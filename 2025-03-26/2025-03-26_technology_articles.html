                <br/>
                <p>I can tell you the entire story of the 11th-generation iPad by explaining the results of one benchmarking test. It’s called Geekbench, and it’s a cross-platform tool that simulates a bunch of real-world activities to give each device a score that roughly approximates how powerful it is. It’s not perfect (no benchmark is), but it can be revealing. In this case, it shows off an iPad that is very good at the things iPads have always been good at, but it may be about to hit its limit — and definitely isn’t ready for what’s to come.

When you run a Geekbench CPU test on a device like the iPad, it tests both single-core and multicore performance. Most modern devices have multiple cores: the iPad’s A16 chip has five CPU cores and four GPU cores; the current iPad Pro has nine and 10, respectively; and you can spec the latest Mac Studio all the way up to 28 CPU cores and 60 GPU cores. Not all cores are created the same, and we could talk about this forever, but let’s not.

All you need to know is that a single-core process only does one thing at a time and is typically used for simple everyday computing tasks, like running your email app or refreshing your Spotify homepage. Multicore processes, on the other hand, are designed for when lots of things need to happen simultaneously, like when you’re editing video or creating a 3D model that needs to be built, rendered, and moved all at once. Again, there are few hard-and-fast rules to all this. But in general, the more cores you have, the more you can do at once.

Which brings me back to the scores. The new $349 base-model iPad’s scores are practically identical to last year’s M2-powered Air on single-core processes, and this year’s M3 Air only beats it by about 11 percent. This suggests that for most normal, simple iPad things, they should all perform about the same, which has been exactly my experience. Watching videos, browsing the web, swiping through photos — the M3 Air is occasionally a smidge smoother, but they’re all effectively identical.

On the multicore test, though, which measures the device’s ability to do lots of things at once, the base iPad gets absolutely trucked by its brethren. The M3 Air scored more than double the base iPad, and even last year’s M2 Air did 60 percent better on the tests. In Geekbench’s GPU test, which is focused specifically on the kind of intensive graphical processing you’ll care about in video games, editing apps, and powerful creativity tools, both Airs more than doubled the iPad.

What those numbers show is what my testing confirms: that the base iPad is still a lovely, fast, usable device for casual use. It’s an excellent Netflix machine, with an 11-inch screen and four speaker grilles (though only two actual speakers) that pump loud, if not fabulous, sound. It’s great for browsing the web, plenty fast for casual games (I’ve been playing a lot of Dredge and Mini Metro, in addition to my usual diet of crosswords and Tiny Wings), and responsive in everyday use — all in all a very good iPad.

Say what you want about the iPad. The colors are the best.

But as soon as you crank up the intensity, the base iPad starts to falter. There are a bunch of games it simply can’t play: Assassin’s Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4 just straight-up don’t support the device. There are others, like Call of Duty: Warzone, where you can really feel the lack of graphics power. I’ll be running down a darkened alley in Warzone, and the shadows start to flicker in and out of position, rendering and rerendering a beat too slowly. Even in productivity-focused tools like Notability, the base iPad lags a bit under the weight of a particularly visual page. And if you’re a multitasker, prone to firing up Stage Manager (on an Air or Pro, since the base model doesn’t support the feature) or just a lot of heavy slide-over usage, you’ll notice the difference.

Even if you don’t care about the cores right now, I bet you will pretty soon. The base iPad doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, for instance, and while it’s not missing much right now, there will probably be some worthwhile local AI features in the next few years. (The other AI-related downside: the iPad also has 6GB of RAM, when the Air has 8GB.) As more apps update to take advantage of the extra power on the Air and Pro, they might start to feel even slower on the iPad. The other iPads have much more power than most people need, but that means they have space for you and your needs to grow. The base iPad doesn’t.

The other big tradeoff with the base iPad is the accessories. Both the iPad Pro and iPad Air support the latest Apple Pencil and have very good Magic Keyboard accessories, none of which work on the iPad. Instead, you get the last-gen Pencil and the substantially worse Magic Keyboard Folio. Is it annoying that this tablet is the same size as the 11-inch Air and totally could work in the same keyboard case, except Apple didn’t include the magnets? Yes. But this is where things are.

I still think the iPad is a great tablet, and it’s very good at most of the things most people need from their iPads. If its $349 price fits your budget, or you’re looking for something simple to give to the kids, buy it with no reservations. Frankly, if you just want the thing because the yellow and pink are the best colors Apple offers on any of its devices, I get it. But if you can, you should buy an iPad that will last you at least five years, and ideally even a few more. This iPad is already far enough behind the curve that I’m no longer confident it will last that long. For the first time in a while, I think the Air is the better deal for most people.

                <p>Chubu Electric Power Group has introduced Tech Touch to ERP systems used by 15,000 employees, achieving significant business efficiency. TechTouch announced it on March 26th.

TechTouch is an AI-type digital adaptation platform (DAP) that has been widely adopted by major companies and government agencies. By easily creating and implementing operation guides without code, it greatly reduces the burden on system personnel and promotes smooth system usage by users.

Chubu Electric Power introduced an ERP system and a cloud-based procurement purchasing system as part of its DX promotion, but inquiries were received a lot of inquiries due to differences in operation with the old system. Therefore, they decided to introduce Tech Touch, which allows operation guidance and automation on the screen.

As a result of the introduction, the number of inquiries was reduced by 55%, the operating time was reduced by 29%, and the number of defective slips was reduced by one-sixth. In particular, the ability to automate operations that require multiple steps with just one click has greatly contributed to improving productivity. These improvements were implemented without any additional feature development and without code.

Chubu Electric Power Company will use Tech Touch to aim to automate approval processes and order processing, improve data accuracy, and further improve operational efficiency. We also look forward to improving productivity through the evolution of AI implementation and analytical functions.

Chubu Electric Power Management Services Headquarters believes that the introduction of Tech Touch has solved problems with system operation and accelerated business efficiency. In the future, we aim to make the procurement system a true DX foundation.</p></b>

                <p>On March 26th, NEC and Cisco announced their collaboration in the field of AI governance. This collaboration will utilize Cisco's AI security solution, "Cisco AI Defense," to promote safe and secure business use of AI.

Generator AI has become popular in recent years, but risks such as information generation that is not based on facts and copyright and privacy invasion have also become apparent. As traditional cybersecurity measures cannot address these risks, it is urgent to establish AI governance.

Taking this backdrop into consideration, the two companies will collaborate to provide AI governance services that combine NEC consulting services with Cisco's Cisco AI Defense starting in fall 2025. This will support the use of safe generation AI in a wide range of fields, including finance, manufacturing, public and local governments.

Cisco AI Defense is a security solution designed to address the risks associated with AI development, deployment and use. Automated vulnerability testing and runtime security layers ensure the safety and security of AI applications and support industry-standard activities.

Since 2023, NEC has been working on risk assessments for Cisco's Robust Intelligence and its generative AI "cotomi." In 2019, the AI ​​and Human Rights Policy was formulated and an AI risk management system was established. We will use these knowledge to help our customers build AI governance.

In this collaboration, Cisco will provide technology, and NEC will begin early evaluations of Cisco AI Defense in March 2025. Starting from the fall of the same year, we will be providing consulting services that utilize the solution. Furthermore, the two companies will also consider risks and countermeasures in using Agent AI.</p></b>

                <p>The moment comes when the "Ring of Saturn" that is particularly eye-catching in the solar system is no longer visible. However, it doesn't disappear completely and will return again in a few weeks.

This phenomenon occurs due to the relationship between the tilt of the axis of rotation of Saturn and Earth. Saturn is tilted approximately 26.73 degrees and Earth is tilted approximately 23.5 degrees, but when both planets are located in a straight line, it feels like Saturn's rings are almost invisible due to perspective relationships.

In other words, if you observe the night sky this weekend, it may seem like Saturn's ring has disappeared. However, with a high-performance telescope, it should barely appear as a thin line across the center of Saturn.

●Why does Saturn's ring disappear?

The main reason why Saturn's rings are invisible is the tilt of the axis of rotation of Saturn and Earth. To put it in perspective, this is the same logic as a piece of paper looking bigger when viewed from the front, but almost invisible when viewed from the side. In fact, Saturn's ring is thinner than you imagined.

"The Saturn ring is surprisingly thin, and even at its thickest part is estimated to be around 1km. Given the diameter of Saturn (over 116,000km), it is incredibly thin," explains Dr. Shannon Schmoll, director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.

Furthermore, according to the latest research from NASA, the ring is about 10m thick. Looking at the ring from Earth, 1.5 million km away, it's like looking at thin paper from the side.

However, the ring does not disappear completely. High-performance telescopes may be recognized as thin lines across Saturn, but with low magnification telescopes, the lines may not be distinguished, and they may reflect like Saturn without a ring.

●When will the ring return?

This peak of "the ring is about to disappear" occurs around the weekend. In reality, this trend has already continued for about a week or two, and until around April it has been difficult to see. As April enters, the ring gradually begins to tilt as Saturn orbits, and slowly returns to its original appearance over a month or two.

"Strictly speaking, the moment the ring surface lies right in front of you is only a moment. However, with a large telescope, you'll soon start to see the ring. Conversely, with a typical home telescope, you'll have to wait a few months for it to become clearly visible as a ring," says Dr. Schmol.

●How rare is this phenomenon?

According to NASA information, this phenomenon occurs roughly every 13 to 15 years. However, there is no strict cycle, and records occurring in 1980, 1995, and 2009 are still available.

"It takes about 30 years for Saturn to orbit the Sun. There are two times in its orbit that the ring angle is exactly the same. However, when Saturn is located across the Sun, sunlight can make it difficult to observe," explained Dr. Schmoll.

The next forecast is that the ring will lie directly in 2038 or 2039. It is said that at that time it will be even easier to observe than this time.

                <p>In order to strengthen global competitiveness, more and more companies are working on "job-based human resource management" as a personnel policy. However, if there are only job-based, individual work experts, I have a frank question for the author: "Will the president really grow?" We asked NEC's human resources manager about this.

What is NEC's job-based human resources management?



NEC Executive Officer, Corporate EVP and CHRO Horikawa Daisuke; NEC Executive Officer, Corporate EVP and CHRO Horikawa Daisuke;

Horikawa Daisuke, executive officer Corporate EVP and Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO), NEC's Human Resources Head, explained his job-based human resource management efforts at a press conference for institutional investors and the media that the company recently held on human capital management.

Regarding job-based talent management, the company is focusing on "designing an organizational shape that maximizes performance, setting up the necessary jobs, and assigning personnel suitable for the job from within and outside the company."

According to Horikawa, "We have been gradually and planned to set up the job-based foundation since 2018. In 2022, the previous business division system was abolished, reducing the organizational hierarchy, and from 2024, we introduced job-based systems for all employees. In the future, we will thoroughly utilize job-based strategies for each department, and move to a practical phase that links business and human resources strategies. In addition, from 2025, we will begin rolling out job-based platforms to each group company, and will evolve into a common platform for resource-based fluidization with a capacity of 48,000 employees in Japan. This will allow us to flexibly allocate resources to the group."

The purpose of job-based human resources management is emphasized, "To respond quickly to changes and become a NEC that continues to win globally as business and revenue grows." Regarding the relationship between the company and employees, he explained, "Both teams create a cycle in which both parties grow, based on equal relationships that are chosen and chosen."

Horikawa also said, "By transitioning to a job-based system, we will continue to promote people with abilities and motivation to fully demonstrate their abilities, regardless of their attributes such as age, company history, gender, nationality, etc., based on a fair evaluation."

At the press conference, detailed explanations were given of the strategic and cultural progress in job-based human resources management, as it was targeted at investors. Although I will leave the content to another article, I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mr. Horikawa something. To put it simply, "Will this initiative help the president grow?" This is a question I have been holding over the years of interviewing.

During the question and answer session at the press conference, I asked, "If we continue to promote job-based human resources management, will we be able to develop a well-balanced manager who can run a large organization, and ultimately a president who is the top management?"

In addition, from 2025, we will begin rolling out job-based platforms to each group company, and will evolve into a common platform for resource-based fluidization with a capacity of 48,000 employees in Japan. This will allow us to flexibly allocate resources to the group."

The purpose of job-based human resources management is emphasized, "To respond quickly to changes and become a NEC that continues to win globally as business and revenue grows." Regarding the relationship between the company and employees, he explained, "Both teams create a cycle in which both parties grow, based on equal relationships that are chosen and chosen."

Horikawa also said, "By transitioning to a job-based system, we will continue to promote people with abilities and motivation to fully demonstrate their abilities, regardless of their attributes such as age, company history, gender, nationality, etc., based on a fair evaluation."

At the press conference, detailed explanations were given of the strategic and cultural progress in job-based human resources management, as it was targeted at investors. Although I will leave the content to another article, I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mr. Horikawa something. To put it simply, "Will this initiative help the president grow?" This is a question I have been holding over the years of interviewing.

During the question and answer session at the press conference, I asked, "If we continue to promote job-based human resources management, will we be able to develop a well-balanced manager who can run a large organization, and ultimately a president who is the top management?" He then replied:</p></b>

                <p>IBM Japan and Tokio Marine and Nichido Anshin Life Insurance (Tokio Marine and Nichido Anshin Life Insurance) have jointly developed a classification and analysis model for "customer feedback." IBM Japan announced this on March 26th.

This model efficiently analyzes requests and complaints from customers sent to call centers and homepages, and aims to improve service quality. Tokio Marine & Nichido Anshin Life Insurance will begin full-scale introduction of this model from March 31st.



Overall structure of using generation AI Overall structure of using generation AI

As customer needs have become more diverse in recent years, the importance of accurately capturing customer requests and expectations and quickly reflecting them in service has increased. Tokio Marine and Nichido Anshin Life has used 18,000 "customer feedback" per year for customer-oriented business operations, but issues have been raised by increasing the burden of manual classification work and variations in classification based on human judgment.

Against this background, both companies have used IBM watsonx to conduct a two-stage demonstration experiment. In the first stage, we combined natural language search and generation AI technology with information search technology to speed up and standardize the classification and analysis of "customer feedback." As a result, accurate classification and significantly reduced work time using generated AI was confirmed.

In the next second stage, we examined the extraction of important keywords, visualization of relevance, multifaceted classification, and automatic hashtag generation. This makes it possible to immediately grasp the content and trends of "customer feedback" and speed up and refine analysis.

After these demonstration experiments, Tokio Marine & Nichido Anshin Life will begin full-scale introduction of the first stage model from March 31st. From the perspective of protecting personal information, we will use a system that is securely built on IBM Cloud. From 2025 onwards, we will also introduce a second-stage model, and will conduct detailed analysis that combines "customer feedback" with contract data and more.</p></b>

                <p>大勢の専門職が日々のワークフローに「Microsoft 365」アプリケーションスイートを活用している。こうした日常的なプロセスの一部を高速化するため、Microsoftは「Microsoft 365 Copilot」に2つの新しい人工知能（AI）エージェントを追加する。

Microsoftは米国時間3月25日、高度な推論能力を持ち、より高度な調査やデータ分析が可能なエージェント、「Researcher」と「Analyst」を発表した。ResearcherとAnalystはいずれも、OpenAIの既存のモデルを利用して、Microsoft 365ユーザーそれぞれのニーズやワークフローに合わせたより高度でパーソナライズされたサポートを提供する。

Researcher

Researcherエージェント機能は、OpenAIやGoogleの「Deep Research」機能と同じような働きをし、ウェブ上の膨大な情報を取捨選択して、情報源が記載された分かりやすいレポートに情報を出力する。

また、リリースによると、Researcherは、OpenAIのDeep ResearchモデルとMicrosoft 365 Copilotの「高度なオーケストレーションおよびディープサーチ機能」を組み合わせているという。

そのため、Researcherは、既存のエージェントを上回る能力を持ち、電子メールや会議、ファイル、チャットなど、ユーザーの業務データからコンテキストを抽出できる。ウェブで入手可能なすべての情報と組み合わせることで、パーソナライズされて充実した内容のレポートを作成可能だ。

例えば、Microsoftによると、Researcherは、アプリと外部のニュースサイトの情報を組み合わせて包括的な四半期レポートをクライアント向けに作成できるという。ServiceNowやSalesforceのようなサードパーティーの情報源からデータを取り込んで、出力情報を向上させることも可能だ。

Analyst

Microsoftによると、Analystエージェントは、OpenAIの「o3-mini」推論モデルをベースとしており、生データから数分で包括的なインサイトをユーザーに提供するという。熟練したデータサイエンティストの役割を果たすことを目的としており、「思考の連鎖」（CoT）による推論（段階的な処理の別名）を用いて複雑なクエリーを処理する。ユーザーはコードが実行されるのをリアルタイムに見て、Analystのプロセスから学習したり、プロセスをダブルチェックしたりできる。

リリース時期

ResearcherとAnalystはいずれも、Microsoft 365 Copilotのライセンスを持つユーザーを対象として4月に提供を開始する。このリリースは、まだ開発中のCopilotのイノベーションをいち早く体験できる新しい「Frontier」プログラムの一部だ。</p></b>

                <p>3Dプリンターはさまざまな用途に使える。高性能な3Dプリンターがあれば、少しの手間はかかるが、ちょっとした修繕用品から複雑なアート作品まで、作れないものはほとんどない。筆者は仕事で3Dプリンターをレビューしているので、サイズも用途もさまざまな3Dプリンターを使える環境にある。レビューでは通常、小さな3Dモデルを使い、複雑さやディテールのレベルを変えながらプリンターの性能を試していく。しかし、時には心から幸せを感じられる作品を作りたくなるものだ。

筆者は新婚旅行で初めてカリフォルニア州のディズニーランドを訪れて以来、城の上に打ち上げられる花火の大ファンだ。家族でカリフォルニアに住んでいた頃は年間パスポートを持っていたが、バージニア州に引っ越してからはディズニーパークを訪れる機会もなくなった。そんな時、Elegooの3Dプリンター「OrangeStorm Giga」をテストする機会を得た。個人ユーザーには勧めにくい巨大なプリンターだが、一家のディズニーパークへの愛を形にするには完璧なプリンターだった。

3Dプリントの城ができるまで

ありがちだが、きっかけは「TikTok」だった。DIY動画を投稿しているAlex Carrao氏が3Dプリンターでディズニーの城を作り、そこにYouTube動画を投影する企画に挑戦していた。3Dプリンターで城を作り、その表面に映像を投影することで、ディズニーパークで毎晩繰り広げられている花火ショーを再現する――このアイデアは、比較的容易にまねできそうに思えた。Carrao氏が作った城は3Dプリンターベッドの標準的なサイズ（約250×250×250mm）に合わせたものだったが、筆者が作りたいのは、もっと大きな城だ。そのための道具はすでにあった。

筆者が3Dプリンターで作りたいと考えていたのは、フロリダ州にあるディズニーワールドの城ではなく、カリフォルニア州にあるディズニーランドの城だ。この2つの城は見た目が違う。ディズニーワールドの方は「シンデレラ」の城、ディズニーランドの方は「眠れる森の美女」の城だ。筆者が思い入れのあるのは後者、つまりディズニーランドの城だった。幸い、Carrao氏は好みの違いに配慮し、両方の城の3Dモデルを用意していた。そこでディズニーランドの城の3Dモデルを購入し、自分のイメージに合うようにモデルを調整する作業に取りかかった。花火ショーの映像は城の中央部分のみに投影されるが、Carrao氏の3Dモデルは城を取り囲む城壁も含めて、城の全景を捉えたものだった。今回のプロジェクトでは、ここまで壮大なものは必要ないため、Microsoftの3Dデータ作成・編集ソフト「3D Builder」（手軽に使えるが、すでにサポートは終了）を使って不要な部分は削除した。思い通りのモデルが完成したら、次はいよいよプリントだ。

OrangeStorm Gigaは、説明しにくい3Dプリンターだ。ビルドエリアは800×800×1000mmと広く、400×400mmのビルドプレートを4枚使って印刷する。最初に発表されたときは興奮して、早く試したくてたまらなかった。実際、あれこれ作る作業はとても楽しいのだが、読者諸氏の用途に向いているとは思えない。稼働させるまでの工程が複雑で、正しく印刷するためには細心の注意が求められる上、プリンター自体が大きいため、作業場がなければ置き場所にも困る。とはいえ、十分なスペースと忍耐力、そして2500ドル（約37万円）を払う余裕があるなら、あっと驚くものを作成できることは間違いない。

城を正しくプリントできると思えるレベルにまでプリンターを調整できたら、カットしたばかりの3Dモデルを印刷してみた。3Dモデルはオリジナルのデザインに調整を加え、最終的に横幅が700mmになるように拡大した。3Dプリンターでは「STLファイル」というファイルを使う。このファイルは、かなりの拡大にもたえられるが、細部が粗くなりやすい。ただ今回は、この問題は発生しなかった。映像を投影することが前提なので、城自体は白地のキャンバスであり、細かい装飾はなかったからだ。

3Dプリントに要した時間は合計85時間強だ。長いと思うかもしれないが、3Dモデルの大きさと材料の量を考えれば早い。参考までに、5年前に実物大のマンダロリアン（「スター・ウォーズ」のキャラクター）のヘルメットを印刷したときは125時間かかった。使用した材料は城の5分の1ほどだ。

今回の城の場合、プリントに必要な材料の量も膨大だった。Overtureの3kgのPLAロールを使い、充填形状はジャイロイド、充填率は8％に設定したにもかかわらず、ロールのほぼ全量を使い切ってしまった。重いが、ちょっとした衝撃では壊れない安心感がある。できあがった城は壁に取り付ける予定だったので、頑丈にしたかった。

魔法の粉をひとふり

映像を投影するための下準備も必要だった。プリントした城のレイヤーラインを目立たなくするために、自動車用の下塗りフィラーを使った。レンガの風合いを残しつつ、適切な質感を出すために2缶ほど使った。その後、石材風に仕上げるためのスプレーペイントを2缶使って、質感をさらに高めた。映像を投影することが目的なので、城自体を暗い色で塗ったり、本来の城の色に似せたりすることはできない。城は、あくまでも白紙のキャンバスである必要があった。とはいえ、映像を投影していない時は壁に自然に溶け込み、インテリアを乱さないようにしたい。スプレーペイントで仕上げた色は壁になじみ、ざらざらした質感にすることで、ただのプラスチックのような安っぽい印象も回避できた。

プロジェクター塗料を使った方が花火をきれいに映せるのではないかとも考えたが、いかんせん高い。1缶で100ドル（約1万5000円）以上する。他の材料をすべて合わせたよりも高くなるようでは、コスパが悪すぎる。やはり頼みはプロジェクターだ。

投影がカギ

映像の投影は、現在でも完璧とは言えず、今後も完璧にはできそうもない。もちろん、現状でも十分にきれいだが、これ以上の調整は、現時点で筆者が利用できる技術ではできない。筆者が使っているのはXGIMIの「Elfin」という小型プロジェクターだ。古いがYouTubeやAndroid TVにもアクセスできるし、何と言っても軽くて、角度も調整しやすい。投影する映像の選択も重要だ。映像は以下の条件を満たしている必要があった。

三脚を使って撮影したもの

解像度は1080p以上

カメラの前を人が横切らない

メインストリートは含めず、城だけが映っている

あちこち検索して、ようやく見つけたのがDizFeedの撮影したディズニーランドの花火ショー「Disneyland Forever」の動画だった。この動画は、すべての条件を満たしている上に、筆者の幸福な記憶をよみがえらせた。この動画は構図が完璧であるだけでなく、そこに記録されている花火ショーは、筆者と妻が結婚した翌日に観たものだった。人生でも指折りの幸せな日に観たショーを、今は毎日、自宅の壁で観ることができる。

次のステップは、プロジェクターの映像を3Dプリントした城の縮尺に合うように調整することだった。この作業には、プロジェクターの台形補正機能を使った。高性能なプロジェクターには必ず、プロジェクターの設置場所に合わせて、投影する映像の形を調整できる機能がある。スクリーンに映し出された映像が真四角ではなく、台形になっているのを見たことがある人は多いだろう。台形補正は隅を引き出すことで、この問題を解決してくれる。

この台形補正機能を使うことで、映像のサイズを3Dモデルにできる限りフィットさせることができる。プリントした城は壁から突き出すような格好で設置したため、背後に影ができ、ピントが合っていないように見えることもある。まずは、どの部分にピントを合わせるかを決めなければならない。筆者は正面の大きな窓を選んだ。ここが一番、映像の動きが多い場所だからだ。もちろん完璧ではない。完璧にするためには複数のプロジェクターを使って、異なる角度から投影する必要がある。しかし、現在の仕上がりでも十分に満足だ。

さらなる高みを目指すなら

さらなる改善を試みるなら追加投資が必要だ。筆者のプロジェクターに搭載されている台形補正機能はシンプルなものだ。つまり、筆者が必要とするほど細かい補正はできない。この問題を解決するためには、より高価なプロジェクターを買う必要がある。もう1つの選択肢は、ノートPCを使ってビデオ出力を調整することだ。この方法は効果があるかもしれないが、そのためにはプロジェクターの背後にノートPCを隠す必要があり、理想的とは言えない。ノートPCの代わりに「Raspberry Pi」を使う方法もあり得る。ノートPCよりはずっと小さいし、存在を隠すためのカバーを3Dプリントで作成することも可能だ。例えば、城へと続くメインストリートのようなデザインの棚を作ってもいいかもしれない。

あるいは、壁に付いている状態の見た目が良くなるように、下部に人工の雲を追加するのもいいかもしれない。それによって城が空に浮かんでいるように見えるだけでなく、投影された動画の下部が拡散され、映像が欠けている部分が隠れるので、より自然な見た目になる。

このプロジェクトを完成させるのはとても楽しかったし、筆者が3Dプリントに夢中になった理由を思い出させてくれた。筆者は、自分の創造性を表現し、生活に楽しみをもたらす方法を探していたが、この城はまさにその両方を実現してくれた。今では、ほぼ1日中この城に花火を投影している。特に懐かしい気分に浸りたいときは音量を上げて、人生で最高の夜の1つを思い出すことにしている。

                <p>ベネッセコーポレーション（ベネッセ）は3月25日、「多様な学びニーズへの取り組み」と題した説明会を開催した。同社は多様化する学びの支援として、発達特性に合うICT学習を支援する「まるぐランド」と、学ぶ場の多様性を踏まえた通信制サポート校「ベネッセ高等学院」を展開する。

コロナ禍以降、不登校や不登校傾向の児童・生徒が増加している。また、発達障害を抱える子どもや家にある本が少ない、家で日本語をあまり話さない子どもなど、教室内の多様性も増加しており、特別支援教育や日本語教育など、教育的支援を必要とする児童・生徒が顕在化しているという。



ベネッセ教育イノベーションセンター長の小村俊平氏とまるぐちゃん ベネッセ教育イノベーションセンター長の小村俊平氏とまるぐちゃん

東京大学社会科学研究所・ベネッセ教育総合研究所が小学校1年生～高校3年生を対象に行った調査によると、コロナ禍以降、「勉強への意欲がわかない」という小・中学生の増加が顕著であるほか、「勉強が好き」という小学生は大きく低下していることが明らかになった。また、「学校に行きたくない」という児童・生徒はコロナ禍で一度減少したが、再び増加しており、高校生は約半数が学校に行きたくないとしている。

ベネッセ教育イノベーションセンター長の小村俊平氏は、2020年に施行された現在の学習指導要領で掲げられている「主体的で対話的で深い学び」について、「この主体性を支える興味・関心あるいは意欲が弱まっているのではないかという懸念を感じている」と指摘する。

2030年度の学習指導要領改訂に向けた検討では、この課題を踏まえて、一人一人が学びやすいように、学ぶ時間や進度、学年、場所などを柔軟にしていく施策が議論されている。一方、教育的支援の必要性が高まる中で、教員の働き方改革は道半ばで教員志望者は減少の一途をたどっている。ベネッセは、このような学校現場や家庭のニーズを踏まえ、まるぐランドの提供やベネッセ高等学院の開校など、多様な学びの支援に取り組むとしている。

「まるぐランド for school」は、ウェブアプリケーションとして提供するICT学習教材で、現在は小学校1～6年生の国語「読み」「書き」「読み取り」が対象範囲になっている。「認知特性チェックテスト」と「読み書きチェックテスト」が搭載されており、チェックテストの結果を基に個々の特性に合った学習コンテンツを自動で提案する。

チェックテストでは、「読み書きの困りの背景」と「認知特性」を把握することができ、読み書きでは「言葉の意味」「音の区別」「小さい文字やのばす音」などが得意か不得意か、認知面では「注意・集中力」「ねばり強さ」「目で見て覚える力」などのスキルがあるかどうかをレーダーチャートで把握できる。

まるぐランド for schoolは、教員向けにクラス全体や児童個別の結果を提示し、指導をサポートする機能を搭載している。個別結果では、児童に対する声がけについてのアドバイスもあるという。

寒河江市教育委員会 学校教育課 児童推進室 指導主査（兼）指導主事の布川真二氏 寒河江市教育委員会 学校教育課 児童推進室 指導主査（兼）指導主事の布川真二氏

山形県寒河江市では、同市の小学校でまるぐランド for schoolを活用し、読解力の育成を行っている。寒河江市教育委員会 学校教育課 児童推進室 指導主査（兼）指導主事の布川真二氏は、「本市では全国学力調査において、小・中学校ともに国語の『読むこと』の正答率に課題を抱えていた。問題別に見ても、選択式の正答率が低い状況にあった。このことから、問題を解く以前の課題として、選択肢も含め問題文の文章をよく理解できていないのではないかと分析した」と、まるぐランドの導入背景を説明する。

2022年度に課題研究部会を立ち上げ、「読解力」の育成を開始。同時に、4校の小学校2年生を対象に同サービスのモニターを実施し、効果検証の結果、本格的な導入に至った。

布川氏はまるぐランドを採用した理由について、「まるぐランドの狙いが、本市の課題に合致していた。学級を構成する児童が多様化している中で、担任が問題のない児童だと感じている児童も含め、その子の特性を的確に把握し、全ての段階の児童の力を最大限に伸ばしたいと考えていた」と話す。

また、モニター実施において、各学校で差はありつつも読み書きに困難を抱える児童が減少したという。教員からは「児童が意欲的に取り組む姿がある」「本格導入をぜひ検討して欲しい」といった声も寄せられた。同氏は「本市が目指したいのは自立した学習者の育成であること、そして子どもが自ら学び取る教育を展開していきたい」とし、今求められる教育を進める上で読解力は基礎的な力として必須であり、まるぐランドはその土台となる力を育むものだと主張する。

2024年度は、小学校2～4年生の全員と小学校5～6年生の特別支援学級希望者を対象に、週3回程度、1日15分間まるぐランドを活用した読解力の育成に取り組んだ。対象の学年については、1年生では平仮名の読み書きの学習が始まったばかりであることを考慮し、読解力の基礎を育むため2年生からの導入になったという。

個別最適化された教材の提供により、集中して取り組む児童の姿が見られるようになったり、教員の教材準備の負担も減ったりと現場では良い変化が起きているという。また、チェックテストの結果が可視化されることで、学力が高い児童でも配慮が必要であることが分かり、新しい気付きを得ることができたという教員もいる。ほかにも、支援が必要な児童でも楽しそうに取り組むことができており、学習意欲の向上にもつながるのではないか、という期待も寄せられている。

着実に成果を出しており、チェックテストの結果からも読解力につながるスキルで困難を抱える児童の割合を大幅に減少した。一方、伸び幅が大きい学校とそうでない学校の差が課題として浮かび挙がってきた。同氏は今後の展望として、「今まで見過ごされてきていた困り感を持つ児童に対して個別の支援を可能にし、全ての児童の読み書きスキル向上や学習意欲の向上、自己肯定感の向上に図りたい」と語る。そのために、これまで取り組んで生きた読解力の育成を継続し、結果が伸びている学校の取り組みを市内で共有するという。



ベネッセ高等学院 学院長の上木原孝伸氏 ベネッセ高等学院 学院長の上木原孝伸氏

次に、学ぶ場の多様性を支援するベネッセ高等学院について、学院長の上木原孝伸氏が説明した。2025年4月に開校するベネッセ高等学院は、「くまもと清陵高等学校」「創志学園高等学校」の2校と連携し、通信制高校の卒業資格取得と大学進学などの進路選択をサポートする。

上木原氏は「令和になってから通信制の生徒が2万人ずつ増えてきている。この増え方は、ネガティブな理由よりもポジティブに通信制を捉える子どもが増えてきている事情があると思う」と話す。学校以外の場所での多様な学習活動の整備が進んだことや、個人に適した学習スタイルの確立、自宅で学べる環境が増えたことであえて「行かない」選択をするケースもある。同氏は、「不登校という言葉自体が、イコール『ネガティブ』という空気感から変わってきている」と述べる。

ベネッセ高等学院は、同社が提供する「進研ゼミ」をはじめとした家庭学習における自主学習コンテンツや、「進研模試」などの学校向けアセスメントなど教育のサービスを通して培った教材やデータ、人を生かして生徒の学習をサポートする。専用教材の「進研ゼミ√Route（ルート）Be」は、勉強が苦手な生徒でも自信や自己肯定感を高められるように、学年を表記しない、自分のやりたい単元から始めるなどの工夫をしている。

                <p>Ozawa Masaharu, Japan's country manager at GitLab, a software development platform, continues to appeal not only to the high development productivity that the company has globally strong in the Japanese market, but also to the security security. We asked him what he thinks about the current state and future of DevSecOps, which guarantees security from the software development stage, in Japan.

In recent years, software development has become more widespread worldwide with the DevOps style, which allows you to respond quickly and efficiently to changes in user needs. On the other hand, since Ozawa took office in 2023, he believes that Japan has not yet become as pervasive as overseas, including its organizational culture, and has instead settled a security perspective that Japanese organizations place importance on, appealing to GitLab as a capable person in ensuring both productivity and safety in software development (related article).

First, regarding the current situation, Ozawa said, "With DX and other backgrounds, efforts to speed up the software development cycle are gradually becoming more widespread, incorporating DevOps to respond quickly to diversifying needs and changing needs. In addition, with the Digital Agency's release of the Security by Design Guidelines, the importance of safe and secure software development has become recognized as a business issue, and there are increasing numbers of cases where people consult with us."

DevSecOps is an important initiative across cybersecurity that reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in software that can be exploited by cyberattackers.

"In 2024, security software products defects had a major impact not only on the developers but also on the organizations that use them, but the problems with software products have come to be recognized as management issues. There is also data that reduces organizational revenue by 5% by dealing with issues such as infringing software rights, such as penalties. The challenge of developing software appropriately and safely is expanding not only to developers but also to management." (Ozawa)

According to Ozawa, the features of GitLab's development platform are its comprehensiveness of a wide variety of development tools, environments, libraries, runtimes, and more, including open source and proprietary, as well as high visibility, information sharing, and information that uses them throughout the development-build/release pipeline.

He has appealed to Japanese customers for his unique characteristics, but most recently he is being cited in the automotive industry, where digitalization is accelerating globally, financial and high-tech industries that are moving forward with digital services while responding to strict legal regulations. Another unique move is that Japanese companies that have allowed relatively free software development environments at bases around the world have introduced GitLab to balance strengthening governance and development productivity.

However, Ozawa says that in Japan's software development situation is still strong in waterfalls, and it is not easy to change this style, which has been pervasive as a "culture" for decades, at the organizational level.

Software testing services have become popular at least in the security services market these days. The background to this is the stricter cybersecurity requirements, the more sophisticated and complex software. If a problem such as a vulnerability is found in pre-release testing of software developed mainly in waterfalls, the cost will increase with fixes and additional development, and delays in release will also result in a loss of business opportunities.

Words with similar meanings to DevSecOps include "shift left" and "security by design," which define requirements and design to ensure security from the previous process of software development. Ozawa says, "The faster the organizations that run agile or DevOps, the faster they understand shift left, and if they don't, it's difficult to put into practice even if they understand the importance. The significance of secure development is beginning to spread through the guidelines of the Digital Agency, so the next challenge is probably expanding the number of organizations that implement this."</p></b>

                <p>Members of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee met Wednesday to discuss what’s typically a highly bipartisan topic: protecting kids online. But in a far-from-typical political climate, the mood was tense and confrontational.

Republican lawmakers are eager to revive a handful of bipartisan bills like the Kids Online Safety Act, which House Republican leadership blocked at the finish line last year. Many Democrats on the panel support these proposals, calling them an urgent response to a social crisis. But they’re raising a new question: as the Trump administration ignores congressional statutes and Supreme Court precedent to gut the federal government, will there be anyone left to enforce these laws?

Last week, President Donald Trump abruptly — and under current law, illegally — attempted to fire the two sitting Democratic commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. The move left two Republicans on the commission, with one more expected to soon be confirmed. Like many agencies across the federal government, the FTC has seen recent staff cuts, though in far smaller numbers than many of the most prominent targets of the right. Even in the minority party, Slaughter and Bedoya warn that their removals will thwart transparency and accountability for any decisions made in their absence, and they’re planning to sue to return to their work. Without dissenting voices in the room, Slaughter and Bedoya have warned, there’s no one to push back and illustrate what alternative paths the FTC could have taken, or provide important context to the agency’s decisions. “I’m going to be even more worried about actions taken to withdraw settlements, modify settlements, [and] votes taken to not sue a company,” Bedoya told reporters outside the hearing room. “If there’s an action brought up to the commission, and the commissioners say no, that never becomes public.”

“We had in place what was needed to protect our children,” ranking member of the commerce subcommittee Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) said in her opening remarks. “And that’s why I am absolutely furious right now that there has been this effort to fire the two members of the FTC.” The Democratic minority invited Slaughter to testify alongside witnesses invited by Republicans, including representatives from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), and Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) — the latter, as one Democrat pointed out, contributed to Project 2025. Bedoya, though not formally invited, sat behind his colleague in the hearing room.

“This hearing is about children. It’s not about what’s going on here in Washington, DC”

Republicans painted the FTC firings as a distraction. “This hearing is about children. It’s not about what’s going on here in Washington, DC,” said full committee Chair Brett Guthrie (R-KY). When reporters outside the hearing room asked about the attempted firings, subcommittee Chair Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) said he’s “focused on the hearing today.” Rep. Erin Houchin (R-IN) apologized to parents in the audience “for the things that are being taken away from this conversation not being focused on protecting children, but instead on someone’s job at the FTC.” Houchin complained that a reporter had stopped her in the hallway to ask about the agency. “Shame on the media if the only thing they cover from today is the FTC, because children are dying,” she said.

But Democrats argued that laws are useless without effective enforcement, which they believe is under threat. The FTC would be primarily in charge of enforcing two major bills that passed through the House Energy and Commerce Committee last year: KOSA and the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0) “We can talk about the importance of passing new legislation here in this hearing,” said KOSA co-sponsor Kathy Castor (D-FL). But she questioned how they could regain trust in Republicans “ if you take the cops off the beat, you give the Big Tech CEOs a front row seat to the inauguration, [and] you block the KOSA and COPPA that was hammered out over years of work in this committee?”

The questions about rule of law and who will enforce it extend far beyond the FTC. In empowering Elon Musk’s pet project, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Trump has deputized the richest man in the world to slash the federal workforce, and seek to shut down agencies created by congressional statute. Trump has asserted power over what are supposed to be independent agencies, including the FTC, and loyalists he’s appointed to run them have so far welcomed him to do so. Many experts say we already are or soon could be in a constitutional crisis, as Trump appears willing to flout everything from a law seeking to ban TikTok to court orders.

Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), ranking member of the full committee, even pointed out that Republicans were the reason KOSA didn’t pass last year. “Let’s not kid the people here to suggest that these bills are going to become law,” he said. “The bottom line is we passed KOSA and we passed COPPA out of this committee last session and the House Republican leadership refused to bring these laws to the floor. And you know why? They’re in the pocket of Big Tech. And Big Tech does not care at all about kids.”

KOSA and COPPA 2.0 both garnered criticism that, as written, they could infringe on speech and privacy. But this criticism could extend to virtually any child safety law.

Slaughter echoed Democrats’ sentiment to reporters after the hearing. “You can’t meaningfully address kids online safety in bills that would empower the FTC to enforce kids online safety, if you don’t talk about whether the FTC is a functional body consistent with the design of Congress,” she said.</p></b>

                <p>Questions about the infamous Yemen-bombing group chat displaced scheduled testimony on worldwide threats for a second day on Capitol Hill as members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence grilled U.S. intelligence leaders about their discussion of battle plans using an unclassified commercial app.

Despite growing evidence to the contrary, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard insisted March 26 that the details shared over the Signal app — including to a journalist for The Atlantic — did not amount to an unauthorized release of classified information. Her insistence came a day after she appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee, first refusing to confirm her inclusion in the group chat, then claiming she did not recall details of the conversation.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who also took part in the group chat, similarly defended his and others’ actions and denied wrongdoing again before lawmakers.

“As CIA director, one of the responsibilities is to kill terrorists. And that's exactly what I did, along with President Trump's excellent national security team,” Ratcliffe said. “I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information and, at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success.”

Those denials followed similar ones from Trump administration officials and spokespeople, who insisted that The Atlantic had exaggerated just how detailed and damaging the information might have been. So just hours before the hearing convened — and after double-checking that no official would call the information classified — the magazine published the transcript of the entire conversation.

“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)”, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had texted. “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)”

At the hearing, Democratic lawmakers sharply questioned Gabbard and Ratcliffe.

“People in the most dangerous and sensitive jobs on the planet put extremely specific, pre-decisional discussions about a military attack on Signal, which could be intercepted by the Russians and the Chinese,” said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the committee’s ranking member. “And they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships. I think that it's by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now.”

The officials testifying before the House largely remained defensive.

“The conversation was candid and sensitive, but as the president [and] national security adviser stated, no classified information was shared,” Gabbard said. “This was a standard update to the National Security Cabinet that was provided alongside updates that were given to foreign partners in the region. The Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices.”

Sources familiar with government mobile device policies said on background that the statement that such an app comes “pre-installed” is inaccurate.

Questions to the Defense Information Systems Agency, which manages mobile devices for much of DOD, were referred to the Office of the Secretary of Defense Public Affairs, which did not respond to a request for comment.

In the House hearing, Gabbard maintained that because no methods, locations or sources were described in the chat, the discussion was not classified — even as she agreed with Himes that, per official ODNI policy, “information providing indication or advanced warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack should be classified as top secret.” She added that the classification would be at Hegseth’s discretion since he has the “authority over DOD information.”

Whether the Signal chat itself is “DOD information” is another point that is contested.

To some of the lawmakers, it’s also a moot point.

“The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee, would not be classified…that's ridiculous. I’ve seen things much less sensitive be presented to us with high classification,” said Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas. “Having sat on this committee for nine years, that somebody would come in with that information and give us something that says ‘unclassified,’ you can walk out of this room with this information and give it to whomever you want…y’all know that’s a lie. It's a lie to the country.”

Gabbard and Ratcliffe were joined in testimony by several national-security leaders who did not participate in the group chat:, FBI Director Kash Patel, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse and National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh.</p></b>

                <p>For years, the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) has provided a window into Google’s development process for Android, allowing developers and enthusiasts alike to observe the evolution of new. However, Google has recently confirmed to Android Authority a notable change in its approach. Starting next week, all Android development will transition to Google’s internal branches, effectively closing the public’s direct view into the live development process.

This move signifies a departure from the previously transparent development model. While this might seem like a drastic change, it aligns with Google’s recent development practices. For some time, crucial components of Android have been developed internally, with AOSP primarily housing specific framework aspects like Bluetooth, kernel, and other core features. Consequently, the AOSP branch has lagged behind Google’s internal builds, requiring developers to await public releases for the latest updates.

Google clarifies that this shift does not alter the release cadence of new Android builds. Instead, the move aims to streamline the development process and mitigate potential conflicts arising from branch merging. The core principle of Android remaining an open-source platform is unchanged. New features and updates will still be released to AOSP, albeit after they’ve been finalized in the internal branches. This change primarily affects the timing of when these updates become publicly accessible.

The implications for end-users and app developers are expected to be minimal. The most significant impact may be on the early insights (leaks) gleaned from AOSP commits, such as the recent “Pixel 10” mention. These early glimpses, while intriguing, can often lead to misinterpretations and inflated expectations. By consolidating development internally, Google likely aims to manage the flow of information more effectively. A formal announcement detailing this change is anticipated later this week, with the transition occurring next week.

                <p>It took almost five and a half hours, but on Wednesday, Marvel Studios announced the cast of next year’s big summer release, Avengers: Doomsday. They were revealed in a simple but stretched-out PR stunt in which 27 director’s chairs, each bearing an actor’s name, were revealed about every 15 minutes or so on a livestream. It then ended with the one cast member we did know about, Robert Downey Jr., appearing. That long break between each reveal gave plenty of time for the internet to have fun with the stunt which, we assume, is exactly what Disney and Marvel wanted.

Fans joked about who could appear in the movie, who would appear in the movie, who they want to see in the movie, and so much more. Brands got involved, the cuts got deeper, and while the whole thing took the better part of a day, it was all pretty fun.

Below is just a small sampling of some of our favorite memes from the Avengers: Doomsday cast announcement, which you can watch right here and read more about here.

                <p>From the AirPods Pro to the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2, Amazon’s Big Spring Sale has ushered in a number of surprisingly good deals on wireless earbuds. Neither of the aforementioned picks is probably the best option if you’re working with a tight budget, though, fortunately, there are cheaper alternatives. Right now for example, the already inexpensive Nothing Ear (a) are on sale at Amazon starting at $77.50 (around $23 off), which is a new all-time low.

Nothing’s entry-level earbuds deliver solid value for the price, which is why they remain our favorite pair of earbuds for under $100. They combine decent active noise cancellation with enjoyable sound, which you can further fine-tune using Nothing’s mobile app. The water-resistant buds also come with three sizes of swappable silicone tips, which allow for a more secure and comfortable fit (should you find the right size).

Nothing Ear (a) $ 78 $ 99 21 % off $ 78 Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same general design as the company’s previous earbuds — but you can get these in a snazzy yellow. They include ANC, more than decent sound quality, and other features like multipoint for just under $100. Read More $78 at Amazon$99 at Nothing

What’s more, the ANC earbuds offer multipoint Bluetooth pairing, Fast Pair (for Android), and a low-latency gaming mode — the latter of which is relatively rare at this price point. They also sport ChatGPT integration, so if you own a Nothing phone, you can ask the AI tool questions on the go using your voice. Or, you know, not.

During a briefing on Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced plans to put a 25 percent tariff on cars and trucks imported into the US. Trump said the taxes would go into effect on April 2nd — the same time he’s expected to introduce a round of reciprocal tariffs, according to The New York Times.

The tariffs, which Trump called “permanent,” would also apply to American companies that manufacture vehicles in other countries and then bring them into the US. Trump said the tariffs would result in “tremendous growth in the auto industry,” though they’re expected to drive up prices for consumers.

As pointed out by Axios, a 2024 analysis from the US International Trade Commission found that a 25 percent tariff on cars shipped to the US could reduce imports by 74 percent, while the average vehicle price could increase by five percent. Trump’s tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico have already gone into effect, affecting a wide range of products like clothing, food, lithium batteries, and more.

The April 2nd tariffs are expected to “be customized for each US trading partner,” according to Bloomberg. Trump has said the tariffs might be more “lenient than reciprocal” as concerns grow over their impact on prices.</p></b>

Game Bar on PC, which gives you the ability to quickly launch games, control audio mixes, and monitor game performance, now comes with a cleaner UI. The Home Bar and widgets, including Capture, Performance, Resource, and the Widget Store, now look more lightweight with fewer lines and colors, giving them less of an Adobe Photoshop tools vibe. Microsoft says this is only the beginning of the visual changes rolling out this week.

The update happened the same week Discord changed its UI with improved spacing between sections in the app and support for a full dark mode overlay. Both Game Bar and Discord let you view widgets while playing a game.

As for the Xbox Cloud Gaming update, there’s now a way to shift between games without having to jump out and return to the Home page. For now, it only works with several Assassin’s Creed titles, but Xbox promises it will work with other cloud games soon. Also, Cloud Gaming is expanding more titles that support Stream Your Own Game.</p></b>

                <p>Somewhere, Kate Bush is remembering Stranger Things‘ stratospheric boost of “Running Up That Hill” and nodding in recognition. But the songs suddenly re-popularized in the wake of Severance‘s second season finale are even older than her 1985 pop hit. That includes the stirring rendition of “The Windmills of Your Mind” that plays as Mark S. and Helly R. are sprinting into their uncertain future, and the jazzy “Work Song” that plays over the “Cold Harbor” end credits.

Both of these songs are standards that have been oft-recorded over the years. “Windmills” is specifically Mel Tormé’s 1968 version, while this take on “Work Song” is Bobby Darin’s from 1963. So these are not exactly ditties that’ve charted recently… until they became swept up in the Severance phenomenon, that is.

As Billboard reports, in the four days since the finale aired March 20, “Windmills” has since “racked up 215,000 U.S. on-demand audio streams,” which represents a 30,000% increase since the previous week. “Work Song” was streamed over 20,000 times, which is fewer than Tormé’s track, but is a 35,000% increase from the same span of days in the previous week.

In addition, the Alan Parsons Project’s “Sirius,” notable for its use by the Chicago Bulls for player introductions during the Michael Jordan ’90s heyday—and now forever linked with Mr. Milchick’s MDR celebration after Mark S. finally finished the Cold Harbor file—got a 16% boost to “just under 125,000 streams.”

So far, there’s no word on where we can stream the Choreography & Merriment’s marching band versions of Lumon’s most stirring anthems.</p></b>

OpenAI is pushing back the rollout of ChatGPT’s built-in image generator for free users. In a post on Wednesday, CEO Sam Altman admitted that the image-generation tool is more popular than he expected, adding that “rollout to our free tier is unfortunately going to be delayed for awhile.”

OpenAI only just added image generation capabilities to ChatGPT on Tuesday, allowing users to create images directly within the app using the company’s reasoning model, GPT-4o. Since its launch, users have flooded social media feeds with photos transformed into images generated in the style of Studio Ghibli, a trend that even Altman has gotten in on.

GPT-4o comes with improvements to text rendering and uses “an autoregressive approach” to image generation, which means it generates an image from left to right and top to bottom instead of all at the same time. It’s currently available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers, but now it’s not clear when it will arrive for free users.</p></b>

                <p>Three weeks ago, NASA revealed that a shipping container protecting a Cygnus spacecraft sustained "damage" while traveling to the launch site in Florida.

Built by Northrop Grumman, Cygnus is one of two Western spacecraft currently capable of delivering food, water, experiments, and other supplies to the International Space Station. This particular Cygnus mission, NG-22, had been scheduled for June. As part of its statement in early March, the space agency said it was evaluating the NG-22 Cygnus cargo supply mission along with Northrop.

On Wednesday, after a query from Ars Technica, the space agency acknowledged that the Cygnus spacecraft designated for NG-22 is too damaged to fly, at least in the near term.

Loading up Dragon

"Following initial evaluation, there also is damage to the cargo module," the agency said in a statement. "The International Space Station Program will continue working with Northrop Grumman to assess whether the Cygnus cargo module is able to safely fly to the space station on a future flight." That future flight, NG-23, will launch no earlier than this fall, likely using a different Cygnus vehicle.

As a result, NASA is modifying the cargo on its next cargo flight to the space station, the 32nd SpaceX Cargo Dragon mission, due to launch in April. The agency says it will "add more consumable supplies and food to help ensure sufficient reserves of supplies aboard the station" to the Dragon vehicle.

As it mulls stopgap measures, one option available to NASA may be to try to slot in a cargo mission on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. After the propulsion issues experienced on Starliner's first crew flight to the space station last June, NASA is still evaluating whether the vehicle can be certified for an operational crew mission, or whether it would be better to perform an uncrewed test flight.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>“Rose,” the very first episode of Doctor Who‘s revival—broadcast 20 years ago today—remains one of the show’s finest examples of what it wanted to do and be in the modern era. Its introduction to the domestic life of its latest companion, Billie Piper’s titular Rose Tyler, put her story at the forefront, setting a template the next 20 years of TARDIS travelers. Its framing of the Doctor, so mysterious and utterly alien, gave Christopher Eccleston a canvas to deliver what would be a career-defining performance. But above all, in its most enchanting moment, it reminded us that deep down beneath all the newness and modernity of it all, it knew what Doctor Who had always been about from the very beginning.

Doctor Who is about running.

Eccleston’s very first scene in “Rose” comes after an opening act that introduces us to Rose’s life. We see her day-to-day, we see how she interacts with her mother Jackie and her boyfriend Mickey, we see the hustle and bustle and banality of a perfectly ordinary life. It’s fast-paced, in so much that it’s then-contemporary TV, from the swoosh-down from space, through Earth’s atmosphere, right onto Rose’s alarm clock rudely announcing the start of her day, to Murray Gold’s zippy soundtrack punctuating its quick cuts. But everything slows down when Rose goes underground at her department store job, trying to find the missing chief electrician. The music turns creepy, things get quiet and mysterious, slowly ramping up the tension and then ratcheting it up even more when the hordes of shop window dummies littered about in the back spaces start coming to life and talking her.

And then it comes, the crescendo: a hand grasping hers, out of nowhere, and one simple word barked out of Eccleston’s mouth. Run.

It’s an electric moment, the smashing open of doors as Rose and the Doctor run through, and, yes indeed, it’s running down a corridor. But it’s more than just that classic Who trope at play, it’s the burst of energy the Doctor represents, to Rose and us as the audience, as he just races into her life. The terror of those dummies, the Autons, clambering behind them, trying to break through as they escape into a nearby elevator. The sudden switch as the Doctor goes from complimenting Rose to an alien coldness as he tells her that the co-worker she was looking for, Wilson, is dead. Everything is suddenly running at a million miles a minute, but not in the way Rose’s life already was in the episode’s opening: it’s discordant, and weird, and exhilarating, and suddenly dangerous. Everything has shifted with that grasp of a hand and that single word.

It’s fitting then, that the scene climaxes with the Doctor trying to shove Rose out of his life as quickly as he entered hers with a similar warning, telling her to run for her life as he prepares to blow up her shop and take the Autons—and maybe even himself—with it. All this characterization, all this mystery, all this energy, it’s there and gone in just a few minutes, truly punctuated with the violent explosion as Rose’s place of work goes up in flames. It hits you as the audience as much as it hits Rose, but it’s also everything Doctor Who should be in just that tiny fragment of time. It’s funny, it’s scary, it’s weird, there’s a mystery and allure about around this strange hero swooping in and out, and you’re left to pick up what’s left behind with a simple question: just who the hell is this person? How can you not, as I did 20 years ago, immediately be hooked into this weird and wonderful adventure?

At that point, the running down a corridor almost becomes ancillary, even if it is ultimately as fundamental to Doctor Who as all that other emotion. But it show’s just how immediately Doctor Who‘s regeneration so keenly understood itself from the get go: and captured an energy that would sustain it for the next 20 years—and hopefully many more beyond it.</p></b>

                <p>The war chat leak episode—in which details of a recent bombing mission were sent from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to head editor of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg—has got to be one of the funniest White House fuckups of all time. Instead of admitting that they fucked up, however, Hegseth and his government allies have conjured up a series of increasingly ludicrous arguments in an attempt to justify what happened. At the same time, Hegseth has sought to attack and demonize Goldberg and The Atlantic for simply reporting on the information that Hegseth, himself, sent to the journalist.

On Wednesday, Hegseth took to X to claim that The Atlantic’s second story showed that he hadn’t released any “war plans,” with the implication being that Goldberg was some sort of fabulist. Hegseth railed: “So, let’s me get this straight. The Atlantic released the so-called “war plans” and those “plans” include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information. Those are some really shitty war plans,” he said. “This only proves one thing: Jeff Goldberg has never seen a war plan or an “attack plan” (as he now calls it). Not even close.”

Hegseth’s sophisticated linguistic analysis of the difference between “war” and “attack” (because apparently a military “attack” with bombs isn’t an act of warfare) runs parallel to another dopey claim being made by his supporters. That claim suggests that Hegseth, as chief of the DoD, is ultimately responsible for what is classified and what isn’t and that the information that was shared with a prominent journalist did not rise to the level of government secrets. Hegseth has also dodged questions about whether the Signal chat took place on personal (as opposed to government-issued) phones—which is something that security pros have worried about, since personal phones are much more hackable than government ones. “Nobody’s texting war plans,” Hegseth recently told a journalist who asked about the phones. “I know exactly what I’m doing,” he said, adding: “I’m really proud of what we accomplished.”

Meanwhile, rightwing influencers like Ian Miles Cheong have made up excuses for why the real blame for the incident should be placed on the media, not Hegseth. “Signal was called the “gold standard” for encrypted comms. Not just by security experts but by The Atlantic itself. Clinton and the Obama administration used it,” Cheong recently wrote on X. “Suddenly it’s a problem that Trump’s people are using it? I’m not buying it.” Yes, while it is true that Signal is considered a really good civilian privacy app, it is for civilians, not leaders of the most powerful military in the world who are regularly targeted by foreign agents. Its group chats feature is the most susceptible element to hacking because it is the most easily overcome by social engineering, stupidity, or whatever Michael Waltz claims was happening when he added the editor of a magazine to the war chat.

Hegseth’s full throated defense seems inconsistent at best and downright divorced from reality at worst. For one thing, it seems clear that some of the information in the chat was—or should have been—classified. Members of Congress seem to think this is the case, and a current Pentagon official interviewed by CNN has alleged the same. “These are operational plans that are highly classified in order to protect the service members,” the anonymous source, described as a U.S. defense official, said. “It is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court martialed for this,” they added. How egregious was the group chat’s operational security failure? That same unnamed official said even his “junior analysts know not to do this.”

Even a former Trump official has claimed that the information is classified. Mick Mulroy, described as the Pentagon’s top official for Middle East policy during the first Trump administration, told the Military Times: “This information was clearly taken from the real time order of battle sequence of an ongoing operation. It is highly classified and protected.”

Indeed, in a situation that is already thoroughly dumb, Hegseth’s insistence that he’s done nothing wrong only makes him look worse. Truly, if this is a normal chain of events, why doesn’t Hegseth make Goldberg a permanent fixture in all pre-bombing IC chats? It can be a running column for The Atlantic: “Here’s When and Where America Will Bomb Next!” where Americans can tune in to read about imminent aerial campaigns in the hours before the bombs drop. Maybe the government can partner with Wikileaks and release the text messages in real-time so that Americans (and, you know, the rest of the world) are on the same page whenever a U.S. military operation is underway.

Other participants in the chat fiasco were put on blast Wednesday’s during a House Intelligence Committee hearing. Most notably, the new Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, continued to answer questions about the incident and, in so doing, did not come off as particularly well suited to her role. During a particular back and forth with Congressman Jim Himes (D-Connecticut), Gabbard, revealed that (unless she’s, you know, a liar) she has a shockingly bad memory for a person who is now tasked with overseeing the entire U.S. intelligence community.

Himes questioned Gabbard about why, during a separate Congressional hearing that took place Tuesday, she testified that she didn’t think the conversation had included specific information about U.S. weapons packages, targets, or timing. She replied: “My answer yesterday was based on my recollection, or the lack thereof.”

Himes: “So it’s your testimony that less than two weeks ago, you were on a signal chat that had all of this information about F-18s and MQ-9 Reapers and targets on strike, and you, in that two-week period, simply forgot that that was there? That’s your testimony?”

Gabbard: “My testimony is that I did not recall the exact details of what was included there.”

Himes: “That was not your testimony. Your testimony was that you were not aware of anything related to weapons packages, targets, and timing.”

Gabbard then responded that she didn’t “remember the exact wording” that she had used in the hearing from the previous day. In other words: Gabbard seems to have trouble remembering stuff that happened a matter of days (or even hours) in the past.

Meanwhile, the government is now putting together a team to understand how Goldberg was added to the group chat, despite the fact that the screenshots of the messages released by The Atlantic (which have been verified as authentic by the National Security Council) appear to clearly show that the editor was added to the chat by national security advisor Michael Waltz. Instead of acknowledging this, the White House has now tasked Waltz, himself, with probing what happened. Also added to the investigative team is the National Security Council, the White House Counsel’s Office, and Elon Musk’s DOGE team, because, you know, they’ve never done anything stupid.</p></b>

                <p>Google has been maintaining two Android development branches for years. One is the Android Open Source Project and the other is an internal branch of Android that’s closer to the software that actually ships on most Android phones and tablets since it includes Google Mobile Services including the Google Play Store and apps like Chrome, Google Maps, and Gmail.

But according to a report from Android Authority’s Mishaal Rahman, starting net week “all Android development will occur within Google’s internal branches, and the source code for changes will only be released when Google publishes a new branch containing those changes.”

The move means Google won’t be working on maintaining two branches at the same time. But it means that AOSP updates will probably come much less frequently. And it means we also probably won’t see as many news articles speculating about possible changes coming to Android that are based on pre-release code commits submitted to AOSP moving forward.

Here’s a roundup of recent tech news from around the web.

Google plans to move all Android development to its internal branch and then publish relevant updates to the Android Open Source Project when they’re ready.

                <p>The wolves have firmly taken charge of the henhouse. The federal government has reportedly chosen David Geier, a notorious vaccine skeptic, to lead its upcoming study examining an already debunked link between vaccination and autism.

The Washington Post first reported on the development Tuesday afternoon, citing anonymous current and former federal health officials. Geier has long advocated against vaccination, often releasing shoddy and swiftly discredited research. His hiring is yet another sign that the country’s public health agenda, now led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is being led astray.

News of the federal government’s planned study into vaccines and autism first broke in early March. At the time, the CDC was expected to lead the research and began to do so at the behest of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to The Washington Post.

In recent weeks, however, HHS reportedly changed tack and instructed the National Institutes of Health to conduct the study instead. HHS has hired Geier to lead the analysis, according to the Washington Post. A listing matching his name can be seen on the agency’s employee directory, where he is described as a senior data analyst. When briefly interviewed by The Washington Post, Geier declined to confirm whether he had a role in the study, directing questions to those in charge.

Gizmodo reached out to HHS but has not yet received any comment regarding these latest developments.

Much like HHS chief RFK Jr., Geier has a long history of supporting the anti-vaccination movement, usually alongside his father, Mark Geier. The Geiers have regularly released research purporting to show the hidden dangers of vaccination, often focusing on a link between mercury-based ingredients in vaccines and autism—research that Kennedy himself has cited in his attacks against vaccines.

In addition to his research, Mark Geier has frequently served as an expert legal witness for plaintiffs seeking compensation for alleged “vaccine injuries” in federal court cases, but he has been barred from doing so in some cases. The Geiers have also created and profited from the sale of autism treatments supposedly meant to help people damaged by mercury.

Importantly, the vast majority of studies examining the issue have failed to find any connection between autism and vaccines or their ingredients. The Geiers’ research has also been routinely criticized by scientists over the years for misinterpreting data to support their agenda, and their studies have occasionally been retracted.

Mark Geier does have scientific training as a physician and geneticist, but David Geier only has a bachelor’s degree in biology. In 2011, the Maryland State Board of Physicians suspended and later revoked Mark Geier’s license to practice medicine in the state over allegations that he mistreated several autistic patients in his care; that same year, the state charged David Geier with practicing medicine without a license, alleging that he misrepresented himself as a doctor to his father’s patients (Geier claimed that his only role in the practice was administrative).

In securing his nomination to lead HHS, RFK Jr. assured his critics that he would have no issue acknowledging that vaccines don’t cause autism once presented with the scientific evidence showing as much. But Kennedy has a long track record of ignoring this evidence, even dismissing examples of it during a Senate hearing prior to his confirmation. Geier’s hiring is another strong indicator that any such discovery process will be rigged in favor of the anti-vaccination movement.</p></b>

                <p>A venmo account under the name “Michael Waltz,“ Carrying a Profile Photo Of The National Security Adviser and Connected to Accounts Bearing the Names of People Closely Associated with Him, what Left Open to the Public Until Wednesday Afternoon. A WIRED Analysis Shows that the account revealed the Names of Waltz’s Personal and Professional Associates, Including Journalists, Military Officers, Lobbyists, and Others - Intelligence Service or Oth Actors Could Exploit for ANY Number of Ends, Experts Say.

Among the Accounts Linked to “Michael Waltz” are that Appear to Belong to Susie Wiles, The White House Chief of Staff, and Walker Barrett, a Staffer on the United States National Security Council. Both Were Fellow Participants in A Now-Infamous Signal Group Chat Called “Houthi PC Small Group.”

The White House Declined to Comment After Being Presented with Wired’s Findings, But the Accounts Appearing to Belong to Waltz and Wiles Went Fully Private Following Wired’s Inquiry.

Earlier This Week, The Atlantic Reported that an account with the name “Michael Waltz” Acceded the Publication’s Editor in Chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, To The Chat, In which senior administration Officials Discussed Plans for a Strike on Yemen. (Waltz Told Fox News ’Laura Ingraham He Takes“ Full Responsibility ”for Inviting Goldberg, Adding,“ We ​​Have of the Best Technology Minds Looking at How This Happened. ”) Over the Encrypted Messaging App, which Defense Guidelines Bar From Being For The Discussion of Any Confublic Defense Information, The Group Debated Whether a Strike Should Be Carried Out at All. Hours After An Account With the Name of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Shared Missile Targets, Strike Timing, and Other Highly Sensitive Operational Details of A Coming Strike, Us Forces Bomb Houthi Targets in Yemen, Reportedly Killing at Least 53 People.

A WIRED Review of Public Data Exposed on Venmo Accounts Associated with Senior Administration Officials Suggests That The Signal Group Chat was NOT an isolated Mistake, But part of a Broader Pattern Of What National Security Experts Describe As Reckless Beeckless Behaver BY OF THE MOST POWEFUL PEOPLE in the US Government.

The Venmo Account Under Waltz’s name including a 328 person Friend List. Among them are accounts sharing the Names of People Closely Associated with Waltz, Such as Barrett, Formerly Waltz’s Deputy Chief of Staff When Waltz was a Member of the House of Repreets, and Micah Thomas Ketchel, Former Chief of Staff to Waltz and Currently to Waltz and President Donald Trump.

Other Accounts Carry the Names of A Wide Range of Media Figures, From On-Air Personalsties Like Bret Baier and Brian Kilmeade of Fox News and Brianna Keilar and Kristen Holmes of Cnn to a Cable News Producer, A Prominent National Security Reporter, Local News Anchors, Documentaries, and Noted Conspiracy Theorist Ivan Raiklin, Who Calls Himelfe the “The Secretary of Retribution” and Once Created a Deep State Target List.

                <p>All Kindles that get the 5.18.1 update also gain access to new book summaries for "thousands of bestselling English language Kindle books," aiming to make it easier to pick up a new book in an ongoing series.

When a recap is available, it will be accessible from your Kindle's home page, or by opening the book and selecting "Recaps In This Series" from the menu. Opening a recap will show you a spoiler warning before you tap through. Based on the handful of recaps I could find and skim, there's a pretty good chance these summaries are mostly AI-generated, but Amazon's release notes and the Kindle interface don't say one way or the other.

The 5.18.1 update also includes the typical non-specific "performance improvements, bug fixes, and other general enhancements" for all models. This is the first update to get the Colorsoft and the other Kindles running on the same software version—before now, the other Kindles were all on version 5.17, and the Colorsoft ran a version of 5.18 that wasn't available for manual download from Amazon's software update page.</p></b>

                <p>AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D are the best gaming CPUs around, but both of those cost well over $400 and are often out of stock. What if you're planning a PC Build that's more budget-conscious? The Ryzen 5 9600X is a great choice for mid-range gaming and productivity.

This 6-core, 12-thread CPU can run at up to 5.4 GHz and now it's on sale for its lowest price ever: $223 at Amazon.

AMD Ryzen 5 9600X: was $230, now $223 at Amazon

This 6-thread, 12-core CPU operates on the Zen 5 architecture and has a maximum boost clock of 5.4 GHz.

When we reviewed the Ryzen 5 9600X, we tested it against our suite of 1080p games and found that it was capable of outputting an average of 163 fps. When we turned on Precision Boost Overdrive, the number jumped to 175 fps.

These numbers are with an RTX 4090 card so your results will vary, depending on your graphics card. However, the point is that you will not be significantly CPU limited and can depend on your discrete GPU for good gaming performance.</p></b>

                <p>An eruption of measles is spreading quickly in Kansas, with cases doubling in a week and spreading to three new counties, some with vaccination coverage among kindergartners at pitiful levels as low as 41 percent. Coverage of 95 percent or greater is thought to protect communities from onward spread of the extremely contagious virus.

In an update Wednesday, March 26, Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) reported 23 measles cases across six counties—up from 10 cases across three counties on March 21. The 23 people ill with the dangerous virus are mostly children, including six who are 0 to 4 years old, nine who are 5 to 10, three who are 11 to 13, three who are 14 to 17, and two adults between the ages of 25 and 44. Fortunately, none of the cases have been hospitalized so far, and there have been no deaths.

Twenty of the 23 cases were unvaccinated. One case was "not age appropriately vaccinated," one was "age appropriately vaccinated," and the remaining case's vaccination status is pending.

Children should get two doses of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, the first between the ages of 12 and 15 months and the second between the ages of 4 and 6, prior to starting kindergarten. Two doses are 97 percent effective against measles, offering lifelong protection.

The cases now span the counties of Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton, and Stevens, all in the southwest corner of the state. Many of the counties have areas with extremely low vaccination rates. Haskell, which has reported 4 of the 23 cases, has two school districts, both with low vaccination coverage: Satanta with only 85 percent of kindergartners being up to date on their MMR vaccines in the 2023–2024 school year, and Sublette with just 41 percent. Likewise, Gray County includes school districts Cimarron-Ensign with 63 percent and Ingalls with 60 percent. Two other districts in the county had unreported vaccination rates.</p></b>

                <p>Marvel just announced its first X-Men movie. Sort of. Along with the elaborate cast announcement for Avengers: Doomsday, Marvel revealed that several stars from the original Fox X-Men series are returning, presumably as their original characters. There’s Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn, Alan Cumming, and Kelsey Grammar, to start.

The cast is still coming and we’ll add more names when they’re revealed. But we think it’s safe to assume they’re playing Professor X, Magneto, Cyclops, Mystique, Nightcrawler, and Beast.

This is fascinating for a bunch of reasons. The first is that there are two X-Men casts. There are the ones from the 2000 original, X-Men, and the ones from the 2011 reboot/prequel, X-Men: First Class. Of course, they came together in a subsequent film, but if you had to choose which cast was going to shift over to the MCU, you would’ve guessed the younger one. Though, to be fair, both Stewart and Grammar have already reprised their roles in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and The Marvels.

Then there’s also the question of what narrative role these characters are going to play in an Avengers movie. They’re not Avengers. They’re X-Men. So is it possible they’re just sacrificial lambs so Doctor Doom, played by Robert Downey Jr., can prove his superiority? Would all of these actors return just to be killed off?

Clearly, we don’t know. We also don’t know if the versions of the characters that appear in Doomsday are the same X-Men from that universe. Deadpool & Wolverine, the actual first X-Men movie in the MCU, clearly established that there are multiple versions of all of these characters. And, with the reveal that Channing Tatum is returning as Gambit, we know that’s part of this. So, potentially, these are completely new ones. Or maybe they’re not even those characters.

Nevertheless, it’s very exciting for long-time superhero film fans to see these names pop up. The Fox universe has gotten a few chances at closure in the past, but coming back for an Avengers film feels like a whole new level.</p></b>

                <p>The US Space Force on Wednesday announced that it has certified United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket to conduct national security missions.

"Assured access to space is a core function of the Space Force and a critical element of national security," said Brig. Gen. Panzenhagen, program executive officer for Assured Access to Space, in a news release. "Vulcan certification adds launch capacity, resiliency, and flexibility needed by our nation’s most critical space-based systems."

The formal announcement closes a yearslong process that has seen multiple delays in the development of the Vulcan rocket, as well as two anomalies in recent years that were a further setback to certification.

The first of these, an explosion on a test stand in northern Alabama during the spring of 2023, delayed the first test flight of Vulcan by several months. Then, in October 2024, during the second test flight of the rocket, a nozzle on one of the Vulcan's two side-mounted boosters failed.

A cumbersome process

This nozzle issue, more than five months ago, compounded the extensive paperwork needed to certify Vulcan for the US Department of Defense's most sensitive missions. The military has several options for companies to certify their rockets depending on the number of flights completed, which could be two, three, or more. The fewer the flights, the more paperwork and review that must be done. For Vulcan, this process entailed:

52 certification criteria

more than 180 discrete tasks

2 certification flight demonstrations

60 payload interface requirement verifications

18 subsystem design and test reviews

114 hardware and software audits

That sounds like a lot of work, but at least the military's rules and regulations are straightforward and simple to navigate, right? Anyway, the certification process is complete, elevating United Launch Alliance to fly national security missions alongside SpaceX with its fleet of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.</p></b>

YouTube will soon count Shorts views using the same method as TikTok and Instagram. Starting March 31st, YouTube will display the number of times a Short starts to play or replay, like Instagram and TikTok do, instead of only counting after someone watches a Short for a specific length of time.

“We hope that this deeper understanding of your Shorts performance will help you inform your content strategy, better represent your work to potential brand or agency partners, and give you a fuller picture of your overall reach if you’re posting on multiple platforms!” YouTube says in the update. The company adds that view counts may be higher following the change.

Related YouTube Shorts are getting less short

The new view-counting system seems designed to bring creators’ view counts in line with what they see on TikTok and Instagram. Despite the change, YouTube will continue tracking the old Shorts metric under an “engaged views” option in its analytics dashboard. It will also keep using “engaged views” to determine how much a creator earns and their eligibility for the YouTube Partnership Program.</p></b>

Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars are two of the tentpoles of Marvel’s upcoming phase 6 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They’ll see the return of both the Russo brothers as directors and Robert Downey Jr., who’ll be swapping the Iron Man mask for Doctor Doom. Marvel reportedly spent big to get the band back together.

Phase 6 will actually kick off this year with Fantastic Four, which is slated to hit theaters on July 25th, just after the premiere of Thunderbolts on May 2nd. Doomsday, meanwhile, is due out on May 1st, 2026.</p></b>

                <p>Amazon has released a software update for the current-generation Colorsoft and Paperwhite that lets you double-tap on the sides or back of your Kindle to turn the page. The new feature, as spotted by The eBook Reader , is listed in the release notes for the 5.18.1 update and can be found in Settings > Device Options.

The new software wasn’t immediately available as an over-the-air update for my Kindle Colorsoft, but I was able to download it and install it manually following Amazon’s instructions. The feature works well using relatively light taps anywhere on the Colorsoft, and since it requires two taps in rapid succession, it’s not easy to trigger by mistake. Unfortunately, it’s limited to just one direction. You can either use it to jump to the next page, or scroll down a long list of books. Perhaps a future update will enable triple-taps as a way to scroll up or go back to a previous page.</p></b>

                <p>Vin Diesel loves his Instagram. He really does. On any given morning, he’ll type out a nice long message to his 100-plus million followers and just say some wild shit. Like there’s a Groot movie coming. Or, he’s been asked to direct a Fast and Furious short film as a prequel to the 11th and final Fast and Furious movie.

That second one happened Wednesday and holds a bit more weight to it. You see, back in 2009, Diesel directed Los Bandoleros, a canon short film set before the events of the fourth film, Fast and Furious. It’s actually pretty good! And now, according to Diesel, he’s doing a similar thing in the run-up to Fast Eleven aka Fast X Part 2.

“I am reminded of that critical moment in the Fast franchise, where we had just wrapped the fourth film,” Diesel wrote. “The studio asked me to direct the precursor to the film, to explain where Dom had been in between the first and the fourth film. It was called Los Bandoleros. Now, all these years later, the request has come in again for me to direct the precursor, to the finale.” Here’s the post.

He goes on to hint that it’s going to be filmed in a very exotic location, such as a desert, but wait a minute. When last we saw Diesel’s character, Dominic Toretto, he was at the bottom of a dam, about to be killed. Is this film going to show how Dom got out of that jam and ran away into the desert? Could it be about his friends Roman, Tej, Han, and Ramsey, who were just shot down in a plane, and how they got back to civilization? Would an 11th installment really just skip this kind of crucial narrative cohesion for a YouTube short film?

Also, when the heck is this 11th film coming? Is this film just a way to stall so the team can put together a coherent, good script this time? io9 has reached out to Universal for some type of comment or clarification and will update this piece if and when we hear back.

It’s the Fast and Furious franchise—so of course, anything is possible. Maybe it’s a Gal Gadot short explaining how Gisele returns. Or Dwayne Johnson’s character, Hobbs, sunbathing for 20 minutes. We don’t know. But, it is sure fun to speculate and to just kind of laugh at the delightful absurdity of it all.

Let us know both what you think Diesel’s Fast Eleven short film will be, and if it’s even a real thing, below.</p></b>

                <p>A federal court in California denied an injunction sought by music publishers in their copyright case against Anthropic on Tuesday. The injunction would’ve barred the AI company from using song lyrics to train the AI models that power its chatbot Claude. The music publishers first filed the suit in late 2023 and while this is a setback for the publishers, it’s just one battle in a much larger legal war between AI companies and copyright holders.

Concord, ABKCO Music & Records, and Universal Music first filed suit against Anthropic in October 2023, alleging that Claude’s responses to questions would include things identical or nearly identical to song lyrics. As the copyright holders, the music publishers argue that such use of their songs aren’t considered fair use under U.S. copyright law.

U.S. District Judge Eumi Lee wrote that although the publishers sought to clarify the scope of what they were asking for, their inclusion of 500 songs that were allegedly used by Anthropic wasn’t good enough, as it was conceded they were “illustrative and non-exhaustive,” according to court documents published by Court Listener.

“Publishers’ counsel could not say how many songs would be subject to the injunction,” the ruling states. “Moreover, the injunction would apply to songs that Publishers currently own and to an unknowable universe of songs that they may acquire while the injunction is in place. Publishers would also ‘update’ the list to add or remove songs as necessary. Publishers did not offer a concrete or definitive way for Anthropic—as the party subject to the injunction and the legal repercussions of a violation—to ascertain its parameters or comply with its terms.”

Anthropic told Gizmodo it was pleased with Tuesday’s ruling and believed its use of song lyrics should be considered fair use.

“We are pleased that the court did not grant the plaintiffs’ disruptive and amorphous request for interim relief in this case,” a spokesperson for Anthropic told Gizmodo via email. “As the case continues, we look forward to explaining why use of copyrighted material for training large language models aligns with fair use principles under copyright law.”

While the copyright holders lost this one round, they expressed confidence in the case moving forward.

“Despite the Court’s narrow ruling, we remain very confident in our case against Anthropic more broadly,” a representative for the publishers said in a statement to Music Business Worldwide.

“In response to our preliminary injunction motion,” the statement continued, “Anthropic had already conceded the merits of our claims against its infringing outputs of our copyrighted song lyrics, by entering into a stipulation requiring it to maintain ‘guardrails’ to prevent such infringing outputs, thereby resolving a critical aspect of the motion in our favor. The Court noted this factor as an important part of its preliminary decision.”</p></b>

                <p>Google is planning a major change to the way it develops new versions of the Android operating system. Since the beginning, large swaths of the software have been developed in public-facing channels, but that will no longer be the case. This does not mean Android is shedding its open source roots, but the process won't be as transparent.

Google has confirmed to Android Authority that all Android development work going forward will take place in Google's internal branch. This is a shift from the way Google has worked on Android in the past, which featured frequent updates to the public AOSP branch. Anyone can access AOSP, but the internal branches are only available to Google and companies with a Google Mobile Services (GMS) license, like Samsung, Motorola, and others.

According to the company, it is making this change to simplify things, building on a recent change to trunk-based development. As Google works on both public and private branches of Android, the two fall out of sync with respect to features and API support. This forces Google to tediously merge the branches for every release. By focusing on the internal branch, Google claims it can streamline releases and make life easier for everyone.

When new versions of Android are done, Google says it will continue to publish the source code in AOSP as always. Supposedly, this will allow developers to focus on supporting their apps without keeping track of pending changes to the platform in AOSP. Licensed OEMs, meanwhile, can just focus on the lively internal branch as they work on devices that can take a year or more to launch.</p></b>

Whenever Verge staffers are asked to describe their smart tech, office tools, kitchen gadgets, or whatever else, they talk about things they recently bought, things they picked up 10 years ago, or things they’ve had sitting around their house for decades.

We’ve gathered a few of the items that our staffers have enthused about in the past that they use for charging, repairing, listening, cooking, gardening, and parenting, and that are now discounted as part of Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. Just in case you’d like to check them out.

Kitchen help

After realizing we’re not a family who likes to get their hands dirty while cooking (we leave that part to mixers and blenders), an automatic soap dispenser has become one of the most used devices in our kitchen. We opted for a cheap $25 option from Amazon that lets you adjust how much foaming soap is dispensed and lasts for a couple of months between charges, but companies like Simplehuman sell pricier $80 versions wrapped in brushed metal or other fancy finishes that could better match your decor. We find we use less soap now that it’s always perfectly portioned out, and buying refills in bulk is much cheaper. There’s now one in every bathroom in our home. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter, news

Instant Pot Duo Crisp $ 100 $ 150 33 % off $ 100 An 11-in-1 air fryer and electric pressure cooker that air fries, steams, slow cooks, sautés, dehydrates, and — in other words — gives you a world of cooking features on your counter. Read More $100 at Amazon

For the past few years, the Instant Pot has been a staple in my kitchen. From making rice to slow-cooking stews and even frying up chicken, it can do just about anything. The best part is that the Instant Pot can cook most recipes in a fraction of the time it would take in the oven or on the stove. Rice, for example, takes just six minutes to cook (not counting the amount of time it takes to build pressure), and there’s no fussing with covering the pot or adjusting the heat. Sometimes, it’s just easier — and much less stressful — to let the Instant Pot take the wheel. — Emma Roth, news writer

One of the first things I did when I got my own place was purchase a food chopper. Perhaps puritan chefs will disagree with my methods, but this saves me so much time. I like to make tikka masala, which requires dicing ginger. If you’ve ever tried to dice ginger, you know that a food chopper would come in handy. This one did break recently, so I’ll probably replace it with a fancier one. — Kylie Robison, senior AI reporter

Infant & child care

The Yogasleep Hushh is a small, portable white noise machine. That’s it, and that’s why it’s great.

It’s not a smart device and doesn’t require any sort of subscription. It has physical buttons. It has three different white noise options. It can run on battery for up to 24 hours, and you can charge it with a USB-C cable. It even comes with a ring to attach it to things.

My wife and I turn on the Hushh every time we put our baby down to sleep. If you’re looking for a simple white noise machine that just works, this is the one to buy. – Jay Peters, news editor

Ravensburger Starter-Set GraviTrax $ 49 $ 70 30 % off $ 49 An interactive track system allows you to design and build your own racetracks and experiment with gravity, magnetism, and kinetics. Read More $49 at Amazon

When screen time is over, there’s no building toy, not even Lego, that holds my kid’s attention better than GraviTrax. It lets you build complicated marble runs using myriad components, including ramps, risers, bridges, switches, and launchers — and that’s just the starter set. There are several expansions that add motorized components that can keep marbles rolling indefinitely if assembled correctly, and it’s one of those toys that adults will enjoy just as much as kids do. For younger kids, there’s also now a GraviTrax Junior line with simpler components and larger marbles. – Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter, news

A musical penguin toy that cycles through surprisingly boppy remixes. It flaps its wings with high-contrast black-and-white spots that will mesmerize your baby. – Helen Havlak, publisher

The Snoo is a smart bassinet that plays white noise and rocks your baby, ramping up the intensity if your baby keeps crying. I have heard from friends that it does not work for every baby, but when it works, it really works — and you have truly magical moments when it successfully puts your baby to sleep. You can control the intensity manually and get nice sleep logs in their proprietary app — though Snoo’s parent company, Happiest Baby, has come under fire for introducing a new subscription fee of $19.99 / month for the main app functionality after nine months. While infuriating, I was so desperate for sleep, I would still have bought a Snoo. Also, look out for return policies; some parents prefer to buy their Snoos from Amazon to avoid Happiest Baby’s steep $199 restocking fee. – Helen Havlak, publisher

Garden gadgets

Gouevn soil moisture meter $ 8 $ 9 11 % off $ 8 Gouevn’s cheap meter can quickly test the soil moisture for both indoor and outdoor plants. Read More $8 at Amazon

Fungus gnats love overwatered soil, so once you’ve gotten rid of them, you’ve got to be careful and diligent about your watering schedule. For that, I got myself a Gouevn soil moisture meter to teach myself how to properly water my plants. I’ve properly vanquished my fungus gnat issue, but with these two tools, I’m always prepared in case there’s ever another infestation. - Victoria Song, senior reviewer

One day, I received a surprise package in the mail from my mom, and it included these Velcro garden ties. I’d never even seen these before, so I decided to try them with my orchid. I found that they’re a lot softer than the plastic ties I used previously, and they do a pretty good job at supporting my plants, both indoor and outdoor. You can simply cut the Velcro ties to size, wrap them around your plant, and the tie will stick to itself. They’re reusable, too! — Emma Roth, news writer

Charging gadgets

Epicka universal travel adapter $ 20 $ 25 20 % off $ 20 Epicka’s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries. Read More $20 at Amazon

In my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you’ve landed in another country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.

Basically, it’s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it’s a game-changer. What I like about this one from Epicka is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.

The only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That’ll get you by in most countries, but it’s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I’ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store. — Victoria Song, senior reviewer

Nobody wants to carry a power strip or an extension cord with them on their vacation. It’s probably unnecessary if you’re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you’re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it’s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there are already two lamps plugged into it.

Older buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they’re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this Anker combination extension cord / power strip. It’s not a full power strip — just a cube with a few sockets along with USB and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I’ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.

The three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people’s devices.

If you’re traveling overseas, don’t forget to purchase a different plug type. — Sarah Jeong, deputy features editor

Other gadgets

Meross Smart Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener $ 39 $ 50 22 % off $ 39 Meross makes a handy add-on that can transform a variety of garage door models into smart doors that you can open remotely. It works with Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. Read More $39 at Amazon

Most of the things I own are, frankly, just unreliable enough to be annoying. All except for one or two, and of those, the one I love most of all is the Meross Smart Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener for HomeKit. And my love for it isn’t just about its rock-solid performance — it’s because, as far as I can tell, it’s compatible with almost any garage door opener on the market and across time itself. I don’t think that’s an exaggeration, either. The chunky mustard yellow all-metal box that cranks my garage door open — the Model 455 by Automatic Doorman — was made, by my loose estimation, sometime between the fall of Rome and 1975.

But Meross’ adapter was $30 — and to my amazement, after a very simple installation, it worked and continues to do so almost every time I need it to. Best of all, I don’t have to carry the chunky remote with me on my bike when I leave because I can just talk into my Apple Watch when I return and coast right in. — Wes Davis, weekend editor

I spend the workday at my Vox laptop, a MacBook Pro, with a few accessories, including a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones that my colleague Chris Welch reviewed. — Adi Robertson, senior reporter

Hoto 3.6V Electric Screwdriver Kit (Classic) $ 40 $ 70 43 % off $ 40 Hoto’s electric screwdriver is perfect for making small- to medium-sized repairs around the house. In addition to a USB-C port, the screwdriver comes with a magnetic case and 25 steel bits. Read More $40 at Amazon

I picked up Hoto’s electric screwdriver because my former boss at The Verge, Dan Seifert, would often pitch it around gift guide season. I’m glad I did, though, because it now sits alongside a handful of tools I use on an almost weekly basis. I wouldn’t suggest using it for real household projects that require some serious torque, but it’s incredibly handy for tightening the legs on my desk, assembling furniture, and making sure my bike seat isn’t going to come off mid-ride. It’s also equipped with a USB-C port for charging, a nifty LED light that lets you ditch the headlamp, and a case for housing the 25 steel bits. Oh, and it really does make for a great little gift. I guess Dan was right. — Brandon Widder, senior commerce editor

Kailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islet switches $ 48 $ 60 20 % off $ 48 A fantastic silent linear mechanical switch for Cherry MX-compatible keyboards. Islets are smooth and quiet, with a long spring that gives them a top-heavy, almost tactile force curve. They’re 3-pin switches, so they work with most hot-swappable mechanical keyboards that take 3- or 5-pin switches. Read More $48 at Amazon (90-piece)

These are my current favorite switches. The Kailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islets are nearly identical to the fantastic switches in the HHKB Studio, just much less expensive. The Islets are silent linear switches, with an extra-long spring, so the actuation force curve is strongest right at the beginning and then smooth the rest of the way, giving them an almost Topre-like tactile sensation. (Pitchforks down; I said almost.) They’re an instant upgrade for any hot-swappable keyboard that takes Cherry MX-compatible switches, and I’ve been using them as my daily drivers for a while. There’s also a tactile version, which I don’t like as much. Sorry to the Kailh Whales. — Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor</p></b>

They’ve always been the safer alternative since they don’t obstruct your hearing, but with the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2, they now actually sound good. Thanks to its USB-C charging (in place of the proprietary charger that its predecessor used), more bass, fewer audible vibrations, and AI-powered noise cancellation, it’s easier than ever to recommend them to more people — especially since they’re $30 off during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale.</p></b>

                <p>The eye-popping scandal surrounding the Trump cabinet’s accidental invitation to The Atlantic’s editor in chief to join a text-message group secretly planning a bombing in Yemen has rolled into its third day, and that controversy now has a name: SignalGate, a reference to the fact that the conversation took place on the end-to-end encrypted free messaging tool Signal.

As that name becomes a shorthand for the biggest public blunder of the second Trump administration to date, however, security and privacy experts who have promoted Signal as the best encrypted messaging tool available to the public want to be clear about one thing: SignalGate is not about Signal.

Since The Atlantic’s editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed Monday that he was mistakenly included in a Signal group chat earlier this month created to plan US airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the reaction from the Trump cabinet’s critics and even the administration itself has in some cases seemed to cast blame on Signal for the security breach. Some commentators have pointed to reports last month of Signal-targeted phishing by Russian spies. National security adviser Michael Waltz, who reportedly invited Goldberg to the Signal group chat, has even suggested that Goldberg may have hacked into it.

On Wednesday afternoon, even President Donald Trump suggested Signal was somehow responsible for the group chat fiasco. “I don't know that Signal works,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “I think Signal could be defective, to be honest with you.”

The real lesson is much simpler, says Kenn White, a security and cryptography researcher who has conducted audits on widely used encryption tools in the past as the director of the Open Crypto Audit Project: Don’t invite untrusted contacts into your Signal group chat. And if you’re a government official working with highly sensitive or classified information, use the encrypted communication tools that run on restricted, often air-gapped devices intended for a top-secret setting rather than the unauthorized devices that can run publicly available apps like Signal.

“Unequivocally, no blame in this falls on Signal,” says White. “Signal is a communication tool designed for confidential conversations. If someone's brought into a conversation who’s not meant to be part of it, that's not a technology problem. That's an operator issue.”

Cryptographer Matt Green, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, puts it more simply. “Signal is a tool. If you misuse a tool, bad things are going to happen,” says Green. “If you hit yourself in the face with a hammer, it’s not the hammer’s fault. It’s really on you to make sure you know who you’re talking to.”

The only sense in which SignalGate is a Signal-related scandal, White adds, is that the use of Signal suggests that the cabinet-level officials involved in the Houthi bombing plans, including secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, were conducting the conversation on internet-connected devices—possibly even including personal ones—since Signal wouldn’t typically be allowed on the official, highly restricted machines intended for such conversations. “In past administrations, at least, that would be absolutely forbidden, especially for classified communications,” says White.</p></b>

                <p>The Scooby gang will be taking on a new era of ghost hunting mysteries in an upcoming Scooby-Doo series at Netflix from Josh Applebaum and Scott Rosenberg (writers of the recent Jumanji films). The eight-episode series will be a Berlanti Productions reboot of the iconic Hanna-Barbera cartoon about those meddling kids getting into spooky hijinks—with the help of the goodest crime-sniffing boy, Scooby. Sure, he’s primarily snack-oriented, but we all grew up knowing that whenever there’s a case of seemingly supernatural suspicion, the gang would get to the bottom of it.

Following the live-action footsteps of James Gunn and Raja Gosnell’s early 2000s Scooby-Doo films, the upcoming Netflix show will explore a 21st century version of Mystery Inc. Netflix’s press release describes the show as “a modern reimagining of the iconic mystery-solving group of teens and their very special dog.”

It’s a project that makes sense for the streamer behind the similarly supernatural live-action series Wednesday. Netflix’s release also gave some insight into how these new versions of Shaggy, Daphne, Velma, and Fred will get swept up into the life of crime solving: “During their final summer at camp, old friends Shaggy and Daphne get embroiled in a haunting mystery surrounding a lonely lost Great Dane puppy that may have been a witness to a supernatural murder. Together with the pragmatic and scientific townie, Velma, and the strange, but ever so handsome new kid, Freddy, they set out to solve the case that is pulling each of them into a creepy nightmare that threatens to expose all of their secrets.”

The Warner Bros. Television and Netflix collaboration with executive producer Berlanti makes sense; the mind behind a whole slate of CW hits continues to produce YA content, and this one is especially close to his heart. “One of my first and favorite jobs in Hollywood was sitting with Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera while they signed animation cells,” he said. “Josh and Scott and everyone at Midnight Radio have crafted a story that captures their amazing spirits and their genius creation. We are grateful to them and everyone at Warners and Netflix for the partnership in helping bring this iteration of Scooby-Doo to life!”</p></b>

                <p>Yet another fake RTX 4090 has been uncovered, this time sporting an older GA102 GPU die. Bilibili user 在当下里 (In the present moment) showed off a seemingly pristine Palit RTX 4090 graphics card that had no visible signs of modification or damage. However, after tearing the card apart, the card was not in fact packing a RTX 4090 die. Instead, it had a previous generation GA102 die used in GPUs including the RTX 3090 Ti, RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 Ti.



It appears the card was non-functional, and it ended up in the hands of the creator to determine what was wrong. Dismantling the card was required, as booting up the card likely didn't work — otherwise, installing Nvidia's drivers is a much easier way to determine what's under the hood. Still, it's interesting to see just how far scammers will go to attempt to dupe potential buyers.



The fake RTX 4090 was initially sold to someone for a mere ¥3,800 (around $530), well below the RTX 4090's MSRP (let alone its current real-world market price). The price should have been more than enough to suggest foul play, but the victim apparently didn't know enough about RTX 4090 pricing, or perhaps they just had faith that the seller was providing one of the best deals ever on an RTX 4090.

Visually, it would have been almost impossible for the owner to detect any foul play. Footage of the fake RTX 4090 showed impressive attention to detail, with the Bilibili channel saying there was no visible damage or signs of modification on the card's exterior.



Even tearing the card apart, the signs of foul play would have been difficult for anyone but a computer expert or enthusiast to detect. The GPU die itself was lapped (filed down to remove the existing marketing) and carefully engraved with the same labeling format as a typical AD102 die. However, there were signs of modification around the GPU die itself.



The Bilibilli user notes that the die's placement adjacent to one of the capacitors was not in the right position compared to an actual AD102 die. Additionally, the MLCC's surrounding the die area (the sea of little capacitors bordering the die itself) matched the same layout as the RTX 3090 Ti, 3090, and 3080 Ti's GA102 die.



The memory chips were also suspect, featuring no visible labeling whatsoever. We can only assume the card wasn't even functional, instead it was a "Frankenstein" card that was supposed to look the part and then fail to work.



This is the second RTX 4090 scam we've seen where someone (or a team of people) modified an Ampere-based AD102 GPU to sell it as an RTX 4090. This type of modification is allegedly very easy to do, as GA102 has the same pin layout as AD102, allowing people with the know-how to swap in GA102 dies into RTX 4090 graphics card PCBs.



Either way, going to the effort of lapping and relabeling just the GPU die while using unmarked GDDR6X memory seems unnecessary. Presumably the scammer was long gone before the buyer could determine that the GPU in question wasn't what it claimed to be.</p></b>

                <p>Affordable smartphone season remains in full swing, with Samsung entering the ring with its own affordable set of Android devices. The budget-priced Galaxy A36 and A26 were teased earlier this month alongside a third device. The phones are now available online and through participating carriers, starting at $400 and $300, respectively. Both devices feature mid-range specifications and Samsung’s “Awesome Intelligence” suite—essentially Galaxy AI, pared down for its affordable smartphones.

See Samsung A36 at Samsung

If it’s a bright, vibrant screen you want under $500, Samsung is the way to go. The Galaxy A36 and the Galaxy A26 both feature a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a maximum 1,200 nits of brightness. Both phones have Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processors with 6GB of RAM. They’re both limited to a middling 128GB of storage, so you’ll want an active cloud account if you’re looking to hoard photos and files.

The Samsung Galaxy A36 has a better-equipped camera system, with a triple-array rear camera with an 8-MP ultra-wide camera, a 50-MP primary camera with an f/1.8 aperture and OIS, and a 5-MP macro camera. There’s also a 12-MP front-facing camera for selfies. The Galaxy A26 has most of the same camera specs, save for a 2-MP macro camera on the rear and a 13-MP front-facing camera.

If you’re into artificial intelligence, the Galaxy A36 and A26 have some of Samsung’s fancy AI features, though they had to be pared down for this particular set of specifications. That’s why it’s called Awesome Intelligence instead of Galaxy AI. The abilities you’ll have access to through these devices include Circle to Search, which is mainly tied to Google’s Gemini, and Samsung’s AI-driven Object Eraser, which nixes distracting subjects from your photos. It’s enough of a taste of Samsung’s AI that maybe you’ll spring for the full-priced thing.

See Samsung A36 at Samsung

Samsung’s Galaxy A36 is available in black, lavender, and a unique lime color at Best Buy starting at $400. Samsung’s Galaxy A26 only comes in black and starts at $300. Samsung’s Galaxy A-series devices aren’t the best deal in the business. For instance, Google’s Pixel 9a, which was announced but remains delayed, features two more gigs of RAM and more of Google’s Gemini features, since it runs natively on Google’s Tensor processors. But it’s delayed and still technically $100 more than the Galaxy A36. With a Samsung phone, you should get a big, bright screen for a decent price—maybe free, if your carrier will subsidize it.</p></b>

                <p>Judge James Boasberg, COME ON DOWN. Again.

The chief judge of the US District Court for DC is already robe-deep in bullshit in the case of the Venezuelans kidnapped and shipped to El Salvador. At the moment, he’s dealing with a preposterous invocation of the state secrets privilege to fend off a query into potential contempt court. How dare the former head of the FISA court ask questions about an event which was filmed, tweeted, and retweeted by multiple members of the federal government!

Sponsored How Opus 2’s AI Powers Smarter, Faster Case Analysis And Trial Preparation Updates to the award-winning case management software empower lawyers to focus on the most important tasks.

And now Judge Boasberg’s been saddled with yet another potential stink bomb, as the Signalgate case landed on his docket this morning.

On Monday, The Atlantic‘s editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg recounted the odd tale of being added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging platform Signal wherein 18 cabinet members and high-ranking Trump administration officials discussed and planned an upcoming drone strike in Yemen that killed Houthi leaders (as well as many civilians). Signal is the preferred communication app for journalists, thanks to its customizable auto-delete feature and lack of backup in the cloud. Essentially, there is no method of preserving those messages outside of screenshots — a gross violation of federal record keeping laws.

Users can select their default user settings to erase all messages, including on the recipient’s phone, after a specific period of time, so it’s impossible to know who in the chain was preserving those messages. But during the conversation, NSA Waltz, who originally set a one-week auto-delete deadline, switched it to four-weeks.

Extremely clean OP-SEC! The cleanest!

Since Monday, we’ve been through multiple news cycles, including: Secretary of Defense Hegseth denying the story after the White House had confirmed it; National Security Advisor Michael Waltz suggesting that Goldberg hacked the group chat; CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard insisting under oath that no classified information was discussed; The Atlantic publishing screenshots of the entire exchange (while redacting the name of an agent), to prove that operational details — which are clearly national defense information — were discussed on an app which can only be loaded onto personal devices; and Gabbard and Ratcliffe testifying that the government pre-installed Signal on officials’ phones.

The president, who swept to office in 2017 by stoking outrage over Hillary Clinton’s supposedly scandalous failure to safeguard classified emails, is purportedly pissed. Not because of the spectacular fuck-up, of course, but because NSA Waltz had Goldberg’s number in his phone and may have been in contact with the “deceitful and highly discredited so-called ‘journalist’ who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again,” as Hegseth put it.

The episode has now spawned its first lawsuit, with American Oversight filing a complaint in federal court in DC this morning. The nonprofit watchdog group sued Ratcliffe, Hegseth, Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Secretary Scott Bessent, and the National Archives (NARA) under the Federal Records Act (FRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), “to prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records and to compel Defendants to fulfill their legal obligations to preserve and recover federal records created through unauthorized use of Signal for sensitive national security decision-making.” The case also names Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in his capacity as Acting Archivist, since Trump fired the head of NARA as part of his government-wide purge.

American Oversight had already filed multiple FOIA requests prior to the scandal, and it claims a cognizable fear that “Defendants’ use of Signal, as demonstrated by this particular example, presents a substantial risk that they have used and continue to use Signal in other contexts, thereby creating records that are subject to the FRA and/or the FOIA, but are not being preserved as required by those statutes.”

And indeed the chat logs released today strongly imply that the administration is regularly conducting high-level deliberations on Signal.

Confirming, as was obvious from context already, that this wasn’t a one-off. They are routinely using Signal to evade statutory record retention requirements. — Julian Sanchez (@normative.bsky.social) 2025-03-26T13:22:40.961Z

The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief that Signal messages constitute an agency record which must be preserved and an order to the attorney general that she must initiate enforcement and recovery proceedings.

The DOJ has not yet responded as of this writing. Presumably they will try to get the case dismissed on standing. Barring that, they’ll claim that the messages are both unclassified and a state secret. Then they’ll summon another troll storm against Chief Judge Boasberg and demand his impeachment.

HOW VERY DARE YOU, SIR!

                <p>Amazon's Big Spring Sale has spawned a few popular deals on some of our favorite tech. I recently covered a deal on the Crucial T705 SSD hitting an all-time low price on Amazon, and since then the SSD has quickly sold out. If you missed out and are still looking for a deal on the fastest consumer Gen 5 SSD then take a look at the same 2TB drive, but with an included heatsink. It is slightly more expensive at $259 instead of $239, but it's still one of the lowest prices for that drive variant, and the heatsink will help to keep a lid on the thermals.

Crucial's T705 PCIe Gen 5.0 SSD is one of the fastest currently available drives on the market, with the 2TB version being the fastest of the T705 capacity lineup. Thanks to Amazon's Big Spring Sale, the 2TB Crucial T705 (Heatsink Version) is at one of its lowest prices of $259. Thanks to the added heatsink on this version of the T705, any heat generated by the power draw of this superfast PCIe Gen 5 drive can be more efficiently dissipated for better thermals and less chance of thermal-throttling.

Using the Phison E26 controller and 232-Layer Micron TLC, the T705 has extremely fast sequential read and write speeds of 14,500MB/s and 12,700MB/s, respectively, with random read/writes of up to 1,550K/1,800K IOPS. This outstanding drive received our Editor's Choice award for its sustained read/write performance at high speed. See our review of the Crucial's T705 SSD for more info on this SSD.

Crucial T705 2TB Gen 5.0 PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD (Heatsink Version): now $259 at Amazon (was $413)

If you want one of the fastest SSD drives available in your PC build, then Crucial's T705 should be at the top of your list. With extremely impressive sequential read/write speeds of 14,500/12,700MB/s, this SSD will load your games and applications faster than ever. This version includes a heatsink for better heat dissipation.

The T705 comes in the M.2 form factor and installs easily in your motherboard's M.2 slot. Gen 5 SSDs are known to run slightly hotter due to an increase in power draw, but this version of the T705 comes with a heatsink for effective heat transfer from the drive to improve performance and reduce the chances of thermal throttling occurring. The height of the heatsink means this SSD cannot have motherboard M.2 slot covers applied.</p></b>

                <p>President Trump and administration officials claimed this week that no classified information about war plans was shared with a journalist, despite The Atlantic report that specific plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen were included in a Signal chat the reporter was inexplicably invited to.

The Atlantic initially declined to publish the exact text of the most specific message sent in advance of the bombings but changed course after the Trump administration's denials. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told reporters that "nobody was texting war plans and that’s all I have to say about that." At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that "there was no classified material that was shared in that Signal group."

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said at the same hearing that "my communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information." Trump himself said the information shared was not classified.

"The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump—combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts—have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions," The Atlantic wrote in a follow-up article published today. "There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared."

As previously reported, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz inadvertently invited Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, into a Signal chat that involved Vice President JD Vance and other officials. The chat was for top Trump administration officials to discuss plans for the bombing that ended up going forward on March 15.</p></b>

The DC Circuit Court of Appeals has blocked Apple’s efforts to intervene in the federal antitrust trial against Google that jeopardizes Apple’s lucrative search exclusivity deal, Ars Technica reports. In February, US District Court Judge Amit Mehta had already denied Apple’s request to take a limited role in the remedies phase of the Google Search monopoly hearing.

The latest ruling upholds Judge Mehta’s decision that Apple simply took too long to file its request, according to MediaDailyNews. Apple had filed a motion to intervene in the trial on December 23rd for a case that started in 2020. With Apple’s efforts to protect its search deal with Google hanging in the balance, the company will have to settle for briefs outside the hearing to share its concerns. The arrangement in which Apple continues to set Google as the default search engine on iPhones was reportedly worth $18 billion in 2021 and $20 billion in 2022. At the judge’s order on Apple’s motion in January, Google had not taken a position on whether Apple should participate.

One of Apple’s concerns mentioned in its motion to intervene in December was that it didn’t want to lose the ability to “reach other arrangements with Google.” However, earlier this month, the Justice Department made changes to the proposed final judgment that include letting Google pay Apple for services that aren’t related to search.

The Department of Justice won its antitrust case against Google last year, finding the company maintains a monopoly on search and advertising. Now, the court is about to determine remedies against Google, which includes the DOJ’s recommendation that the company divest from its Chrome browser and make changes to its Android business.</p></b>

                <p>Is this the end of the videos of a handful of seconds? According to the figures of a recent report signed Buffer: Yes! The way we consume videos is evolving. The ideal duration was in the past between 60 and 90 seconds, but the platforms are now turning to even longer clips, in order to arouse more commitment. Instagram and YouTube extended the duration of real reals and shorts, and the trend is confirmed on Tiktok.

According to Buffer, "Tiktok videos of more than a minute benefit from a viewing time 63.8 % greater than that of videos from 30 to 60 seconds." Users now seem to take the time to look at clips. In short, the scope is significantly higher and the viewing time progresses.

For applications like Tiktok, this is clearly a good thing. If the videos last longer, that Internet users are more attentive and more committed, it means that they spend more time on the social network. However, it should not be generalized and reduce the success of content simply to its duration.

Despite the obvious success of so -called "long" videos, Buffer's study allows you to recall what works on Tiktok:

Very short videos are always common, but commitment is limited. Today, 22.2% of videos last between 5 and 10 seconds for an average viewing duration of 3.1 seconds. In other words, short contents do not often pay attention.

Videos of 30 to 60 seconds combine scope and commitment. Currently, this represents more than a third of the videos (33.7%). The average viewing duration then increases to 6.9 seconds; Which leaves a little more time to get a message across. Among content creators, this is a much appreciated format, because it offers enough time to present and develop an idea without making too heavy shooting. This is enough to have a real added value and short enough to be consumed during a short break.

Long videos have the most views and the best range. In the study carried out, only 12% of videos analyzed lasted between 1 and 10 minutes. But, for these, the average viewing duration increased to 11.3 seconds.

In short, whatever the duration, we especially remember that the spectator must remain attentive. Admittedly, the algorithm will prefer to push long content, but, to be captivating, the latter require more efforts; Whether it's narration, sound quality or images.

Opture for longer content is therefore an interesting choice that will eventually bear fruit. On the other hand, you must have in mind that the work to be done will be more substantial. Once again, success is not limited to duration. It is important to have a grip from the first seconds, an interesting subject, reminders, a rhythmic and effective montage, clear and neat legends, without forgetting to bring something to the spectator: entertainment, information, tutorials ... Last size detail, the regularity of publications is also very important to gain the confidence of your audience, and not get your place.</p></b>

Google is fundamentally changing the way it develops future versions of the Android, shifting the process significantly to in-house development branches.

Previously, most of the development on Android was achieved by periodic updates to the public Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repositories. Under the new arrangement, all development on Android will now be taking place within Google's internal infrastructure. These internal branches are available only to Google employees and partner companies with Google Mobile Services (GMS) licenses, such as Samsung and Motorola.

Google explained that the reason for this change is to streamline development workflow and simplify software releases. This is a continuation of a recent trend towards trunk-based development. The company stated how much work it took to maintain synchronization between the internal development branches and public AOSP branches, which would diverge on features and API support. Merging development should rid them of these complexities.

Despite this shift at the stage of active development, Google restated its commitment to open source. It continues to commit itself to publishing the final source code for subsequent Android releases to AOSP upon completion of development and preparation of the version for release, upholding the open-source nature of the finished product.

This change extends to all aspects of Android development. Some technologies, such as Bluetooth and the kernel, will also be developed within the internal system now.

Google will likely announce more about this change to the development process in the near future, with the changes potentially going into effect within a week.

                <p>What you need to know

Google reportedly "confirmed" to a publication that it will move to "privately" develop its Android OS and slow down its AOSP releases.

The main purpose of this is to "streamline" its process, as Google won't have to worry about "merging conflicts" with the AOSP as often.

Google is still expected to release its open source code on the AOSP as usual, but with a small change to its cadence.

Android 16 recently achieved Platform Stability ahead of its expected Q2 2025 launch.

A curious report on the future development plans of Android from Google has surfaced, detailing its potential impact.

A report by Mishaal Rahman (Android Authority) supposedly "confirms" Google will shift to privately developing the Android OS as soon as "next week." The claim that Google's audible to a "private" focus only seems to facilitate a more "streamlined" approach to its OS development. According to Rahman, this more privatized way of developing Android will have a "minimal" impact for end-users who await these updates once completed.

Additionally, developers, both those who create custom ROMs and others who contribute to the AOSP, will also see little impact.

Rahman claims this change will more directly impact Google and the AOSP (Android Open-Source Project). The company will allegedly "change the frequency of public source code releases for specific Android components." Rahman states that, with Google's normal public source code releases for the AOSP, the company needs to "spend time and effort merging patches."

The "merging" part is key as Rahman states conflict often arises between the two branches and the involved code. To avoid getting too technical, Google is required to patch these issues between its internal branch and the AOSP through its normal public source releases. Making its development more private will slow things down to help this happen less often.

Rahman alleges nothing will change for developers looking forward to Android 16 as its open source code will see an expected release when it's ready. This makes sense as the entire purpose of the AOSP is for other developers to create their Android OS skins, like One UI from Samsung. However, since Google may take Android's software behind closed doors for longer (and more often), tipsters/leakers could find it harder to see what's coming.

Nothing has been directly confirmed yet from Google. The report alleges the company will make an official statement about this development change "later this week," so we'll see what happens.

In other news, Android 16 recently achieved an important milestone: Platform Stability. Beta 3 rolled out for enrolled Pixels, bringing with it additional accessibility tools for low-vision users via Text Outline. The patch also includes "Local Network Protection," which lets users control what apps can access their device. Platform Stability is the last step before Android 16's grand rollout for users.

This step should consume the rest of March and April before the software drops in Q2 2025.</p></b>

The public relations representative's comments are as follows:

"Our vehicles use Soracom Co., Ltd.'s communication services, and this incident is due to the company's communication failure. Soracom is currently investigating the cause of the communication failure, but we will also cooperate fully and strive to restore the service as soon as possible," the person in charge.

LUUP uses SORACOM's IoT data communication service "SORACOM Air for Cellular" for remote control of vehicles. The service experienced a communication failure from around 7:42am on March 26th, the same time as the LUUP failure, and is still ongoing.

In an interview at 3pm, LUUP said, "We were unable to say for sure (whether SORACOM was the cause) and are currently investigating," but then commented to the CNET editorial department that "the cause has been confirmed."

                <p>The 19-year-old DOGE staffer known as “Big Balls” online, whose grandfather was a KGB spy, reportedly ran tech support for a cybercrime ring before taking his job in Washington.

Big Balls’ real name is Edward Coristine and, according to Reuters, he ran a company called DiamondCDN in 2022 while he was still in high school. DiamondCDN’s website is now defunct, but the Internet Archive has a copy. The service purported to protect clients from Distributed Denial of Service attacks and claimed to have a “near instant reaction” when such attacks happened.

Wired and Krebs on Security had previously reported on Coristine’s connection to DiamondCDN, but Reuters has more details. One of DiamondCDN’s clients was a cybercrime ring called EGodly. On Telegram, EGodly bragged about cryptocurrency theft, hijacking phone numbers, and doxxing an FBI agent. It even made prank phone calls to the FBI agent and posted audio of it on Telegram.

In another post on Telegram, EGodly thanked Coristine’s DiamondCDN for its services. “We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website,” EGodly said in a post on Telegram, according to Reuters.

Coristine had previously been linked to “The Com” by Krebs on Security. The Com is a nebulous label for a disorganized and decentralized digital youth criminal movement that organizes on Discord and Telegram. The Com isn’t one specific group, it’s more of a cultural movement.

Reuters did not explicitly link EGodly and DiamondCDN to The Com, but the activities described match previous reporting about how they operate. EGodly allegedly posted a video shot from inside a car of someone driving by the FBI agent’s house while screaming “EGodly says you’re a bitch” out of the window. In the world of The Com, participants tend to commit digital crimes and then brag about them in Discord and Telegram groups. Doxxing enemies and making obscene phone calls are common.

Krebs on Security and Wired have both written about DiamondCDN and its connection to the online criminal underground before. When Coristine was 16, he founded a company called Tesla.Sexy LLC which controls dozens of web domains, including some that are registered in Russia. The links between Coristine and known criminal gangs are numerous and complicated. The Reuters story just details the latest one.

Com-related violence isn’t limited to verbal and digital harassment. 404 Media has reported about how members of The Com film themselves attacking the homes of rivals. Sometimes it’s as simple as throwing a brick through a window, but other times they’ve shot at buildings with handguns.

To be clear, Edward “Big Balls” Coristine has not been accused of street violence. But he does have a lot of connections with the culture, communities, and companies who participate in digital crime and commit street violence.

Elon Musk defended Coristine in a post on X last month. “Big Balls is awesome 😎,” he said.</p></b>

                <p>From the beginning of President Donald Trump’s administration, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had a plan to monitor USAID payments and was preparing to use US Treasury Department systems to halt them, according to new court documents, emails, and affidavits obtained by WIRED.

Court documents in Alliance for Retired Americans et al v. Bessent et al and American Federation of Teachers et al v. Bessent et al reveal the extent of DOGE’s penetration into the most sensitive systems at the Treasury, including the Bureau of Fiscal Service (BFS), and what exactly DOGE was hoping to accomplish. The bureau is nested within the US Treasury and handles most federal payments, to the tune of more than $5 trillion a year.

WIRED first reported that Marko Elez, a former engineer at X, the social media company owned by Musk, had read/write access to two BFS systems: the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) and Secure Payment System (SPS). But documents now reveal that Elez also had “read” access to Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP), an accounting system where federal funds are stored in pre-authorized accounts. Court documents shared by the government reveal Elez had access as of February 1.

From court filings, it appears this access was in service of the administration’s plans to target USAID.

USAID was one of the earliest targets of DOGE and the Trump administration. Less than two weeks after Trump’s inauguration, the majority of the agency’s staff were placed on administrative leave, and funding to many partner organizations was cut off. The documents appear to show how plans were in place for this sudden strangulation in payments to happen.

In a January 26 email between Matthew Garber, a top Treasury official, and the Treasury secretary’s chief of staff, Garber outlined the new administration’s plan to utilize BFS access to halt payments to USAID.

“Fiscal will intercept USAID payments files prior to ingestion into our PAM/SPS systems (this is in place now and can begin immediately),” Garber wrote. “We developed a process to intercept the file, and additional flags to ensure we catch all USAID payment requests through our systems.” (This email chain was included as part of documents shared in the Alliance for Retired Americans lawsuit.)

“Fiscal will manually pull an unredacted and unmodified copy to share with State officials,” Garber continued, outlining plans from his team. "State officials will review and provide a determination to Fiscal on whether or not to release the file into our normal payment processes.”

A top Treasury official’s calendar shows that a few days later, Elez arrived in Kansas City, one of the main BFS sites, and had a full docket of meet and greets and several deep dives with the teams responsible for each of the systems. The plan was for Elez to spend the next month at the facility to identify “opportunities to advance payment integrity and fraud reduction goals.” According to a planning sheet, which was also shared with the court, “only (1) individual (i.e. the designated technical team member)”—which was Elez—“requires access to Fiscal Service systems and data at this time.”</p></b>

                <p>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.

Canon has announced an updated version of its EOS R50 with improved video capabilities, a smaller body, and a cheaper price tag — thanks in part to losing an electronic viewfinder. The original, which launched in 2023, was an entry-level mirrorless camera with 4K video capabilities that maxed out at 30fps. The new EOS R50 V bumps that to 4K at 60fps and borrows some features from the video-focused PowerShot V1 point-and-shoot Canon announced in February.

The Canon EOS R50 V will be available sometime in April at $649.99 (the original debuted at $680) for the camera body alone. It will also be sold in an $849.99 bundle that includes Canon’s new RF-S14-30mm F4-6.3 lens featuring optical image stabilization and powered zoom capabilities controlled by a ring instead of a button or a lever. Canon says the use of a ring makes it easier to smoothly control the lens’s zoom, whether using the camera in portrait or landscape modes or while shooting selfie videos.

The camera features the same 24.2-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor as the original EOS R50 and uses Canon’s Dual Pixel AF II system with focus breathing compensation that can also be found on the EOS R6 Mark II and the PowerShot V1. New video recording modes include options for slow or fast shutters depending on the type of action being captured. There’s also a video mode with electronic stabilization to smooth out footage captured while the camera is moving, but there’s still no in-body image stabilization.

Where the EOS R50 V differs from its predecessor is a complete lack of a built-in flash and no electronic viewfinder. Framing shots is all done either on an external screen or using the three-inch articulated touchscreen on the back of the camera. The EOS R50 V is also much easier to use in either vertical or landscape modes thanks to a redesigned grip, an additional tripod screw mount on the side of the camera, and a second video record button on the front.

The EOS R50 V adds a dedicated livestreaming button that can be used to quickly access four different modes. Image: Canon

Four different livestreaming modes are supported, accessible through a dedicated button, including HDMI and support for Canon’s Camera Connect and Switcher Mobile apps. Although the EOS R50 V may seem like an affordable cinema camera solution for filmmakers, its somewhat limited capabilities make it better suited for video content creators looking for an upgrade to the PowerShot V1 that will let them swap lenses.

Alongside today’s EOS R50 V news, Canon has also announced global availability for the PowerShot V1. The point-and-shoot was initially announced in February 2025 with a late April launch for a limited number of countries including Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Canon says that same shipping timeline will now include the US, with the camera priced at $899.99.</p></b>

                <p>SpaceX is gearing up for one of its most unique missions yet, launching four private astronauts into polar orbit to observe the planet’s most remote regions from above.

The Fram2 mission, named in honor of the original ship that reached both Earth’s Arctic and Antarctic regions, is set for launch no earlier than Monday, March 31 at 11:20 p.m. ET. The mission will venture out where no other human spaceflight mission has gone before, flying over the planet’s polar regions at an altitude of around 265 to 280 miles (425 to 450 kilometers) above the ground.

A four-person crew will ride on board a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Chun Wang of Malta, who founded the Bitcoin mining companies f2pool and stakefish, is leading Fram2 and is reportedly funding the mission. The remaining crew includes Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer; Eric Philips, an Australian polar adventurer; and Rabea Rogge, a German robotics researcher. Despite their eclectic backgrounds, the private astronauts are all first-timers when it comes to spaceflight.

The crew will be the first astronauts to orbit over Earth’s poles, following a trajectory no human mission has attempted before. “This new flight trajectory will unlock new possibilities for human spaceflight and provide a deeper understanding about our planet and its polar regions,” a Fram2 news release read, according to Florida Today. “With the exception of the Apollo lunar missions, the North and South Poles have not been fully visible to other astronauts in orbit, including those onboard the International Space Station.”

The four astronauts will spend three to five days on board SpaceX’s Dragon crew spacecraft, gazing down from a polar orbit at an inclination of about 60 to 90 degrees to the equator. From their unique vantage point, the crew will study the aurora-like phenomenon known as STEVE (Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement), known for its hazy purple and green streaks across the sky.

The mission will also include an experiment that will attempt to grow mushrooms in space. Launched by the Australian firm FOODiQ Global, the research payload will aim to grow a crop of oyster mushrooms in microgravity as a way to provide nutrition for future human missions to the Moon and Mars, The Guardian reported.

SpaceX continues to push the limits of private spaceflight. Its last private mission, Polaris Dawn, pulled off the first commercial spacewalk in history, with two astronauts venturing outside of the Dragon vehicle and into the vacuum of space.

Fram2 carries its own set of risks. Polar orbits are generally used by Earth-observing satellites and reconnaissance missions. The orbital path of the ISS passes over 90% of the Earth, with the exception of latitudes north of 51.6 degrees in the northern hemisphere, or south of 51.6 degrees in the southern hemisphere. Flying through the polar region, however, is generally avoided in spaceflight due to the higher-than-usual radiation exposure, including the risks associated with increased auroral activity, according to NASA.

Fingers are crossed that the crew of four amateur astronauts can pull off a successful mission over Earth’s poles.</p></b>

                <p>There's a new "exciting, small EV" on the way, to be launched early next year by Also, a spinoff of the electric vehicle maker Rivian. Details are light on exactly what that product will be, but don't go expecting a $20,000 electric hatchback or the like—think more like an e-bike. Also will be into micromobility, not competing with Mini or Smart.

Also started out as an internal project to see if Rivian could use its knowledge of electric powertrains, vehicle electronics, and software to build other "small vehicle form factors." In fact, in 2023, news broke of a Rivian e-bike in the works at Rivian, although it was unclear if it would be something with pedals or more like an electric motorcycle.

Things are still rather vague. Also's announcement says its "flagship product" will launch in early 2026 and that the company will focus on the US and Europe at first. It will build "an exciting range of electric vehicles that are efficient, sustainable, and delightful to use," using in-house technology.

But Rivian founder RJ Scaringe told TechCrunch that "there’s a seat, and there’s two wheels, there’s a screen, and there’s a few computers and a battery."

Since Also doesn't have the cost of having to buy that tech like most e-bike makers do, it may be able to make its products a lot cheaper.

Also will be independent of Rivian, but Rivian will own a minority stake in the startup, which is also being financed by Eclipse, a venture capital company. Scaringe will be a board member, but Chris Yu, Rivian's former VP of future programs, will be Also's president.</p></b>

                <p>If you don't already own one of the best budget 3D printers, Amazon's Big Spring Sale presents you with an opportunity. Elegoo, which makes some really great, low-cost 3D printers, has two models on sale: the Neptune 3 Pro for $209 and the Neptune 4 Pro for $284.

The main difference between these two models is that the Neptune 4 Pro is a lot faster, clocking in at up to 500 mm/s while the Neptune 3 Pro is an older-gen model that still offers excellent quality but at last-gen speeds (maybe 2 to 3x slower). If you're just getting started with 3D printing, it's a good choice. One of our editors has the Neptune 3 Pro and has found it to be an excellent all-rounder.

Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro: was $249, now $209 at Amazon

This open-framed FDM printer has a build volume of 225 x 225 x 280mm and a dual-gear direct drive extruder that makes it easy to work with lots of different materials and avoid jams.

Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro: was $359, now $284 at Amazon

This bed-slinger style printer has direct drive and speeds of up to 500 mm/s.

When we reviewed the Neptune 3 Pro back in 2022, we praised the printer for its auto-leveling, direct drive and quiet operation. It was also very easy to assemble and get started with.

The direct drive allows it to handle even difficult-to-use filaments such as TPU (a rubbery filament). We printed a Christmas tree using TPU and it came out smoothly in 4 hours and 40 minutes.

We reviewed the Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro when it came out in 2023 . We praised its quality and how fast it was. For example, it printed a Benchy (this boat) in just 18 minutes.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The Neptune 4 Pro has a speed advantage over the Neptune 3 Pro and this is thanks to a newer Klipper firmware, linear rods instead of v-slot wheels, and a part cooling fan with a "sport" mode designed to rapidly cool filament.

Overall, either Neptune is a good deal. If you can spend the extra money, the Neptune 4 Pro is a bit faster but the Neptune 3 Pro offers similar quality and flexibility at somewhat slower speeds.</p></b>

                <p>How thin it will be iPhone 17 Air? The lot of noise new model should be part of the expected range next September and has already been predicted as the Apple smartphone with the smaller thickness ever. To give comfort to this thesis and to propose a comparison was the well -known Leaker Majin Buon with an image published on X who puts the two cases of the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro side by side, with a difference that immediately jumps to the eye.

iPhone 17 Air is one of the most anticipated Apple novelties of 2025, which should still reserve several ads by the Californian brand. Originally known as iPhone 17 Slim, this model will propose a restyling as it has not been seen since the times of iPhone X, with an ultra -thin profile and a body that will inevitably have less space for the components of the standard models. For this reason, a rather precise count has already been made on the compromises to which you will have to go down, for example sacrificing a single 48 megapixel hybrid megapixel sensor therefore also equipped with 2x zooms as well as for iPhone 16e and eliminating the slot for the Simcard and speaker on the bottom of the device. Below, the image loaded on X by Majin BU which compares the cases for iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro, based on leaked preliminary information.

X Content This Content Can Also BE Viewed on the Site It Origintes from.

The thickness of the iPhone 17 Air should be 5.5 millimeters, which rise to 9.5 mm in correspondence with the back of the rear camera, therefore just above the thickness of iPhone 17 Pro which is equal to 8.725 mm. iPhone 17 Air should mount a 6.6 -inch display and will propose the Magsafe charging technology in contact, also on the side the action button would find space. Still no anticipation on a possible price, which however could be halfway between the standard and pro version.</p></b>

                <p>ROME - What is not yet clear is simple: who spied the director of Fanpage, Francesco Cancellato, using the Graphite software produced by Paragon? Because in the hearing of March 25, the Undersecretary with delegation to the secret services Alfredo Mantovano would have in fact denied the line held until recently by the executive on the turbid affair. Instead, it would be acclaimed that the Mediterranean NGO, and in particular its activists Luca Casarini, Beppe Caccia and Don Mattia Ferrari, was spied on by the secret services on the mandate of the Meloni government.

But according to what Wired he was able to learn from environments close to Copasir, the parliamentary control committee on secret services, we are very close to another certainty: that is, the involvement in the operation of public security apparatuses. The castle begins to creak, one piece at a time: and it is a bomb that can drop the Meloni government. If only the steaming gun is located.

Paragon, what he still does not come back

Of course, the clues are several and converge. The software of Israeli society is only sold to governments, their security apparatuses, or to agencies accredited by these, not to private subjects, less than never to individual citizens. On those who acquired licenses to access the software cloud in Italy, a convincing explanation has never been provided. And not only that: there are many, too many, the gears of the executive who - must be remembered - has postponed the story to the Parliamentary Committee for the security of the Republic where there are no opposition forces and above all the auditions are covered by secret, under penalty of seven years of imprisonment for the parliamentarians who report the contents of the auditions.

Not to mention the fact that the erased journalist is unveiled to the government for his investigations on young people from Fratelli d’Italia. His obviously represents the most controversial case of the story and not surprisingly, on his involvement, the prosecutors of Naples, Rome, Venice, Bologna and Palermo are investigating. Because, in essence, if Mediterranean activists could somehow be secondary figures in an investigation aimed at intercepting exponents of dangerous organizations for national security (hypothesis, however, to be demonstrated and which would not just justify the use of the spyware, which in fact was stopped by Paragon), control over the canceled mobile phone would have no legitimate justification and could even appear a violation of the constitutional dictates. It is clear that the executive continues to deny an involvement: an admission would mark the end of the period that began in 2022 and went on - against the expectations of many - to date.

Luca Casarini and Beppe Caccia were spied on by theise with the paragon software

Meanwhile, the Mediterranean NGO with a note returns to the matter.

"The Undersecretary for the Prime Minister - reads a released press release after the hearing of Mantuan - admitted that Mediterranea and its activists were spied on by the secret services with the Military Software Paragon Graphite because they are considered danger to national security".

The reason for the intrusion into their smartphones would be linked precisely to the organization's activity, which operates on the Libyan route to save men, women and children who are left at sea by Libyan traffickers. The use of the Graphite software would have been authorized by the Aise (the government agency information and external security) and by the Prosecutor General of Rome, Jimmy Amato. The Aise, reads still in the press release issued by Mediterranea, would be the same body of the secret services that manages relationships with the Libyan security forces and this recalls another story that has seen the government accused of a political use of the systems related to security, that of the release of the Libyan criminal Almasri.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>We’ve reached a new frontier in organ transplantation. In a medical first, scientists announced this week that they successfully kept a genetically modified pig liver functioning inside a human body—at least for a short while.

Researchers in China detailed their groundbreaking accomplishment in a study published today in Nature. They transplanted the liver into a brain-dead recipient, where it was able to survive and even perform some basic functions for over a week. The findings are the latest to suggest that animal-to-human transplantation, or xenotransplantation, can someday become a viable option for the many people in need of donated organs.

There are over 100,000 Americans currently on the waiting list for an organ, with a new person added every eight minutes. Yet only 48,000 transplants take place annually, creating a significant shortfall. It’s estimated that 17 people die every day waiting on the transplant list.

Scientists have been exploring various ways to extend the pool of available organs or to lengthen people’s survival while waiting for one, such as artificial devices or xenotransplantation. But it’s only recently that the latter has emerged as a feasible reality, thanks to advances in gene-editing technology.

These advances have made it possible for scientists to create pigs with organs that are more compatible with human biology, thus reducing the chances of rejection. One common edit, for instance, removes a pig’s ability to produce alpha-gal, a sugar that the human body doesn’t make.

As with other early tests of xenotransplantation, the researchers performed the procedure on a brain-dead recipient whose family agreed to help. They transplanted a liver from a Bama miniature pig—a breed that’s commonly used in research—that had six gene edits, while the recipient was given immune-suppressing drugs to prevent rejection. They monitored both recipient and organ for 10 days, terminating the study at the family’s request.

Things appeared to go smoothly during the experiment. The researchers, including a team from Xijing Hospital at Fourth Military Medical University, found no signs of immediate rejection, while the liver remained functional through the entire 10 days. Within two hours of the transplantation, it began to produce bile and maintained acceptable blood flow.

Last year, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania reported that they successfully attached a donor pig liver to a brain-dead recipient via a machine outside the body, keeping the organ alive for three days. But the researchers note that theirs is the first peer-reviewed study to document the bona fide transplantation of a gene-edited pig liver into a person.

“It’s a great achievement,” said study researcher Lin Wang at a press conference held on Tuesday.

That said, we’re still far from seeing pig-derived livers and other organs becoming commonplace. In recent years, scientists have begun to transplant pig kidneys and hearts as a last resort treatment for otherwise terminally ill recipients. But only two recipients are still alive, with 53-year-old Towana Looney currently being the longest-living recipient at roughly four months (she received a pig kidney transplant in late November 2024). Larger clinical trials are expected to start very soon, but even if successful, outside scientists have cautioned that it may take a long time before animal-derived organs can approach the survivability of human donated organs.

Still, xenotransplantation could become an important option even before that lofty goal is achieved. The scientists note that the recipient’s own liver remained intact the entire time. So it’s possible that gene-edited pig organs could be used as a sort of bridging therapy for people on the transplant waiting list or for people whose organs need time to recover before becoming functional again.</p></b>

                <p>More than 140,000 cloud tenants potentially compromised. Over 6 million sensitive records exposed, including encrypted SSO, LDAP passwords, Java Keystone (JKS) files, and enterprise manager JPS keys.

But the real story of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) breach isn’t about the back-and-forth details or the vulnerability that attackers exploited. It’s how prevalent OCI is and the number of companies who are using the service, whether they know it or not.

Oracle has yet to own up to this incident, as it calls into question the security of their service. But it also raises a far more critical question: how many organizations even know they’re using OCI in the first place?

The answer, for many, is “they don’t.”

Despite OCI holding just 3% of the global cloud market share, it’s surprisingly well-adopted by a wide range of companies. While its footprint is small compared to giants like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, OCI has carved out a niche by catering to enterprises that rely heavily on Oracle’s database products. This tight integration makes it an attractive option. So, while OCI may not dominate in raw market share, its presence across major enterprises—and its strategic use cases—give it a bigger real-world impact than the numbers suggest.

What You Do Next Defines You

These days, security professionals know that breaches are inevitable. What truly matters is how quickly and effectively you respond—especially when vulnerabilities are known and well publicized. In fact, some of the highest-profile breaches were prevented by companies that acted early to avoid becoming victims.

SolarWinds showed us the danger when malicious code is injected into software and the importance of supply chain visibility and security.

Log4J reminded us that even the smallest libraries can expose the largest attack surfaces.

The Snowflake incident revealed just how deep the rabbit hole goes with third-party cloud dependencies.

It’s no different with the recent OCI breach. The challenge isn’t just what happened, but where and how it’s still unfolding and the potentially devastating downstream impact, just as we saw with the other incidents. And just like the other breaches, much of the damage stems from a lack of visibility of what is operating in an organization’s environment and programmatically addressing the risks. But this breach also adds another layer: the credentials that were compromised are encrypted, which means attackers are likely working to decrypt them as we speak, emphasizing a time-sensitive urgency for organizations to take action. Security teams have a small window of opportunity to defuse a ticking time bomb by acting fast, including rotating credentials and enforcing MFA—if you know what tenants exist in the first place.

“Wait, We Use OCI?”

Following the news of the Oracle Cloud breach, Grip engineers looked at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure usage across our customer base and found thousands of unique OCI tenants detected in 41% of our customers.

We share this to illustrate a point. OCI usage extends far and wide, and in most organizations, the security teams are not even aware OCI tenants exist—or catch all of them. Dark Reading reports the companies that may be affected include FedEx, PayPal, Fortinet, and Cloudflare. But even if they know they use OCI, are they aware of all their tenants?

Oracle Cloud offers a free tier, so it’s easy for developers to set up a test account, use it for a while, then the project ends and they forget about it. The situation is more common than you may think, and happens with other cloud services, too. In one case a Grip customer with AWS tenants thought they had 35 tenants, but Grip uncovered 350. That’s the nature of modern cloud infrastructure: it scales fast, spreads quietly, and often slips outside the lines of centralized governance.

That’s what makes responding to these kinds of breaches so difficult. Rogue cloud tenants grow outside the view of security teams, unmonitored, and unmanaged. OCI and other cloud services make this especially easy. Like other modern SaaS platforms, adoption is frictionless. Just sign up, click a few buttons, and you’re off and running. But with the ease of adoption brings risk—especially when a service is breached, because you don’t know how many tenants have been created.

The two primary risks companies must address in the OCI breach are:

Rogue OCI tenants— an account someone created for a project, never shut down, and is unprotected by MFA—a prime target for attackers. Case in point: the Microsoft Midnight Blizzard attack in which an overlooked dev account became an entry point.

Unmanaged or abandoned OCI accounts tied to critical services. According to Grip research, 16% of unused accounts remain connected to core systems, opening the door for attackers to move laterally and access your sensitive data faster.

It’s not just the active OCI accounts you should be worried about, but the ones you don’t know about that can seriously harm your organization. In response to this incident, security experts recommend an all-too familiar playbook: rotate passwords, enable MFA, review access logs. All sensible. All important. But there’s an unspoken assumption baked into those recommendations: that you already know where your Oracle tenants are, and who’s using them. And that’s where the real risk lives—not in the controls you’ve put in place, but in the ones you didn’t know you needed yet.

Grip’s Role: Find and Fix What You Didn’t Know to Look For

What separates a headline from a footnote is how fast you detect and respond. When news of a new security incident breaks, like the Oracle OCI breach, Grip helps security teams act quickly, with clarity. We accelerate your response and shrink the exposure window before it becomes a storyline.

With Grip, you can respond with speed and precision:

Detect all OCI tenants in use and who is using them across your organization in minutes, even the rogue and forgotten accounts that aren’t tied to your IdP or existing controls.

‍

Act immediately using the Grip Policy Center. Automate workflows to enforce password resets or revoke user access and create an alert for your team the moment an incident occurs.

Grip is the difference between a fast, confident response and scrambling to catch up—or worse—seeing your company added to list of devasting losses.

Beyond the Oracle Breach

Unfortunately, cybersecurity today can’t focus only on prevention. Breaches are going to happen. The differentiator now is how quickly you can detect exposure and act with precision. This isn’t just a story about Oracle or another breach headline. It’s an ongoing reminder that security teams are being held responsible for accounts they didn’t approve and often don’t even know exist. But Grip can help solve this challenge and we invite you to discover how. Book a free demo to learn more and find out if the OCI breach impacts your organization.

The company is developing a radical new kind of computer chip that harnesses the thermodynamic fluctuations that naturally occur within electronic circuits—and which are normally a headache for engineers—using them to perform highly efficient calculations with probabilities.

This chip might well find some takers as AI giants search for ever more computer power to build AI models that perform artificial reasoning, and as we all worry about AI’s incredible energy demands.

Extropic has now shared more details of its probabilistic hardware with WIRED, as well as results that show it is on track to build something that could indeed offer an alternative to conventional silicon in many datacenters. The company aims to deliver a chip that is three to four orders of magnitude more efficient than today’s hardware, a feat that would make a sizable dent in future emissions.

I wrote about Extropic’s strange backstory for WIRED’s special issue on the Frontiers of Computing. My piece explores the remarkable technological, political, and cultural currents that led to the company’s founding. But it’s well worth taking a closer look at Extropic’s technology.

A technical document provided to me by Extropic includes a signal from an oscilloscope (an instrument that measures electronic voltage over time) showing a probabilistic bit or p-bit in action. A conventional computer bit is fixed as either a one or a zero. A p-bit has a certain probability of being in either state and the oscilloscope image shows a p-bit flipping between 1 and 0. The crucial thing is that Extropic can control the probability that the bit will be in either state at any point in time. And by engineering interactions between several such p-bits it is possible to perform more complex probabilistic computations.</p></b>

                <p>Thermal Grizzly has updated its WireView Pro GPU with a 90-degree connector design, which effectively transforms this tool into a right-angled adapter. In addition to all the neat monitoring and safety benefits you get, this version alters or, in some cases, simplifies, cable routing, depending on your setup.

The WireView Pro GPU was developed as a collaboration between Elmor Labs and Thermal Grizzly. It's designed as a neat gadget where you can connect your GPU's PCIe power cables to measure and monitor its power consumption and other statistics on the attached OLED screen. The Pro variant carries additional temperature sensors and a connector detector that sounds an audible alarm if either the temperature/current limit is exceeded or if the cable is not seated properly.

One of the major shortcomings of reference model RTX 50 series GPUs is the lack of per-pin current detection. The WireView Pro GPU sadly cannot display amperage readings across each individual pin, unlike certain DIY solutions. In any case, the updated 90° design is available in both "N" and "R" versions, depending on the orientation of your GPU's 12V-2x6 connector. Note that not all GPUs will be compatible (PDF) with the 90-degree version due to variations in cooler sizes and the connector's position.

In addition, the 90 model can be used with vertically mounted GPUs, where, based on your selected variant (N or R), the power cable can be routed toward the motherboard or the side panel. Even if a connector flip changes the display orientation, the configuration menu allows for correction. Since all the power is being drawn through the WireView Pro's connectors, it can heat up quickly. In the case of an RTX 4090 with a 450W TGP, the temperatures on the gadget's PCB can shoot up to 60 degrees Celsius with air-cooling or even 100 degrees Celsius if your card is liquid-cooled.

The included display can show real-time data, such as connector temperatures, temperature from external sensors, power drawn by the GPU in watts, volts, and amperes, the minimum and maximum power draw, average power drawn in the past 60 seconds, and the total energy consumed in watt-hours. Pertinently, this tool only measures power drawn through the connector, excluding the PCIe slot's potential 75W contribution, which could affect your total GPU power readings.

The 90-degree WireView Pro GPU is available at Thermal Grizzly's store, retailing for the same price as its 180-degree counterpart at $73.40. The website's download section contains additional details regarding GPU compatibility and display setup to assist customers.</p></b>

                <p>The relics of Blessed Carlo Acutis, who will become Santo in April, would have been put on sale on the web. On online platforms such as eBay, many sacred memorabilia would be dedicated to what has been renamed the "patron of the internet", with very high offers: the highest exceeds two thousand euros. To report the incident the bishop of the diocese of Assisi - Nocera Umbra - Gualdo Tadino, Monsignor Domenico Sorrentino, who filed a complaint against unknown persons after having become aware of the objects attributed to the future saint, whose body is kept in the sanctuary of the undressing. The prosecutor of Perugia led by Raffaele Cantone who immediately started the investigations.

Sacred objects for sale

A series of objects auctioned by one or more anonymous sellers have started to fill the pages of the purchase platforms, probably taking advantage of the wave of the faithful who are preparing for the canonization ceremony of Acutis, which will be proclaimed Saint by Pope Francis between 25 and 27 April on the occasion of the Jubilee of teenagers. On the net it would be put up for sale ** "Relic reliquary" ** by Blessed Carlo Acutis "ex capillis with certificate" reads in the announcement that expires on Wednesday: we would therefore be faced with a strand of hair of the future saint who could benefit the seller very high figures. As mentioned, in fact, the highest offer was more than 2,000 euros. For a few days, however, there are not only the relics of Carlo Acutis: other dozens of similar offers have offered possible buyers relics of Saints, including St. Francis of Assisi. The offer, at the moment, seems to have been removed but, in parallel, others linked to other saints would be appearing.

The sale of relics, admitted in the past, is prohibited by canon law, as confirmed by fee 1190 of the ecclesiastical law. In addition, from December 2017, the Church has established new rules regarding the custody, care, transport and authentication of the relics of Servants of God, blessed and saints by an education of the congregation of the causes of the saints entitled The relics in the Church: authenticity and conservation that sanctions the absolute ban for "the trade and sale of the relics, as well as their exposure in profane or unauthorized places".</p></b>

                <p>We’ve had rumors, we’ve had trade reports, we’ve had enough speculation for years that Marvel would be trying to pull off the impossible to get people amped up for its next set of Avengers films. And now, it’s doing so by assembling quite the roster of familiar names.

In a live stream today, Marvel teased a huge amount of upcoming talent to announce Avengers: Doomsday entering production, by tantalizingly laying out director’s chairs with star names on the back, in a long line. A very long line.

The stream concluded after nearly five and a half hours with a brief appearance by Robert Downey Jr., but if you don’t want to watch five and a half hours of chairs, here’s the full list of everyone announced today.

Chris Hemsworth

Vanessa Kirby

Anthony Mackie

Sebastian Stan

Letitia Wright

Paul Rudd

Wyatt Russell

Tenoch Huerta Mejia

Ebon Moss-Bachrach

Simu Liu

Florence Pugh

Kelsey Grammer

Lewis Pullman

Danny Ramirez

Joseph Quinn

David Harbour

Winston Duke

Hannah John-Kamen

Tom Hiddleston

Patrick Stewart

Ian McKellen

Alan Cumming

Rebecca Romijn

James Marsden

Channing Tatum

Pedro Pascal

Robert Downey Jr.

No characters were confirmed yet, of course—there’s every chance that some familiar faces could pull a Robert Downey Jr. and be playing other famous Marvel characters from across the multiverse, rather than their established roles.

There’s also some very interesting absent names here. Of the many returning Fox X-Men stars, there’s no Famke Janssen or Halle Berry as Jean Grey or Storm, and there’s no Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds as Wolverine or Deadpool. Only Hemsworth and Downey are returning of the original Avengers cast, and presumably only one of them is an Avenger this time around. There’s also no Captain Marvel (or Ms. Marvel, or any of the Young Avengers introduced so far), no resurrected Scarlet Witch, no Spider-Man, no Guardians of the Galaxy. And no Doctor Strange, despite Benedict Cumberbatch’s recent commentary. Perhaps the brothers Russo are saving some heavy hitters for Avengers: Secret Wars.

But suffice to say, regardless of whoever’s in or not in, it seems like the House of Ideas is very keen on upping the ante the from the last time it ruled the box office in Avengers: Endgame. After a long streak of uneven output since, can they do so? This growing list of names certainly indicates that they hope so.

We’ll bring you more on Marvel’s plans for Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars as and when we learn them.

Update, March 25, 7 p.m.: Marvel has hinted on its own Instagram post that this isn’t even everyone in the cast, thanks to a cheeky exchange with Downey in the comments.

Downey wrote: “That’s what u call a deep bench of talent… actually it’s more like a row, but an extra long one… That must be it… right?” Marvel replied: “there’s always room for more…”</p></b>

                <p>Just a few months after releasing its first Gemini 2.0 AI models, Google is upgrading again. The company says the new Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is its "most intelligent" model yet, offering a massive context window, multimodality, and reasoning capabilities. Google points to a raft of benchmarks that show the new Gemini clobbering other large language models (LLMs), and our testing seems to back that up—Gemini 2.5 Pro is one of the most impressive generative AI models we've seen.

Gemini 2.5, like all Google's models going forward, has reasoning built in. The AI essentially fact-checks itself along the way to generating an output. We like to call this "simulated reasoning," as there's no evidence that this process is akin to human reasoning. However, it can go a long way to improving LLM outputs. Google specifically cites the model's "agentic" coding capabilities as a beneficiary of this process. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental can, for example, generate a full working video game from a single prompt. We've tested this, and it works with the publicly available version of the model.

Gemini 2.5 Pro builds a game in one step.

Google says a lot of things about Gemini 2.5 Pro; it's smarter, it's context-aware, it thinks—but it's hard to quantify what constitutes improvement in generative AI bots. There are some clear technical upsides, though. Gemini 2.5 Pro comes with a 1 million token context window, which is common for the big Gemini models but massive compared to competing models like OpenAI GPT or Anthropic Claude. You could feed multiple very long books to Gemini 2.5 Pro in a single prompt, and the output maxes out at 64,000 tokens. That's the same as Flash 2.0, but it's still objectively a lot of tokens compared to other LLMs.

Naturally, Google has run Gemini 2.5 Experimental through a battery of benchmarks, in which it scores a bit higher than other AI systems. For example, it squeaks past OpenAI's o3-mini in GPQA and AIME 2025, which measure how well the AI answers complex questions about science and math, respectively. It also set a new record in the Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark, which consists of 3,000 questions curated by domain experts. Google's new AI managed a score of 18.8 percent to OpenAI's 14 percent.</p></b>

                <p>For the first time, Tesla loses the primacy of leaders by turnover in the electric cars sector. In 2024, the Chinese Giant Byd recorded revenues for 107 billion dollars, exceeding 97.7 billion in the American car manufacturer and becoming the sixth world manufacturer for sales volume, in front of Honda. The overtaking takes place at a crucial moment for the market: the European Union has set the stop to the sales of petrol and diesel cars at 2035, while the United Kingdom anticipated the deadline for 2030 and California at 2035. The electric vehicles sector, driven by these measures, recorded a 50% growth in 2024, with 1.2 million units sold globally (a quarter of which in China). In this scenario the Shenzhen company has been able to conquer the global market with a strategy that combines affordable prices and technological innovation, elements that had marked the initial success of Tesla but which now has to face increasingly fierce competition.

The Chinese strategy

Byd's primacy is based on a different business model than Tesla's. The American company only sells fully electric cars, while the Chinese house offers both pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, thus answering a wider demand for consumers. In 2024, Byd sold 4.3 million vehicles a total of 1.76 million fully electric compared to the 1.79 million Tesla. The accessible prices represent another decisive strength in the byd strategy. The new Qin L model, recently launched by the car manufacturer, has a starting price of 119,800 yuan in China (about 15 thousand euros), less than half of the 235,500 Yuan (about 30 thousand euros) of the Tesla model 3. This strategy proved to be particularly effective in a period in which Chinese consumers reduce expenses due to the country's economic difficulties, including the real estate crisis and the slowdown of growth.

On the innovation front, Byd is no less than the American rival. The Chinese company, for example, has presented a charging technology called "Super E-Platform" which promises to recharge an electric car in just 5 minutes, three times faster than the 15 minutes needed with the Tesla Superchger system. In addition, in February 2025 he launched the advanced guide assistance system called "God's Eye", which includes autonomous overtaking features and other semi-automatic driving characteristics, offered free of charge on all models in the range. A strategy opposite to that of Tesla, which for its "Full Self-Driving" system requires about 8 thousand additional dollars compared to the base price of the vehicle.

The global challenge

Byd's success has translated into impressive financial results. In addition to the record turnover, the company has recorded a net profit of 5.6 billion dollars, growing by 34% compared to the previous year. Investors have rewarded this performance, raising the value of the shares of 51% in the last year. However, Tesla still maintains a significant advantage in terms of market value: 800 billion dollars against 157 billion byd. Also as regards the actual profits, despite the lower turnover, Musk's company manages to earn more: 7 billion dollars of profit in 2024 against 5.6 billion byd, although Tesla's profits are 53% decreasing compared to the previous year. This indicates greater efficiency of the American business model, which converts a higher percentage of revenues in net gains.

The battle between the two giants is moving more and more internationally. Byd is present in over 70 countries but remains excluded from the US market due to 100% duties imposed by the Biden Administration on Chinese electric vehicles. In Europe, however, the Chinese company is accelerating its expansion, focusing on the combination of competitive prices and advanced technology. President Wang Chuanfu also announced his intention to build 4 thousand charging stations, although without specifying timing, to compete with the over 2 thousand Tesla stations already present in China.</p></b>

                <p>Being Red Bull Racing 1 teammates with Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen is a hard ask. The Dutch driver took his fourth consecutive world championship last year, dominating the sport to such an extent that he led the points table across a 63-race, 1,029-day streak that only ended with McLaren and Lando Norris' victory in Australia earlier this month. Now we believe he's going to have his second teammate of the year, after just two races, as Red Bull gets ready to drop Liam Lawson for Yuki Tsunoda.

For three of its championship years, Red Bull built the fastest car in F1, and Verstappen's teammate Sergio Perez scored race wins and plenty of points to help the team secure the constructors championships in 2021, 2022, and 2023. But Red Bulls' designers have been evolving a concept that even its former design boss Adrian Newey thinks is flawed, and in 2024, we saw Perez' form evaporate after the first handful of races that year.

Verstappen was able to fight for the title thanks to his considerable skill in the car. But the team lost out to both McLaren and Ferrari in the constructors' standings, something that will have had a very considerable impact upon the end-of-year bonuses for Red Bull's hundreds of employees.

Red Bull spent the second half of last year vacillating over whether to allow Perez to finish out the year. At one point, it hoped the fan-favorite Daniel Ricciardo could return after a spell of reputation rehabilitation at Red Bull's junior squad (currently known as the Racing Bulls). Ricciardo was with Red Bull from 2014 to 2017 and for some of that time was probably the fastest man in F1.</p></b>

                <p>The U.S. government on Wednesday added 80 entities to the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List, reports the New York Times. The expansion of the list is designed to prevent or slow down the use of American technologies in China to improve its economic and military capabilities, and closes a critical loophole that allowed subsidiaries to dodge sanctions. China's advancements in AI, exascale supercomputing, quantum computing technology, and hypersonic weapons are named the main points of concern, reports Nikkei.

The U.S. Department of Commerce's BIS has added 80 new organizations from China, Taiwan, the UAE, South Africa, Iran, and other countries to the Entity List for actions it deemed harmful to U.S. national security and foreign policy. Twelve organizations (11 in China, one in Taiwan) were involved in AI and supercomputing tied to China's military. Seven Chinese entities were involved in quantum tech development for military use, and two Chinese companies supplied restricted components to blacklisted Huawei and HiSilicon, according to the BIS. Other entities assisted China's military and nuclear programs in one way or another, or supplied U.S. parts to China or Iran.

Perhaps the most noteworthy additions to the Entity List are six Inspur subsidiaries, including those that were used to bypass the U.S. sanctions against the parent company that were imposed in 2023. Among the six entities added, one is Inspur Taiwan, and another is Inspur Software. BIS alleges that Inspur — which is the largest server maker in China — illegally obtained restricted hardware developed by U.S. companies to build servers for its customers in China, including clients tied to the People's Liberation Army. The alleged operations were significant enough for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, one of the largest makers of servers, to start a legal battle against Inspur Group, alleging server patent infringements and violating U.S. sanctions.

In addition, Henan Dingxin Information Industry, Nettrix Information Industry, Suma Technology, and Suma-USI Electronics were added to the U.S. Entity List for supporting the development of exascale supercomputers. Specifically, these companies supplied hardware from Intel and Nvidia, software from Microsoft, and manufacturing capabilities to Sugon (Dawning Information Industry), a previously blacklisted supercomputer maker tied to China's defense modernization. Essentially, these companies facilitated hardware and infrastructure essential for HPC and highly accurate large-scale simulations that are usually used for development of aircraft, rockets, and other weapons of mass destruction.

Finally, the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence and Beijing Innovation Wisdom Technology were added to the U.S. Entity List for their involvement in developing AI models and advanced computing chips intended for Chinese military use. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, both entities were identified as working to acquire and apply American technology to advance China's defense modernization.

"American technology should never be used against the American people," said Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Jeffrey I. Kessler. "BIS is sending a clear, resounding message that the Trump administration will work tirelessly to safeguard our national security by preventing U.S. technologies and goods from being misused for high performance computing, hypersonic missiles, military aircraft training, and UAVs that threaten our national security,” said Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Jeffrey I. Kessler. “The Entity List is one of many powerful tools at our disposal to identify and cut off foreign adversaries seeking to exploit American technology for malign purposes."</p></b>

                <p>In just the last couple of years, scientists have found microplastics in disturbing places, from beneath Arctic ice to human blood, testicles, and even brains. In fact, plastic is so widespread that it has triggered a new geological epoch. Now, researchers have added chewing gum to the growing list of products that expose humans to microplastics.

A team of researchers has revealed that chewing a single stick of gum can release hundreds to thousands of microplastics into our saliva—meaning it most likely gets ingested. The researchers presented the pilot study at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS) on Tuesday.

“Our goal is not to alarm anybody,” Sanjay Mohanty, an engineer at the University of California, Los Angeles, who participated in the research, said in an ACS statement. “Scientists don’t know if microplastics are unsafe to us or not. There are no human trials. But we know we are exposed to plastics in everyday life, and that’s what we wanted to examine here.” While more research is needed, it’s worth noting that previous studies have already linked microplastics to health complications.

Scientists have previously estimated that people ingest at least 50,000 microplastics a year. Given this evaluation, Mohanty and his colleagues decided to investigate the amount of microplastics that’s being released by chewing gum. They tested 10 commercially available brands: five synthetic gums and five natural gums. To avoid having to consider different salivas and chewing patterns, the team had a single participant chew seven pieces of each brand.

“Our initial hypothesis was that the synthetic gums would have a lot more microplastics because the base is a type of plastic,” explained Lisa Lowe, a graduate student in Mohanty’s lab who participated in the research.

While the participant chewed each piece of gum, the researchers took saliva samples at various time intervals. They then measured the amount of microplastics in the samples, either by staining the particles red and counting them with a microscope, or via a technique called Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy that can identify components within a mixture.

Ultimately, the team found that chewing gum released an average of 100 microplastics per gram of gum, and that 94% of the total microplastics documented in the study were released during the first eight minutes of chewing. The release of microplastics is the result of the abrasive mechanics of chewing, which detaches the particles from the gum, rather than from the saliva breaking them down.

“Surprisingly, both synthetic and natural gums had similar amounts of microplastics released when we chewed them,” said Lowe, and contained the same polymers (plastics are a type of polymer).

Some sticks of gum released as many as 600 microplastics per gram. Based on an estimate of 160 to 180 sticks per year—though some sources put that number closer to 300—a person could be swallowing around 30,000 microplastics annually from gum alone. Since the researchers’ instruments limited them to detecting microplastics 20 micrometers or larger, smaller particles might make that number even higher.

Furthermore, “the plastic released into saliva is a small fraction of the plastic that’s in the gum,” Mohanty pointed out, meaning that once you’re done with it, it can still contribute to environmental plastic pollution. “So, be mindful about the environment and don’t just throw it outside or stick it to a gum wall.”</p></b>

                <p>A discredited anti-vaccine advocate who has no medical background and who has been disciplined for practicing medicine without a license will reportedly lead a questionable federal study on vaccines and autism—despite a large volume of existing research that has found no link between the two and despite a thorough debunking of claims that vaccines cause autism.

Late Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that David Geier has been hired as a "data analyst" by the Department of Health and Human Services, which is now headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent and fervent anti-vaccine advocate. Kennedy and Geier have both long touted the false claim that vaccines cause autism, despite the extensive evidence showing that they do not. In March, HHS directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reexamine the nonexistent link between vaccines and autism, using funds from taxpayers that could have been directed at other research.

David Geier earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in 2002. Since then, he has largely worked with his father, Mark Geier, also an anti-vaccine advocate who falsely blames vaccines for autism. In 2011, Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for misrepresenting his credentials, failing to meet state and federal regulations on safety oversight, and allegedly putting the safety and welfare of autistic children at risk.

The board found that the elder Geier "misdiagnosed autistic children with precocious puberty and other genetic abnormalities and treated them with a potent hormonal therapy ("Lupron Therapy" or "Lupron Protocol"), and in some instances chelation therapy, both of which have substantial risks of both short-term and long-term adverse side effects. [Mark Geier's] treatment exposed the children to needless risk of harm."</p></b>

                <p>Ultimate Summary: Google will start developing Android OS behind closed doors, starting next week. Not to be confused with taking Android closed-source, as Google will continue to open source the code, after a new version of Android is released.

Since the beginning of Android, it’s been developed out in the open as part of the Android Open Source Project. However, it seems that they now will take this private, and develop the Android OS fully behind closed doors. This does not mean that Google is going closed source (like Apple and iOS), but instead, the development won’t be out in the public. Once the release is final, it’ll be added to AOSP, like usual.

Google has told Android Authority that it is doing this to streamline the development of Android.

Currently, the way it works is, Android is able to accept code contributions from third-party developers. Even though the majority of the AOSP development is done by Google itself, others can still contribute. And others can also see what changes have been made, before Google pushes it to devices. But, Google does treat “the Android project as a full-scale product development operation” as an effort to “ensure the vitality of Android as a platform and as an open-source project”. Basically meaning that Google has final say on what code is able to be merged with AOSP.

Google is eliminating a branch of Android

Currently, Google has two branches of Android. There’s AOSP (Android Open Source Project) that is open to anyone to use however they like. In fact, companies like Amazon do use it to an extent for their Fire Tablets. Then there’s Google’s internal brand, which is only available to companies that have a Google Mobile Services (GMS) licensing agreement. We heard more about this when Huawei was banned from working with US companies a few years ago. They were able to keep using Android, but they wouldn’t get help from Google.

Now, Google is eliminating that public branch of development to make things simpler. As having two branches can sometimes create code conflicts, making things tougher to get new versions of Android out the door.

Google has confirmed that they are not going closed-source with Android. It will continue to publish the source code for new Android releases. It will also continue to publish the source code for Android’s Linux kernel fork, since it is licensed under GPLv2.

This is all set to begin next week, with all Android development happening in Google’s internal branches. Source code will only be added for changes once Google publishes a new branch containing those changes. This is already normal for most Android component changes, so Google is consolidating its development into a single branch.

For regular users, this will not change a single thing. It will only change for companies that are using the open source version of Android and those individuals that submit code to AOSP.</p></b>

                <p>is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

The Nissan Leaf is back, and it’s not a frumpy looking hatchback anymore.

The Japanese automaker is dusting off its pioneering EV and giving it new technology and a new form factor. The Leaf will return as a crossover SUV with a Tesla plug (!!), casting off its outdated appearance that previously led to rumors of its inevitable demise.

Nissan is also rebooting some other familiar nameplates, including the Sentra and Rogue. But the newly refreshed, third-generation Leaf is coming first, arriving in North America in 2026.

It makes sense that Nissan would throw out its old looks for something new and daring. The automaker is going through a particularly rough patch at the moment, with declining sales and the collapse of a merger deal with Honda. It needs some fresh products to help boost its overall image.

Nissan is teasing several new products. Image: Nissan

It’s hard to tell from the photos, but InsideEVs (which attended the reveal event in Japan) describes the new Leaf as egg-shaped (which is typical for most modern EVs) and about 3/4ths the size of a Tesla Model Y.

Nissan didn’t reveal much about the new Leaf, aside from confirming that it will be built on the modular CMF-EV platform that also undergirds the Ariya EV. The new Leaf will also have “significant range improvements over the previous generation.” The current Leaf sits in the low category for range, with the SV Plus trim getting a maximum 212 miles on single charge.

Perched on 19-inch alloy wheels, the new Leaf features a panoramic moonroof and — perhaps most shockingly — a native North American Charging Standard (NACS) charging port for Tesla Supercharger access. Nissan says it will be the first EV in its vehicle lineup to roll out of the factory with an integrated NACS port. As one of the first commercially available electric vehicles, the Leaf has always been saddled with outdated charging tech in the form of the CHAdeMO port. But now Nissan is rectifying that issue for this new generation.

The Leaf appeared to be headed for the compost heap up until recently, with Automotive News reporting in 2022 that Nissan would be winding down production on the current generation by mid-decade, with no immediate plans for a refresh.

Nissan is promising more details on the new Leaf by mid-year. The company also announced that new ICE and plug-in hybrid versions of its Rogue SUV, and refreshed models of its mid-sized Pathfinder SUV and Sentra sedan, would be coming soon. For Infiniti, a refreshed three-row luxury QX60 SUV is on its way, alongside a new Sport package for the full-size QX80 SUV.

Infiniti also plans on releasing several new models. Image: Nissan

And then in late fiscal year 2027, Nissan will introduce a new, unnamed EV slated for production as its Canton, Mississippi plant. The automaker says it will be an “adventure themed” SUV, so expect something of the Rivian/Scout/Jeep variety. In fiscal year 2028, Infiniti will release a luxury SUV inspired by the Vision QXe concept.

The automaker had previously discussed its plans to electrify half its vehicle lineup, including seven EVs for the US and Canada. Today, Nissan clarified that these future models will feature batteries manufactured in the US in partnership with SK one.</p></b>

                <p>The topic of an Intel Arrow Lake CPU refresh has been a recurring topic of discussion among leakers for several months, though these rumors have largely been inconsistent. Jaykihn, who has a very strong track record when it comes to Intel, reports that an Arrow Lake refresh is back in development after the first concept was scrapped. This supposed Core Ultra 300 series will allegedly feature only unlocked (K/KF) variants, which typically carry a premium price versus their non-K counterparts. Details on the core architecture and a potential release timeline have not been shared, so that bit remains a mystery.

Before launch, the expectation was that Arrow Lake would be the Hail Mary Intel's chip division needed, delivering exceptional performance while being efficient. To everyone's surprise and dismay, Arrow Lake struggled to keep up with last-gen Raptor Lake chips, while taking multiple blows from AMD's Ryzen X3D chips in gaming. Several of these issues can be traced back to latency penalties incurred by the off-die IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) and slow ring-bus frequencies.

Arrow Lake also suffered from several underlying issues that pushed Intel to release a fix by December. A follow-up with further enhancements in the form of a new microcode and BIOS firmware update was promised by January. However, despite Intel's many claims and fixes, Arrow Lake still lags behind AMD's offerings and Team Blue's own Raptor Lake.

Jaykihn alleges that Intel planned and axed an Arrow Lake refresh, only to revive it later with a revised design. Initial leaks pointed towards a 40-core (8P+32E) variant, or one with an upgraded NPU design on the SoC Tile. Given the product's preliminary nature, it's hard to draw up architectural changes, if any even exist. It's anyone's guess at this point, but Intel's primary objective will likely be resolving or at least mitigating the latency problems discussed earlier.

Preliminary.ARL-S Refresh will only feature K and KF SKUs.There will be opt-in uplifts to the current ARL-S K and KF lineup in the meantime.March 25, 2025

Likewise, following Intel's updated nomenclature, this supposed Core Ultra 300 series will only feature unlocked variants, which generally have a base TDP of 125W, going as high as 295W (PL2), in the case of Arrow Lake. One more supported generation, albeit only with pricier K/KF variants, would be sufficient to prevent LGA 1851 from being considered the most short-lived platform in Intel's history.

The leaker claims Intel will offer "opt-in" uplifts to current-gen Arrow Lake chips. On further clarification, Jaykihn is referring to specific BIOS presets for increasing performance that do not void warranty. The exact specifics are unknown. However, these presets are said to be similar in premise to Intel's in-development IPO (Intel Performance Optimization) settings, designed to deliver higher performance with guaranteed stability, aimed at system integrators and OEMs.

No further details were provided on a release date, specifications, or pricing. With Nova Lake slated for a 2026 launch, we are likely to hear more about this refresh straight from Intel sooner rather than later.</p></b>

                <p>A reader recently contacted me to ask me how he could configure the LibreOffice interface so that it looks like that of Microsoft Office. He wanted to perform this task so that Linux finally becomes his default operating system.

Receive a selection of strategic advice and concrete tips every week in your mailbox with our newsletter practical guides. Learn more about the use of personal data

For all those who, like him, wish to move away from the Office suite of Microsoft (whatever the reason), LibreOffice is the most correct choice you can find.

LibreOffice is highly compatible with Microsoft Office and is also multiplate, open-source and flexible, which perfectly illustrates the customizable user interface of the software. With LibreOffice, you have several choices for the user interface, including:

Standard toolbar

Tabs

Unique toolbar

Compact tabs

Compact group bar

Compact contextual

Believe it or not, it is quite easy to modify the LibreOffice interface.

Let me show you the way.

How to customize the LibreOffice user interface

The only thing you will need for this task is the latest version of LibreOffice installed on the operating system of your choice.

The software is available for Linux, MacOS and Windows, and the user interface customization process is the same for each of them.

I will demonstrate the steps with version 24.8.1 installed on pop! _OS Linux. Also note that I compare LibreOffice to the Office user interface365.com.

1. Open any LibreOffice tool

One of the most interesting aspects of the LibreOffice user interface is that it is possible to apply a different interface to each component (text document, workbook, presentation, database, etc.)

This flexibility means that you can define interfaces individually if you like an interface for Doculence Text and another for workbook.

As text document is the tool I use the most, I will open the document editor mode.

2. Open the User Interface tool

With LibreOffice Document Text Open, click View> User interface.

This will open a contextual window in which you can select the user interface option of your choice.

You can apply the new user interface to a single LibreOffice component or everyone. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET

3. Select the user interface

For me, the best user interface combination is the lateral shutter option, but it does not correspond at all to the Office user interface365.com.

Your best solution is to opt for the compact tab interface. So select this option in the left part of the context window, then click apply to Writer or apply everywhere.

If you want the tab user interface to apply to all LibreOffice tools, click Apply everywhere, otherwise click Apply to Writer.

4. Refine the user interface

With LibreOffice, you can refine your customization by opening the personalized contextual window. To do this, click on the icon of three small horizontal lines located at the top right of the LibreOffice Writer window and select customize.

In the resulting context window, you can customize the menus, toolbars and other options. You can select an option available in the left panel and move it to the right, or there are even more options in the assigned control panel. It is also possible to delete options from the assigned control component. You can do the same in the Tool Bars tab.

The sky is the limit of personalization of the LibreOffice interface. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET

To further customize visible toolbars, again click on the three horizontal traits icon, then on toolbars. You will see a fairly wide drop -down list with several options.

You can add as much or remove from the toolbar menu menu. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET

You may take a few minutes for the LibreOffice user interface to be exactly like what you want, but with the help of the various customizations, you can put yourself on the page and go to your convenience.

                <p>VMware is suing the US arm of industrial giant AG Siemens. The Broadcom company claims that Siemens outed itself by revealing to VMware that it downloaded and distributed multiple copies of VMware products without buying a license.

VMware filed the lawsuit (PDF) on March 21 in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, as spotted by The Register.

In the complaint, VMware says that it has had a Master Software License and Service Agreement with Siemens since November 28, 2012. The virtualization company claims that in September, Siemens sent VMware a purchase order for maintenance and support services. Siemens was reportedly looking to exercise a previously agreed-upon option for a one-year renewal of support services. However, the list of VMware technology that Siemens was seeking support for "included a large number of products for which [VMware] had no record of Siemens AG purchasing a license," the complaint says.

The lawsuit also reads: “In the context of attempting to exercise the option... to purchase a one-year renewal of Support Services for certain eligible licensed products for the year following the expiration of the ELA in September 2024, Siemens AG revealed that it had downloaded, copied, distributed, and deployed thousands of copies of VMware products for which it had never purchased a license."</p></b>

                <p>Insufficient, the Act chips? This European law adopted in 2023 plans to facilitate the establishment of companies specializing in the field of semiconductors, a sector which has become highly sensitive today.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

But this initial attempt seems to have long been firing and European parliamentarians invited the commission to return to the subject according to the reuters news agency.

In a letter signed by around fifty parliamentarians, parliamentarians deplore the failure of the first chips Act. The measures are slow to give concrete effects. They call on the Commission to propose new initiatives aimed at promoting the establishment of companies in the sector in Europe.

The disappointed hopes of the Act chips

The 2023 Chips Act had attracted several major players in the sector, like Intel who had announced the construction of a giant factory in Germany.

The project represented an investment of 30 billion euros for Intel, which hoped to be able to count on an additional 10 billion euros in the form of subsidies from the German government.

But Intel finally announced at the end of 2024 wanting to freeze the project for a period of at least two years. A decision that caused the slowdown in other similar projects initiated in Europe. In parallel, the new administration of the United States government has multiplied aggressive policies to force the giants of semiconductors to repatriate their production tools on American soil.

Reduce the fleas to the house

This event of the European Parliament is in unison other initiatives from the private sector. Or member states themselves. Last week, several organizations also asked the Commission to implement a new Act chips, this time focusing on flea design, design, R&D as well as work on materials.

Earlier in the month, nine EU member states, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, announced the launch of a coalition dedicated to semiconductors and supporting the sector. The displayed objective is to make Europe self-sufficient in terms of semiconductors' production, while the sector is today very largely dominated by American (Intel) and Asian (TSMC) giants.

These industrial initiatives also echo more general calls from the digital sector, calling for the European Commission to promote products from the EU in a context of trade war between the United States, Asia and Europe.</p></b>

                <p>The National Weather Service is reducing the number of weather balloon launches—and thus, the amount of data collected from American skies—following sweeping cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by the Trump White House.

Hundreds of federal workers at NOAA—about 10% of the workforce—were fired on the last day of February, as the Trump administration continued its culling of federal funding across the sciences.

“We’re going to lose data because of this staffing,” said Michael Morgan, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and former NOAA administrator, in a press conference Monday. “And that loss of data then translates into less precise forecasts, more uncertainties in the forecast.”

According to a National Weather Service wire published late last week, weather balloon observations are now suspended out of Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, due to a lack of staffing. Inside Climate News reported that launches were also suspended in Kotzebue, Alaska.

Typically, the NWS launches weather balloons twice each day from 100 sites across the country, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Basin. The radiosondes attached to those weather balloons collect information on a suite of factors that contribute to weather, including temperatures, dew points, humidity, barometric pressures, and wind speed and direction.

“Does it mean every single forecast is going to be poor? No, but it does mean that the uncertainties in our forecast will grow over time.”

A second NWS Public Information Statement said that weather balloon launches would be cut down to a single launch per day out of Aberdeen, South Dakota, Grand Junction, Colorado, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gaylord, Michigan, North Platte, Nebraska, and Riverton, Wyoming.

“Does it mean every single forecast is going to be poor?” Morgan added. “No, but it does mean that the uncertainties in our forecast will grow over time.”

Similar views were espoused by NOAA meteorologist and hurricane hunter Andrew Hazelton, who spoke to Gizmodo last week as his employment status wended its way through the federal court system. Hazelton—and many other federal employees—have been left in employment limbo after being laid off, but now reinstated, albeit not permitted to work.

“Whenever there’s a hurricane, better forecasts allow people to get out—or vice versa, if they’re not going to be impacted, they don’t have to close up their school or business,” Hazelton told Gizmodo. “Better forecasts save lives and money. In a lot of ways, NOAA really pays for itself.”

Last month’s cost-cutting measures also reduced the workforce at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Park Service, among other agencies. It will take time to see the impacts of the layoffs across the board, and the same goes for the staffing shortages at NWS locations. The NWS Press Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Exactly how this diminished data will affect weather forecasts won’t be clear immediately, but what is clear is that the cuts will mean we have less information about what’s going on in our skies.</p></b>

                <p>A partial eclipse of sun is scheduled for 29 March which will be visible from the North, Center and part of Southern Italy. On that occasion, the moon will pass in front of our star and project its shadow on earth, in particular on a part of the northern hemisphere. This is in which time slot to observe the event from the various areas of Italy. We immediately remember that it is strongly recommended to observe the sun through special filters to avoid damage to the vision.

The partial eclipse of sun in Italy

As anticipated, it will not be a total eclipse but of a partial eclipse of the sun. The magnitude will be equal to 0.936, this means that about 94% of the sunscreen will be obscured by the moon at the height of the event, but the actual percentage will vary significantly depending on the geographical position.

In Northern Italy, the percentage of coverage of the sun diameter will be greater than in the center and south of the country. According to the forecasts of the Italian Astrophils Union (UAI), in Milan the sun will be eclipsed by the Moon for 19.2% (while NASA estimates a slightly lower coverage in correspondence with the Lombard capital, equal to 10%). Also according to the UAI, the percentage of covered sun diameter will be 7.9% in Rome and 1.8% in Naples.

The event will start at 11:20 in Milan, at 11:34 in Rome and 11:50 in Naples. The maximum is scheduled a few minutes after 12 (12: 03-12: 04) in all three cities. The partial eclipse of sun will not be visible from Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily and Puglia (from Gargano yes, while from the Bari area not). Anyone wishing to follow the streaming event will be able to do it through official channels that will broadcast it online (an example is the Youtube channel of the Royal Observatory of Greenwich).

The other countries affected by the partial eclipse of sun

Globally, it is estimated that about 814 million people will be able to attend the partial eclipse of sun, but only a few tens of thousands in the north of Quebec will be able to observe a darkening greater than 90%. In some areas of Greenland, moreover, the darkening will reach or exceed 80%.

As shows the interactive map of Google, as regards Europe, the luckiest will be the inhabitants of the North-West of the continent: in Reykjavík, in Iceland, the sunbath will be eclipsed for about 68%. Elsewhere, the event will be visible from the north-western area of ​​Africa and northern Russia.</p></b>

                <p>On Monday The Atlantic published a story that revealed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sent secret war plans to a Signal group chat. This morning it published the entire chat, which includes Hegseth detailing the movements of American F-18s, including targets and munitions, in a group chat with 18 other people. Hegseth shared this information before the attack took place and outside of a secure setting. This is information that would typically be classified and highly sensitive.

But on Tuesday, in testimony before Congress, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard swore under oath that it wasn’t. In the initial story, The Atlantic published a small section of the group chat but not the whole thing. In particular, it held back specific information about the movement of the F-18s.

So here are the new things we know now. The new story published screenshots of the entire chat that Goldberg witnessed, along with a screenshot of details about the Signal group that showed all of its 19 members. Just last week the Pentagon issued a memo warning against using Signal because of threats from Russian hackers. National Security Advisor Michael Waltz was the person who added Goldberg to the group chat. It’s clear as day at the top of the first screenshot. Waltz took “full responsibility” for the leak in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.

One of the funniest lines from the group chat was Hegseth saying “We are currently clean on OPSEC [operational security]. Godspeed to our warriors.” We now have the full context of that statement.

Before claiming to have the information ecosystem locked down, the Secretary of Defense shared the plan to attack the Houthis and included a timeline, specific aircraft, and specific munitions.

“TEAM UPDATE: TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/ CENTCOM we are GO for mission launch.

1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)

1345: “Trigger Based” F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME) — also, Strike Drones Laucn (MQ-9s)

1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)

1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier “Trigger Based” targets)

1536: F-18 2nd Strike Starts — also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”

“I will say a prayer for victory,” Vice President JD Vance said in the chat. Two people reacted with prayer emojis. Then Mike Waltz set the disappearing message timer in the chat to 4 weeks, meaning that everything written afterwards would delete itself after a month.

Waltz hit the chat with a follow up. “VP. building collapsed. Had multiple positive ID. Pete, Kurilla, the IC, amazing job.”

“What?” the Vice President of the United States said.

“Typing too fast,” Waltz said. “The first target—their top missile guy—we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and now it’s collapsed.”

Under oath before Congress yesterday, Gabbard and Ratcliffe talked out of both sides of their mouth when grilled about the contents of the chat. Congress wanted to see everything but Ratcliffe and Gabbard wouldn’t release it. “The information was not classified,” Gabbard said, while the pair refused to release the information or explain why discussions about a bombing run in Yemen aren’t classified.

Trump also said the information wasn’t classified during an interview on Newsmax Tuesday night. “Now, it wasn’t classified, as I understand, there was no classified information. There was no problem. And the attack was a tremendous success,” Trump said.

The Atlantic has taken the administration’s words at face value. If a discussion among the Vice President, director of National Security, and Secretary of Defense, about a pending military operation is not classified then it’s free to publish it in full. And so it has.

It remains to be seen how the administration will react to another embarrassing revelation, but Press Secretary Karoline Levitt gave us an early indication in a post on X. “The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT ‘war plans,’” she said. “This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.”</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>If there is one certainty of social media in 2025, it’s this: Rage clicks rule. Hyperbole, hate, cheap shock—it’s all par for the course—and often rewarded with virality.

But Sez Us, an app just launched by veteran Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, believes it’s possible to change that by punishing users who shitpost for the sake of provocation.

The timing may be just right. America is entering an age of oligarchy with a rising wave of right-wing extremism taking hold of global politics. Platforms like Truth Social and X now operate as effective propaganda machines, recasting culture-war issues over immigration, DEI, and trans rights as boogeymen in President Trump’s new vision of America, which is really just a very old version of America. As the next era of social media comes into view, emerging platforms also have an opportunity to rise to the moment. Can Sez Us, which is positioning itself as the antithesis to X, facilitate a better way forward?

“If you bring back responsibility, ownership, and reputation, then suddenly all the incentives that we have in the real world are back,” says Yevgeny Simkin, Sez Us’ cofounder and chief product officer.

Even as online discourse has devolved into rabid spectacle, platforms like Bluesky have shown there is an appetite for a more civil kind of conversation. Rather than boosting any post that’s getting rage clicks, Sez Us uses what its creators call a “reputation engine,” a feature that allows you to rate another user’s posts on the platform across five key areas: approval, influence, insightfulness, relevance, and politeness.

On the app, ratings determine a user’s reputation score and overall visibility. The higher the score, the more reach you have in the community. Users control who replies to them based on a person’s score, with low-scoring users penalized by having less influence. All posts are visible but you can block users from replying to you, for example, if they don’t have high-approval ratings. Ultimately, ratings are designed to deprioritize engagement based around viral moments.

“It’s not about the moderators coming in and saying ‘you’re bad,’” Simkin says. “It’s about the community saying ‘we don’t like what you’re saying.’ Then I know that I have to temper how I say things. I have to be more polite. I have to be less bombastic.”

In the race to perfect social media, there has never been a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to moderation—for those who still bother with it. Scale can make this task even more difficult as a platform’s user base grows. For Simkin and his team, the idea was to build a platform that would “bring to the fore all the ways in which social media should be running rather than the way it has been,” he says. “The camel’s back was broken by the straw of Elon [Musk] buying Twitter,” and suddenly a whole new world seemed possible.

The fracturing of Twitter, since rebranded as X, kicked off an arms race among techies who had all sorts of ideas about the next phase of social media, and how to define it. It was during this period, in 2022, that the concept for Sez Us was born, grounded in the lofty goal of bringing back civil discourse.</p></b>

                <p>Millions of professionals rely on the suite of Microsoft 365 applications for their daily workflows. To accelerate some of these daily professional processes, the company now adds two new artificial intelligence agents to its Microsoft 365 Copilot offer.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

Tuesday, Microsoft unveiled its deep Researcher and Analyst -style reasoning agents, capable of carrying out high -level data research and analysis.

These two agents rely on existing OPENAI models to provide more advanced and personalized assistance, adapted to the specific needs and the workflows of Microsoft 365 users.

Agent Researcher (researcher)

Agent Researcher works in the same way as the Deep Research functions of Openai and Google, scrutinizing large amounts of information from the web and producing this information in a neat relationship with sources.

In addition, Microsoft’s Research agent is fueled by the OPENAI Deep Research model in combination with the "orchestration and research capacities" of Microsoft 365 COPILOT, according to the press release.

Consequently, the version of Microsoft can go further than these existing research agents, also drawing the context of your work data, such as your emails, meetings, files, cats. Combined with all the information available on the web, it is able to create really personalized and rich reports.

For example, Microsoft says that Researcher can create a complete quarterly report for a customer who combines information found in your applications as well as external news. The Researcher agent can also extract data from third -party sources, such as ServiceNow and Salesforce.

Analyst agent (analyst)

The analyst agent was designed on the basis of the O3-Mini of Openai reasoning model in order to provide users with full information from raw data in a few minutes, according to Microsoft.

Designed to act as a good data scientist, he uses reasoning by thinking, another term for step by step treatment, to treat complex queries.

Users can observe the execution of the code in real time in order to draw lessons from its processes and to dismiss them.

The availability of these two new agents

Researcher and analyst agents will start to be deployed for customers with a Microsoft 365 COPILOT license in April.

This deployment will be part of a new frontier program which allows customers to discover the first Copilot innovations while they are still under development.</p></b>

                <p>LUUP, which operates micro mobility services such as electric kickboards, has temporarily suspended its services since the morning of March 26th.

According to the company, communication failures have occurred in the network used by LUUP, and the start and end of the ride cannot be performed normally. The disorder occurred around 7:40am. Even as of 2pm, there is no prospect of recovery.

In addition, users who were unable to ride due to communication problems and incurred fees, or who used the coupon because they were unable to ride and were unable to ride, will be refunded or compensated for the coupon at a later date.

Is the cause SORACOM fault?

LUUP uses SORACOM's IoT data communication service "SORACOM Air for Cellular" for remote control of vehicles.

This SORACOM Air for Cellular experienced a communication failure from around 7:42am on March 26th, the same time as the LUUP failure, and is still ongoing.

The outage of service on LUUP can be attributed to this failure. A LUUP spokesperson said that the facts are currently being confirmed.

(Updated) According to LUUP, it has been confirmed that this was caused by a communication failure in SORACOM.

OPENAI is expanding its chatgpt offer, adding an AI voice assistant, understanding files and images, new research capacities, AI agents, and more. However, there was a blatant omission: a really efficient image generator.

Tuesday, Openai launched the generation of 4o images. This image model is much better - although slower - than the Dall -E models previously offered by Openai. He attacks very difficult questions such as realistic and even more impressive images, a specific text.

A convincing demonstration

For example, during the live demonstration, Sam Altman, CEO of Openai asked 4O to create a photo from a specific point of view and a prospectus containing a lot of text. After a few seconds of loading, the application managed to give a correct cinematographic direction and to print with precision all the text.

Screenshot by Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET

The previous OPENAI images generator was devoid of many features, such as image referencing, which can be used to create a new version of the image (such as a animated version or a selfie) or as a source of inspiration for the creation of a completely new work.

This tool being intended to integrate into the workflows of creatives, it can:

Generate images on a transparent background

Use specific colors from HEX codes

Implement advanced conversational capacities of the chatbot in generations

AI has finally humor!

For example, when he was asked to include "humor" in the photo during the demo, he included the text that responded to this criterion.

The image generator being accessible in Chatgpt, users can also refine the images through a conversation with several laps. This facilitates the adjustment of images and allows the model to use the context of previous generations to create new ones. And as GPT-4O has access to the web, this context is also added to the creation of images.

According to the company, the generation of images of GPT-4O is also based on strong membership in instructions. It can manage from 10 to 20 different objects, which means that you can ask him to generate a large number of objects at once.

More flexible protective measures

Another new aspect of the image generator is that it can now create more risky content, why Elon Musk's Grok model is known. Altman said you can use the GPT-4O images generator to create offensive content "within reason". In an X post after Livestream, Altman added:

"What we want is that the tool does not create offensive content unless you want. In which case it will do it within the limits of reasonable. Entrusting this intellectual freedom and this control to users is the best thing to do, but we will observe how it goes."

The blog post announcing the model specifies that it will block requests that violate content policies, including documents relating to sexual abuses on children and sexual "deepfakes". Another protection measure is to limit what can be created when real people are in the context, including "particularly robust protective measures concerning nudity and graphic violence".

How to access this new image generator

Updated image generation features are deployed today in Chatgpt and Sora. Whether subscribers or not, all users (including free users) will have access to the generation of GPT-4O images by default.

If users always want to access Dall-E, they can do so through a GPT dedicated to Dall-E. Users of the company and education sectors will soon have access to it, and the access of developers via the API is planned for the coming weeks.

When Dall-E was launched for the first time, he was hosted on an autonomous website. At the time, he seemed to be the best and most recent. Since then, he has been moved to reside only in Chatgpt. There, the model has pale compared to more advanced image generation models of competitors such as Midjourney, Google and Adobe. This update now makes it possible to better compete with other models.</p></b>

                <p>If Amazon wants to make this Big Spring Sale a regular thing like Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, we’d be totally OK with that. The tech deals especially have been outstanding, and this one on the Insignia 50-Inch Class F30 LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV is no exception. It’s at its all-time lowest price after the Big Spring Sale 37% price cut, now just $190 down from $299.

See at Amazon

The Insignia Fire TVs tend to punch well above their weight class in terms of performance vs. price to begin with, and this 50-Inch Class F30 was very reasonably priced at $299. Dropping it to just $189, however, means you should probably start measuring your walls to see where this big, beautiful screen best fits your home.

4K For Days

If you haven’t gone 4K yet with your big screen, you’re going to see the 2160p Ultra HD resolution of the Insignia 50-Inch Class F30 and wonder how you’ve managed to go this long without it. Shows and movies you’ve seen dozens of times take on a new life when you see them in Ultra HD for the first time, and if you’ve been gaming on a small monitor or a TV of lesser resolution, you’re in for a serious treat with the Insignia 50-Inch Class F30.

The sound quality of a 4K television never seems to get as much of the hype, but the DTS Studio Sound that courses through the Insignia 50-Inch Class F30 with two-speaker playback keeps pace with the amazing picture. You’ll find the rich sound comes in handy if you take advantage of the Insignia TV’s Alexa skills, which include video calls and picture-in-picture live views from your Ring or Blink video doorbell.

More Content Than Ever

The Insignia 50-Inch Class F30 comes fully loaded with all of the streaming and music apps you could ever want, including Amazon’s own Prime Video and Amazon Music along with Netflix, Apple TV+, Hulu, Spotify, Pandora, and more. All told, depending on your subscriptions, you’ll have access to over 1 million movies and TV episodes, and millions of songs. They’re all just a voice command away with the Class F30’s Alexa-enabled voice remote.

The Insignia 50-Inch Class F30 is more TV than $189 should be able to get you, but that’s the price right now thanks to the 37% markdown taking place during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. When the Big Spring Sale ends, this all-time low price may end along with it, so don’t hesitate.

                <p>The European Union seems to develop its own Linux distribution. This new version of Linux, called Eu OS, is proof of concept for a distribution based on Fedora which uses the KDE Plasma office environment.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

EU OS seeks to create a new Linux distribution which offers the following advantages:

The possibility of adding layers to the basic operating system (national layer, regional or sectoral layer, layer specific to organization).

A common office environment

A common method of user management and their data, software and devices.

It meets the requirements of the European public sector

The EU OS being designed from free software, it meets the requirements of the European public sector, while being rapid and ecological, whether new or old equipment. Windows 10 being about to arrive at the end of their life, it is timely to prevent users from having to spend money on new equipment, with the bonus of a more reliable and safer operating system.

The EU OS site explains the concept of layers superposition:

"The layers define a clear and transparent hierarchy of software and configuration responsibilities. Each layer of the European operating system would only contain the very specific elements for its user cases and its users. The use of common layers allows them to group responsibilities at the appropriate level so that teams close to end users can focus on their specific environment."

Public money = public code

What motivates the creation of Eu OS? Motivation is the same as that of other similar projects, such as the French Gendbuntu project, the Russian project Astra Linux, Chinese projects Kylin and Neokylin, the Cuban project Nova Linux and the German Limux project:

Public money = public code: the whole public would benefit from the investment

Tax savings: there is no license cost

Independence: more dependence on suppliers, programming of software migrations and less upgrades to the equipment.

Open source: promotes innovation

Better use of administrative resources

Possibility of analyzing the code

A global community

According to the official website, the functional requirements of the European OS are productivity, management of devices, scalability, security and robustness. There is not yet an indication of a calendar.

Save money and have a more reliable platform

You can nevertheless consult the Gitlab of Eu OS page to see the documents available and, hope, examine at a given time any code added to the deposit. For the moment, it seems that most of the elements appearing on the GitHub pages are reserved spaces and that no stage has been crossed.

Keep in mind that it is for the moment only proof of concept. But you can consult the official Kanban Table of the project to follow its evolution.

I cross my fingers so that this project succeeds and the EU finally adopts a free operating system which will allow it to save money and have a more reliable, safer and more robust platform.</p></b>

                <p>On March 5, Do No Harm, an organization that advocates against diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in medicine, among other issues, sued the American Chemical Society for its Scholars Program, which provides financial support to chemistry students from underrepresented backgrounds. The complaint argues the program is illegal because it is not open to white and Asian students. Around two weeks later, Do No Harm also sued the University of Pennsylvania for its partnership with a database called the Black Doctors Directory, which allows patients to find Black physicians.

The lawsuits join a recent uptick in legal action against universities, departments, and professional societies that host programs intended to increase diversity across academia, including in the sciences. In May 2024, for example, White students at the University of Oklahoma sued their school, alleging the university discriminated against them by factoring in race when determining financial aid. In August, a conservative activist group sued the Department of Education over the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program, which provides mentoring and research support to underrepresented students pursuing doctoral degrees. Those cases followed the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision against factoring in race when considering college admissions, effectively striking down affirmative action.

“What's happened here is the organizations bringing these lawsuits, they're capitalizing on the fact that the US Supreme Court struck down race-conscious admissions,” said Vinay Harpalani, a professor at the University of New Mexico School of Law and an expert on affirmative action policies.

Now with President Donald Trump’s administration in the White House and a conservative Supreme Court, more organizations may feel inclined to bring these types of lawsuits, he said. “They're really trying to expand this doctrine, the scope of this idea the Supreme Court has that we shouldn't use individual race at all in making any of these types of decisions.” (Do No Harm did not reply to a list of questions or repeated requests for an interview.)</p></b>

                <p>Chinese startup Deepseek is talking about her again. This time with an updated version of its V3 model, published in December.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

On Tuesday, the company officially announced V3-0324, appointed according to the month and the day of its release.

One day earlier, Deepseek had downloaded the new model on Huggingface. But with little additional information.

What are the news of Deepseek V3-0324 model?

Like R1 - the most efficient model of Deepseek published in January and a competitor of Openai - the new version is open source (in the sense that its weights are published, but not its real code) under a MIT license.

In a post on X, Deepseek notes that the update shows better coding skills for web development and a "major increase in reasoning performance". But he always recommends using it for less complex reasoning tasks. R1 remains the best reasoning model in the laboratory, ranking fourth on the Arena chatbot.

Deepseek said that the update also shows an improvement in performance compared to the V3 on several standard benchmarks, including the mathematical benchmark (American Invitational Mathematics Examination), with a score of almost 20 points.

Deepseek

While reference tests have become too easy for most models, a problem known as the reference tests saturation, loves it is always considered more difficult than most others. In January, Scale Ai and the Center for Ai Safety (Cais) published Humanity's Last Exam to fight against this saturation.

That said, because they are based on the mathematical content of secondary education, love responses are publicly available online. This means that it can be included in the training data.

According to Deepseek, other improvements have been made, including an "improved" writing style and better quality, especially for longer content. Some Reddit commentators speculate that the publication of the update could foreshadow the arrival of R2, which should be as disruptive as R1.

How to try the Deepseek V3-0324 model

You can access V3-0324 now via Huggingface. Or directly on the website and the Deepseek application.

Although you want to take into account the main safety flaws and user privacy problems into account.

While the V3 and R1 versions have been very easy and dangerous to break, it is not yet known if Deepseek added safety layers in the V3-0324 version.</p></b>

                <p>The signal messaging application is talked about, and not for something positive. The controversy comes from the United States. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, recently showed how not to use a secure communication channel to share sensitive and classified information.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

A journalist from The Atlantic publication found himself inadvertently included in a conversation with senior officials from the US administration, who discussed military strike plans in Yemen between them. The situation poses a major problem for some essential reasons, as described by BBC News.

However, signal is not to be blamed. Rather, the responsibility of civil servants who have not taken the necessary precautions. In good hands, signal can be an effective tool to preserve the confidentiality and safety of your conversations. What is signal and why should you use it rather than another messaging application? Here are seven reasons.

1. end -to -end encryption

By default, signal secures your texts (and your phone calls) with end -to -end encryption.

This means that no one, including the Foundation signal, can read your messages or listen to your calls. To do this, Signal uses its own open source encryption protocol.

All applications and all messaging formats do not quantify your default texts. And if we compare with those who do it, the signal protocol is considered one of the best.

2. No advertisements or trackers

With signal, you will not see any advertising or marketing message. And you will not be tracked.

The Foundation signal is a non -profit organization which is devoted to the protection of privacy and security.

This contrasts with other messaging applications such as Facebook Messenger, Imessage and even Whatsapp, which can all collect certain metadata on your texts.

3. Available everywhere

The signal app is available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, iPados and Android. So that you can use it on any computer or mobile device. In addition, you have nothing special to chat with another signal user.

Conversely, iPhone and Android users who want to send SMS can use the old SMS system or the instant messaging system. They have the choice between the old SMS and the new RCS. But the RCS does not yet offer encryption between iOS and Android.

As a bonus, you can use signal in other countries without having to worry about a cell package. As long as you have Wi-Fi connection, you can use signal.

4. Make your messages disappear

You can make your messages disappear after reading them. To do this, in the mobile application:

Go to Settings

Select confidentiality and press the missing messages option

You can configure your messages to disappear between 30 seconds and 4 weeks after being seen by the recipient.

Other applications allow you to do the same, including Snapchat, Telegram and Whatsapp. Messages sent via Apple iMessage, Google Messages and other popular applications remain in place unless the other person deletes them manually.

5. Discussions in large group

Of course, you can organize group discussions in almost all messaging applications.

But signal supports up to 1,000 people in a single cat. You can invite people through a link or QR code.

As a administrator, you can withdraw someone from the group, control who can send messages and launch calls, and manage who can modify group information and the messages of messages.

6. Use the receipt and strike indicators

By default, you can confirm that your recipient has received your message and that he is trying to answer them.

If the reception accused are activated, a timer appears on the message you have sent, indicating for how long it has been read. And with the striking indicators, the usual three points flash on the screen to tell you that you are waiting for an answer.

The receipt accused are available in other messaging applications, but the option must usually activate manually.

7. Add media to your message

Signal supports different types of media that you can attach to a message.

These include photos, GIFs and files.

You can also share contact information, your location and even payment details for digital currencies.</p></b>

                <p>What would a big Amazon event like the Big Spring Sale be without amazing deals on Amazon’s own superstar lineup of tech devices? We don’t know, honestly, and we’re not going to find out this time, because the Amazon tech offerings are coming in strong, like this one taking 32% off the price of the Fire HD 10 Tablet, bringing its price down into the double-digits at $94 down from $139.

See at Amazon

This is the latest version of Amazon’s fan-favorite 10-inch tablet, loaded with front and read 5 MP cameras, expandable storage up to 1TB with a micro SD card, a 13-hour battery life for all-day entertainment, and seamless interaction with Amazon’s vast ecosystem of apps and devices, including Alexa.

Master of Multitasking

The Fire HD 10 tablet utilizes its powerful octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM to make multitasking a breeze. You can open two compatible apps side by side on a split screen, so you can knock out emails on one side while streaming your favorite show or movie on the other.

Your entertainment options are virtually limitless with the Fire HD 10. Amazon-native apps like Prime Video, Audible, and Amazon Music are built in (subscriptions may be required), and the Fire HD 10’s Kindle app is as good a reading experience as having a dedicated Kindle. A subscription to Amazon Kids+ adds thousands of books, apps, games, videos, and more to turn the Fire HD 10 tablet into the ultimate kid-friendly entertainment device for long car rides or flights.

See at Amazon

All that entertainment looks incredible on the Fire HD 10’s 1080p Full HD display, and you can enjoy it virtually all day long thanks to the tablet’s 13-hour battery life. If you run that battery all the way down, you can bring it back to 100% in under 3 hours with a 15W adapter and USB-C cable. The included 9W adapter will give you a full charge in just under 4 hours.

Put It to Work

You can play the day away with the Fire HD 10 tablet, but it’s also a remarkably productive device, especially when you add some of Amazon’s great accessories (sold separately). The Made for Amazon Keyboard Case turns the Fire HD 10 tablet into a mini-laptop, and the Made for Amazon Stylus Pen has over 4,000 levels of sensitivity to create a truly natural writing experience for when you want to sketch in OneNote or just jot down ideas and to-do lists.

When you look across the super-competitive tablet market, a $95 full HD tablet with incredible interactivity, long battery life, a beautiful screen, and stellar lineup of entertainment and productivity options is virtually unheard of. All the more reason to take this 32% off deal on the Fire HD 10 tablet before Amazon’s Big Spring Sale ends.

                <p>“Where is everybody!?”

It was around 1950. UFO mania had recently ramped up across the world, with dozens of reported sightings of strange flying machines fueling rampant speculation regarding their origins.

The eminent physicist Enrico Fermi was visiting his colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico that summer, and the mealtime conversation turned to the subject of UFOs. Very quickly, the assembled physicists realized that if UFOs were alien machines, that meant it was possible to travel faster than the speed of light. Otherwise, those alien craft would have never made it here.

At first, Fermi boisterously participated in the conversation, offering his usual keen insights. But soon, he fell silent, withdrawing into his own ruminations. The conversation drifted to other subjects, but Fermi stayed quiet.

Sometime later, long after the group had largely forgotten about the issue of UFOs, Fermi sat up and blurted out: “But where is everybody!?”

Every scientist at that table immediately knew what he meant.

That central question—where is everybody?—is now known as the Fermi Paradox in his honor. And while he wasn't the first person to wonder about the nature of other intelligent civilizations, he was the first to give the idea a modern spin.

The paradox arises from a seemingly innocent line of rational thinking that leads to an incorrect conclusion. It goes like this. We’re not special. We live on just another rocky planet around a ho-hum star in an unspectacular arm of an average spiral galaxy. There’s nothing incredibly unique or exotic about our physical circumstances.

And here we are. Alive. Intelligent. (Almost) spacefaring.

Nature tends not to do things just once. If we’re here and on the cusp of exploding into space, and there are hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy, trillions of galaxies in the Universe, and billions of years to play around with, the Universe should be teeming with alien civilizations. We should see evidence for them everywhere we look, the same way we see any other common process played out again and again in the cosmos.</p></b>

                <p>Lian Li's O11 range of PC cases has been in the wilderness for quite some time and is still a very popular choice for new PC builds, thanks to its initial design and more recent iterations that expand on that success. The Lian Li PC-O11 Air Mini is our pick for the best compact ATX PC case, and this Spring Sale 2025 deal on the Lian Li O11 Vision is good news if you're looking to get your hands on one of the prettiest cases for your latest build and show off your components through the tempered glass windows.

It's not the best price I've ever seen for this case, but it is a good price. Also, this case is pretty much out of stock everywhere right now. If this is the case you've been waiting for, you might want to jump on it sooner rather than later. Available at Newegg, the Lian Li O11 Vision is $149 while stocks last. The version offered at this price is the white variant with clear glass panels. You can get the black version with tinted glass panels for $10 less, but as we covered in our review of the Lian Li O11 Vision, it can be a little too dark and mask the view of your components and RGB.

Lain Li O11 Vision PC Case: now $149 at Newegg (was $189)

The Lian Li O11 Vision PC case is a dual-chamber PC case with the sides separated. Show off your components and run the airflow through the glass side whilst hiding your PSU and cabling on the other. A popular choice for new PC builds that feature RGB.

The Lian Li O11 Vision uses a dual-chamber design that allows you to display all your precious parts and fans in the tempered glass "Fish Tank" side of the case, while your power supply, cables, RGB controllers, and extra 2.5-inch SSDs are stashed in the closed area. This makes the PC build look neat and tidy, but the negatives of the dual chamber design are that the cases are usually pretty wide and can take up more of your valuable desk space.</p></b>

                <p>Qualcomm has accused its longtime partner, Arm Holdings, of unfair business practices, taking the matter to U.S., Europe, and South Korea regulators. The allegations claim that Arm limits access to its technologies and changes licensing models in a bid to harm competition, according to Bloomberg. Arm denies the accusations.

Qualcomm has reportedly filed secret complaints against Arm with the European Commission, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Korea Fair Trade Commission. Qualcomm argues that Arm's open licensing approach helped build a robust hardware and software ecosystem. However, this ecosystem is under threat now as Arm moves to restrict that access to benefit its chip design business, namely compute subsystems (CSS) reference designs for client and datacenter processors and custom silicon based on CSS for large-scale clients.

Qualcomm has presented its case to the EC, U.S. FTC, and Korea FTC behind closed doors and through formal filings, so it does not comment on the matter now. Arm rejected the accusations, stating that it is committed to innovation, competition, and upholding contract terms. The company called Qualcomm's move an attempt to shift attention from a wider commercial dispute between the two companies and use regulatory pressure for its benefit.

Indeed, the antitrust complaints align with Qualcomm's arguments in a recent legal clash with Arm in Delaware. Qualcomm won that trial, as the court ruled that the company did not break the terms of its architecture license agreement (ALA) and technology license agreement (TLA) by acquiring Nuvia and using its IP in its Snapdragon X processors for client PCs. Arm said it would seek a retrial.

However, Qualcomm seems to want to ensure that it will have access to Arm's instruction set architecture and technologies by filing complaints with antitrust regulators.

Bloomberg reports that before the Delaware court ruling in December, Qualcomm filed a formal competition complaint with the EU authorities, alleging that Arm was trying to limit license access while attempting to compete more directly. Arm has acknowledged receiving the filing and is preparing a reply. Qualcomm also reportedly met with FTC officials in Washington and then raised similar concerns with South Korea's regulatory body. Among the issues cited are withheld technologies and violations of existing agreements.

“Arm remains focused on enhancing innovation, promoting competition, and respecting contractual rights and obligations," an Arm representative said in a statement to Tom's Hardware. "Any allegation of anti-competitive conduct is nothing more than a desperate attempt by Qualcomm to detract from the merits and expand the parties’ ongoing commercial dispute for its own competitive benefit. Arm is confident that it will ultimately prevail in this dispute.”</p></b>

Even better than the all-time-low price on the DJI Osmo Action 4 video camera is the fact that unlike elite-level video cameras of the very recent past, you don’t need to be Warren Miller to shoot jaw-dropping action videos of your ski trip, nor do you need to be Jacques Cousteau to come home from your tropical vacation with aquatic action videos that will blow away your friends and family. The DJI Osmo Action 4 is designed for use by beginners and experts alike.

Point and Shoot

The thing that makes the DJI Osmo Action for a superior buy even if you’ve never shot an action video in your life is the fact that it does so much of the work for you. Three stabilization modes will compensate if your hands are shaky, and the huge 1/1.3-inch sensor takes in all of the action in vivid detail regardless of the lighting, so you’re not fumbling through endless menus to make adjustments.

At 120 frames per second, your videos will be impeccably detailed in vivid 4K resolution, and since we’re talking about an action and sports video camera, it’s good to know that it works in temperatures as low as -4 degrees Fahrenheit without compromised performance, and it’s also waterproof down to 18 meters.

Everything You Need

Regardless of your active-sports preference, the Osmo Action 4 is up for the challenge. Bring it diving, mount it to your surfboard with the Osmo Action Surfing Tethers Kit, or mount it to your handlebars, your wrist, or your backpack with one of the many mounting accessories available for separate purchase. They’re all easily mounted and dismounted with the DJI Osmo’s quick-release magnetic adapter mount.

The DJI Osmo Action 4 Essential Combo comes with the camera itself, which is roughly palm-sized and weighs less than a half-pound, an Osmo Action Extreme Battery with a 160-minute duration, a type-C to type-C cable, horizontal-vertical protective frame, lens hood, and anti-slip pad. All you need to add is your active lifestyle and your enthusiasm for capturing your exploits, and the DJI Osmo Action 4 does the rest for you. This 31% off Amazon deal is one of the best tech buys we’ve seen during the Big Spring Sale.

                <p>This entry-level air tower delivers essential cooling performance, good noise levels, and a low price of just over $20 US.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

Everyone in the PC enthusiast community is familiar with cooling manufacturer Thermalright – or at least should be. The company has established a reputation for quality competitive coolers at comparatively low prices, repeatedly raising the bar for value in the PC cooling realm.

Most of my past Thermalright reviews have focused on the company’s best-performing products, like the excellent Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 EVO , which sits at the top of our air cooling list of the best CPU coolers .

Today we’re looking at Thermalright’s Assassin Spirit 120 V2 Plus, from the other end of Thermalright’s lineup – a single tower air cooler that costs just over $20. You won’t be using this cooler to win overclocking competitions, but it provides essential performance sufficient for gaming and other common use cases. This model sets itself apart from competitors by including a 120mm rear reverse fan for cooling the heatsink, in addition to a standard 120mm fan.

Let’s take a look at the specifications and features of the cooler, then we’ll go over thermal performance so you’ll know how cool it will keep your computer’s processor and noise measurements to let you know how loudly it operates.

Features of Thermalright’s Assassin Spirit 120 V2 Plus air cooler

*️⃣ RAM Clearance

If you’re only using slots two and four of your motherboard, you won’t run into any compatibility issues whatsoever. However, there might be a chance for issues with the thickest RAM modules if you’re using the first slot. This is easily rectified by raising the fan up a few millimeters, which shouldn’t have a significant impact on performance.

*️⃣ Thermalright TF4 Thermal Paste

Included with the AIO is a small tube of Thermalright’s TF4 thermal paste. This is the company’s entry-level thermal paste, but it performs well enough, as you can see in our best thermal paste tests.

*️⃣ Simple single tower heatsink with four direct-touch heatpipes

This cooler features a single tower heatsink to move heat away from the CPU. The design of the fins is simple; there’s nothing exotic or out of the ordinary.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Heat is moved into the fins (shown above) via four direct-touch copper heatpipes (shown below). You don’t see many direct-touch designs on larger coolers due to engineering challenges, but on a smaller cooler like this one, it can help improve the cooler’s efficiency.

*️⃣ Basic backplate

The backplate included is basic – just enough to do the job. It is primarily made of plastic and bends easily.

*️⃣ Two 120mm fans, including one reverse fan

There’s more to a cooler than just the heatsink or radiator. The bundled fans have a significant impact on cooling and noise levels, as well as how the cooler looks in your case. Thermalright includes two 120mm fans with this cooler, one of which is a standard design (left) and one featuring a reverse design (right) for aesthetic reasons – essentially so you don’t have to stare at the rear frame of a fan from any angle.

There are many factors other than the CPU cooler that can influence your cooling performance, including the case you use and the fans installed in it. A system's motherboard can also influence this, especially if it suffers from bending , which results in poor cooler contact with the CPU.

In order to prevent bending from impacting our cooling results, we’ve installed Thermalright’s LGA 1700 contact frame into our testing rig. If your motherboard is affected by bending, your thermal results will be worse than those shown below. Not all motherboards are affected equally by this issue. I tested Raptor Lake CPUs in two motherboards. And while one of them showed significant thermal improvements after installing Thermalright’s LGA1700 contact frame, the other motherboard showed no difference in temperatures whatsoever! Check out our review of the contact frame for more information.

I’ve also tested this cooler with Intel’s latest platform, Arrow Lake and LGA 1851.

LGA 1700 and 1851 Installation

The installation of this cooler is simple and should be easy to complete for most users.

1. You’ll first need to place the backplate against the rear of the motherboard. Adhesive strips are included to make this step easier, if desired. I personally avoid using adhesive, but that’s mainly because I change coolers on my system fairly frequently and adhesive makes removal a little more difficult.

3. Apply the included thermal paste to your CPU. If you have any questions on how to do this properly, please refer to our handy guide on how to apply thermal paste .

4. Place the CPU block on top of the CPU, and secure it with a screwdriver.

                <p>In recent years, the US military has made much of a concept known as tactically responsive launch. This essentially means that if there is some rapidly developing threat in space—say an adversary takes out a key national defense satellite—the military would like the capability to rapidly fuel a satellite on Earth, mate it to a rocket, and launch it into space.

The US Space Force first demonstrated this tactically responsive capability with a launch on Firefly's Alpha rocket in 2023. As part of this "Victus Nox" test flight, a satellite was encapsulated into a payload fairing and mated to the rocket and completed all final launch preparations within 27 hours.

But what if there were an even faster way to respond? That's the vision behind a new, $60 million federal award to a new space company named Gravitics for a concept called an orbital carrier.

"In many ways it's kind of like what an aircraft carrier does," said Jon Goff, director of advanced concepts for the Seattle-based company.

Shielding satellites

In interviews about the concept with Ars, company officials were fairly vague about specific details of what orbital carriers will be able to do. A news release published on Wednesday morning, highlighting the Strategic Funding Increase, or STRATFI grant from the United States Space Force, also lacks specifics. The Space Force would prefer to keep the vehicle's operational capabilities under wraps.

But in general, the idea is to provide an unpressurized module in which one or more satellites can be pre-positioned in orbit.

Such a module would isolate the satellites from the space environment, sparing their batteries and sensitive electronics from harsh thermal cycles every 90 minutes, and provide some shielding from radiation. In addition, the orbital carrier would obfuscate the satellites inside from observation by other nations or hostile actors in space. Then, when a satellite is needed, it can be deployed into multiple orbits by the carrier.</p></b>

                <p>GuruFocus reports that Nvidia is reportedly considering using Intel Foundry's manufacturing services for GPUs aimed at gamers. Timothy Arcuri, an analyst with UBS, is quoted as saying that if Intel lands an order from Nvidia, one of the biggest fabless chip designers, this would be a major win and perhaps an inflection point for Intel Foundry.

According to the analyst, Broadcom and Nvidia—two AI chip powerhouses—are considering using Intel's 18A (1.8 nm-class) process technology for their products. However, Arcuri claims that Nvidia is 'closer' to adopting Intel as its second (or third?) supplier than Broadcom. AMD has also demonstrated interest in this manufacturing process, though its progress with this node is unclear.

"Intel is working to finalize commitments from Nvidia or Broadcom to use its foundry services," Arcuri reportedly wrote in a note to clients.

In addition to 18A, Intel is prepping its performance-enhanced 18A-P fabrication technology, which promises to either increase performance at the same power, or decrease power at the same performance. The analyst believes this production node could appeal more to external customers who want to maximize their performance while minimizing power consumption.

While vanilla 18A manufacturing technology could be a very good choice for Intel, which needs to roll out its next-generation Panther Lake processors for client PCs and Xeon 7 'Clearwater Forest' CPUs for datacenters as soon as possible, fabless chip designers may opt for performance-enhanced version of the process, just like they do with TSMC. By doing so, they get higher performance or lower power and a bit more mature fabrication technology with lower performance variability, lower defect density, and potentially higher yields.

Timothy Arcuri wrote in a note to clients that Intel's new chief executive, Lip-Bu Tan, will emphasize the company's chip design and foundry capabilities in the near term, which is something that both former CEO Pat Gelsinger and interim co-CEOs already did. The comment highlights that for now there is little understanding about Lip-Bu Tan's plans outside of the company.

Lip-Bu Tan will make his first public address as CEO of Intel on March 31 at the company's Vision event in Las Vegas. The event is mostly aimed at analysts and investors.</p></b>

                <p>On average, the French spend about 4 hours a day in front of their screens, a quarter of the waking time. And two out of three even say they cannot do without your more day smartphone. These figures from the 2025 edition of the Crédoc digital barometer show how addicts we have become addicts to digital practices.

With an average of ten screens per household, this hyperconnection raises the question of the quality of internet access. If the fiber optics has become widespread throughout the national territory - with 90 % of the connectable foci according to the latest Cost of the ARCEP dating from the end of September - the connection to very high speed is not always synonymous with equal performance.

Fiber in all rooms

The classic fiber (Fiber to the Home) consists in bringing the fiber optics to an optical termination point on which the box is connected. It is generally located near the entrance or in a central location such as the living room. From this point, the signal distribution is done by WiFi or Ethernet wiring. This signal degrades the more we move away from the Internet box and that it encounters obstacles on its way. The connection becomes unstable, especially many users are connected simultaneously.

Conversely, the FTTR, for "fiber to the room" or "fiber to the room" in good French, goes, as its name suggests, carry the optical fiber directly in the different parts of a home.

This technology guarantees very high speed and homogeneous high speed and a low latency, regardless of the user.

Only two operators in France

For this, fine cables go through the existing conduits or run along the plinths to carry the fiber throughout the accommodation. In addition, each room is equipped with a "micro-box" connected to the central access point. This optimal connection responds to cases of demanding uses such as online video games, videoconferencing in the context of telework, virtual reality or 8K streaming.

In France, only two operators offer the FFTR. Based in Reunion, Zeop was the first to launch a dedicated offer.

In mainland France, he was joined by the Alsatian operator Vialis who hopes to attract 5 to 10% of Alsatian households within three years. Its mobile application allows the user, from their smartphone, to manage or cut the connection of each part independently.

Between 10 % and 20 % of households eligible for cable wifi

Another technology provides optimal speed in all rooms in the accommodation to fully enjoy your fiber subscription. Wi -foster wifi consists in multiplying the WiFi access points from Ethernet walls. Since a decree of August 3, 2016 relating to the Construction and Housing Code, each new accommodation includes a digital network and the associated wiring.

Between 10 % and 20 % of households are already eligible for cable WiFi estimate, in a joint press release, a set of professional building federations or electrical engineering professions.

"If the accommodation is not yet equipped with a digital network, the installation by any qualified electrician is fast and easy, without degradation of the aesthetics of the accommodation. »»

Do not confuse wifi wifi, rehearsal and cpl

The renovation of a housing or work on the electricity network can also be an opportunity to install the wifi wifi. The installation being independent of the telecom operator, it is not necessary to reconfigure the installation in the event of a box change.

Cadble wifi should not be confused with WiFi repeaters which, as their name suggests, only repeat "a signal likely to be already degraded and unstable, not offering the expected benefit. »»

In the case of Internet access by CPL (online carriers), the signal is, this time, conveyed by the electricity network. "His degree of stability is very variable, due to a sensitivity to electrical parasites, and its important latency. »»

                <p>Vincent Coudrin, Dinum Cloud Interministerial Project Director, underlined this on March 18 at the "State in the Cloud" conference, new markets are open for qualified SECNUMCLOUD suppliers.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

Reason: the Ansi's approval to the migration of on-premise systems to the cloud. This applies to ministries, but also for OIVs.

“These are new orders,” insists the framework of Dinum. Provided you offer expected services, particularly in terms of containerization.

Sovereignty, Total partitioning and speed of deployment

It is precisely on this segment that Outscale has just positioned itself, the Dassault Systems Cloud subsidiary. The company announces Okscale Kubernetes AS A Service, a "managed and dedicated platform".

The promise of the supplier is the rapid creation of Kubernetes customer environments in the public cloud, with insulation guarantee and compliance with the CERNUMCLOUD 3.2 requirements. The triptych for outscale: sovereignty, total partitioning and speed of deployment.

On a market where the sovereign supply continues its development and where hyperscalers accelerate their investments, the French actor is also part of the movement in favor of the hybridization of information systems.

Hybridization, however, implies efforts in terms of interoperability. Recall that Gartner provides for a massification of the use of containers by 2029. At this due date, 95% of organizations will exploit this technology in production.

Containers for IA/ml workloads

Interoperability “has become a major strategic issue,” said Outscale. As part of an approach described as "sovereign and hybrid", the hexagonal CSP thus describes OKS "guaranteed an interoperable sovereign cloud".

With the addition of this Kubernetes offer, Outscale prepares in particular the field for business developments in the field of artificial intelligence - in addition to providing managed services for critical applications.

Also according to Gartner, more than 75 % of AI/ML workloads will operate in containerized environments by 2027, compared to less than 50 % in 2024. The sensitivity of data and applications of AI can however require the use of qualified secnumcloud services.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>In the early 1920s, a trio of scientists sat down for a break at Rothamsted agricultural research station in Hertfordshire, UK. One of them, a statistician by the name of Ronald Fisher, poured a cup of tea, then offered it to his colleague Muriel Bristol, an algae specialist who would later have the plant C. muriella named after her. Bristol refused, as she liked to put the milk in before the tea. Fisher was skeptical. Surely it didn’t matter? Yes, she said, it did. A cup with milk poured first tasted better.

“Let’s test her,” chipped in the third scientist, who also happened to be Bristol’s fiancé. That raised the question of how to assess her tasting abilities. They would need to make sure she was given both types of tea, so she could make a fair comparison. They settled on pouring several cups, some tea-then-milk and others milk-then-tea, then getting her to try them one at a time. But there were still a couple of problems. Bristol might try to anticipate the sequence they’d chosen, which meant cups needed to arrive in a genuinely random order. And even if the ordering was random, she might get a few correct by chance. So there would need to be enough cups to ensure this was sufficiently unlikely.

Fisher realized that if they gave her six cups—three with milk first and three with milk second—there were 20 different ways they could be randomly ordered. Therefore, if she simply guessed, one in 20 times she’d get all six correct. What about using eight cups instead? In this situation, Fisher calculated there were 70 possible combinations, meaning there was a one in 70—or 1.4 percent—probability she’d get the sequence right by sheer luck. This was the experiment they decided to run with Bristol. They poured eight cups, four of each type, and got her to test them in a random order. She named the four she preferred, and the four she disliked, then they compared her conclusions with the true pattern. She’d got all eight correct.

The reason for Bristol’s success was ultimately down to chemistry. In 2008, the Royal Society of Chemistry reported that tea-then-milk will give the milk a more burnt flavour. “If milk is poured into hot tea, individual drops separate from the bulk of the milk and come into contact with the high temperatures of the tea for enough time for significant denaturation to occur,” they noted. “This is much less likely to happen if hot water is added to the milk.”

Fisher later described the tea-tasting experiment in a 1935 book titled simply The Design of Experiments. Among other things, the book summarized the crucial techniques they’d pioneered in that Rothamsted tea room. One was the importance of randomization; it wouldn’t have been a rigorous test of Bristol’s ability if the ordering of the cups was somehow predictable. Another was how to arrive at a scientific conclusion. Fisher’s basic statistical recipe was simple: start with an initial theory—he called it the “null hypothesis”—then test it against data. In the Rothamsted tea room, Fisher’s null hypothesis had been that Bristol couldn’t tell the difference between tea-then-milk and milk-then-tea. Her success in the resulting experiment showed Fisher had good reason to discard his null hypothesis.

But what if she’d only got seven out of eight correct? Or six, or five? Would that mean the null hypothesis was correct and she couldn’t tell the difference at all? According to Fisher, the answer was no. “It should be noted that the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation,” he later wrote. “Every experiment may be said to exist only in order to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis.” If Bristol had got one or two wrong, it didn’t necessarily mean she had zero ability to distinguish milk order. It just meant the experiment hadn’t provided strong enough evidence to reject Fisher’s initial view that it made no difference.

If Fisher wanted experiments to challenge null hypotheses, he needed to decide where to set the line. Statistical findings have traditionally been deemed “significant” if the probability of obtaining a result that extreme by chance (i.e. the p-value) is less than 5 percent. But why did a p-value of 5 percent become such a popular threshold?</p></b>

                <p>South Korea's Samsung Electronics has announced that co-CEO Han Jong-hee has passed away while treating a heart attack. According to Samsung, co-CEO Jeon Yong Hyun, who was appointed a week before Han passed away, is expected to take over the role.

Han joined Samsung in 1988 and after several turning points he became the head of the consumer division in 2021. Previously, he had a track record of leading the good performance of the display sector. Samsung is fiercely competing with other tech giants, including Apple, NVIDIA and Google, mainly in the semiconductor and smartphone sectors. Han's funeral is scheduled to be held on Thursday, with his wife and three children left behind.

What is the impact on Samsung?

Although the co-CEO has been recently appointed, there is a high possibility that Samsung will look for a replacement for Han's role in overcoming mobile, television, home appliances, digital appliances, device experience businesses, and more. "Han's expertise and leadership were outstanding, so it may take some time to find a substitute," said Jae Yong Bang, a PhD faculty member at the USC Department of Computer Science and software development director at Quandary Peak Research.

"It is unclear at this point whether Samsung will return to a dual-headed system, but it seems unlikely that his death will lead to a sudden change in the company's overall strategy," Bang points out. For the time being, Samsung may place emphasis on long-term research into core technologies such as semiconductors, materials, equipment, and AI. Han announced at CES in January that it will be delayed in developing Home AI, which will link the company's products together.

However, given Samsung's huge organizational structure, some say its impact on consumers is limited. "I don't think that day-to-day operations and customer service will change dramatically, at least in the near future," Van said.

                <p>On March 25th, OpenAI added an image generation function that utilizes the GPT-4o model to its flagship interactive AI, ChatGPT. This allows you to natively create AI images in the ChatGPT window without using "DALL·E." Starting on the same day, it will be available on free plans and paid Plus, Pro, and Team plans, and will soon be available on Enterprise and Edu plans. It can also be used by the company's video generation AI, Sora.

OpenAI's previous efforts to generate images have been mainly focused on DALL-E. DALL-E allows you to generate a variety of images, including sci-fi space opera-style scenes and stock photo styles. One of the reasons why DALL·E is particularly highly regarded among AI image generation tools is that its unique dialogue makes it easy to create and edit images. Fortunately, this "edit in chat" function will also be introduced in ChatGPT. DALL-E will continue to be available in the future.

Image generation using the GPT-4o also focuses on business-related images, such as infographics and diagrams. Therefore, OpenAI has improved text rendering. This is extremely demanding, as AI often causes halcination and makes words in images go crazy. The new feature also allows you to edit uploaded images.

In its announcement, OpenAI said that it will continue to improve the AI ​​models in the future, as they are not perfect and have limits.

Similar to DALL·E, images generated with ChatGPT do not add any visible watermarks. OpenAI adds industry-standard C2PA metadata to images, making it possible to tell it is AI generation. Regarding safety, the company will block image generation requests that violate the company's content policy. The company has said it has "strengthened restrictions" particularly on nude and graphic expressions of violence.

                <p>China would have created a network of ghost companies to obtain confidential information from former American federal employees fired by Elon Musk. This was revealed by an exclusive investigation of Reuters published on March 25th. According to the reconstruction of the press agency, a group of fictitious companies, all attributable to the Chinese technological company Smiao Intelligence, would be publishing working ads specifically designed to attract government officials who remained without employment after the massive cuts to the American public administration of the first months of 2025. These layoffs, decided by President Trump in collaboration with the Department for Government efficiency (Doge). Musk have left thousands of federal employees suddenly unemployed.

According to Reuters' reconstruction, this network uses strategies already used in the past by Chinese intelligence to collect sensitive information. In particular, the Recruitment Ciinesi companies focus on people with government experience, potentially still in possession of confidential information or contacts in the administration, which are in economic difficulties after a sudden dismissal. In these conditions, candidates could be more inclined to accept a job offer without deepening too much the nature of the company, especially if the opportunity seems to enhance their institutional experience.

The alleged strategy of China

The discovery was possible thanks to the research of Max Lesser, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Think Tank based in Washington. Lesser has identified four consultancy and recruitment companies that would show evident connections to each other: websites hosted on the same server, similar content and other elements that suggest a common origin. Among the identified companies, it reveals Strategies presents itself as a "professional consultancy company on geopolitical risk". Until recently, this company had an active LinkedIn page with work ads explicitly looking for people with experience at American government agencies. A particular announcement for a "geopolitical risk consultant" had collected over 200 applications before being removed with the entire LinkedIn page of the company.

Reuters attempts to contact and verify the real existence of revenge strategies have revealed a series of anomalies that confirm its fictitious nature: the American telephone number indicated on the site is no longer active; The physical address to Boulder, Colorado, leads to a company that offers registration services for companies; The address in Singapore leads to a university building where the company is non -existent. A person who presented himself on LinkedIn as an employee of Rivemerge revealed to Reuters that he had been contacted by an individual known to a networking event in China, who paid him 1,000-2,000 dollars every two to three months to publish job advertisements.</p></b>

                <p>According to an announcement from Artificial Analysis, which operates a benchmark comparison site for AI models, DeepSeek V3 is currently at the top of the non-inference model, beating out of OpenAI, Grok and Google. The benchmark evaluated items such as inference ability, knowledge, mathematics, and coding.

Of course, the competition is heating up, and the rankings could soon change. On the other hand, it is also worth noting that this is the first time that the "openweight" model has taken the lead. This open weight means that DeepSeek V3 is completely open sourced and the entire model is made public to users. OpenAI is named "Open," but the details of ChatGPT training and model architecture remain private.

However, V3 is not a so-called "inference" AI model, so it is not that powerful. On the other hand, it has the advantage of being fast, low cost, and easy to use in many situations.

The DeepSeek V3 was released in December 2024, and the benchmark results confirmed it is an even more threatening American AI companies. DeepSeek released the R1 inference model for free in early 2025. This was the first high-level inference model to check recursively before answering, and was released by the masses. Furthermore, the DeepSeek R1 is attracting attention for its low cost operation.

However, inference-type AI models are suitable for research that deal with large-scale data, and are not suitable for general use compared to non-inferential models (GPT-4.5 and Google Gemini 2.0). However, non-inference is practical for many tasks because it can be operated quickly and cheaply. The rise of DeepSeek V3 shows that Chinese AI companies can fully compete with US companies using open source.

To combat this threat from China, OpenAI is calling on the Trump administration to remove restrictions on learning using copyrighted works. They argue that if fair use restrictions continue, US AI companies will no longer be able to compete with China.

                <p>Developers have long struggled to blend crypto functionality into games and services that people want to use because they’re enticing, not just for the opportunity to turn a quick profit. But CTG players waxed lyrical about the game, which became the talk of Crypto Twitter during the first two seasons.

“Financial incentives are the greatest [user] acquisition tool in the world, but very bad for retention,” says David Phelps, founder of crypto startup JokeRace, who played in the second season of CTG. “Tapping into social incentives is almost radical in crypto.”

CTG is partly a game of skill; each day, tribes of players compete in a challenge—typically some sort of crypto puzzle, scavenger hunt, or arcade game—with the goal of earning temporary immunity from elimination. But it’s predominantly a social game; one of politicking, alliance-building, maneuvering, and backstabbing. Each night, the tribes without immunity are tasked with voting out a varying number of their own players until only a handful remain. On the final day, a single winner is crowned by the eliminated players.

“You can’t just backstab your way to the top,” Dylan Abruscato, the creator of CTG, told WIRED in an interview last spring. “You need to play a ruthless but respected game.”

Nearly a decade ago, Abruscato was an executive at HQ Trivia, a live quizzing game that became a viral hit before the operation ran out of cash. CTG is a spiritual successor of sorts, pitched at a narrower audience: chronically online crypto fanatics.

After the debut season, each subsequent edition has had its own twist. In season two, all players were anonymous, and entry NFTs could be traded on the secondary market. This time, players had to register with an X account but were given a small chance to earn their way back into the game by way of resurrection. “Every season is its own unique social experiment,” says Abruscato. “I always want to keep players on their toes.”

When I spoke to Abruscato again ahead of the third season, he was careful not to say anything that might give me an undue advantage. But we did discuss the possibility that high-profile players might be targeted for elimination. I’m far from a household name, but given the animus toward journalists in some quarters of cryptoland, I decided to go undercover.

In my two-and-a-half years covering crypto, I have reported on all manner of frauds, bankruptcies, scams, and other morally dubious shenanigans. The common thread has been the extraction of wealth, which generally flows into the pockets of an already-wealthy or nefarious few at the expense of those who can least afford to lose.

But CTG struck me as different. It was an opportunity to embed among technologists convinced of the latent potential of crypto technologies, in an experiment that is far less about profit—despite players competing to win a pot of money—than about expressing crypto’s hacker culture and colorful lore.

I asked a random name generator to assign me an alter ego: Leo Westley. It had a ring to it. Then I created new Google and X accounts and picked up a burner SIM, knowing that players would be communicating over Telegram and working in shared spreadsheets, which they use to coordinate voting.</p></b>

                <p>Coding in Forth reminded me of the lawless dystopia in Mad Max. You make your own rules, subject to the limits of the context. You can redefine the IF statement if you so please. You can rewrite machine code instructions for a Word. You can even change Words during run time. Because Words become keywords themselves in Forth, you can create a language that’s optimized for a single purpose, packing commands that would otherwise be dozens of lines into just one. “In Forth, you’re creating your own language,” Leo Brodie, author of the first Forth textbook, Starting Forth, told me.

Machine Readable A regular column about programming. Because if/when the machines take over, we should at least speak their language.

The low-level nature of Forth, while key to its processing power, made programming feel foreign. It uses postfix, a form of mathematical notation that renders 2 + 1 as 2 1+ and which I found neither intuitive nor even really legible. And while most languages allow memory to be broken up and moved around, Forth is stack-based—meaning data is stored chronologically and managed on a last-in/first-out basis. I kept running into bugs, forcing myself to abandon programming conventions I had considered universal. I found myself struggling to speak the language of the machine.

When I emailed Dupras to ask for help, he compared using Forth to driving a stick. It’s more granular than C. Where the latter defines calling conventions, variable storage, and return stack management, Forth leaves it all up to the programmer. It directly interacts with memory the same way C does but far outperforms C in precision and efficiency. “People mistake Forth as just a language,” Dupras says. “It’s a way to interact with the computer.”

The reason Forth isn’t more popular is the same reason most of us drive automatics. The personal computing boom of the 1990s sparked an obsession with making tech fit your palm and making code easier to write. Languages were abstracted to protect programmers from themselves, and somewhere along the way, we got lost. Things became bloated for the sake of convenience and, in Dupras’ words, started “oozing inscrutable pus at every corner.”

“The way we understand efficiency is so skewed,” Dupras says. Forth is a scythe to Python’s lawnmower. “If you calculate the number of joules per blade of grass, you’ll find that the person scything is more efficient,” he says. “When you think of speed, you’d see the lawnmower as more efficient.” Forth forces you to be precise and memory-efficient—to marshal your resources carefully, as you would after the collapse. Dupras cuts his own lawn with a scythe, obviously. “At a certain point, you can go as fast as a lawnmower,” he says.

I began to find my way. Rather than sending bytes into the ether and trusting the system to figure out where they go, as I would in Python, I got used to being responsible for allocating and freeing memory. All I could think about was what was being stored, where it was being stored, and how much space it required. Each line of code suddenly bore weight. I was Immortan Joe, my laptop was my Citadel, and memory was my water.

Soon I found myself refining and revisiting my code like I would a run-on sentence. Instead of expecting the machine to anticipate my needs, I tried to think like the machine, to meet it more than halfway. And because I had to think twice, all the needlessly complicated acronyms that remind us to be concise in other coding languages—YAGNI (you aren’t gonna need it), KISS (keep it simple, stupid), DRY (don’t repeat yourself)—were rendered obsolete.</p></b>

                <p>The Santa Ana winds were already blowing hard when I ran the first worm simulation. I’m no hacker, but it was easy enough: Open a Terminal shell, paste some commands from GitHub, watch characters cascade down the screen. Just like in the movies. I was scanning the passing code for recognizable words—neuron, synapse—when a friend came to pick me up for dinner. “One sec,” I yelled from my office. “I’m just running a worm on my computer.”

At the Korean restaurant, the energy was manic; the wind was bending palm trees at the waist and sending shopping carts skating across the parking lot. The atmosphere felt heightened and unreal, like a podcast at double speed. You’re doing, what, a cybercrime? my friend asked. Over the din, I tried to explain: No, not a worm like Stuxnet. A worm like Richard Scarry.

By the time I got home it was dark, and the first sparks had already landed in Altadena. On my laptop, waiting for me in a volumetric pixel box, was the worm. Pointed at each end, it floated in a mist of particles, eerily stick-straight and motionless. It was, of course, not alive. Still, it looked deader than dead to me. “Bravo,” said Stephen Larson, when I reached him later that night. “You have achieved the ‘hello world’ state of the simulation.”

Larson is a cofounder of OpenWorm, an open source software effort that has been trying, since 2011, to build a computer simulation of a microscopic nematode called Caenorhabditis elegans. His goal is nothing less than a digital twin of the real worm, accurate down to the molecule. If OpenWorm can manage this, it would be the first virtual animal—and an embodiment of all our knowledge not only about C. elegans, which is one of the most-studied animals in science, but about how brains interact with the world to produce behavior: the “holy grail,” as OpenWorm puts it, of systems biology.

Unfortunately, they haven’t managed it. The simulation on my laptop takes data culled from experiments done with living worms and translates it into a computational framework called c302, which then drives the simulated musculature of a C. elegans worm in a fluid dynamic environment—all in all, a simulation of how a worm squiggles forward in a flat plate of goo. It takes about 10 hours of compute time to generate five seconds of this behavior.

So much can happen in 10 hours. An ember can travel on the wind, down from the foothills and into the sleeping city. That night, on Larson’s advice, I tweaked the time parameters of the simulation, pushing beyond “hello world” and deeper into the worm’s uncanny valley. The next morning, I woke to an eerie orange haze, and when I pulled open my laptop, bleary-eyed, two things made my heart skip: Los Angeles was on fire. And my worm had moved.

At this point, you may be asking yourself a very reasonable question. Back at the Korean place, between bites of banchan, my friend had asked it too. The question is this: Uhh … why? Why, in the face of everything our precarious green world endures, of all the problems out there to solve, would anyone spend 13 years trying to code a microscopic worm into existence?</p></b>

                <p>On March 25th, US time, Google announced a new AI inference model, "Gemini 2.5." The first release was Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, which is said to be the AI ​​model with the highest ratings on LMArena.

According to the company, the new Gemini 2.5 model is a "thinking model," which recursively analyzes the answers before presenting the final output to a person. According to the benchmarks, Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is at the top of the board in reasoning, science, mathematics and code editing. However, not all tests dominate. For example, in "LiveCodeBench v5," which measures coding ability, OpenAI's "o3-mini" is better.

Gemini 2.5 is available through Google AI Studio and the paid Gemini Advanced. Some Reddit users also reported that they had to delete and reinstall the Gemini app.

On X (formerly Twitter), users who have tried out Gemini 2.5 features have posted the results. Fei Xia, a researcher at Google DeepMind, has transformed a simple sketch of a three-tiered cake into a 3D printing file.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is such a strong coding model. I was able to use it to convert an image into a 3d-printable object, and bring it to live. More in https://t.co/aj28gvl7AX pic.twitter.com/6WHk3NydWD — Fei Xia (@xf1280) March 25, 2025

Google has released a video showing the Gemini 2.5 creating a simple endless runner game in just a few seconds. One X user posted that he created a simple flight simulation game.

Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

                <p>Pedagogy is the art of rehearsal, often say teachers. An adage that the Ministry of Education takes up its account in terms of awareness of phishing. Ten months after a first prevention campaign for college students from Yvelines and the Orleans-Tours Academy, rue de Grenelle has just renewed the operation throughout the territory.

Named Cactus, she took the form of an email sent, via digital work spaces, to more than 2.5 million college and high school students via more than 2.5 million.

Pirated video games

The recipients were invited "to click on a link to obtain pirated video games for free", recalls the ministry. An administration helped in this campaign by the section of the cybercrime of the Paris prosecutor's office, the cybermalveillance public interest group, the Ministry of the Interior and the CNIL.

In the end, almost one in twelve, more than 210,000 students, died of temptation. Their click returned them to the video shot last year by the public authorities.

A way of "raising awareness among families and empowering students," said the Ministry of Education. "It is a question of encouraging them to prudence so as not to expose themselves," continues the administration.

Educate and dissuade

In recent years, IT security problems with computer hygiene - such as the compromise of passwords due to infostealers, these password thieves programs - have destabilized national education. After a wave of malicious software, the institution must have temporarily suspended access to digital work areas.

However, the Cactus awareness campaign is not only doomed to improve the computer security of students. It is also a question of "dissuading" college and high school students "to commit illegal actions on the internet", recalls the rue de Grenelle.

One way, specifies the magistrate Johanna Brousse on the LinkedIn social network, to strengthen "prevention to avoid the passage through the prison box", by warning them of the criminal risk incurred. And thus counter the mirages of easy money.</p></b>

                <p>ベトナム ホーチミン市に近いビンズン省で、日本企業の東急を中心とした街づくりが進んでいる。「東急ガーデンシティ（TOKYU GARDEN CITY）」と名付けられた街にさまざまな日本企業が参画し、大型ショッピングセンター、人気飲食店、高級マンションなどが集積している。

その中で、ブランドとして大きな存在感を放っているのがパナソニックだ。電気、明かり、空気・水といったインフラ関連商材を中心に、さまざまなところでブランドロゴを確認できる。

そもそもパナソニックは、ビンズン省だけでなくベトナム全土において広く親しまれているようだ。例えば、ECM（electrical construction materials：電設資材）に分類される配線器具とブレーカー、はたまたIAQ（Indoor Air Quality：室内空気質関連機器）に分類される天井扇、換気扇、ポンプなどで、ベトナム国内のシェア1位を獲得しているという。

パナソニックがベトナム市場で愛される理由はどこにあるのか――国内外の戦略を担うパナソニック エレクトリックワークス（EW）や、現地関係者などに理由を聞いた。

並ぶ「1位」--100カ国で販売するパナソニックの配線器具

パソニックグループでは、配線器具などの「電気設備」領域は、パナソニックEWが管轄。パナソニックEW 電材＆くらしエネルギー事業部 電設資材ビジネスユニット 戦略企画統括 松本亮氏は、パナソニックグループ全体の年間売上高は約8.5兆円、パナソニックEWは約1兆円であり、「パナソニックEWは年間の比率で見た場合、グループ全体の売り上げで約12％、利益で約17％を占めることになる。全社に対して利益の面で貢献できている」（松本氏）と話す。パナソニックEWはパナソニックグループ内で重要な役割を担っているようだ。

配線器具の事業として見ると、前述のベトナムだけでなく日本でもシェア1位を獲得。世界での販売は100カ国に達し、東南アジア向け事業の中心と位置づけるベトナム、南アジア・中東・東アフリカの中心のインド、欧州・CIS・北アフリカの中心のトルコという、同社が核と設定する3カ国でも1位を獲得しているという。

海外の成長率も、核とする3カ国のGDP成長率の平均より高い。そのほか多くのアジア各国、アジア全体のシェアでも1位を獲得していると説明する。

しかし、松本氏は「フィリピンでは首位から3位に転落するなど、中国勢の脅威にさらされている。安泰とはいえない事業で、大規模設備投資とコスト力、代理店・工事店網のカバー率、SCMオペレーションといった強みなど、それぞれの地域で着実に伸ばせる所を伸ばし、事業を盤石化させたい」とし、今後も事業をより一層推進すると語る。

2021年で50周年--日越外交関係樹立より早いパナソニックのベトナム事業

日本のパナソニックではなく、ベトナムのパナソニックはどんな状況なのだろうか。

実はパナソニックは、日越外交関係樹立に先駆けてベトナムで事業を開始。2021年には事業進出50周年を迎え、現在は統括会社となるパナソニックベトナムのもと、6の事業会社で約6800人が事業に従事するという。

配線器具とブレーカー、天井扇、換気扇、ポンプといったベトナムでシェア1位の商材を取り扱うパナソニック エレクトリックワークス ベトナム（PEWVN）など、6社それぞれが各商材ごとに開発や製造、販売を手がけている状況だ。

配線器具という商材単体で見た場合も、ベトナムでの販売開始は1994年と、30年以上前までさかのぼる。現地法人としては2013年にPEWVNの前身となるパナソニック エコソリューションズ ベトナムを設立し、その翌年には新工場の稼働が開始。着実に生産基盤を拡大してきたという。

PEWVNでは現在、本社機能を持つ大規模工場と2014年創業の小規模拠点が連携し、ブレーカーやスイッチ、コンセントといった高品質な配線器具を生産。現地だけでなく世界市場への輸出も見据えた体制を確立しているという。いずれもビンズン省にあり、就労環境の創出という意味で寄与している点も特徴だ。

PEWVNでGeneral Directorを務める坂部正司氏は、「日本の人口が1億人を超えたのは、経済成長が盛んになった1970年代。ベトナムも人口が約1億人を超え、ちょうど成長期にさしかかっている。若手が多いことに加えて手先が器用、向上心がある、勤勉で真面目といった国民性があり、アジア主要国と比較して平均賃金が30～40％低い。ASEAN諸国で随一の地理的優位性もあり、製造業・輸出業向きで、今後の成長も期待できる魅力的な場所」と話す。2024年には422KWのソーラーパネルや最新の自動化設備を導入した第二生産棟（新棟）の増築が完了し、事業をさらに推進すると意気込む。

迫る中国企業--30年来の現地パートナーと対抗

パナソニックの現地における大きな原動力として欠かせない存在が、ともに歩み始めて30年来という現地パートナーのNanoco（ナノコ）グループだ。

ベトナム全土に21の営業所を保有し、人口の97％をカバー。物件などに継続的に投資しており、今後は約2時間以内に製品を供給できる体制を構築する予定だという。

Nanocoグループ CEOを務めるルーン・リュク・ヴァン氏は、パナソニック製品について「従来のベトナムではプレミアムブランドとして認識されていたが、昨今はさまざまな価格帯の製品が展開されている。ベトナム人の所得水準も上昇しつつあるが、パナソニック製品を持っていると自慢できることに変化はない」と話す。

実際に市街に出ると、さまざまな電気店でパナソニックブランドを発見できる。その中の1つ「Nguyen giang」では、パナソニックの全商材の年間販売上は約200億VND（約1億1000万円）と、ベトナムで受け入れられていることがよくわかる。

ヴァン氏は一方で、中国企業の参入が新たな課題になりつつあることも加える。中でも中国企業は、市場の変化への素早い対応、消費者ニーズに合わせた強力な製品のカスタマイズ力などの特徴があるという。

「中国企業の強みはスピードと柔軟性にある。しかし、われわれもベトナム全土に2時間以内にアクセスできる。パナソニックが対応できるようフィードバックを早めるなど、今後も協力していきたい。お互いが協力して迅速性を確保すれば、負けずに発展できる」（ヴァン氏）とし、今後も両社のパートナーシップを深めたいと話した。

Greenland’s massive cap of ice, containing enough fresh water to raise sea levels by 23 feet, is in serious trouble. Between 2002 and 2023, Greenland lost 270 billion tons of frozen water each year as winter snowfall failed to compensate for ever-fiercer summer temperatures. That's a significant contributor of sea level rise globally, which is now at a quarter of an inch a year.

But underneath all that melting ice is something the whole world wants: the rare earth elements that make modern society—and the clean energy revolution—possible. That could soon turn Greenland, which has a population size similar to that of Casper, Wyoming, into a mining mecca.

Greenland’s dominant industry has long been fishing, but its government is now looking to diversify its economy. While the island has opened up a handful of mines, like for gold and rubies, its built and natural environment makes drilling a nightmare—freezing conditions on remote sites without railways or highways for access. The country's rich reserves of rare earths and geopolitical conflict, however, are making the island look increasingly enticing to mining companies, Arctic conditions be damned.

When President Donald Trump talks about the United States acquiring Greenland, it’s partly for its strategic trade and military location in the Arctic but also for its mineral resources. According to one Greenland official, the island “possesses 39 of the 50 minerals that the United States has classified as critical to national security and economic stability.” While the island, an autonomous territory of Denmark, has made clear it is not for sale, its government is signaling it is open to business, particularly in the minerals sector. Earlier this month, Greenland’s elections saw the ascendance of the pro-business Demokraatit Party, which has promised to accelerate the development of the country’s minerals and other resources. At the same time, the party’s leadership is pushing back hard against Trump’s rhetoric.

Rare earth elements are fundamental to daily life: These words you are reading on a screen are made of the ones and zeroes of binary code. But they’re also made of rare earth elements, such as the terbium in LED screens, praseodymium in batteries, and neodymium in a phone’s vibration unit. Depending on where you live, the electricity powering this screen may have even come from the dysprosium in wind turbines.

These minerals helped build the modern world—and will be in increasing demand going forward. “They sit at the heart of pretty much every electric vehicle, cruise missile, advanced magnet,” said Adam Lajeunesse, a public policy expert at Canada's St. Francis Xavier University. “All of these different minerals are absolutely required to build almost everything that we do in our high-tech environment.”</p></b>

                <p>Apple has announced that it will hold its annual developer conference, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) from June 9th to 13th, US time. On the first day there will be a special event at Apple Park, followed by an online session. In the keynote speech on the 9th, plans for software updates for iOS 19 will be announced for the iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.

If the rumors are correct, it appears that Apple's OS will be undergoing a major revamp. According to Bloomberg, new icons and menus will be introduced for iOS 19, iPadOS 19 and macOS 16, and the way devices are navigated and the way devices are navigated is changed. The purpose is to create a more consistent style across platforms, and is reportedly reminiscent of the company's "visionOS," an OS for mixed reality (MR) headsets.

"We are delighted to be able to hold another great WWDC this year with the developer community around the world," said Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of world wide developments. "We can't wait to showcase the latest tools and technologies that will help developers improve their capabilities and continue to innovate."

WWDC invitations usually don't arrive at this time of the year, and Apple tends to announce dates and other events a few weeks before the event. WWDC is open to all developers for free, but if you want to participate on-site at the event at Apple Park on June 9th, you will need to apply online.

At WWDC in 2024, Apple announced updates to iOS 18, Apple Intelligence, and Siri, which have not yet been realized.

                <p>Faced with the proliferation of computer attacks, cybersecurity has become an absolute priority for businesses, whether multinationals or smaller structures. A complex task, of course, but far from being insurmountable by opting for suitable solutions.

What are the consequences of a cyber attack?

In two words: many and varied

Before going into details, you should know that companies are not all equal to threats. A large -scale structure will generally have greater resources to protect itself, while an SME or a startup can be more vulnerable for lack of sufficient means. Each company must therefore assess its own vulnerabilities and adapt its protections according to its capacities. And then, money alone is not enough to protect a business. Without training, employees will not be able to identify the dangers, avoid certain errors and react to attacks.

The risks range from the loss of data sensitive to defamation campaigns, including attempts at phishing and blackmail. Between legal costs, costs to put an end to cyber attacks, or the possible stop of operations, financial losses can quickly become colossal.

However, these risks can be avoided. Simple solutions exist to help companies, whatever their size, to strengthen their safety without involving significant investments.

Threats weighing on businesses are manifested in different forms. Some are targeting personal data, online identity of employees and other digital assets. Others, however, directly target computer systems and networks. The Surfhark force is to deploy protections against all of these threats.

A VPN for secure navigation

By creating an encrypted tunnel, the VPN secures exchanges and protects navigation effectively against cyber attacks. Even in the event of an intrusion, the information remains unusable to pirates.

This protection is all the more essential during connections on public networks, whether in hotels, transport or cafes. Surfshark adds to this a "no log" policy, thus, no data is not kept service.

Surfhark alert detects data leaks

To protect yourself against an attack, it is essential to know if your personal information-email addresses, passwords, identifiers or bank data-have been exposed on the web.

Once informed, it is possible to react quickly by modifying its access and alerting the services concerned in order to limit the risks. With Surfshark Alert, users have a monitoring tool that constantly analyzes the web to detect any data leaks.

Surfhark antivirus neutralizes threats

Included in the Surfshark One subscription, the antivirus provides real -time protection by detecting and neutralizing threats before they cause damage. Among its features, specific protection for the webcam alert the user when an application or a site attempts to access it without authorization.

                <p>客観的に考えて、電動一輪車（EUC）に一度も乗ったことのない人がこの乗り物を見て怖く感じるであろうことは、よく理解できる。車輪が2つではなく1つしかない乗り物で、一体どうすればバランスを取れるのかと思うだろう。筆者は手すりを使って練習したが、わずか20分程度で乗れるようになり、家に帰るときは何もつかまなくても大丈夫なほどになっていた。筆者にできるのだから、ほとんどの人ができるはずだ。重要なのは、自分の身体を新しいものに適応させることである。

「InMotion V13 Challenger」は、初心者に最適な製品とは程遠い。このEUCの乗り方を練習している人々の話を聞いたこともあるが、InMotion V13は、高さが3フィート（約91cm）近くあり、重さも110ポンド（約50kg）ある。さらに、最高時速は56マイル（約90km）だ。しかし、経験豊富なライダーにとっては、こうした特徴こそが魅力になっている。これほど高速な乗り物に乗るときは、両脚の間にある車体の面積が大きい方がいいので、車体の高さと幅が重要になってくる。重量は、持ち運ぶのには適していないが、車輪を地面の上で安定させるのに最適だ。

確かに、1899ドル（約28万3000円）という価格を考えると、InMotion V13は身体的にも経済的にも覚悟がいる。だが、このような乗り物を乗りこなせるベテランライダーにふさわしい優秀なEUCを探している人にとって、InMotion V13は十分に価値がある製品だ。

デザインと特徴を紹介

InMotion V13 Challengerの特徴は、最適化された重量配分と洗練された形状だ。また、現在市販されているなかでも最上級の安全性を備えたEUCになるように設計されており、堅牢で革新的なバッテリー管理システムと車体の急停止を防ぐ予備のセンサーを搭載している。大型の22インチハイブリッドタイヤが、エアサスペンションと連携して衝撃を吸収し、110ポンド（約50kg）という重量のおかげで安定性が確保され、転倒を防止する。車高も比較的高い。

動力源は3024Wh、126Vのバッテリーだ。モーターの最大出力は1万Wで、トルク（回転力）は300N・m。最高時速は56マイル（約90km）に達する。充電は、5Aの充電器を使用して、4～6時間で完了する。走行可能距離は約88マイル（約142km）だが、速度やライダーの身体の大きさ、地形、風の状態などによって変化する。性能的に最高速度は簡単に超えることができるが、車体の急停止を防ぐために、速度の上限が設けられている。この安全措置のおかげで、ライダーが加速し続けようとしても車体から振り落とされることはなく、車両も制限速度内で、前進する動きとバランスを維持できる。

ただし、速度制限はアプリや車体から追加で設定することも可能だ。

InMotionのほかの製品と同様、V13もBluetoothで「iOS」アプリや「Android」アプリに接続して、機能を拡張したり、走行実績を追跡したりできる。アプリ内の統計情報では、走行実績やバッテリーの残量、車両の状態、温度、使用習慣などを確認することができる。

安全上の予防措置として、初期状態では、速度が時速56マイル（約90km）に達しないようになっており、ライダーはまずアプリから、最高速度のロックを解除することに同意しなければならない。設定した速度に達すると、車体が後ろに傾いてビープ音を発し、ライダーに警告する。

車体の前部には、2.4インチの小型LCDタッチスクリーンも搭載されているので、スマートフォンを使わなくても、現在の速度やバッテリー残量を確認したり、設定を調整したりできる。筆者が気に入っているもう1つの機能は、車体の電源をオンにするパスコードを設定できることだ。これは、外出中に車両をベビーカーコーナーに置いておきたいときに重宝する。パスコードを設定しておけば、誰かに勝手に電源をオンにされることもない。

前面と背面には保護用のケージが付いており、転倒や衝撃から車体を保護する。前面のケージは、使用しないときにスタンドとしても機能する。別売りのスタンドもあり、こちらは背面を下にして、車体を固定するタイプのものだ。筆者の場合、車から出し入れするときや、時々ではあるが階段を上るときにも、ケージの部分を利用している。

車輪の両側には折りたたみ式のフットパッドが付いている。頑丈で広さもあるのでグリップがしっかりしており、筆者のサイズ12（30cm）の靴でも安心して置くことができる。

さらに、電源がオンのときに点灯し続ける昼間走行用のLEDリングライト、暗い場所を走行する際に使用する18Wの明るいヘッドライト、視認性を高めるリアブレーキライトも搭載されている。

最後に、充電ポートが2つあるほか、モバイルデバイスの充電にUSB Type-AとType-Cのポートも付いている。

性能はいかに？

それでは、InMotion V13のような乗り物には、どのように乗ればいいのだろうか。EUCはどれもそうだが、V13で直立状態を保つ仕組みも驚くほど簡単だ。車体が前後のバランスを取り、ライダーが左右の動きを制御する。体重をつま先にかけると車体が前進し、かかとにかけると車体が減速または後退する。自転車に乗るのとよく似ている。身体がその乗り物に慣れると、習得するのになぜあんなに時間がかかったのだろうと不思議に思うはずだ（これは、InMotion V13にも、ほかの電動一輪車にも当てはまる）。

筆者はInMotion V13に乗って、1300マイル（約2092km）以上を走行した。そして、走行距離は今も増え続けている。選択肢はほかにもあるが、InMotion V13は今でも日常的に使用するお気に入りのEUCの1つだ（車体を持ち運ぶ必要がある場合は除く）。ミネソタ州やサウスカロライナ州、シカゴ、ニューヨーク市内への旅行にも持っていった。筆者がInMotion V13を旅行に持っていくのが好きな理由の1つは、SUVの車内であまり場所を取らないことだ（自転車はもっとかさばる）。それに、どんな場所でもパワーもスピードもしっかりと出るし、タイヤも大きいのでほとんどの道路や未舗装の道も問題なく走行できる。

筆者は身体が大きいので、このサイズの車両がもたらす安定感と安心感は本当にありがたい。ただし、注意点もある。InMotion V13は安定していて、矢のようにまっすぐに感じるが、高速走行時はロケットのようだ。最初のうちは、身体を傾けてカーブを曲がるのに苦労するが、しばらく練習すれば、スムーズに乗りこなせるようになる。

本稿執筆時点で、筆者の最高速度は時速48マイル（約77km）である。もっと速度を出せるスペースがあればいいのだが。

改善の余地もあり

InMotion V13には引き手となるハンドルが付いているので、車体を引いて歩くのも簡単だ。全体的にしっかりとした作りだが、使っているうちにハンドルのネジが緩んできたので、締め直さなければならなかった。これは、ネジ緩み止め用の接着剤を少し塗るだけで解決できるささいな問題だが、言及しておく価値はあるだろう。

もうひとつ気になるのが、車体の重量だ。小柄な人や体重の軽い人には少し重すぎて、操縦が難しいかもしれない。サスペンションも、使用しているうちに空気圧が下がる傾向があるため、定期的な点検が必要だ。付属のポンプを接続しなくても圧力をチェックできれば便利になると思う。ただし、乗り物はどれもそうだが、一番良い状態の性能を維持したければ、定期的なメンテナンスが必要になってくる。

結論

品質や性能、速度、安全性に関して言えば、InMotion V13は間違いなく称賛に値する。個人的には、かなりお気に入りの製品だ。EUCを試してみたいと思っている大柄なライダーにとって、素晴らしい選択肢となっている。でこぼこ道や荒れた道路、草の生い茂った丘も問題なく走行でき、スムーズで安定した乗り心地を提供する。

筆者はフル装備でバックパックを背負い、推奨最大体重の265ポンド（120kg）よりも重い状態で乗ったこともあるが、走行に全く影響はなかった。十分なパワーを備えるInMotion V13 Challengerは、乗り物に強さと性能を求める人にとって、頑丈で信頼できる選択肢といえる。

                <p>Apple has just announced the date of its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) annual. The Keynote to open the event will take place on June 9 at the Apple Park, marking the start of the event to be held until June 13. This WWDC 2025 will present the new generation of software for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, Vision Pro and Apple TV.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

Present developers, face -to -face or virtually, can learn, exchange and participate in many activities and consultations to optimize their applications. Apple will take advantage of the event to present the latest software updates, including iOS 19, MacOS 16, Watchos 12, Visionos 3 and TVOS 19.

"We are delighted to celebrate an exceptional new year with WWDC and our global developer community," said Susan Prescott, vice-president of relations with Apple world developers. “We are impatient to share the latest tools and technologies that will give power to developers and help them continue to innovate. »»

A major redesign of the iOS interface

Apple should make major changes to the user experience of the iPhone. In particular by rethinking icons, menus, applications and windows. What bring to iOS a new style. This major software overhaul would have been the first for at least 12 years.

Apple has not made significant changes to its user interface since the release of iOS 7 in 2013. One of the goals pursued would be to unify the user experience on iPhone, Mac and iPad. And also to make navigation more intuitive.

Before the event, Apple organized the Swift Student Challenge, an annual coding competition for students from around the world. This competition encourages developers aged 13 and over to create an application with Swift Playgrounds. The winners will receive Apple gifts and prices. And the 50 best participants will be able to attend WWDC.</p></b>

                <p>テクノロジー製品に開発の遅れはつきものだ。しかし、Appleが先頃、音声アシスタント「Siri」の次世代バージョンが遅れていると認めた（リリース時期について、「今後1年以内」という以上の詳細は発表されていない）ことは、秘密主義を常とする同社としては異例といえる。

さらに異例なのは、その問題が次世代のSiriにとどまらないことだ。現行バージョンでも後退しているように思われる。Redditのスレッド（およびDaring FireballブログとMacRumorsの報道）によると、「What month is it?（今は何月？）」とSiriに尋ねると「I don't understand（分かりません）」という答えが返ってきたという。筆者が試しても、確かに同じ結果だった。「iOS 18.3.2」版のSiriと、話題を呼んでいる「Apple Intelligence」が搭載された最新の「iOS 18.4」ベータ版のSiriのいずれでもだ。

このくらい基本的な質問なら、解析リクエストの負荷が高いとは考えにくい。その答えが想定されてこなかったのは、昏睡状態から目覚めたとか、無人島から救出されたという状況でしか出てこないような質問だからなのかもしれない。それでも、「Pixel 6 Pro」で同じ質問をすれば現在の日付が返ってくる（公平を期すために言っておくと、厳密には求めたとおりの回答ではないが、少なくとも正しい情報は提示された）。

こうした現状のすべてに、株主も、またジャーナリストや顧客も歯がゆい思いを抱いている（もっとも、われわれジャーナリストはいやおうなく慣れてしまっているが）。Appleの音声アシスタントに関して一定水準の能力を期待していてそれが得られないとなれば、なおのことだ。そして、その秘密主義が原因で、例のごとく何カ月も「Appleは人工知能（AI）で後れをとっている」という批判がなされ、Apple Intelligenceの発表につながることになった。以上の点を踏まえれば、社内で（また）AI分野をめぐる幹部の刷新があったという報道にも説明がつく。

投資家やメディアの圧力に対して（Appleとしては）異例の措置をとったこと、そして準備万端とはいえない機能を発表したことで、Appleは事態を悪化させてしまったのかもしれない。アナリストや報道各社、ファンなどの推測が正しかったと裏付けた結果になっている。

これまでどおり、秘密主義に徹して、出荷準備が整う直前くらいまで特性や機能のプレビューを公開しない方が、Appleの動きとしては賢明だろう。

Appleへの膨らむ期待

製品開発に関して、Appleの取り組み方はこれまで一貫していた。発表できる状態になるまで終始、必要とあれば何年でも、プロジェクトを秘密裏に進めるという方針だ。発表の時点では完全とは言えないことも多いが、一般向けに発表できるようになった段階で、中核的な特性と機能はすでに存在している。

その例はいくらでも挙げることができる。「Vision Pro」が製品としては成功していないという意見は妥当だ。高価であり、顧客や開発者の間で広く採用されてはいない。装着感も快適ではない。しかし、処理能力、マイクロOLEDディスプレイ、「visionOS」といった根幹的な要素は、確固たる基盤としてすべてそろっている。

ある製品の存在が早い段階で大々的にリークされたとき、Appleは大抵最終版を発表する。まだ機能が限定的な段階でも、である。2007年の「Macworld Expo」開催前まで、Appleは携帯電話を発表するだろうという予測が多かった。特に、当時は「iTunes」を搭載していた携帯電話「Motorola ROKR E1」で失敗したという背景もあったからだ。しかし、物理キーボードを廃した全面スクリーン型で、フルブラウザーまで搭載するなど、それまでの携帯電話とかけ離れた製品になるとは誰ひとり予想していなかった。

今回の状況が当時と異なるのは、AppleがApple Intelligenceの基盤として進化したSiriを約束したのは、投資家やメディア各社、アーリーアダプターに期待をかけられ、それに反応した形のように見えるということだ。各関係者は、単にAIが採用されるだけではなく、AIを即時に利用できることにこだわっている。Appleは、競争力のある機能を携えたAI市場の積極的なリーダーと目されなければならない。そして、その機能の実現も間近なはず、という期待がある。

今後見込まれているものといえば、ほかにもある。毎年恒例の新型「iPhone」の投入だ。Appleも、他のスマートフォンメーカーと同様、新しい端末の売り上げがAIによって大きく左右されると認識している。現在は、「iPhone 15 Pro」と、登場から半年経った「iPhone 16」シリーズの各モデルしか、Apple Intelligenceを実行できるだけの処理能力を備えていない。だからこそ、2024年の「WWDC」の基調講演ではApple Intelligenceが強調された。そして、間もなくSiriがインテリジェントなエージェントとなって、iPhoneのあらゆる部分からデータを取得し、「母の乗った飛行機の到着予定時刻は？」といった問いに答えられるようになることも約束されたのである。

LLMは想定通りに進化するわけではない

「ChatGPT」をはじめとする大規模言語モデル（LLM）は、記録的なペースで進化を続けている。会話の機能はますます自然になり、大量の情報をうまく要約できるようになってきた。例えばリアルタイムの文字書き起こしにしても、いつも手書きのメモを相手に格闘していた筆者のような人にとっては、空前の変化をもたらしている。

とはいっても、そうしたAIの技術はGoogleやOpenAIが期待するとおりの進化を遂げているわけではない。われわれのことを知り尽くしているインテリジェントなエージェントに自社のAIの未来を賭けているのは、Appleだけではないのである。

おそらくAppleは、Googleと同じく、LLMの機能が進化する驚異的なペースを前にして、現在直面している数々の困難も、何回かの簡単なバグ修正とAIモデルの再コンパイルで解決できそうだと判断したのだろう。その困難を解消できれば、各機能をつなぎ合わせて次世代のSiriとして発表するのは、数カ月でできる。そう見込んだのかもしれない。

しかし、その期待どおりには進んでない。AIのハルシネーションや不適切なデータが依然として問題になっている。食習慣として1日1つ小さな石を食べるべき、というおかしなAIの提案に従うわけにはいかないだろう。

Appleが腐心している理由は、Siriの開発計画を遅らせなければならないことだけではなく、それを公にしなければならない点にもあるのではないか。たとえ次世代のSiriが近い将来に登場しないとしても、引き続きApple Intelligenceの機能を改善していくチャンスは十分にある。「iOS 19」や「iPhone 17」の各モデルに対する取り組みと、「WWDC 2025」に向けた準備が進行していることは間違いない。有能なアシスタントに対する期待が薄らいだからには、Siriの未来はここから良くなっていくのかもしれない。

                <p>While listening to music or podcasts, you may want to adjust the volume without unlocking it. Many people probably press the volume button on the side of the iPhone, but the adjustment range using this button is constant, so it may be difficult to fine-tune it, such as wanting to make it a little larger or smaller.

However, if you have updated to the latest iOS 18.2, you will be able to redisplay the volume bar on the lock screen. You can now perform finer volume adjustments without unlocking the lock.

In fact, Apple removed the volume bar from the lock screen with iOS 16, which was released in 2022, but now it can be viewed again in iOS 18.2 in December 2024. The setup procedure is as follows:

1. Open Settings

2. Choose accessibility

3. Select "Audio and Visual" in the "Heady Support" column

4. Turn on "Always Show Volume Control"

When you enable this function, you can adjust the volume bar on the lock screen to your desired size, such as in the gym or train, even when you are playing music or videos in the background.

Task management

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data

AI at the service of companies

Their goal? Fluidify collaboration and maximize the efficiency of professional exchanges. A promising advance, and above all, saved time for the teams.

A meeting agent synonymous with time saving

This agent is distinguished by his ability to join your live meetings as a virtual participant.

Thanks to a voice command, he can answer questions based on information from your company's database. It supports certain monitoring tasks, such as meeting meetings or writing emails, thus saving time and efficiency for teams.

This assistant is gradually deployed to all Otter.ai users for virtual meetings on Zoom. Compatibility with Microsoft Teams and Google Meet is planned in the coming months.

A commercial agent with real -time coaching

This agent provides real -time coaching for salespeople related to customers.

He is able to accompany them throughout their exchanges, he also provides advice, especially during difficult situations.

In the near future, Otter plans to develop similar agents for other sectors such as marketing, recruitment, and many others. This agent is compatible with all virtual meeting services.

Autonomous demonstrations

Finally, the AI ​​responsible for commercial development can achieve demonstrations of live products independently.

For example, visitors to your website can discover a product instantly, without having to solicit an employee.

Optimize meetings

Originally specialized in voice transcription, Otter.a has expanded its offer to become a major player in assistance during meetings.

In June 2023, the company unveiled a cat AI agent, capable not only to participate in meetings, but also to answer questions relating to shared or tackled content.

After each meeting, AI is also able to generate summaries, actions, follow-up emails and even blog articles. This innovation marks a new step in the commitment of the company in the field of artificial intelligence and automated chatbots.</p></b>

                <p>Openai has unveiled a new version of the Chatgpt vocal mode, aimed at making the conversation experience more fluid and natural. This update allows the voice assistant to better manage interactions by avoiding interrupting the user too quickly. From now on, he takes into account the breaks in the conversation without automatically supposing the end of a reflection, thus filling one of the current defects of vocal assistants.

Despite the presence of this feature since its launch, the advanced vocal mode of Chatgpt was still suffering from premature cuts, making prolonged exchanges less natural than with a human interlocutor. This version improves silences management: as the demonstration video shows, the assistant remains attentive even after a long break and only speaks when the user has completed his intervention.

The voice assistant has also been updated to gain personality, which Optai describes as "more engaging, direct and concise". Result: it is supposed to appear more "natural" and less robotic. This difference seems very subtle, and is ultimately a preference question.

Advanced voice mode test on the iPhone 16 Pro

Associated with the action button of the iPhone 16 Pro, the use of the chatgpt vocal mode is done naturally.

From the first interaction, a difference is felt: the assistant marks a longer waiting time before responding, adopting a less hasty and more natural rhythm.

When questioning the AI ​​about the news introduced by this update, she explains that interactions are now more natural. "I can answer in a way that looks more like a real conversation. I can adapt my tone, ask additional questions and, in general, streamline exchanges! »»

An evolution that promises to further improve the user experience for those who rely on AI on a daily basis.

The ability of AI to adapt its tone is particularly impressive, filling a lack often observed in vocal assistants: the inability to reproduce the nuances of a human conversation. To put this functionality to the test, we have expressed contrasting emotions, both depressed and optimistic. In each case, the assistant adjusts his voice: adopting a softer and more understanding tone, then becoming more playful and dynamic.</p></b>

This week, Google announced Gemini 2.5, its "smartest" model.

According to the company, this is an "experimental version of version 2.5 pro, at the cutting edge of technology on a wide range of benchmarks and hiding largely at the top of the Lmarena ranking".

Tested on an even more demanding new benchmark

More specifically, Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental surpassed O3 Mini of Openai and Claude 3.7 Anthropic Sonnet on Humanity's Last Exam (Hle), a benchmark recently created to fight against saturation, or the problem of the too great facility of industrial tests for rapidly evolving models.

Hle is therefore a relatively more difficult test to succeed.

Gemini 2.5 obtained a score of 18.8 % against 14 % for O3 Mini (evaluated only using text problems, without images) and 8.9 % for Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

Improvements in terms of reasoning and multimodality

Already at the top of the Chatbot Arena ranking, the new model has also surpassed its competitors on current reference criteria in science, mathematics and coding, but generally with a lower margin, which is now predictable given the speed with which the new models are evolving.

Google indicated that Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental presented improvements in terms of reasoning, multimodality and agent capacities, even from a simple command line.

Google has announced that Gemini 2.5 Pro is available today with a contextual window of a million tokens for users of Gemini Advanced via Google AI Studio and the Gemini application, and that it will soon be available on Vertex AI. The company added that it would publish the prices in the coming weeks.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Wednesday it was a “mistake” for national security officials to discuss sensitive military plans on a group text chain that also included a journalist — a leak that has roiled President Donald Trump’s national security leadership.

Speaking before the House Intelligence Committee, Gabbard said the conversation included “candid and sensitive” information about military strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. But as she told senators during testimony on Tuesday, she said the texts did not contain any classified information.

“It was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added,” Gabbard said.

Wednesday’s hearing was called to discuss an updated report on national security threats facing the U.S. Instead, much of the focus was on the text chain, which included Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and other top officials.

Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was also added, and on Wednesday his publication released more details from the chats, showing the level of detail they offered about the strikes.

Democrats have demanded an investigation into the sloppy communication, saying it may have exposed sensitive military information that could have jeopardized the mission or put U.S. service members at risk.

The National Security Council has said it will investigate the matter, which Trump on Tuesday downplayed as a “glitch.” Goldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, who was in the group chat and has taken responsibility for the lapse.

Even though the texts contained detailed information on military actions, Gabbard, Ratcliffe and the White House have all said none of the information was classified — an assertion Democrats flatly rejected on Wednesday.

“You all know that’s a lie,” Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, told Ratcliffe and Gabbard, who said that any decisions to classify or declassify military information falls to the secretary of defense.

Several Democrats on the panel said Hegseth should resign because of the leak.

“This is classified information. It’s a weapon system, as well as a sequence of strikes, as well as details of the operations,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois. “He needs to resign immediately.”

Ratcliffe defended his use of Signal as “appropriate” and said questions over the Signal leak have overshadowed the military operation targeting the Houthis.

“What is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,” he told lawmakers. “That’s what did happen, not what possibly could have happened.”

The discussion at times grew heated as Ratcliffe and Democratic lawmakers spoke over one another. At one point, Rep. Jimmy Gomez, an Illinois Democrat, asked whether he knew whether Hegseth was drinking alcohol when he participated in the chat.

“I think that’s an offensive line of questioning,” Ratcliffe angrily replied. “The answer is no.”

Ratcliffe and Gomez then began shouting over each other as Gomez sought to ask a follow-up question. “We want to know if his performance is compromised,” Gomez said.

Wednesday’s hearing was called to discuss the intelligence community’s annual report on threats to American national security. The report lists China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as strategic adversaries, and notes that drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations pose other threats to Americans.

The presentations from top Trump appointees reflect Trump’s foreign policy priorities, including a focus on combating the flow of fentanyl, illegal immigration and human trafficking, and are taking place as Trump attempts to work out a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine three years after Russia’s invasion.</p></b>

                <p>The European Space Agency is inviting proposals to inject competition into the European launch market, an important step toward fostering a dynamic multiplayer industry officials hope, one day, will mimic that of the United States.

The near-term plan for the European Launcher Challenge is for ESA to select companies for service contracts to transport ESA and other European government payloads to orbit from 2026 through 2030. A second component of the challenge is for companies to perform at least one demonstration of an upgraded launch vehicle by 2028. The competition is open to any European company working in the launch business.

"What we expect is that these companies will make a step in improving and upgrading their capacity with respect to what they’re presently working on," said Toni Tolker-Nielsen, ESA's acting director of space transportation. "In terms of economics and physics, it’s better to have a bigger launcher than a smaller launcher in terms of price per kilogram to orbit."

"The ultimate goal is, we should be establishing privately developed competitive launch services in Europe, which will allow us to procure launch services in open competition," Tolker-Nielsen said in an interview with Ars.

From one to many?

ESA and other European institutions currently have just one European provider, Arianespace, to award launch contracts for the continent's scientific, Earth observation, navigation, and military satellites. Arianespace operates the Ariane 6 and Vega C rockets. Vega C operations will soon be taken over by Italian aerospace company Avio. Both rockets were developed with ESA funding.

The launcher challenge is modeled on NASA's use of commercial contracting methods beginning nearly 20 years ago with the agency's commercial cargo program, which kickstarted the development of SpaceX's Dragon and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus resupply freighters for the International Space Station. NASA later applied the same model to commercial crew, and most recently for commercial lunar landers.</p></b>

                <p>YouTube is changing how it counts views on YouTube Shorts to give creators a deeper understanding of how their short-form content is performing, the company announced on Wednesday.

Shorts views will now count the number of times a creator’s Short starts to play or replay.

In the past, a view had been counted after a Short was viewed for a certain number of seconds. As a result of this change, view counts will be higher moving forward.

YouTube says that it’s making the change because it heard that creators want to understand how often their Shorts are actually seen. The idea is that creators can now better showcase the full extent of their reach, making it easier to inform their content strategy and present their work to potential brand partners.

With this update, YouTube Shorts will now align its metrics with those of TikTok and Instagram Reels, both of which track the number of times your video starts or replays. YouTube notes that creators will now be able to better understand how their short-form videos are performing across multiple platforms.

Creators who are still interested in the original Shorts metric can view it by navigating to “Advanced Mode” within YouTube Analytics. The metric, now called “engaged views,” will continue to allow creators to see how many viewers choose to continue watching their Shorts.

YouTube notes that the change won’t impact creators’ earnings or how they become eligible for the YouTube Partner Program, as both of these factors will continue to be based on engaged views rather than the updated metric.

The change goes into effect on March 31.</p></b>

                <p>A Bit of News from the Android Development Front This Week, With Google Confirming That It’s Taking Android Development Completely Private. While That Might Sound Like A Big Change, If You Aren't An Android Developer, You’re Not Going to Notice Anything.

As of Right Now, Google Already Does Most of its Work on Android in Private, then Publishes Changes to AOSP (Android Open Source Project). Google HAS Confirmed that the move to full -private development is to allow for a more efficient process, with Android engineers not having to deal with merge conflicts that take place when combining code from aospel with its its internal code.

From an Average User’s Perspective, there won the be anything noticevy Different. Google HAS Confirmed That It is Still Committed to Publishing Android’s Source Code, Thought, The Frequency of Public Source Code Releases for Specific Android Components May Be Slightly Delayed.

Another Thing to Note is Leaked Information. A lot of time, we get information about Future Android Changes and Devices from Aosp. With Google Taking its Development Behind Closed Doors, We May See Less Of That. Personally, I'm all for that. It might be nice to have a surprise here and there instead of knowing about Everything 6+ months in advance.

For a real detailed look at what Google is Doing, we recommend reading the post from Android Authority. Mishaal does a great job of breaking it down.

                <p>U.S. intelligence chiefs faced new questions from Congress on Wednesday after the publication of additional text chains indicating that the Trump administration’s top national security officials shared detailed plans for an air attack on Yemen over a commercial messaging app. The Atlantic magazine, which this week revealed the existence of the chat group to which its editor in chief was inadvertently added, published portions of the messages it had previously withheld.

The more complete transcript showed that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted in the chat a detailed timeline of the planned strikes and listed the weapons to be used — including F-18 fighters, MQ-9 Reaper drones and sea-launched Tomahawk missiles. The magazine published the transcript a day after the administration’s top spy chiefs had insisted, under oath before a Senate panel, that the chats contained no classified information.

Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee immediately seized on those statements Wednesday morning as the same spy chiefs again took the witness stand for what was supposed to be a routine annual hearing on the biggest threats facing the United States.

Instead, Rep. Jim Himes (Connecticut), the top Democrat on the committee, read back the previous day’s testimony to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe — who, along with Vice President JD Vance, national security adviser Michael Waltz and others, had participated in the group chat.

Senators had asked the officials on Tuesday whether the Signal chat included “information on weapons packages, targets or timing,” to which Gabbard responded that she couldn’t recall, Himes noted.

He then read aloud from a text message from Hegseth that was contained in the fuller transcript published Wednesday morning:

“TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch

1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)

1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME — also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)

1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)”

Himes looked up: “Do either of the directors want to reflect on their testimony yesterday?”

“My answer yesterday was based on my recollection, or the lack thereof,” Gabbard said.

“So … less than two weeks ago, you were on a Signal chat that had all of this information about F-18s and MQ-9 Reapers and targets on strike, and you, in that two-week period, simply forgot that that was there?” Himes asked. “That’s your testimony?”

“My testimony is I did not recall the exact details of what was included there,” Gabbard said.

Himes then quizzed Gabbard on her familiarity with her office’s own classification guidance for information, after she claimed again Tuesday that the information in the Signal chat was not classified.

Himes read aloud from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s classification guidance.

“I’m reading from your classification guidance, and the criteria is ‘information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack.’ Do you recall what [level] your own guidance would suggest that that be classified?” Himes asked.

“I don’t have the specifics in front of me,” Gabbard responded.

“Let me help you,” Himes said. According to the guidance governing the classification criteria from Gabbard’s office, such information “should be classified as top secret,” he said.

The new details of the leak, published an hour before the House Intelligence hearing, triggered an immediate escalation in the chorus of Democratic lawmakers calling for the resignations of Hegseth, Waltz and other chat participants.

“Crime and cover up, all in one,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (Virginia), the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote on X. “This entire team needs to go — right now.” Connolly is among the dozens of senior Democratic lawmakers who by the end of the day Wednesday had demanded that Hegseth and Waltz testify before Congress.

“The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee, would not be classified, you all know, is a lie,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), another member of the committee, said to Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials Wednesday during the hearing.

“That’s ridiculous,” Castro continued. “I’ve seen things much less sensitive be presented to us with high classification, and to say that it isn’t is a lie to the country.”

Gabbard acknowledged Wednesday that inadvertently including a journalist on the Signal chat was a “mistake,” and she told the House committee that Waltz “has taken full responsibility” for the incident and that the National Security Council is conducting an in-depth review of what happened.

It was a greater degree of contrition shown than in the previous day’s hearing, even as Gabbard tried to distance herself from the scandal, saying she was “not playing a very specific role” in the group chat. She reiterated the claim that the information shared there was not classified.

She also cited a lawsuit, filed Tuesday by the government watchdog group American Oversight, as a reason that she was “limited in [her] ability to comment further on that specific case.”

The lawsuit — which names Gabbard, Hegseth, Ratcliffe and other chat participants — alleges that they violated federal records laws by using Signal for high-level national security deliberations. The lawsuit also seeks “to prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records.”

According to screenshots of the fuller transcript of the Signal chat, Waltz set the “disappearing” time on the messages to four weeks, meaning that it should still be intact on the participants’ phones. Officials who delete the messages would be violating U.S. law, the lawsuit says.

The House intelligence hearing grew deeply contentious at times Wednesday, as Democrats and Ratcliffe repeatedly shouted over one another. The committee’s Republican chairman, Rep. Rick Crawford (Arkansas), came to the defense of the government witnesses and blamed the Biden administration for a “pattern of lapses” in which political motives drove faulty intelligence assessments in recent years.

The intelligence community’s behavior during the Biden administration means now that “many of our citizens lack trust” in U.S. intelligence agencies, Crawford said.

Earlier Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the Atlantic’s reporting a “hoax” and claimed falsely to reporters that the magazine had conceded that the Signal chat messages did not amount to “war plans.” The magazine has not made a statement to that effect.

“I know a lot of folks in this administration were saying that they’re going to take on the establishment and drain the swamp,” Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-California) told the administration’s senior intelligence officials at the House intelligence hearing. “But you have become that swamp in a matter of days,” he added. “Not weeks or months. Days.”

Rep. Chrissy Houlahan’s frustration erupted when Gabbard reiterated an earlier claim that she was not in a position to comment on the appropriate classification for the information shared over the Signal chat because it fell under the purview of the Defense Department’s classification guidance.

“This chat did not have the auspice of being a DoD chat,” Houlahan (D-Pennsylvania) said in exasperation, waving her hand. “There’s no such thing as labeling it as DoD.” She added that Gabbard, under U.S. law, has “an obligation, when you think there has been a tangible, significant leak of information, to instigate an investigation.”

Houlahan and other Democrats lamented that their obligation to probe the group chat incident had prevented them from spending their limited question time on the intended subject of the hearing: the intelligence community’s assessment of the gravest national security threats facing the nation.

Republican members of the committee sought periodically on Wednesday to redirect the hearing discussion to that original purpose, but they also took the opportunity to blast Democrats for their questions and to echo the administration’s defense of the Signal incident.

The major national security concerns of the day — including the administration’s focus on confronting drug cartels and the growing cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea — largely remained, as they had in the Senate committee hearing, overshadowed by what some are now calling “Signal-gate.”

Trump inherited an array of foreign policy challenges when he began his second presidential term in January, including two U.S.-supported war efforts, high levels of illegal migration across America’s southern border, and an increasingly sophisticated and belligerent China.

The United States has funneled billions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine over the past three years to support its fight to expel Russian forces, which invaded the country in 2022, and Trump campaigned in part on bringing an end to that conflict.

But Democrats have warned that the president’s actions and rhetoric during his first two months in office — particularly, friendliness toward Russia and hostility toward traditional adversaries — have only made Americans less safe.

In his opening statement Wednesday, Himes noted that the unclassified report submitted by the officials to his committee in advance of the hearing was reassuring.

“I found a lot of continuity in the [intelligence community’s] assessment about critical threats to our national security,” Himes said. Like last year’s report, intelligence officials remained focused on the “threats from our principal adversaries China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.”

But Trump’s actions tell a different story, Himes said. While the report identifies Russia as “an enduring potential threat to U.S. power, presence and global interests. ... As far as I can tell, we’re now on Team Kremlin.”

“I must say,” Himes added, “After these last two months, I’m worried the call may be coming from inside the house.”</p></b>

                <p>Trump administration officials continued to defend themselves Wednesday against claims that they mishandled classified information following the public release of a Signal group chat used to plan military strikes in Yemen.

Speaking at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard called the incident, in which a journalist was accidentally added to the chat, a “mistake.”

“It was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added to a Signal chat with high-level national security principals having a policy discussion about imminent strikes against the Houthis and the effects of the strike,” Gabbard said. “National security adviser [Mike Waltz] has taken full responsibility for this, and the National Security Council is conducting an in-depth review, along with technical experts, working to determine how this reporter was inadvertently added to this chat.”

However, Gabbard and other officials insisted that no classified information was shared. A report published Wednesday in The Atlantic revealed details of the chat, including attack plans that included specifics on timing and types of military assets used, following the outlet’s bombshell report Monday that Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg had been privy to a highly sensitive discussion among senior Trump administration officials.

“I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so,” said CIA Director John Ratcliffe. “I didn’t transfer any classified information. And at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success.”

Gabbard added that government officials have been encouraged to use encrypted apps like Signal for communication when in-person meetings are not possible, and said Signal is “pre-installed” on government devices. She pointed to December guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency directing “highly targeted individuals” to use only end-to-end encrypted communications.

“At times, fast-moving coordination of an unclassified nature is necessary where in-person, conversation is not an option,” she said.

However, a separate 2023 Defense Department memo warned against the use of “unmanaged” messaging apps, such as Signal, to transmit nonpublic information.

Democrats on the committee railed against the officials involved in the incident, who include Gabbard, Ratcliffe, Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

“Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships,” said Connecticut Democrat Jim Himes, ranking member of the panel. “I think that it’s by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now.”

Republicans on the committee largely sidestepped the issue, instead focusing their questions on other topics. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., asked a series of friendly questions that allowed Gabbard to confirm that no targets, locations, routes, methods, or unit names were discussed in the chat.

“Wouldn’t an operational plan contain that type of information?” he asked.

“Every operational plan I’ve ever seen has contained that information,” Gabbard responded.

Hegseth and Waltz both took a similar stance on Wednesday, suggesting the information discussed in the group chat was too vague to qualify as war plans that should be classified.

“So, let’s me get this straight. The Atlantic released the so-called ‘war plans’ and those ‘plans’ include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information,” Hegseth wrote on the social platform X Wednesday. “Those are some really shitty war plans.”

But Democrats vociferously pushed back against that idea, with more than one lawmaker displaying printed-out versions of the leaked Signal chat.

“The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee, would not be classified, we all know, is a lie,” said Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas. “That’s ridiculous. I’ve seen things much less sensitive be presented to us with high classification, and to say that it isn’t is a lie to the country.”</p></b>

                <p>Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX has allowed Chinese investors to buy stakes as long as the funds are routed through the Cayman Islands or other offshore hubs, according to reporting from ProPublica.

SpaceX is a defense contractor for the Pentagon, one that handles sensitive work like building a classified spy satellite network. Investment from China raises national security concerns, as it could grant a foreign adversary access to sensitive military technology, intelligence, or supply chains.

The insight into SpaceX’s investment approach surfaces new questions around Musk’s own ties with China, particularly amid reports that the Pentagon briefed Musk on a potential war with China. The billionaire executive who is leading the charge to gut federal spending has regularly met with Communist Party officials in China to discuss his business interests. Tesla’s Shanghai gigafactory builds about half of Tesla’s cars, and the country makes up a significant (if shrinking) chunk of its sales.

The details of how SpaceX allows Chinese investors to buy into the company came to light through the testimony of its CFO, Bret Johnsen, and major investor Iqbaljit Kahlon during a recent corporate dispute in Delaware.

The dispute centered around an aborted 2021 deal with a Chinese firm that had planned to buy $50 million of the company’s stock. When the news became public, SpaceX executives pulled out to avoid potential problems with national security regulators.

Kahlon testified in December that SpaceX finds it “acceptable” for Chinese investors to buy into the company through offshore vehicles, which are often used to keep investors anonymous.

Experts who spoke to ProPublica said this practice is troubling because it’s a potential sign that the company is taking active steps to conceal foreign ownership interests. It’s unclear exactly why SpaceX does this; the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While passive, noncontrolling stakes from foreign investors are welcome, it is the Trump administration’s position that adversaries like China use concealed investment strategies to obtain technologies, IP, and leverage in strategic industries. As a result, typically such investments would be vetted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

There’s no public record of SpaceX undergoing a formal CFIUS review. TechCrunch has reached out to CFIUS and SpaceX to learn more.

ProPublica’s reporting follows an investigation from the Financial Times that found that Chinese investors are using special-purpose vehicles to quietly funnel millions into Musk-controlled companies, including SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink.</p></b>

                <p>Before RJ Scaringe founded Rivian in 2009, he had micromobility on his mind.

More than a decade later, his musings took root in a small skunkworks program inside Rivian that set out to answer one question: Could the company’s technology be condensed down into something smaller and more affordable than its electric vans, trucks, and SUVs?

The answer was yes. But what they also discovered, Scaringe told TechCrunch, was that the skunkworks program was a bigger idea than could naturally exist within Rivian. That skunkworks — now a team of about 70 people hailing from Apple, Google, Specialized, Tesla, REI Co-Op, and Uber — has spun out of Rivian with a new name and $105 million in funding from Eclipse Ventures.

The startup, called Also, will exist as a stand-alone company from Rivian. But the two will be closely related. Rivian holds a minority stake, Scaringe will serve on its board, and Also will leverage the automaker’s tech, retail presence, and economies of scale. Chris Yu, Rivian’s VP of future programs, will be its president.

Also plans to put its flagship product into production next year for consumers in the United States and Europe. The startup will eventually launch vehicles tailored for consumer and commercial use in Asia and South America.

Scaringe said Also will show off its first vehicle designs at an event later this year. But he and the new company are being coy about what that first product will be — though the Rivian CEO did cop to it having a bike-like form factor.

“There’s a seat, and there’s two wheels, there’s a screen, and there’s a few computers and a battery,” Scaringe said.

He was clear that the goal is to make Rivian-quality micromobility available at affordable prices.

It’s “remarkable that a nice e-bike costs as much as it does,” Scaringe commented. “Like a nice ebike, you can spend $6,000 to $8,000 on, and really nice ones, over $10,000. That’s a reflection of a poorly developed supply chain that’s very, very, very tiered.”

Also’s electric roots

Scaringe initially set his ideas about e-bikes and micromobility aside as he built up a company around electric passenger vehicles like the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV.

But around 2019, former Rivian chief growth officer Jiten Behl — who spearheaded the funding round from Eclipse Ventures — said he and Scaringe began talking seriously about starting up an effort inside Rivian to seize that opportunity.

“There is a gap here,” Behl remembered telling Scaringe. “If you look at our cities, the infrastructure is such that you can’t have large cars driving around, but they still have mobility needs. We need something different, something smaller, something more flexible.”

A few years later in 2022, they brought on Chris Yu, the former chief product and technology officer at bike-maker Specialized to spin up the skunkworks team.

One of the few publicly available hints that Rivian was working on the project came in 2022 when the company filed a new trademark for bicycles and electric bikes, as well as their corresponding structural parts.

Scaringe talked about e-bikes at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2022, and Bloomberg reported in 2023 that Rivian was working on one, but the project remained under wraps.

Leveraging Rivian tech

Many companies have tried to design and sell e-bikes that stand out from the crowd. But Scaringe said those companies were limited in their ability to drive down costs, in large part because they are relying on a scattered supply chain and operating at low volumes.

Scaringe said the “aha moment” for Rivian was when he realized his company could change those variables. It also helps that Rivian is working on a lot of technology that is transferable to smaller form factors.

“Most companies in the micro space don’t have, like, a full power electronics team, and don’t have a team that develops the software OS, and are designing and building computers,” he said.

“Oh, wow, we have all this capability,” he remembered thinking.

Scaringe, Yu, and Behl think Also has potential not only on the consumer side, but also commercially.

“You could almost say that the need for small form-factor EVs is a little bit more acute on the commercial side than the consumer side, especially within dense metro areas, particularly in Europe [where city centers are] shut down to cars and vans,” Yu said in an interview. “We’ve seen an intense amount of excitement around a scalable platform approach for food, parcel, delivery, et cetera, type vehicles.”

Yu said Also is in “reasonably advanced discussions with some really exciting partners at the moment,” but declined to name any of them.

The Also team has their work cut out for them. They want to build small EVs for consumers and commercial companies across a global market. And they are willing to build pretty much any form factor to serve those needs.

Asked whether that means we could one day see an Also rickshaw, or skateboard, Scaringe said there are some practical limitations to what the company can achieve. But, he said, “never say never on anything” in micromobility.</p></b>

                <p>Terrestrial Energy, a small nuclear startup, merged with an acquisition company on Wednesday.

The North Carolina-based company is developing small modular reactors and expects to net $280 million from the deal. Before the SPAC merger, Terrestrial Energy had raised $94 million, according to PitchBook. The combined entity expects to list on Nasdaq under the symbol IMSR.

The ticker is a reference to Terrestrial Energy’s flavor of small modular reactor (SMR), which it calls an integral molten salt reactor. In such a device, uranium fuel is mixed with various salts, such as lithium fluoride or sodium fluoride, that serve to suspend the nuclear fuel and act as the reactor’s main coolant.

Terrestrial Energy’s reactor core is designed to be entirely replaced every seven years, in part to head off some of the problems earlier molten salt reactors experienced like corrosion. The reactor core includes not only the fuel and graphite modulators that regulate the speed of the fission reactions, but also the heat exchangers and pumps that keep the salt cool and flowing.

The startup is targeting a range of markets, including electric power, data centers, and industrial applications that require heat.

There are many extant proposals to build commercial-scale molten salt reactors, but to date, none have been built. The basic technology was invented in the 1950s, but two experiments from that era were plagued with problems.

Nuclear power has received renewed attention as electrification of buildings and transportation, coupled with the rapid growth of data centers, has sent electricity demand soaring.

Tech companies have become increasingly interested in the technology as a possible solution to the electricity requirements of AI training and inference. Google, Meta, Amazon, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have all picked a horse in the race to develop advanced nuclear reactors.

Terrestrial Energy isn’t the first SMR startup to SPAC — the Altman-backed Oklo completed its deal in 2024 — and given current hype around nuclear power, it’s possible it won’t be the last.</p></b>

                <p>The proliferation of scarily realistic deepfakes is one of the more pernicious by-products of the rise of AI, and falling victim to scams based on these deepfakes is already costing companies millions of dollars — not to mention the implications these could have on national security. A startup that’s built a toolset aimed at governments and enterprises to help detect and halt deepfakes and impersonations in audio, video, and still images is announcing some funding Wednesday with some impressive customers and investors in tow.

GetReal — co-founded by Hany Farid, one of the pioneers in detecting deepfake media — has raised $17.5 million in equity, funding that it will be using for R&D, hiring, and business development.

Alongside the funding, the company is launching its forensics platform as a service, which includes a web interface, an API, and integrations to run media analysis as a service. Features include a threat exposure dashboard; an “Inspect” tool specifically aimed at safeguarding high-profile executives from being spoofed; a “Protect” tool to screen media; and “Respond,” which involves human teams at GetReal performing deeper analysis.

Forgepoint Capital, a specialist in cybersecurity and AI, is leading this Series A with Ballistic Ventures, Evolution Equity, and K2 Access Fund participating.

Ballistic is a key firm in that list. GetReal was incubated at the VC from 2022 until it emerged from stealth in June 2024. Ballistic also led GetReal’s $7 million seed — a round that, per PitchBook, also included Venrock, Artisanal, Qudit, and Silver Buckshot.

Ballistic is important for another reason: The firm’s founder, Ted Schlein, is the chairman and the other co-founder of GetReal. Before Ballistic, Schlein headed Kleiner Perkins.

Hany as a service

GetReal sits in the wider world of cybersecurity, specifically in the fast-evolving area of cyber-forensics. The gap in the market that the San Mateo-based startup is addressing is the dearth of talent and knowledge in that space.

“If you think cybersecurity has a shortage of people, get ready for forensics,” said Matt Moynahan, GetReal’s CEO.

Moynahan is not the startup’s founder; he came to GetReal while it was still in stealth on the heels of a three-decades-long career leading a string of major cybersecurity companies such as Symantec, Arbor Networks, Veracode, and Forcepoint.

“To be honest, I don’t think I’ve seen a threat this ubiquitous,” he said of the ability to create and then apply malicious deepfakes.

He described viruses as a “novel threat” in comparison. “What we’ve seen over the past 20 years is the threat moving to the end user,” he said. “Fun” apps that let people create deepfakes are part of the problem, but so is the environment we work in today. “People have gone from bricks and mortar to businesses that are now almost completely digital and in the cloud.”

Phishing, he said, proved out that even very smart people can be easily tricked, and taken all together, it’s a complicated and very bad sign for where things might go.

GetReal is the brainchild of Farid, a longtime, well-known academic (currently at UC Berkeley) who is considered a pioneer in techniques for identifying when digital images have been doctored. Arguably, Farid was understanding the risks of deepfakes before the term had even come into existence.

As Farid explained it to TechCrunch, while working primarily as an academic and researcher, he’s been applying his learnings more or less informally for years as a service to media organizations, legal teams (after digital images became admissible in court), and others. In 2022, he came together with Schlein to consider how to translate that into an actual business, turning that investigative process into code.

“No one’s peering into this the way that Hany does,” Moynahan said. “But Hany can’t scale. So we basically took Hany and tried to create a ‘Hany service’ in the cloud.”

Interestingly, Farid notes that while the technology it is developing is dependent on how new apps work — there is a lot of reverse engineering that takes place at GetReal — it is combined with decades of knowledge that has changed very little.

“There are techniques we developed 20 years ago that still work today,” he said. He declined to explain what they are. “You don’t have to tell people everything we do, but it’s complicated to get right.”

The Signal effect: Text still to come

The Series A being announced Wednesday also includes some key strategic backers that include Cisco Investments, Capital One Ventures, and In-Q-Tel, an investment firm closely linked with the CIA.

That list of strategics mirrors the kinds of companies that are interested in or have already started to adopt GetReal’s product, said Alberto Yépez, the co-founder of Forgepoint who led the investment.

What Yépez said he found during due diligence was that heavily regulated industries — such as financial institutions — were already asking for a product like this, and CISOs were reaching out on a mandate from the boards of directors.

“They raised the issue [of deepfaked impersonations] after their CEOs had been been put into voice interviews,” he said. They were impersonated themselves and tricked by impersonations. Named customers include John Deere and Visa.

As for the government work, Yépez said, “They also have some priorities in the space.”

These “priorities” include intelligence agencies and government officials being tricked into acting, or not acting, based on faked information from bad actors.

They have yet, however, to extend to text-based impersonations.

That is something that came up only this week, when the editor of The Atlantic who was mistakenly added to a Signal group chat planning a military attack in Yemen initially assumed it was an impersonation hoax. Shockingly, that chat turned out to be very real and very much in violation of national security procedures.

Farid said that text is not currently in GetReal’s purview. “It is a different beast,” he said. But longer term, the plan will be to widen the scope over time to include all kinds of deepfake and impersonation threats.</p></b>

                <p>Google said it has fixed a vulnerability in its Chrome browser for Windows that malicious hackers have used to break into victims’ computers.

In a brief note on Tuesday, Google said that it fixed the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-2783, that was discovered by researchers at security firm Kaspersky earlier this month.

Google said it was aware of reports that an exploit for the bug “exists in the wild.” The bug is referred to as a zero-day because the vendor — in this case, Google — was given no time to fix the bug before it was exploited.

According to Kaspersky, the bug was exploited as part of a hacking campaign targeting Windows computers running Chrome.

In a blog post, Kaspersky called the campaign “Operation ForumTroll” and said victims were targeted with a phishing email inviting them to a Russian global political summit. When a link in the email was clicked, victims were taken to a malicious website that immediately exploits the bug to gain access to the victim’s PC data.

Kaspersky provided little detail about the bug at the time of the Chrome patch but said that the bug allowed the attackers to bypass Chrome’s sandbox protections, which limit the browser’s access to other data on the user’s computer. Kaspersky said the bug affects all other browsers based on Google’s Chromium engine.

In a separate analysis, Kaspersky said the bug was likely used in an espionage campaign, typically designed to stealthily monitor and steal data from a target’s device, usually over a period of time. The Russia-headquartered security firm said the hackers sent personalized phishing emails to Russian media representatives and employees at educational institutions.

It’s unclear who was exploiting the bug, but Kaspersky attributed the campaign to a likely state-sponsored or government-backed group of hackers.

Browsers like Chrome are a frequent target for malicious hackers and government-backed groups. Zero-day bugs capable of breaking through their protections and into the victim’s sensitive device data can be sold at high prices. In 2024, one zero-day broker was offering up to $3 million for exploitable bugs that can be triggered from over the internet.

Google said Chrome updates will roll out over the coming days and weeks.</p></b>

                <p>U.S. intel leaders are grilled again about the leaked Signal chat as more details emerge

toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and other top U.S. intelligence officials testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday — in a session dominated by discussion of an extraordinary breach of security.

Gabbard, who as DNI is the head of the U.S. intelligence community, was part of a high-level group chat on Signal, an open-source messaging app, where officials discussed detailed plans for a U.S. bombing campaign in Yemen earlier this month.

The use of civilian software to discuss sensitive military and government matters came to light after Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, said the Signal account of national security adviser Michael Waltz had added him to the Principals Committee (PC) group chat.

Goldberg reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sent detailed war plans in a message well before the U.S. attack began. Hegseth is not among the officials testifying on Capitol Hill — but on Wednesday, several Democratic lawmakers called for him to resign.



Disputes over what constitutes classified information

As the hearing began, Gabbard addressed the issue dominating headlines this week.

"It was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added to a Signal chat with high-level national security principals having a policy discussion about imminent strikes against the Houthis and the effects of the strike," Gabbard said, referring to the rebels in Yemen.

She added that Waltz has taken responsibility and that a review is underway.

"The conversation was candid and sensitive," but no classified information was shared, Gabbard said. She added, "There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared."

Democrats on the committee disagreed.

"I've seen things much less sensitive be presented to us with high classification," said Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas. "And to say that it isn't is a lie to the country."

Another Democrat, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, cited an executive order and a Defense Department manual that deem information "classified" if its unauthorized disclosure could harm national security, specifying details such as military plans and weapons systems.

Producing a large placard bearing an enlarged screenshot of the "Houthi PC small group" Signal chat, Krishnamoorthi noted that Hegseth sent two messages announcing the launch of F-18 fighters and MQ-9 drones as the attack began. Krishnamoorthi then asked the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, whether those are weapons systems.

"They are," Kruse said. But, he added, he would draw a distinction, because such weapons are "used all across the globe in a lot of contexts."

"This is classified information," Krishnamoorthi replied. "It's a weapons system as well as sequence of strikes, as well as details about the operations."



Trump says it's 'a witch hunt'

President Trump dismissed the controversy during an appearance in the Oval Office on Wednesday, telling reporters, "It's all a witch hunt."

The president sought to brush back criticism of the defense secretary, saying Hegseth "had nothing to do with this."

He also attempted to raise questions about Signal itself. "You want to ask about whether or not Signal works," Trump said. "I don't know that Signal works — I think Signal could be defective, to be honest with you."

Earlier Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Signal was "an approved encrypted app."

"As the president said yesterday, as the CIA director has testified under oath, this is an approved app," Leavitt said. "It's an encrypted app. The Department of Defense, the Department of State, the CIA has it loaded onto government phones because it is the most secure and efficient way to communicate."



A second day of testimony for intelligence bosses

Trump's comments followed the second appearance on Capitol Hill in as many days for Gabbard and Ratcliffe, who were grilled on Tuesday by Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee.

The leaders told senators that they had not shared any classified information in an improper or unlawful way — prompting a challenge from the ranking Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.

"If there was no classified material, share it with the committee," Warner said. "You can't have it both ways."

With the officials insisting they did nothing wrong and had not shared classified information, The Atlantic has now published Signal messages that were inadvertently shared with Goldberg, in a story titled "Here Are the Attack Plans That Trump's Advisers Shared on Signal."

The story states, "The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump—combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts—have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions."

As the hearing entered its final hour, Hegseth defended himself on X, saying The Atlantic's release of the Signal messages lacked specific names, targets and locations — and held "no classified information."</p></b>

Gabbard made the claim while testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, after the revelation that Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic, was added to a Signal government group chat.

The Atlantic's story showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided times of warplane launches, strike packages, and targets of Houthi rebels in Yemen.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency in December issued guidance recommending "highly targeted individuals use only end-to-end encrypted communications," Gabbard said at the committee's annual worldwide threats hearing.

"They named Signal as an app as an example of such an end-to-end encrypted messaging app," Gabbard testified.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that Signal was uploaded to his CIA devices after he was confirmed, Politico reported.

The CISA and ODNI did not respond to requests for comment from Politico.

Signal had previously not been authorized for use on government devices, Politico said, citing a Defense Department Office of the Inspector General report that condemned a Pentagon official for using the app. Last month, the National Security Agency reportedly warned employees of potential security issues with using Signal.

The White House has dismissed claims that "war plans" were shared with Goldberg as a hoax.

"The Atlantic has conceded: These were NOT 'war plans,'" Leavitt posted on X.

"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin."</p></b>

                <p>For years now, Android has been developed in a way that allowed the public to look in on Google’s work, but that’s now changing as Google has just confirmed that it will start to develop the operating system entirely in its internal branch.

The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) has left most of Google’s work in developing Android as an operating system visible to the public eye. But, starting next week, Google is moving that work behind closed doors.

Google confirmed to Android Authority that “all Android development will occur within Google’s internal branches,” the publication says. This is a shift from how Android has been developed for a very long time, but also aligns with more recent moves Google has been making. For a while now, Google has been developing most parts of Android behind closed doors in its “internal branches,” with the “AOSP branch” only having certain other aspects of Android’s framework (including Bluetooth, kernel, and some other core components). As such, it’s been quite a while since the current state of AOSP is at the same level as Google’s internal builds, leaving developers and others to wait on Google to make a public release to get all of the new changes.

With this change to move everything to its internal, private development branch, Google isn’t changing the speed at which these new builds arrive. Rather, this will potentially streamline the process and prevent conflicts when merging the branches.

This does not mean that Google is making Android a closed-source platform, but rather that the open-source aspect will only be released when a new branch is released to AOSP with those changes, including when new full versions or maintenance releases are finished.

In the end, users of Android almost certainly won’t see any changes from this new structure. App developers will also likely be unaffected. The biggest impact may be on the tidbits caught from AOSP that make their way into the public eye, such as the recent appearance of “Pixel 10” in an AOSP commit. That may be for the best, as those small tidbits can often be misconstrued or overhyped, leading to confusion later on.

A formal announcement of this change is apparently coming “later this week,” with the change itself happening next week. We’ll update this post when Google makes further details available.

                <p>Google recently confirmed that it’s making some big changes with regards to how it will approach development on Android, particularly its open-source version. The company claims that this new strategy is aimed at streamlining Android development, although it’s not revealing everything at the moment.

As initially reported by the folks over at Android Authority, Google is now consolidating its development efforts by moving all Android OS development to its internal branch, a change it’s making after 16 years. While Android manufacturers such as Samsung and Xiaomi (to name a few) customize the look and feel of Android to their liking, the foundation of these versions still uses the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) at the core.

At the moment, Google maintains both a public AOSP branch and a private internal branch. While some components are developed publicly, some such as the core OS framework, are developed internally. This can sometimes lead to the public branch lagging behind and causing complexities in merging code and resolving conflicts. To address this, Google will no longer have these separate branches, with all development happening internally.

It’s important to note that this change is not expected to make Android closed-source, as Google will still publish the source code for new Android releases. The primary impact will be on the frequency of public source code releases for specific components.

Additionally, while regular users and most developers (especially app developers and those building custom ROMs) are unlikely to notice a significant difference, external developers who actively follow and contribute to AOSP may find it more challenging to stay informed about and contribute to the platform’s development, as the publicly available code will be less up-to-date.

This shift might also reduce the likelihood of leaks into upcoming Android features and devices through AOSP code changes. In any case, Google is expected to make further announcements regarding this new transition.</p></b>

                <p>Digital banking startup Mercury has raised $300 million in primary and secondary funding at a $3.5 billion post-money valuation, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Wednesday.

The valuation is more than double the startup’s valuation when it last raised capital — a $120 million Series B round in 2021 that valued the company at $1.62 billion post-money.

Sequoia led the latest round — a Series C — alongside existing backers Coatue, CRV, Andreessen Horowitz, and new investors Spark Capital and Marathon. It’s the first check that Sequoia has written into Mercury since the startup was founded in 2017. The raise brings Mercury’s total primary and secondary funding to $500 million. The company declined to break down how much of the Series C was primary and how much was secondary with Mercury CEO and co-founder Immad Akhund saying the “majority” was primary.

Mercury is planning to do a broader employee tender offer at a later date, he added.

Akhund also told TechCrunch that the startup notched $500 million in revenue in 2024 and that it has seen 10 consecutive quarters of profitability on both EBITDA and GAAP net income.

The company counts over 200,000 companies as customers and claims it has seen 40% year-over-year customer growth. Akhund declined to share revenue figures from previous years but noted that its payment volume increased by 64% to $156 billion. Its customers range in size, according to Akhund, and include tech companies such as Linear, Phantom, and ElevenLabs; venture capital firms; e-commerce companies; and a range of small businesses.

Mercury launched its first corporate credit card in 2022. Last May, Mercury told TechCrunch that it was layering software onto its bank accounts, giving its business customers the ability to pay bills, invoice customers, and reimburse employees. Those additional features put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of Brex and Ramp, two rival fintechs that have for years been fighting for market share in an increasingly crowded space.

Later this year, Mercury plans to launch a consumer banking product that it first announced in April 2024.

Mercury will be eyeing acquisitions with its new capital, Akhund said. It will also be hiring. Presently, Mercury has 850 employees with plans to grow to more than 1,000 in 2025.

The startup was embroiled in drama with partner bank Evolve Bank & Trust and embattled BaaS startup Synapse in recent years. On March 12, Mercury announced that it had decided to end its relationship with Evolve and migrate customers to its other bank partners. Akhund told TechCrunch that Mercury had stopped sending new customers to Evolve in 2022.

Mercury’s Series C raise is believed to be the largest fintech funding round announced this year, one that is also seeing Klarna prepare to go public.

                <br/>
                <p>Bradley Tusk, co-founder and managing partner at Tusk Venture Partners, told TechCrunch in today’s episode of Equity that VC as we know it is dead. And it has been for the last four years.

“Maybe there’s some VC that I’ve never heard of that’s awash with liquidity the last couple of years, but we haven’t returned $1 in capital to our LPs in four years,” Tusk said.

VC has had a rough couple of years thanks to higher interest rates, crashed startup valuations from 2021 highs, and stymied IPO and M&A transactions.

Many investors had been holding their breath for President Donald Trump to rejuvenate the VC landscape with deregulatory measures and pro-business tax reforms. However, the uncertainty following Trump’s record-breaking executive orders, tariff-fueled trade wars, and the dismantling of federal agencies has tempered the anticipated surge in VC activity.

Or as Tusk put it, “I just don’t know many serious economists that think a trade war is a good idea for anyone’s economy.”

So Tusk is bowing out of the traditional VC model and has decided not to raise a fourth fund. Instead, he is shifting focus to an “equity-for-services” model, which allows Tusk to accept equity in exchange for helping startups navigate regulatory environments, legislative communications, and government procurement.

For Tusk, equity-for-services goes back to his roots. In 2010, when he had just launched his political consulting firm Tusk Strategies, what was then a small transportation technology company called Uber enlisted his services. Uber didn’t have the cash to pay him, so they offered him equity. Tusk spent the next few years “running campaigns all over the U.S. to legalize Uber and ride-sharing.”

Creating regulatory frameworks for disruptive technologies to save startups from death by politics has been Tusk’s bread and butter for years, an expertise he earned through previous roles as campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg’s 2009 mayoral race and deputy governor of Illinois.

All the “real VC stuff,” like fundraising from LPs and “compliance, board seats, portfolio construction,” just started to feel like a distraction from the kind of work he actually loves doing.

And it feels like a shortcut to do the work he loves, while still actually making more money than he can make as a classic venture investor.

“When I realized that I could just as easily get on cap tables and get equity from startups that I like in return for my expertise, the traditional model just didn’t make a lot of sense,” Tusk said.

“I actually made more money when I was in equity-for-services because even though there’s less leverage than there is on a venture check, you keep 100% of the proceeds,” he said. “Whereas in traditional venture, I’ve got to return the investment capital to investors. I’ve got to repay the fees, then I’ve got to give them 80 cents on the dollar,” he said.

Tusk Venture Partners will continue to support its existing portfolio companies until the fund’s life cycle ends in 2031.</p></b>

March

Block

Let go of 931 employees, around 8% of its workforce, as part of a reorganization, according to an internal email seen by TechCrunch. Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and CEO of the fintech company, wrote in the email that the layoffs were not for financial reasons or to replace workers with AI.

Brightcove

Has laid off 198 employees, who make up about two-thirds of its U.S. workforce, per a media report. The layoff comes a month after the company was acquired by Bending Spoons, an Italian app developer, for $233 million. Brightcove had 600 employees worldwide, with 300 in the U.S., as of December 2023.

Acxiom

Has reportedly laid off 130 employees, or 3.5% of its total workforce of 3,700 people. Acxiom is owned by IPG, and the news comes just a day after IPG and Omnicom Group shareholders approved the companies’ potential merger.

Sequoia Capital

Plans to close its office in Washington, D.C., and let go of its policy team there by the end of March, TechCrunch has confirmed. Sequoia opened its Washington office five years ago to deepen its relationship with policymakers. Three full-time employees are expected to be affected, per Forbes.

Otorio

Has cut 45 employees, more than half of its workforce, after being acquired by cybersecurity company Armis for $120 million in March.

ActiveFence

Will reportedly reduce 22 employees, representing 7% of its workforce. Most of those affected are based in Israel as the company undergoes a streamlining process. The New York- and Tel Aviv-headquartered cybersecurity firm has raised $100 million at a valuation of about $500 million in 2021.

eBay

Will reportedly cut a few dozen employees in Israel, potentially affecting 10% of its 250-person workforce in the country.

Starbucks

Cut 1,100 jobs in a reorganizing effort that affected its tech workers. The coffee chain will now outsource some tech work to third-party employees.

Laid off dozens of employees over the last few weeks, including around 10% of staff in one day, after failing to meet its sales growth targets. The “headless commerce” platform raised money at a $1.9 billion valuation just a few years ago.

Dayforce

Will cut roughly 5% of its current workforce in a new efficiency drive to increase profitability and growth.

Expedia

                <p>Silicon Valley used to take a backseat to Washington, D.C. But now, the people disrupting technology have taken the wheel at the highest echelons of government. And that’s thanks, in large part, to the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE.

Much reporting on DOGE has focused on its staffers’ ties to Musk, the billionaire bestie of President Donald Trump. However, there’s another major nexus: the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors who have joined its clarion call of slashing government spending.

TechCrunch has compiled a comprehensive list of the founders and VCs who have worked with DOGE, identified through a combination of personal declarations, court records, and other reporting. Our research also reveals one previously unreported DOGE member, Mike Gonzalez, the former founder of an HR startup called TraceHQ.

And Gonzalez is far from the only Silicon Valley founder to find a new role in public service. Our roster of founders-turned-DOGE workers spans from the co-founder of Airbnb to a guy who sold his startup for nearly $1 billion — only to join DOGE to find a higher meaning after breaking up with his girlfriend.

Then there are the VCs. This contingent includes Silicon Valley titan Marc Andreessen — a self-described “unpaid intern” at DOGE — and one man who spent seven years working for Thiel Capital before joining the top levels of government.

Regardless of how you feel about DOGE, there’s no question that Silicon Valley’s influence on the federal government is stronger than ever. To find out who is shaping that future, read on.

Founders

Nate Cavanaugh

Cavanaugh is the co-founder of two startups: Brainbase, an enterprise SaaS business which he sold in 2022, and FlowFi, which raised $9 million last year to build a marketplace of finance experts for entrepreneurs.

He is part of a DOGE team tasked with auditing — some would say dismantling — the USADF and IAF, two U.S. government agencies that fund development projects in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, according to a lawsuit from USADF president Ward Brehm.

Although Cavanaugh has no public history of political activities, he looks to Trump backer Peter Thiel for “a lot” of his thinking about the world and business, he said in an interview with VC firm Differential Ventures.

Stephen Ehikian

Ehikian has sold two companies to Salesforce: Airkit.ai in 2023 and RelateIQ in 2014. Ehikian worked in product at Salesforce twice after the acquisition of his companies, most recently serving as VP of AI products.

Trump appointed Ehikian as acting administrator and deputy administrator of GSA in January. This agency is the cornerstone of purchasing contracts for the federal government.

In his role, Ehikian manages GSA’s real estate portfolio and doles out government contracts for technology. He has said that the GSA would terminate leases and cut consulting contracts, and has been firing GSA employees.

California Senator Alex Padilla and New York Congressman Joseph Morelle wrote a letter in March to Ehikian, opposing his work with DOGE on such matters.

Justin Fulcher

Fulcher is the founder of RingMD, a Singapore-based telehealth startup. Fulcher made headlines in 2013 after the government of Singapore funded RingMD with $500,000 when he was only 21.

Despite expanding to multiple countries in Asia, RingMD has since gone bankrupt, according to Forbes.

Fulcher, now 32, was installed by DOGE to oversee reforms at the Veterans Administration (VA), which cut 1,000 staff soon after DOGE’s arrival.

Joe Gebbia

Gebbia is the billionaire co-founder of Airbnb and Samara, a pre-fab tiny home startup that raised $41 million in 2023. He is also a personal friend of Elon Musk, who had been deliberating buying one of Samara’s tiny homes last year, according to Tesla filings.

At DOGE, Gebbia will work as a volunteer in the Office of Personnel Management, he confirmed in a post on X after his involvement was reported by The New York Times. “My first project at DOGE is improving the slow and paper-based retirement process,” Gebbia wrote.

Gebbia is a longtime Democratic donor, but said he voted for Trump in 2024 and supports Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new health secretary.

Mike Gonzalez

Gonzalez founded HR startup TraceHQ in 2019 and sold it to Paylocity in 2023 for an undisclosed sum. Gonzalez says on his website that he started his career as a Facebook product manager and worked at Zenefits with David Sacks when he was CEO there, all before launching his own company.

VC Sacks has joined the Trump administration as its crypto and AI czar. Gonzalez was working on the finance team when they worked together at Zenefits.

Gonzalez’s LinkedIn profile previously mentioned that he joined DOGE full-time earlier this month as a “Senior Advisor” at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Shortly after TechCrunch reached out to Gonzalez for comment, the mention of DOGE was removed from his LinkedIn profile.

Gonzalez has not said what he’s doing at OPM. But in February he wrote a post on LinkedIn lamenting the state and process of the federal budget.

Vinay Hiremath

Hiremath is the co-founder of video recording startup Loom, which was sold to Atlassian in 2023 for $975 million.

According to a blog post on his personal website titled “I am rich and have no idea what to do with my life,” Hiremath says that after breaking up with his girlfriend, he decided to “externalize” his emotions by climbing a mountain in the Himalayas. After that, he decided to work for DOGE.

His stint at DOGE lasted about a month and involved making hundreds of recruiting calls. Hiremath wrote that he was added to Signal groups run by DOGE and “immediately put to work.”

Hiremath praised DOGE’s work as “extremely important,” but said he quit the job as he needed to focus on himself. He called off plans to move to Washington, D.C. and went to Hawaii instead, his post states.

Brooks Morgan

Morgan is the co-founder and former CEO of an Austin-based edtech startup called Podium Education, a press release from last year shows, although he is not currently listed as a leader on the company’s website.

His social media presence is extremely minimal but he has reportedly been involved in edtech for well over a decade, previously working for a long-since acquired company that offered a Facebook app for schools.

Morgan is said to be involved in DOGE’s efforts at the Education Department, especially around efforts to augment — perhaps replace — some of the workers there with AI, The New York Times reports.

Kyle Schutt

Schutt is listed by Crunchbase as a co-founder of a Virginia-based software company called KAMM, which state records say has been inactive as of late November 2024.

Schutt has also worked on WinRed, WIRED reports, a for-profit fundraising site that says it’s helped raise $1.8 billion for Republican party candidates since 2023. He also served as the CTO at online fundraising platform REVV, also used by the Republican party.

He is a member of DOGE and is now on staff at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to an internal staff directory viewed by Politico. He was previously at the GSA. He is said to have access to FEMA systems and to have worked for a company called Outburst Data which hosts several Musk-related sites, and hosts parts of the DOGE website.

(back to top)

Ethan Shaotran

Shaotran was previously the founder of Energize.ai, though its website no longer loads. He also developed several iPhone apps, including a Donald Trump-themed running game called “Donald Dash.”

In 2024, Shaotran told Business Insider that he was a 22-year-old Harvard computer science student working solo on his startup, which offered an AI scheduling assistant and had landed a $100,000 grant from OpenAI.

Shaotran was one of a number of DOGE workers named in a lawsuit by federal employees that sought to prevent DOGE workers from accessing federal records, although he was not a defendant.

Shaotran reportedly has a working GSA email address and requested access to a decade’s worth of GSA data. Shaotran also has access to email systems at the Department of Education and access to the department’s back-end website, NBC reported.

Brad Smith

Smith is a longtime healthcare entrepreneur who co-founded the palliative care company Aspire Health (later acquired by Anthem) and co-founded CareBridge, which provides at-home service to Medicaid patients (and is said to have struck a deal with Elevance Health to sell for $2.7 billion).

He also co-founded healthcare VC firm Russell Street Ventures and served as CEO of Main Street Health, which offers primary care services to those in rural areas.

Smith led the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation during President Trump’s first term. He is said to be one of the leaders of DOGE, alongside close Musk ally Steve Davis.

As ABC News reported, Smith has been an advocate for privatizing aspects of Medicaid and Medicare. At DOGE, Smith has requested access to the payment systems at Medicare, according to The New York Times.

Jordan Wick

Wick is the co-founder of Y Combinator startup Intercept. He also worked as an engineer at Alphabet’s self-driving car company Waymo, he told a podcast in 2024.

He is among the DOGE staffers granted extensive access to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s data, according to a lawsuit from former USAID contractors which names him (but not as a defendant).

Wick graduated from MIT with a degree in computer science in 2019 and also has a master’s degree from there, according to an archived version of his website. He also worked at YC-backed logistics startup Flexport.

Venture Capitalists

Baris Akis

Akis is a co-founder and president of Silicon Valley VC firm Human Capital.

He reportedly led inquiries into the Treasury Department’s payments systems, The New York Times reported. He was also named in a lawsuit about DOGE’s legality, although not as a defendant.

Akis is the second link to DOGE from Human Capital. The VC firm’s former head of talent, Amanda Scales, is now chief of staff at the powerful Office of Personnel Management, the federal government’s HR department.

(back to top)

Marc Andreessen

Andreessen is the co-founder of prominent VC firm Andreessen Horowitz. He famously backed Trump for president in 2024, despite previously endorsing Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Andreessen described himself as an “unpaid intern” for DOGE in a podcast with the Hoover Institution earlier this year, reportedly helping recruit for DOGE’s early hires, the FT reported.

In the Hoover Institution podcast, Andreessen described former a16z managing partner Scott Kupor — and incoming OPM head — as “very aligned” with DOGE’s mission.

Antonio Gracias

Gracias is the founder and CEO of Valor Equity Partners, and a longtime close associate of Elon Musk. Valor has invested in a who’s who of buzzy startups (including Anduril, Dataminr, Eight Sleep, and Reddit) but is particularly known for backing Musk companies like SpaceX, Neuralink, SolarCity, The Boring Company, and Tesla.

Gracias is well known as a Tesla board member from 2007 to 2021, on the board prior to its IPO as well as when Tesla bought the Musk-controlled company SolarCity for $2.6 billion.

On a February episode of the VC All-In Podcast, Gracias said that he was working with DOGE. “I’m not there full-time,” he said. “I’m in and out a little bit and trying to help where I can.” He also mentioned that DOGE had 80-plus full-time people at that time.

He is apparently now working with DOGE’s efforts at the Social Security Administration, The New York Times reported, and is one of nine DOGE associates there. Other Valor employees are also part of the Social Security crew, the NYT reports.

Michael Kratsios

Until recently, Michael Kratsios served as managing director at Scale AI, the data labeling startup that began working with the Pentagon last year to test and evaluate AI tools for the military.

From 2010 to 2017, Kratsios worked for Thiel Capital, the office that manages VC Peter Thiel’s many investments, per his LinkedIn; Thiel was one of Trump’s early backers in 2016. Kratsios also served as CTO of the U.S. during Trump’s first administration.

Kratsios helped lead efforts to staff DOGE in late 2024 by conducting interviews of prospective staff, Bloomberg reported.

He is Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Science and Technology Policy. During his confirmation hearing, Kratsios responded to questions about mass firings of federal workers by saying he believes it’s reasonable for the current administration to evaluate current talent.

Scott Kupor

Kupor is a managing partner at VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, and was a16z’s first employee. He serves on the boards of a number of a16z investments. He is also a former chairman of the National Venture Capital Association — the VC industry’s lobbying organization.

Trump announced in December 2024 that he picked Kupor to serve as the director of the Office of Personnel Management. The same day, Kupor confirmed that he was helping DOGE.

As the federal government’s HR department, the OPM has become ground zero for DOGE’s mission to slash the federal workforce. DOGE workers are using OPM’s data and computer systems to obtain information about federal workers across agencies, according to a CNN report.

Shaun Maguire

Maguire is a partner at Sequoia Capital and formerly co-founded cyber firm Expanse, which was sold to Palo Alto Networks for $800 million in 2020.

Maguire has reportedly helped screen potential candidates for DOGE. He’s a frequent and vocal supporter of DOGE on X.

Maguire is an outspoken supporter of President Trump, and announced that he donated $300,000 to his campaign last summer.

Adam Ramada

Ramada was previously a managing director at SpringTide Capital, where he was part of a $12 million deal to fund the probiotic drink company ZBiotics. His firm also invested in a SpaceX supplier last year.

He was identified as a member of DOGE in a temporary restraining order after the American Federation of Teachers sought to block DOGE’s access to privileged information. The restraining order was later denied by a federal judge.

In a signed declaration, Ramada said he started working for DOGE in January, assigned to audit contracts and programs at the Department of Education for waste, such as federal student loans. President Trump, a critic of the Department of Education, recently signed an executive order to start its closure very soon.

In another declaration, Ramada, who is also listed as a GSA employee, said he was assigned to the Labor Department, too, to “improve its information technology and data organization system.”

Amanda Scales

Scales worked for two and half years at Silicon Valley VC firm Human Capital, advising the firm’s portfolio companies on talent and HR, according to her her LinkedIn profile. Her boss at Human Capital, its co-founder Baris Akis, served as a DOGE advisor.

Scales is now chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government’s powerful human resources department, according to an OPM memo.

Scales previously worked on talent at Uber before joining Human Capital, according to her LinkedIn.

                <p>In Brief

Sez Us, a social app founded by Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, is trying to build a platform without rage-bait.

Rage-bait refers to any posts that are intended to stoke controversy. This might be an intentionally controversial political take, or it can be a wholly fabricated scenario designed to farm engagement (e.g., a satirical creator got 1.5 million views on a TikTok where she claims to file for divorce after her husband booed Taylor Swift).

Most existing social networking apps incentivize rage-bait, including Instagram, X, TikTok, and YouTube. These platforms have programs for creators that pay them based on how many views they get, and enraging content tends to draw more attention.

Sez Us wants to break this cycle by allowing users to rate other users’ posts for approval, influence, insightfulness, relevance, and politeness. The hope is that users will think twice before inciting an argument or making inflammatory statements; instead, the idea is to encourage civil discourse.

Changing the nature of the social internet is easier said than done, and Sez Us may be more of a feature than a product. But that doesn’t mean other platforms can’t learn from these experiments in community-driven moderation.</p></b>

                <p>A complaint about poverty in rural China. A news report about a corrupt Communist Party member. A cry for help about corrupt cops shaking down entrepreneurs.

These are just a few of the 133,000 examples fed into a sophisticated large language model that’s designed to automatically flag any piece of content considered sensitive by the Chinese government.

A leaked database seen by TechCrunch reveals China has developed an AI system that supercharges its already formidable censorship machine, extending far beyond traditional taboos like the Tiananmen Square massacre.

The system appears primarily geared toward censoring Chinese citizens online but could be used for other purposes, like improving Chinese AI models’ already extensive censorship.

Xiao Qiang, a researcher at UC Berkeley who studies Chinese censorship and who also examined the dataset, told TechCrunch that it was “clear evidence” that the Chinese government or its affiliates want to use LLMs to improve repression.

“Unlike traditional censorship mechanisms, which rely on human labor for keyword-based filtering and manual review, an LLM trained on such instructions would significantly improve the efficiency and granularity of state-led information control,” Qiang told TechCrunch.

This adds to growing evidence that authoritarian regimes are quickly adopting the latest AI tech. In February, for example, OpenAI said it caught multiple Chinese entities using LLMs to track anti-government posts and smear Chinese dissidents.

The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., told TechCrunch in a statement that it opposes “groundless attacks and slanders against China” and that China attaches great importance to developing ethical AI.

Data found in plain sight

The dataset was discovered by security researcher NetAskari, who shared a sample with TechCrunch after finding it stored in an unsecured Elasticsearch database hosted on a Baidu server.

This doesn’t indicate any involvement from either company — all kinds of organizations store their data with these providers.

There’s no indication of who, exactly, built the dataset, but records show that the data is recent, with its latest entries dating from December 2024.

An LLM for detecting dissent

In language eerily reminiscent of how people prompt ChatGPT, the system’s creator tasks an unnamed LLM to figure out if a piece of content has anything to do with sensitive topics related to politics, social life, and the military. Such content is deemed “highest priority” and needs to be immediately flagged.

Top-priority topics include pollution and food safety scandals, financial fraud, and labor disputes, which are hot-button issues in China that sometimes lead to public protests — for example, the Shifang anti-pollution protests of 2012.

Any form of “political satire” is explicitly targeted. For example, if someone uses historical analogies to make a point about “current political figures,” that must be flagged instantly, and so must anything related to “Taiwan politics.” Military matters are extensively targeted, including reports of military movements, exercises, and weaponry.

A snippet of the dataset can be seen below. The code inside it references prompt tokens and LLMs, confirming the system uses an AI model to do its bidding:

Inside the training data

From this huge collection of 133,000 examples that the LLM must evaluate for censorship, TechCrunch gathered 10 representative pieces of content.

Topics likely to stir up social unrest are a recurring theme. One snippet, for example, is a post by a business owner complaining about corrupt local police officers shaking down entrepreneurs, a rising issue in China as its economy struggles.

Another piece of content laments rural poverty in China, describing run-down towns that only have elderly people and children left in them. There’s also a news report about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) expelling a local official for severe corruption and believing in “superstitions” instead of Marxism.

There’s extensive material related to Taiwan and military matters, such as commentary about Taiwan’s military capabilities and details about a new Chinese jet fighter. The Chinese word for Taiwan (台湾) alone is mentioned over 15,000 times in the data, a search by TechCrunch shows.

Subtle dissent appears to be targeted, too. One snippet included in the database is an anecdote about the fleeting nature of power that uses the popular Chinese idiom “When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter.”

Power transitions are an especially touchy topic in China thanks to its authoritarian political system.

Built for “public opinion work”

The dataset doesn’t include any information about its creators. But it does say that it’s intended for “public opinion work,” which offers a strong clue that it’s meant to serve Chinese government goals, one expert told TechCrunch.

Michael Caster, the Asia program manager of rights organization Article 19, explained that “public opinion work” is overseen by a powerful Chinese government regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), and typically refers to censorship and propaganda efforts.

The end goal is ensuring Chinese government narratives are protected online, while any alternative views are purged. Chinese president Xi Jinping has himself described the internet as the “frontline” of the CCP’s “public opinion work.”

Repression is getting smarter

The dataset examined by TechCrunch is the latest evidence that authoritarian governments are seeking to leverage AI for repressive purposes.

OpenAI released a report last month revealing that an unidentified actor, likely operating from China, used generative AI to monitor social media conversations — particularly those advocating for human rights protests against China — and forward them to the Chinese government.

OpenAI also found the technology being used to generate comments highly critical of a prominent Chinese dissident, Cai Xia.

Traditionally, China’s censorship methods rely on more basic algorithms that automatically block content mentioning blacklisted terms, like “Tiananmen massacre” or “Xi Jinping,” as many users experienced using DeepSeek for the first time.

But newer AI tech, like LLMs, can make censorship more efficient by finding even subtle criticism at a vast scale. Some AI systems can also keep improving as they gobble up more and more data.

“I think it’s crucial to highlight how AI-driven censorship is evolving, making state control over public discourse even more sophisticated, especially at a time when Chinese AI models such as DeepSeek are making headwaves,” Xiao, the Berkeley researcher, told TechCrunch.</p></b>

                <p>Enterprise browser startup Island just raised a sizable funding round — one that bumps up its valuation significantly, and less than one year after its last fundraise.

Dallas-based Island raised $250 million in a Series E round led by Coatue that valued the company at $4.85 billion, the startup announced today. This brings the company’s total funding to $730 million. Other backers in the round include Insight Partners, Sequoia, and Canapi Ventures, among others.

Island builds online browsers that are designed for enterprises and are meant to be more secure than traditional commercial search engines. They also have universal application access control, device visibility and management, and application automation, among other features.

This Series E round marks a notable step up for the nearly 5-year-old company. It raised $175 million in a Series D round that valued the company at $2.9 billion just 11 months ago, co-led by Sequoia and Coatue.

At the time, Sequoia partner Doug Leone told TechCrunch that he was attracted to the company right off the bat due to Island’s team and unique value proposition.

“The two founders, one of whom was a technical founder out of Israel — Dan Amiga — and one who was a very senior security executive out of the U.S. — Mike Fey — had a vision that if you could produce a browser based on Chromium that looks like a standard browser to the consumer employee in a corporation but was secure, it would stop bad guys from doing a whole bunch of things,” Leone told TechCrunch at the time.

Enterprises are clearly buying into the mission, too, as the company now counts 450 customers, among them Mattress Firm, Swiss Life, and Fiverr.

                <p>UnitedHealth Group has scrubbed much of its website mentioning its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, including pulling down blog posts and removing large sections from its website, TechCrunch has learned.

According to archived copies of UnitedHealth’s website, several of the company’s web pages dedicated to DEI no longer load and now redirect to a “page not found” error. A section of the company’s career page that used to have a dedicated section for diversity, equity, and inclusion, along with its diversity initiatives, no longer appears on the same live page. UnitedHealth also removed a 2022 blog post featuring a conversation with its vice president of DEI.

It’s not clear why UnitedHealth pulled down the pages, and if it represents a shift of verbiage or an actual change in its policies. UnitedHealth spokesperson Tyler Mason did not return requests for comment Wednesday.

The removal of DEI from UnitedHealth’s websites coincides with a broad retreat from DEI policies and programs by household names and tech companies alike, amid mounting pressure from Trump administration-issued executive orders targeting DEI programs.

In February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed the Justice Department to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize” DEI programs that it considers illegal at private sector companies that receive federal funding. A federal appeals court temporarily allowed the Trump administration to press ahead, despite a lower court ruling the government’s efforts unlawful.

Several tech companies have already scrubbed mentions of DEI from their websites, including Google and OpenAI.

TechCrunch saw UnitedHealth take down its web pages mentioning DEI throughout Wednesday morning in real time. Since the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare last year, TechCrunch has used a web page monitor to automatically and continually check for any changes to its website, such as updates to its data breach notice.

In removing “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion” in UnitedHealth’s website menu, the company added a slimmed-down page with weaker language it calls the “Culture of Belonging,” which leaves out previous references to the company’s diversity efforts on university campuses, diversity in recruiting, and the company’s various employee resource groups.

                <p>In Brief

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on Wednesday that the rollout of ChatGPT’s viral new AI image features to free users would be delayed, citing significantly higher demand than the company expected.

“Images in ChatGPT are wayyyy more popular than we expected (and we had pretty high expectations),” Altman said in a post on X on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, the company announced the launch of GPT-4o’s native image generation, which lets users upload and modify images, saying it would soon come to all tiers of ChatGPT. As of Wednesday, OpenAI has only rolled out the feature to subscribers to ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Teams.

In recent months, OpenAI has faced similar hiccups around product launches, repeatedly blaming a lack of compute capacity. Shortly after launching Sora in December, OpenAI disabled signups. Perhaps, the company’s planned $500 billion Stargate data center project will help with those capacity constraints.</p></b>

Nvidia is looking to get into the server rental market.

The semiconductor giant is reportedly nearing a deal to acquire Lepton AI, a company that rents out servers that are powered by Nvidia’s AI chips, according to The Information. Citing unnamed sources, the outlet says the deal deal is worth several hundred million dollars.

TechCrunch reached out to Nvidia for more information.

Lepton AI was founded two years ago and raised an $11 million seed round in May 2023 from CRV and Fusion Fund. The other big player in the server rental market is Together AI, a startup that has raised more than $500 million in venture capital despite only being about a year older than Lepton.

Nvidia reportedly acquired synthetic data startup Gretel last week.</p></b>

                <p>The Lumon Terminal Pro — the computer used in Apple TV’s hit series “Severance” — has appeared on Apple’s retail website. When shopping Apple.com, you’ll see the new device, adorned with a red “New” label, when you click to view the available Mac computers Apple has for sale from the top-level navigation.

But sorry, “Severance” fans: The Lumon terminal computer isn’t actually for sale.

Instead, its appearance on the retail website serves as an advertisement for Apple’s streaming service, Apple TV+, which is available as a free three-month trial with any purchase of a Mac computer. The streaming offering is a part of Apple’s growing services business, which grew by 4% in the most recent quarter to reach $26.34 billion, helping push Apple’s gross margin to the highest on record.

Given its pop culture appeal, the Cupertino-based tech giant has been heavily marketing “Severance,” now Apple’s most-watched TV series ever, with a number of official tie-ins, including free e-books on Apple Books, a “Severance” podcast with Ben Stiller and Adam Scott, a LinkedIn profile for Lumon Industries (the fictional company in the show), a “Severance”-themed playlist, an NYC pop-up, and more.

On Wednesday, the company also showcased how one of the show’s editors, Geoffrey Richman, uses an iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro to work on the series, whether on location, at home, or on the go.

Alongside the Lumon Terminal Pro listing, there’s a link to a short film offering a behind-the-scenes look at his editing process.</p></b>

                <p>OpenAI is embracing rival Anthropic’s standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data resides.

In a post on X on Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that OpenAI will add support for Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol, or MCP, across its products, including the desktop app for ChatGPT. MCP is an open source standard that helps AI models produce better, more relevant responses to certain queries.

“People love MCP and we are excited to add support across our products,” Altman said. “[It’s] available today in the Agents SDK and support for [the] ChatGPT desktop app [and] Responses API [is] coming soon!”

MCP lets models draw data from sources like business tools and software to complete tasks, as well as from content repositories and app development environments. The protocol enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications, such as chatbots.

Developers can expose data through “MCP servers” and build “MCP clients” — for instance, apps and workflows — that connect to those servers on command. In the months since Anthropic open sourced MCP, companies including Block, Apollo, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph have added MCP support for their platforms.

“Excited to see the MCP love spread to OpenAI – welcome!” Anthropic chief product officer Mike Krieger said in an X post. “MCP has [become a] thriving open standard with thousands of integrations and growing. LLMs are most useful when connecting to the data you already have and software you already use.”

OpenAI says it intends to share more about its MCP plans in the coming months.</p></b>

                <p>It’s only been a day since ChatGPT’s new AI image generator went live, and social media feeds are already flooded with AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the cult-favorite Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films such as “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.”

In the last 24 hours, we’ve seen AI-generated images representing Studio Ghibli versions of Elon Musk, “The Lord of the Rings“, and President Donald Trump. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even seems to have made his new profile picture a Studio Ghibli-style image, presumably made with GPT-4o’s native image generator. Users seem to be uploading existing images and pictures into ChatGPT and asking the chatbot to re-create it in new styles.

OpenAI’s latest update comes on the heels of Google’s release of a similar AI image feature in its Gemini Flash model, which also sparked a viral moment earlier in March when people used it to remove watermarks from images.

OpenAI’s and Google’s latest tools make it easier than ever to re-create the styles of copyrighted works — simply by typing a text prompt. Together, these new AI image features seem to reignite concerns at the core of several lawsuits against generative AI model developers. If these companies are training on copyrighted works, are they violating copyright law?

According to Evan Brown, an intellectual property lawyer at the law firm Neal & McDevitt, products like GPT-4o’s native image generator operate in a legal gray area today. Style is not explicitly protected by copyright, according to Brown, meaning OpenAI does not appear to be breaking the law simply by generating images that look like Studio Ghibli movies.

However, Brown says it’s plausible that OpenAI achieved this likeness by training its model on millions of frames from Ghibli’s films. Even if that was the case, several courts are still deciding whether training AI models on copyrighted works falls under fair use protections.

“I think this raises the same question that we’ve been asking ourselves for a couple years now,” said Brown in an interview. “What are the copyright infringement implications of going out, crawling the web, and copying into these databases?”

The New York Times and several publishers are in active lawsuits against OpenAI, claiming the company trained its AI models on copyrighted works without proper attribution or payment. There have been similar claims brought in lawsuits against other leading AI companies, including Meta and AI image-generation startup Midjourney.



In a statement to TechCrunch, an OpenAI spokesperson says that while ChatGPT refuses to replicate “the style of individual living artists,” OpenAI does permit it to replicate “broader studio styles.” Of course, it’s worth noting there are living artists who are credited with pioneering their studio’s unique styles, such as Studio Ghibli’s co-founder, Hayao Miyazaki.

Evidently, users have also been able to use GPT-4o’s native image-generation feature to re-create styles from other studios and artists. Someone else made a Marc Andreessen portrait in the style of Dr. Seuss, and a married couple re-created their wedding photos in the style of Pixar.

We tested several popular AI image generators — including ones available in Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok, and Playground.ai — to see their ability to match Studio Ghibli’s style. We found OpenAI’s new image generator created the most accurate replica of the animation studio’s style.

For now, OpenAI’s and Google’s new image features present a leap forward in what AI models can generate, which seems to be driving a surge in usage. OpenAI delayed the rollout of its new image tool to free-tier users on Wednesday, citing high demand. That may be the most important thing for these companies today, but we’ll have to wait for the courts to weigh in on their legality.</p></b>
