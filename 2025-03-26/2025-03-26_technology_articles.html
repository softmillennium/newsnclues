New research suggests that dark energy, the unknown force driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, may not be behaving as previously believed. Observations from a large-scale 3D map indicate that this force could be evolving over time, contradicting long-standing models of cosmology. The data, derived from extensive observations of millions of galaxies, provides fresh insights into the fundamental workings of the universe. Scientists are now questioning whether the standard model, which assumes a constant dark energy force, remains valid in explaining the cosmos.

According to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which operates from the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-Meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, findings suggest that dark energy may not be a fixed force. The analysis is based on data collected over three years, covering nearly 15 million galaxies and quasars. DESI's ability to simultaneously capture light from 5,000 galaxies allows researchers to examine large-scale cosmic structures and measure how the universe's expansion rate has changed over time.

As reported, inconsistencies arise when DESI's findings are compared with measurements from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae. The CMB consists of fossil light from the early universe, has been used to track the expansion history of the cosmos. Similar to thaf type Ia supernovae, often called "standard candles" for their uniform brightness, have provided key distance measurements. The DESI data suggests that dark energy's influence may have weakened over time, a deviation from the accepted cosmological model that assumes it remains unchanged.

Speaking in an official press release, DESI Project Scientist Arjun Dey stated that these findings could redefine humanity's understanding of the universe. The instrument's ongoing observations will continue to refine knowledge of dark energy's role. Scientists anticipate that by the project's conclusion, further data will offer a clearer picture of whether dark energy fluctuates, potentially reshaping existing theories of cosmic evolution.

Signal is at the centre of a fierce debate over its use by US government officials, bringing the encrypted messaging app's limitations into sharp focus.

In a shocking debacle, The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, became privy to highly sensitive discussions among top national security officials in the US after he was mistakenly added to a group chat on the Signal app comprising US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top defence officials in the Trump administration

The group members reportedly discussed upcoming military strikes targeting locations of Houthi terrorists in conflict-ridden Yemen. The discussions continued for six days before Goldberg left the group on his own while other members still seemed to be unaware of his presence in the chat, according to the report by The Atlantic.

Beyond the security breach, the incident raised questions over whether it is safe to share classified information such as plans for a bombing mission on platforms like Signal.

Signal is a pioneer of encrypted communications and is regarded as one of the most secure messaging apps currently available on the market.

It is widely considered to be a leading easy-to-use, encrypted messaging service among cybersecurity experts, since there are no public reports of hackers intercepting users' messages in-transit by cracking the platform's end-to-end encryption protocol.

The app is also a favourite of privacy and digital rights activists as it collects minimal user data and offers robust privacy features such as the option to hide your phone number and display a username instead.

Unlike Telegram, end-to-end encryption is enabled by default for all messages and voice calls on Signal. In January 2025, Signal announced a new feature that would give users the choice to transfer their chat history and media from to other Android and iOS devices or start fresh.

Signal's end-to-end encryption technology is open-source, meaning that developers can take a look under the hood and verify its security. In addition, the encryption protocol forms the basis of the security offered by other messaging apps like WhatsApp.

Since 2023, Signal has been upgrading its encryption technology to remain secure against the future, hypothetical threat of quantum computers.

When a user sends a text message on Signal, the information is encrypted and only the recipient of the message can decrypt it with specific cryptographic keys stored locally on the devices of the sender and receiver. This ensures that not even the service provider has access to the encrypted data.

It is impossible for law enforcement authorities or hackers to intercept a Signal message in-transit. Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended that American citizens use encrypted messaging apps like Signal to keep their messages private. The recommendation was made after Chinese hackers reportedly compromised US-based telecom networks to access conventional SMS text messages.

However, Signal is only as secure as the device security. Encrypted messages can be leaked if an attacker gains access to an unlocked device, installs spyware, or tricks a user into linking their account to a malicious device.

Similarly, a participant in your group chat can take screenshots of your conversation and share it elsewhere. They could also potentially hand over their device to another person who will be able to simply read your decrypted messages.

The bottom line is that Signal is not infallible against human error. Experts noted that the recent US national security leak happened because someone — whether intentionally or by mistake — added an outsider to the chat.
In its response to the ‘Signalgate' scandal, the non-profit entity behind the app said that the claim that there are ‘vulnerabilities' in Signal isn't accurate.

No, Signal does not offer ironclad protection from all forms of snooping. For instance, users on the platform could still fall for scams or phishing attacks.

Last month, Google's cybersecurity arm Mandiant released a report stating that Russian intelligence officials were trying to trick Ukrainian users on Signal into sharing their personal information and handing over access to their accounts on the platform.

However, the report did not mention whether any Signal accounts were actually compromised.

“In order to help protect people from falling victim to sophisticated phishing attacks, Signal introduced new user flows and in-app warnings. This work has been completed for some time and is unrelated to any current events,” the organisation said in a post on X.

“We also constantly monitor security@signal.org for any new reports, and we act on them with quickness while also working to protect the people who rely on us from outside threats like phishing with warnings and safeguards,” it added.

End-to-end encryption is also useless if a device has been infected with spyware like Pegasus, as threat actors can directly access the messages and files on the device without the user knowing.

While it is not possible to fully remove the risks associated with encrypted chat apps like Signal, here are a few ways you can minimise them:

– Use audio and video calls over Signal to avoid written records of what you discussed.
– Enable Relay for calls on Signals so that your IP address remains private while making phone calls to others
– Use your personal phone or laptop while communicating through Signal, as opposed to using work devices.
– Avoid connecting your personal device to work networks to prevent monitoring.
– Enable disappearing messages in Settings &gt; Privacy > Disappearing Messages to automatically delete chats after a set time.

News and sports programming, which are the biggest drivers for broadcast revenue and audiences, were also the central topic of the first panel at the TV Tech Summit, where executives at stations and networks discussed newer technologies that are helping them engage viewers and streamline operations.

When asked about the future of technologies for news and sports, panelists were particularly bullish on advances in virtual sets, remote production, standardized interoperable solutions, hybrid cloud archives and infrastructures that help streamline the delivery to multiple platforms.

During the panel, “New Tech for the Next Generation of News and Sports” Tim Hinson vice president, technology, at ABC13 KTRK in Houston Texas at the ABC Owned Television Stations, stressed that a key tech priority at the station group has been to standardize and centralize technologies. This, he said, has helped them improve quality and more efficiently produce massive amount of local news each week.

That effort, he added, also produced a number of important benefits during the L.A. wildfires.

“Over the past few years, we've been really focusing on technology and operations, centralization and standardization,” he said, adding that he wasn't “necessarily referring to just a people or a hub, for example, even though we do some of that. Really what we're talking about is centralization of technology [in terms of] reducing costs and also workflow optimization. And we're also hyper focused on making sure our common systems and workflows are standardized across the group, especially from a technology perspective, because that really, really promotes the sharing of data, content and personnel.”

Covering Wildfires with Better Tech

During the wildfires, he explained, “a lot of our other stations sent reporters, photographers and other support staff to L.A. to help out with the coverage….Because of our standardization efforts mentioned earlier, people were able to jump right in and begin working…We were able to easily provide live shots to any station around the country from any bonded cell packing unit with just a touch of a button.”

They were also able to get them working without having to “learn the station systems first…They were just able to go straight out in the field and start contributing right away,” he said.

Hinson and the other panelists also stressed the importance of engaging viewers with new ways of telling stories that can help them stand out from a crowded news and sports landscape.

One example of that is virtual sets or augmented reality technologies.

Jason Wormser, senior vice president, CW Sports noted that their production partner NASCAR Productions has recently unveiled a new virtual set in Studio 43, their state-of-the-art production facility that NASCAR uses to produce the CW NASCAR coverage.

“They've invested in a 57 foot LED wall,” he said. “They are using AR camera tracking technology with a [ARRI] Alexa 35 studio camera system…We really think this is kind of the next stage, the next step of these virtual systems" that will provide enormous flexibility and quality for the studio production.”

During the panel, Scott Warren, president and general manager, CBS Bay Area (KPIX/KPIX+) discussed a ground-breaking case study of how the CBS-owned stations were able to deploy virtual sets, which until relatively recently, required the kind of large budgets and engineering staff that only large networks could afford.

Warren said the project began in 2023 as part of a push to find better ways to tell stories and provide better, more engaging weather coverage. “We wanted to make an immersive experience, because weather is more than two dimensional,” he explained. “It's more than a person in front of a map, it's cloud stacks, it's elevation, it's wind, it's rain, it's precipitation…We felt like we could tell the weather story in a better way in an immersive environment, and that's where this all started.”

In the development process of the system, they worked with Myreze, a branding and virtual production company from Norway. Other vendors included Zero Density's virtual solution, rendering from the Unreal Engine, camera tracking from stYpe and Baron Weather for integrated weather data.

The Secret Sauce for Immersive Local News

A key component, however, was their inhouse tech talent, Warren stressed. “We had to challenge them [all the vendors], as well as ourselves, because we couldn't add bodies…We really had to do it with the existing team…We had to do something different and bring all of this in house and have it hook up into an automated control room with just one director.”

And…that was the where the secret sauce comes in, [the station's inhouse tech talent],” he added. “Our coders and our engineers have worked feverishly to pull all the pieces and parts [together] and to get inside all of the third party vendors' engines and reconfigure things to make it work.”

The result, he adds, is “TV in a box. We've created a system that does work with just one director driving the whole thing, and one operator, and that's it.”

The system is so streamlined they've been able to since install it at other CBS owned stations in New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Colorado and Miami. It has also been expanded for additional types of coverage, including breaking news and sports, with the CBS stations using it for their March Madness Coverage.

In San Francisco, they've become so comfortable with the solution that they've discarded all the hard sets.

The system is particularly appealing for breaking news. “The magic of the weather system is that everything is in real time and real time data,” Warren said. “The big challenge at the very beginning of building this was, how do we bring all that weather data from the National Weather Service and other partners into our system at every single elevation in the atmosphere, to show every different kind of condition, pressure, wind, precipitation and temperature, all the things that factor into what makes weather. How do we bring that digital information into the system in real time and create the visual representations of what that is doing?”

The resulting system “does exactly that,” he explained. “It builds graphics in real time.”

This has also been important for breaking news like wildfires. “We're able to watch fires and fire lines develop with these virtual maps,” he said, adding that it has also been a great tool for covering “earthquakes...We're able to locate and show the magnitude as it ripples out across an area, and all of this is driven by the meteorologists in real time who have an iPad.”

The Remote Production Game

During the panel, CW's Wormser also highlighted the growing importance of remote production tech advances in cutting the costs of sports production.

“Our system is a little bit different than everybody else's, because we are using third parties,” that are producing events for us,” Wormser explained, using remote production technologies. “With REMI, with COVID…it just accelerated so many things in our business [so that remote production]...is kind of the next step” in sports production.

Wormser noted that remote productions have given them more flexibility in the way they've produced events, while reducing costs and freeing up money to improve the productions.

“It just saves so much, and it also gives you flexibility in the future of trying new things, trying different ideas, spending more time on pre-produced or post-produced elements,” he said. “It gives you a little bit more flexibility at a lower cost.”

“All the networks are doing it,” he added. “ESPN has been doing it with basketball. Fox has been doing this for years…It goes back into the early 2000s basically, they were bringing games in from across the world, and they were voicing and doing all the graphics in their studios in Los Angeles, and calling him off the monitor because they don't have the money to go around the world. So it's only going to get better. The technology is unbelievable, and will enable networks to put the money into rights and yet still have high quality, innovative production and content for the viewers.”

The TV Tech Summit had a full separate panel on remote productions discussing those developments in more detail.

Starlink is on the verge of launching its satellite broadband service in India, with regulatory approval from the government expected soon. Recently, the company has teamed up with Jio and Airtel to distribute its equipment throughout the country. In addition to India, Starlink is gearing up to expand its reach in various other nations. Currently, its broadband service operates in 125 countries and boasts over 7 million users.

However, Starlink might encounter fierce competition from Chinese satellite broadband providers like SpaceSail in the foreseeable future. The company is preparing to make its entry into markets such as Brazil, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan.

Elon Musk's goal for Starlink is to acquire at least 1 million new users each year, a target that could gain significant momentum following its launch in India. That said, there are concerns that the arrival of these Chinese companies could pose challenges for Starlink.

In India, Starlink will also face competition from local providers like Airtel and Jio, as well as Amazon Kuiper. The telecom regulator is poised to allocate spectrum for satellite services, with consultations from stakeholders and experts nearly complete.

Starlink has been waiting since 2022 to roll out its services in India. This high-speed internet service operates through SpaceX satellites orbiting close to the Earth. Once the necessary regulatory approval and spectrum allocation from the Government of India are secured, Starlink is set to officially begin its operations, especially now that it has partnered with Jio and Airtel, which bodes well for a timely approval.

Meanwhile, the government's efforts to tackle cyber fraud are intensifying and show no signs of slowing down. As of February this year, authorities have blocked over 780,000 SIM cards, more than 3,000 Skype IDs, and upwards of 83,000 WhatsApp accounts.

BANGKOK (AP) — China protested Wednesday after the U.S. added dozens of companies to its export control list, including more than 50 based in China that it says sought advanced knowhow in supercomputing, artificial intelligence and quantum technology for military purposes. 

Companies from Taiwan, Iran, Pakistan, South Africa and United Arab Emirates also were included in the roughly 80 companies added to the “entity list” of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. 

Six are subsidiaries of the Inspur Group, China's leading cloud computing and big data service provider. It was listed in the U.S. government's entity list in 2023. 

The update also includes the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, which objected vehemently.

“We are shocked that a private non-profit scientific research institution has been added to the entity list. We strongly oppose this wrong decision without any factual basis and ask the relevant U.S. departments to withdraw it,” the research institute said in a statement.

A review committee said the BAAI and another company, the Beijing Innovation Wisdom Technology Co. were judged to have developed large AI models and advanced computer chips for military purposes. 

China's Foreign Ministry also lashed back, saying the entity list and other export controls were an abuse meant to “unjustly suppress Chinese enterprises.”




“It seriously violates international law and basic norms of international relations, severely damages the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, and undermines the security and stability of global supply chains. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns this,” ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a routine news briefing Wednesday. 

The aim is to restrict China's capacity to acquire and develop ultra fast, or “exascale” supercomputers, to develop hypersonic weapons and other sensitive technologies, the bureau said in a notice on its website. It also is intended to prevent South Africa's Test Flying Academy from using U.S. goods to train Chinese troops, disrupt Iran's access to unmanned aerial vehicles and other military items and hinder development of insecure nuclear and ballistic missile programs, it said. 

The companies on the list are subject to the “foreign direct product rule” of the BIS which allows it to control reexports and transfers of foreign-made products containing technology that the U.S. government deems vital for national security. 

The tightening of controls comes as the Trump administration prepares for another round of tariff hikes due next week, an escalation of the trade war that President Donald Trump launched during his first term in office. 

Trump has already raised tariffs on imports of Chinese goods to 20%. On Monday he said he would impose a 25% tariff on all imports from any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela. China buys a large share of the oil exported by Venezuela. 

China has retaliated with its own countermeasures, including sweeping new duties on a variety of American goods and an anti-monopoly investigation into Google.

It also has moved to tighten its own sanctions regime, meanwhile, with a law enabling it to freeze assets of companies subject to Chinese sanctions.

By Raphael Satter

WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -The best-known member of Elon Musk's U.S. DOGE Service team of technologists once provided support to a cybercrime gang that bragged about trafficking in stolen data and cyberstalking an FBI agent, according to digital records reviewed by Reuters.

Edward Coristine is among the most visible members of the DOGE effort that has been given sweeping access to official networks as it attempts to radically downsize the U.S. government.

Past reporting had focused on his youth - he is 19 - and his chosen nickname of "bigballs," which became a pop culture punchline. Musk has championed the teen on his social media site X, telling his followers last month that "Big Balls is awesome."

Beginning around 2022, while still in high school, Coristine ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services, according to corporate and digital records reviewed by Reuters and interviews with half a dozen former associates. Among its users was a website run by a ring of cybercriminals operating under the name "EGodly," according to digital records preserved by the internet intelligence firm DomainTools and the online cybersecurity tool Any.Run.

The details of Coristine's connection to EGodly have not been previously reported.

On Feb. 15, 2023, EGodly thanked Coristine's company for its assistance in a post on the Telegram messaging app.

"We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website," the message said.

The digital records reviewed by Reuters showed the EGodly website, dataleak.fun, was tied to internet protocol addresses registered to DiamondCDN and other Coristine-owned entities between October 2022 and June 2023, and that some users attempting to access the site around that time would hit a DiamondCDN "Security check."

Coristine did not return messages seeking comment. Musk's team, which has adopted the name "Department of Government Efficiency" though it is not an official government department, did not respond to emails about Coristine. He is listed as a "senior adviser" at the State Department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to one official at each agency who told Reuters they had seen his name in their respective agencies' staff directory.

On LinkedIn, Coristine describes himself as a "Volunteer (Intern) Plumber" with the U.S. government.

The State Department did not return messages asking about Coristine. CISA, which is responsible for protecting federal government networks from cybercriminals and foreign spies, declined comment.

EGodly's Telegram channel has been inactive for the past year; attempts to elicit comment from eight people who participated in or interacted with EGodly were unsuccessful.

'THESE ARE BAD FOLKS'

DiamondCDN's website - CDN typically stands for "content delivery network" - was registered in mid-2022, according to records collected by DomainTools. It pitched itself as offering "excellent security tools" that would help "lower your infrastructure costs," according to copies of the site maintained by the Internet Archive. The site said the company "has no business inspecting user content."

In 2023, EGodly boasted on its Telegram channel of hijacking phone numbers, breaking into unspecified law enforcement email accounts in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and cryptocurrency theft. Early that year, the group distributed the personal details of an FBI agent who they said was investigating them, circulating his phone number, photographs of his house, and other private details on Telegram.

EGodly also posted an audio recording of an obscene prank call made to the agent's phone and a video, shot from the inside of a car, of an unknown party driving by the agent's house in Wilmington, Delaware at night and screaming out the window, "EGodly says you're a bitch!"

Reuters could not independently verify EGodly's boasts of cybercriminal activity, including its claims to have hijacked phone numbers or infiltrated law enforcement emails. But it was able to authenticate the video by visiting the same Wilmington address and comparing the building to the one in the footage.

The FBI agent targeted by EGodly, who is now retired, told Reuters that the group had drawn law enforcement attention because of its connection to swatting, the dangerous practice of making hoax emergency calls to send armed officers swarming targeted addresses. The agent didn't go into detail. Reuters is not identifying him out of concern for further harassment.

"These are bad folks," the former agent said. "They're not a pleasant group."

He declined to comment further about the harassment or whether EGodly had been or still was the subject of an FBI investigation. The FBI didn't return messages seeking comment on EGodly.

Reuters was not able to ascertain how long EGodly used DiamondCDN, or whether EGodly paid Coristine's company. Archived copies of DiamondCDN's website said the firm envisioned having both paying and nonpaying customers.

Another individual who has been subject to abuse from EGodly and a cybercrime researcher who has followed the group said it was composed of hardened fraudsters, citing the group's makeup and the credibility of its claims. Both asked not to be identified, citing fears of retaliation.

Even if the connection between Coristine and EGodly were fleeting, Nitin Natarajan, who served as the deputy director of CISA under former President Joe Biden, told Reuters it was worrying that someone who provided services to EGodly only two years ago was part of a group that has gained wide access to government networks.

"This stuff was not in the distant past," he said. "The recency of the activity and the types of groups he was associated would definitely be concerning."

          March 26, 2025
        



NASHVILLE, TENN. – Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. today showcased a bold array of new and refreshed models, along with next-generation technologies set to debut in the U.S. and Canada from FY25 through FY27. Loaded with innovative features, the new products will play a crucial role in elevating the company's performance, boosting customer loyalty, attracting new buyers, increasing profitability, and promoting sustainable growth.

To meet the rising demand for diverse powertrain options, the upcoming lineup will include hybrid technologies (including e-POWER and plug-in hybrids), next-generation electric vehicles (EVs), and advanced internal combustion engines (ICE).

Guillaume Cartier, chief performance officer, stated: "Today, we unveil our redefined market approach and tailored product strategy designed to better meet customer needs and drive top-line growth. Through powertrain diversification and new models, we will provide a broader range of options that cater to diverse customer preferences, further distinguishing Nissan and INFINITI brands." 

Ivan Espinosa, chief planning officer, said: "Over the next two years, we are excited to roll out an impressive lineup that will redefine the road! This includes the reimagined Nissan LEAF, and a daring new Micra EV. But that's not all – we're refreshing our range of SUVs to elevate the driving experience, and our next-generation e-POWER promises new levels of refinement and efficiency. We are committed to investing in products that embody the very best of Nissan. To our passionate fans and loyal owners around the world, I can assure you, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey ahead."

Christian Meunier, chairman, Nissan Americas, said: "North America is a key market, and we are taking quick actions to get us back to growth and set the stage for the exciting products to come.

We're strengthening our retail partnerships to deliver high customer satisfaction and hear the voice of the market. Our dealers are fully engaged and enthusiastic for the future.

We're simplifying our operations and retail programs so that we can attack our cost structures, allowing us to deliver the right products to our customers, when they want them, where they need them, and for the right price.

With these actions, and continued investments in our business, we expect an accelerated recovery, supported by strong sales of the fantastic new products already in market, and future models on the way. Full speed ahead!"

The U.S. and Canada will see more than 10 new and refreshed products in key segments, including next-gen EV and hybrid technology and INFINITI models.

In FY25, the U.S. and Canada will be the first markets to launch the all-new Nissan LEAF, joining Ariya in the brand's EV portfolio. 



Reimagined as a sleek and spacious family-friendly crossover, the third-generation all-new Nissan LEAF pairs substantial improvements in aerodynamics with a more advanced EV architecture. 

As a first for the iconic EV nameplate, the all-new LEAF will be available with 19-inch alloy wheels and a panoramic moonroof. For the North American market, a NACS charging port is also integrated – the first time for a Nissan EV – enabling convenient access to the Tesla Supercharger network.

The all-new LEAF sits on Nissan's modular CMF-EV platform (which debuted with the Ariya). Efficient energy management, streamlined packaging and enhanced driving performance from Nissan's new 3-in-1 EV powertrain, are expected to help deliver significant range improvements over the previous generation. Today's announcement provides a first glimpse at this new model, with further details to be shared mid-year.

Additionally, Nissan will commence sales of the brand's first plug-in hybrid in North America, in a PHEV version of the compact Rogue SUV.

A new generation of Nissan's top-selling Sentra compact sedan will be introduced later this year, alongside a refreshed mid-size Pathfinder SUV.

For INFINITI, a refreshed three-row luxury QX60 SUV will be offered, alongside a new SPORT package for the full-size QX80 SUV.  

In FY26, production of the all-new, fourth-generation Rogue will begin. The model will be the first to offer Nissan's innovative e-POWER technology to consumers in the U.S. and Canada. Nissan will also offer Rogue with a powerful and efficient internal combustion engine, as well as a plug-in hybrid model, providing a diverse range of powertrains to shine in the market's most popular vehicle segment. 

INFINITI will launch the all-new QX65 crossover coupe. Channeling inspiration from the pioneering INFINITI FX, INFINITI QX65 promises buyers a stylish two-row alternative in the very popular mid-size crossover segment. 

Then from late FY27, an all-new Nissan EV is scheduled to commence production at Nissan's Canton, Mississippi plant in the U.S. The all-new model will be an adventure-focused SUV. It will be joined in FY28 by a luxury INFINITI EV SUV (inspired by the Vision QXe concept) that pairs the brand's latest Artistry in Motion design language with a suite of technology features.

Under the recent agreement with SK On, both of these future models will feature U.S.-manufactured batteries, supporting 1,700 U.S. jobs at SK On, and involving a total investment of $661 million, including equipment purchases. This is in addition to Nissan's $500 million in investments for EV production at the Canton Assembly Plant.

For customers seeking a sophisticated hybrid powertrain, Nissan's third-generation e-POWER will benefit from the learnings of over 1.6 million produced units since the technology was first introduced in 2016.

The third-generation e-POWER system delivers notable improvements in efficiency where it is targeted to provide up to 15% enhancement in economy at high speeds compared to the current, second-generation system. It will also deliver lower emissions and enhanced refinement through reduced noise and vibration.

A unique Nissan technology, e-POWER uses a small capacity gasoline engine and lithium-ion battery to power an electric motor. As the electric motor alone drives the wheels, the result is an EV-like driving experience, characterized by powerful and responsive acceleration paired with quiet operation.

Central to the advancement is the adoption of a new 1.5-liter e-POWER dedicated engine and the new 5-in-1 system, which shares core components with Nissan's latest EV powertrain.

The third-generation e‐POWER system will debut in North America in FY26 in the next-generation Rogue.

Nissan is committed to delivering the highest customer satisfaction, sustainability, and enhanced business performance. More details on each new product, as well as news on additional models that the company plans to launch, will be shared closer to the start of sales in each respective market.

*Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. financial years are from April through March.

News Corp's chief technology officer David Kline is resigning from his role to accept an undisclosed position “outside the organisation.”

Kline will remain with News Corp until the end of June as a search for his successor is underway.

“After more than five incredibly productive and exciting years as CTO of News Corp, I am resigning with mixed emotions. It's been a remarkable journey, and while it's bittersweet to step away, I do so knowing that the technology organisation is stronger than ever, with a high-performing, forward-looking team firmly in place. I'm deeply grateful to Rupert, Lachlan, Robert and the entire News Corp leadership team for their trust, partnership and support throughout this chapter,” Kline said in his exit statement.

Kline joined News Corp in January 2020 and over the last five years has driven a rapid period of legacy system overhaul and global implementations of new technology solutions. He moved to News Corp from Viacom Global where he had served as executive VP of technology, CTO and CIO since 2010. His technology career is steeped in media experience, with earlier senior leadership roles at Discovery Communications and AMC Networks.

News Corp CEO Robert Thompson said Kline's contribution, “at a time of profound transformation,” was a crucial element to the media giant's success.

“Dave's drive and leadership have been crucial to our success as other media companies have floundered and foundered. His contribution to our company will resonate for many years to come, both in his enduring positive influence and through the strong and talented tech team that he has assembled,” said Thomson.</p>

Financial advisers face mounting pressure to improve efficiency, driven by both regulatory demands and commercial realities.

Demand for advice continues to grow – particularly in tax planning, as frozen allowances and upcoming changes to pension inheritance tax relief reshape financial strategies. And clients – and the regulator are increasingly expecting advisers to provide better value for money.

In the meantime, capacity isn't growing to meet the growing demand because adviser numbers stay stubbornly static.

One answer is that advisers need to get more efficient so that they can look after more clients and also provide a better customer experience.

The movement towards more productivity is painfully slow

So the rising demand is presenting advisers with opportunities, but only for those who adapt. The danger is that the tax changes will create more work for advisers but it won't necessarily boost their profits and maybe not even their revenues. The movement towards more productivity is painfully slow.

It is true that advisers are turning to technology to improve their efficiency, according to our latest report, UK Financial Advisers: Planning and Technology. But the pace of their adoption of technology is slow overall and there are big differences in the speed of progress for different parts of the advice process, as we've outlined below.

Technology has transformed some areas of financial planning in recent years. Risk profiling tools are used by nearly all advisers and they have mostly been integrated into advice firms' centralised investment processes. That wasn't the case just a few years ago.

The regulator's retirement income advice review may prompted some advisers to use of cash flow planning for clients approaching or in retirement, but many advisers now see commercial benefits from using the tool to engage clients in a rich experience of thinking hard about their finances.

Yet many manual processes persist in the advice process, notably fact-finding and letters of authority. Advisers' use of manual paper-based fact-finding has only dropped from three-quarters of advisers to two-thirds in five years, so progress here remains horribly slow.

Client portals aim to streamline workflows, but relatively few clients use them and they often complain about their poor useability. And still the advice process beset by fragmented digital experiences and multiple logins.

However, AI-driven transcription is gaining traction in fact-finding, improving efficiency and accuracy of recording. Currently, only one in six (16%) advisers use these facilities but numbers are growing.

Many advisers consider letter of authority (LoA) process the least efficient aspect of their service. Providers dictate the various LoA methods they're willing to accept, which complicates advisers' administration.

Providers and platforms have a great opportunity to offer innovative solutions

But innovative solutions from tech providers like Pension Lab, Re:LoA and Unipass are gaining traction with some advice firms.

With the growing impact of tax on clients' finances for providers we would expect to see lots of helpful tax calculators and other programmes, but advisers report that there are few tax tools in their financial planning suites.

Roughly two-thirds of advisers say they use calculators for income, capital gains and inheritance tax liabilities but often they are mostly free but clunky online tools or the ancillary to their cash flow modellers or their platforms.

Advisers' adoption of technology is progressing, but the pace is slow many advice processes remain manual and fragmented. Providers and platforms have a great opportunity to offer innovative solutions.

Mews, the industry leading hospitality cloud, has been chosen by Pelham Hospitality to centralize operations, enhance the guest experience and unlock new levels of efficiency across their hotels and event spaces.

Pelham Hospitality runs a collection of three boutique properties in Cape Cod. Pelham House Resort is its flagship property, which also hosts large weddings every weekend, alongside Pelham on Main and Pelham on Earl. The brand is known for its fresh, bright aesthetic and highly personalized service. For General Manager Heather McCarthy, switching to Mews was a long time coming.

“The second I saw Mews, I was obsessed,” said McCarthy. “It's like my hotel brain created an ideal system that's super flexible with lots of open interfaces, incredibly user-friendly, and complete with built-in guest messaging. It checked all the boxes.”

By moving to Mews, Pelham Hospitality will streamline reservations, upsells, and sales and catering, bringing everything under one roof. Their previous property management system and sales and catering software operated independently, creating manual workarounds and data silos. Now, with Mews as the central hub, their systems will be fully integrated, saving time, reducing admin and improving reporting.

Pelham Hospitality is also onboarding Thynk for sales and catering at the same time, connected seamlessly via Mews Marketplace. This hotel tech app store allows the team to easily integrate to pre-approved solutions without additional connection fees. “Mews is the hub of our operations but having that flexibility to choose specialist partners is huge,” McCarthy said. “Once I attached to the idea of picking the expert system in that area and making sure they connect really well, it made a ton of sense.”

Because of the brand's focus on providing memorable experiences, it was important to choose a system that puts guests at its center. In addition to providing user-friendly guest communication tools like direct messaging, Mews automates manual tasks so that staff have more time to spend directly with guests.

“The onboarding has been so refreshing,” added McCarthy. “It's great to meet like-minded hospitality folks who all speak the same language. It feels fresh, but also very personal. And all this smart automation will let us focus on our ultimate priority: being able to tailor the guest journey to the individual guest, which is fundamental to who we are.”

Matt Welle, Mews CEO, commented: “Pelham Hospitality is a perfect example of how great hospitality stems from being open minded. They truly thought about their brand's needs and what they wanted to get out of a new system, which in turn will help them to create even more exceptional guest experiences. Their commitment to flexibility and seamless operations aligns perfectly with Mews, and we're thrilled to support their vision for modern hospitality.”

Pelham Hospitality joins several other hotels on Cape Cod powered by Mews, such as AWOL Provincetown and The Coonamessett, both managed by Lark Hotels, as well as independents like Emerald Resort, Anchor Inn Beach House and Gifford House. Mews is also the first ever PMS to be an active member of the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce, cementing its commitment to the area.

OpenAI has significantly upgraded its ChatGPT chatbot, expanding its capabilities beyond text-based conversations to advanced image generation. The company unveiled the latest update on Tuesday, integrating new technology that enables ChatGPT to create highly detailed and complex images based on user prompts.

The new version, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model, can generate intricate visuals, including multi-panel comic strips with custom characters and dialogue. This marks a major leap from previous versions, which, while capable of image generation, struggled with blending multiple complex concepts into a single output.

The development reflects a broader shift in artificial intelligence, where chatbots are evolving into multifunctional tools. Originally designed for text-based tasks such as answering questions, writing poetry, and generating code, ChatGPT now supports voice commands, images, and even video interactions.

OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT in late 2022, training it on vast amounts of text data from across the internet. While the chatbot initially lacked image-generation capabilities, OpenAI later released DALL-E, a separate tool designed for that purpose. The latest iteration of ChatGPT, however, merges these functionalities into a single, more powerful system that learns from both text and visual data.

Historically, AI image generators have struggled with creating visuals that deviate significantly from existing examples. However, OpenAI claims the new ChatGPT can now handle requests for unconventional images—such as a bicycle with triangular wheels—more effectively.

Starting Tuesday, the enhanced ChatGPT will be available to both free and paid users. Subscribers to ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) and ChatGPT Pro ($200 per month) will also gain access to OpenAI's latest AI tools.
