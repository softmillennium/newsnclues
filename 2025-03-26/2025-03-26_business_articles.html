Oops, something went wrong

GameStop (GME) stock slid more than 8% in after-hours trading Wednesday as the company announced it's attempting to raise $1.3 billion to buy bitcoin (BTC-USD).

The company will attempt to raise the funds via convertible senior notes.

The news comes one day after GameStop shares rose more nearly 12% when the video game operator turned popular meme stock said in a release that its board "has unanimously approved an update to its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset."

The planned bitcoin investment comes about a month after CNBC reported GameStop was exploring cryptocurrency investments. On Feb. 8, a social media post from GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen sparked speculation over GameStop's interest in cryptocurrency. Cohen posted a picture on X with Strategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor, who has famously hitched his company to bitcoin. It now holds more than 447,000 tokens, per a February filing.

The strategy has worked out well for Saylor's company, with the stock up over 84% in the past year amid a rise in the price of bitcoin. But Wall Street strategists are hesitant to conclude that GameStop investing in bitcoin would mean the video game retailer's stock has upside.

"The company's strategy, which has changed about six times in three years, is they're going to buy cryptocurrency and be just like MicroStrategy," Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance on Monday ahead of the earnings release. 

He added, "The problem with that thinking is MicroStrategy trades at about two times their bitcoin holdings. If GameStop were to buy all bitcoin with their $4.6 billion in cash and trade at two times [their bitcoin holdings,] the stock would drop five bucks."

Also after the bell on Tuesday, GameStop reported fourth quarter earnings results. The company posted $1.28 billion in net sales for the quarter, marking a 28% decline from the year-earlier period. For the full year, GameStop reported an adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million, down from $64.7 million seen the year prior.

Chandler has long been known as a hub of innovation in Arizona, but today that reputation extends around the globe. Our city stands at the forefront of the semiconductor revolution, with industry leaders like Intel investing billions in our community and a thriving supply chain of high-tech manufacturers choosing Chandler as their home. Our future is brighter than ever.  

But for Chandler to maintain its competitive edge, businesses—both large and small—need access to reliable, affordable energy. That's why the Chandler Chamber of Commerce supports the agreement between Southwest Gas and the staff of the Arizona Corporation Commission, the state's utility regulator, in the company's pending rate request.   

Chandler's growth in the semiconductor sector has been nothing short of remarkable. Intel's massive investment in our city has solidified our position as a leader in advanced manufacturing. The businesses that support semiconductor production—from suppliers to logistics companies—are expanding here, bringing jobs and economic prosperity. These companies depend on stable, predictable energy rates to make long-term investments in Chandler, and natural gas plays a crucial role in keeping operations running efficiently and affordably.   

With Chandler's growth, though, comes the expectation that we offer amenities families want and a quality of life that brings folks here. Take Chandler's downtown, which has become one of the Valley's most exciting destinations. Our restaurants are bustling with guests, serving up world-class meals that wouldn't be possible without natural gas cooktops. For these businesses, reliable access to natural gas isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. From fast and casual to fine dining establishments, our culinary scene thrives thanks to affordable energy and access to natural gas.    

Southwest Gas has been a trusted partner to the Chandler business community. The company works closely with businesses of all sizes, ensuring that natural gas remains an accessible, cost-effective energy source. Small businesses, in particular, rely on natural gas to keep costs manageable while delivering high-quality products and services to customers. In an era of economic uncertainty, our small businesses need energy stability, and Southwest Gas provides just that.   

As a chamber of commerce leader, what has impressed me most is Southwest Gas' commitment to open communication. The company has maintained an open-door policy with the Chandler Chamber of Commerce and its members, engaging in a transparent and constructive dialogue about the potential for a rate increase, which today is smaller than in our initial meetings. They have taken the time to explain the need to attract the capital that will make possible the infrastructure investments necessary to maintain safety and reliability and to meet the demands of Chandler's growth, all while ensuring rates remain competitive for businesses. This kind of engagement and fair and balanced approach is exactly what we expect from a responsible corporate partner.  

Chandler is growing, and the demand for energy is growing with it. If we want to continue attracting world-class companies, creating jobs, and supporting our local businesses, we must ensure that reliable, affordable natural gas remains part of our energy mix.  

We've looked closely at the agreement between Southwest Gas and the Corporation Commission staff. Rate increases—even modest ones like this one—are rarely popular, but this proposal has been vetted with community stakeholders, it makes sense for our community, and it is consistent with recent outcomes for other regulated utilities. We urge the Arizona Corporation Commission to grant its approval so that Chandler's business community can continue to thrive with the help of affordable and reliable natural gas.  

Terri Kimble is the president and CEO of the Chandler Chamber of Commerce.

            Dollar Tree is ending its short-lived and ill-fated Family Dollar experiment, offloading the discount brand for $1 billion – just a fraction of its purchase price from a decade ago.
    


            Family Dollar will be sold to private equity groups Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management, pending regulatory approval that is expected to clear next quarter. Dollar Tree bought Family dollar in 2015 for $9 billion.
    


            “The Dollar Tree leadership team and Board of Directors determined that a sale of Family Dollar to Brigade and Macellum best unlocks value for Dollar Tree shareholders and positions Family Dollar for future success,” the company said in a statement.
    


            Family Dollar has around 8,000 US stores, catering to low-income customers predominantly in cities with prices typically ranging from $1 to $10. The chain has struggled in recent years. Last year, Family Dollar announced plans to close more than 900 stores and was put up for sale.
    


            Messy stores, high prices and over-expansion have plagued Family Dollar, analysts say. The chain has also faced steep competition from larger retailers, such as Walmart.
    


            The sale of Family Dollar “closes the book on a sad and troubled chapter for Dollar Tree,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Wednesday. “Dollar Tree bit off far more than it could chew.”
    


            The sale comes at a difficult moment for Family Dollar and other dollar store chains. Inflation in recent years has increased Family Dollar's operating costs and squeezed its lower-income customers. President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported goods put a further put further pressure on dollar stores.
    


            “We continue to see value seeking behavior across all customer groups,” Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon said on a call with analysts Wednesday. Dollar Tree caters to more middle-income customers than Family Dollar.
    


            Tariffs have introduced “uncertainty and volatility,” Creedon said, but Dollar Tree is shifting its suppliers to try to mitigate the impact and considering raising prices.
    


            Dollar Tree believed acquiring Family Dollar would help it compete against bigger rivals. The combined company hoped that by joining forces it could grow its customer base, reduce costs and fend off Dollar General, which is located primarily in rural areas. Dollar General had also bid for Family Dollar.
    


            But Dollar Tree misjudged the deal. The match between the two different chains was a poor fit, Wall Street analysts have said, and Dollar Tree has struggled to manage the larger Family Dollar store base.
    


            Family Dollar stores were in worse condition than Dollar Tree management expected, and early strategies to improve sales, such as selling beer, fell short. Many Family Dollar stores were located too close to each other and cannibalized each other's own sales.
    


            A year later, an activist investor pushed for a sale of the “underperforming” Family Dollar business, and Family Dollar announced it would close hundreds of stores.
    


            Even though Family Dollar has renovated thousands of stores in recent years, many are still poorly maintained, analysts say.
    


            Family Dollar was hit with a record $41.6 million fine by the Justice Department last year for violating product safety standards after selling items that were stocked in a rat-infested warehouse in West Memphis filled with live, dead and decaying rodents.
    


            It's not just Family Dollar that has struggled — the entire dollar store industry has been under pressure in recent years.
    


            Dollar Tree and Dollar General have hit trouble as low-income customers struggle to afford basic necessities and dial back their spending and competition from Walmart and other chains increases. 99 Cents Only filed for bankruptcy last year.
    


            “Our customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said on an earnings call Thursday. “Many of our customers report they only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities.”
    


            Many companies are noting a consumer slowdown across income levels because of inflation, tariffs and a wobbly stock market.
    


            Dollar Tree said last year that tariffs may lead it to alter some product specifications, change sizes or remove them from stores altogether if they become too costly. Dollar Tree may also raise prices from their current level of $1.25.
    


            An estimated 40% of Dollar Tree's sales are reliant on imported goods, leaving the retailer highly exposed to tariffs, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets analysis.
    


            Dollar Tree may also raise prices to combat tariffs, joining a growing list of chains from Walmart to Best Buy that say that will hike prices to offset any impact.
    


            In 2021, Dollar Tree raised base prices to $1.25 after 30 years of selling items for just a dollar. Dollar Tree also sells some products for up to $7.

Salt Lake City has become a thriving metropolis with a booming population and plenty of job opportunities in banking and tech.

Many residents, like former Gov. Michael Leavitt, point to the 2002 Winter Olympics as the catalyst for the city's transformation.  

"A lot of good things came together at the right time. We had a growing population. Tech was becoming — it was in its infancy and was expanding. A startup culture was important," Leavitt said. "We were in the position to be able to educate a lot of engineers at the right time, and then to be able to close that in the art, in the brand of the Olympics, that was a good combination."

Salt Lake City is also a major draw for finance, with one of the highest concentrations of industrial banks in the U.S.; 15 of the nation's 23 industrial banks are located in the county.

The metro's snow economy sets it apart from other cities and will once again help boost Salt Lake City's profile on an international stage when it hosts the Winter Olympic Games in 2034. 

Yet some real challenges are ahead. Climate change and a lack of diversity, for example, could affect the city's future.

A month ago, City Council approved an ordinance allowing cars with expired tags to be towed. Monday night, the sponsors of that earlier plan pitched another proposal, this time aimed at cracking down business owners that don't pay pay their property taxes. After a contentious debate, council opted to take a different route, referring the proposal to a committee to review, delaying a vote on implementing the plan.

The proposal was another piece of public safety legislation authored by Mayor Ken McClure, who is less than a month away from leaving the post he's held for the past eight years, and Councilman Craig Hosmer. The pair co-sponsored the ordinance, which would require applicants seeking occupational licenses to be up to date on their personal property taxes.

The amendments to the current ordinance would require that an applicant include paid receipts for "all personal property taxes due Greene County for property held in the name of the applicant for the previous calendar year." For those who might not owe taxes that year, a statement of non-assessment would have to be included.

City Attorney Jordan Paul said such a requirement has been found to be allowable under state and federal laws and that a similar requirement is already in place in St. Louis and Kansas City.

Greene County Assessor Brent Johnson addressed council and noted that while the city has issued roughly 11,000 business licenses, he has only received a little more than 4,000 business assessment lists from within city limits for the year. He said business assessment lists are similar to personal property assessment — owners list their assets, which for businesses include any equipment, furniture, vehicles, and any other tangible property that is used for the business.

If that list is never filled out and returned, taxes cannot be billed. Johnson also noted it is a matter of education — some business owners do not know that they are required to fill out assessments or what assets would have to be assessed.

Unlike the requirement of an individual property tax receipt for vehicle registration, Greene County Collector Allen Icet said the county has no effective mechanism to crack down on businesses that are not declaring the property they own nor paying their taxes. While collections from property taxes do not make up a large portion of the city's budget, these tax revenues do fund Springfield Public Schools, Springfield-Greene County Library District, and other tax entities.

Hosmer and McClure's proposed change would require those who want to renew or receive a new business license to show they have paid their business' property taxes. Hosmer said this would be a similar process to what the state already uses for vehicle registration, ensuring all business owners are held to the same standards. He highlighted SPS' need for the revenue, particularly as discussions of job cuts have surfaced more recently.

Councilman Abe McGull was the one to suggest referring the proposal to the Plans and Policies Committee prior to voting on it. He emphasized that he was not against the goal of the ordinance and ensuring everyone pays their fair share but rather wanted the details to be more fleshed out and allow time for public feedback.

"When you send things through committee, all those things are hashed out, everybody in the community is aware of it," he said. "But you're asking us, in two weeks, to pass this major piece of legislation that's going to affect a lot of people, the small businesses and stuff like that, and they may not even know about it. Not everybody watches the city council meetings."

The towing ordinance passed by council Feb. 24 in a 5-3 vote also had not gone through committees prior to being presented to council for a vote. Hosmer questioned why committee work was brought up for an ordinance specifically dealing with businesses and not for the general public.

"It's a privilege to do business in the city of Springfield, and we should make people pay their fair share, businesses and individuals both," Hosmer said. "So, I think it's imperative that we go ahead and do this, and I don't think it should be sent to committee, because the last time my bills got sent to committee, they never seem to come back."

Councilwoman Monica Horton and Councilman Brandon Jenson, both of whom voted against the towing ordinance, noted that the discussion was not about showing favoritism to businesses but ensuring all questions are answered prior to making legislative decisions. Horton noted there is no rush to put the issue to a vote.

"We might have had a unanimous vote on the towing amendment, if it had went to committee and we had fleshed out some of the issues that came before us to the public," she said. "I think that, you know, because we're having this type of tug of war here, I think that there is some value-add and some benefit to flesh this out a little bit better, instead of doing this sloppily."

Jenson said that when he was onboarded, he was told that there should be no ordinance that comes before council without going to committee prior. He recently referred Right to Counsel to committee. While there is nothing that requires ordinances to go before committee, City Code does state that it is council policy "to encourage the referral of council bills involving policy issues and substantive changes to the appropriate city council committee." Likewise, there is no legislation or strict rules about how long an ordinance, program or topic can remain in committee or what must come out of the process.

"I am surprised that the sponsors of this bill, who gave me that instruction, now have brought two ordinances forward that have a substantial impact on people in our community without following the process that I was told is critically important to good policy," he said.

Ultimately, the referral passed 7-2 with McClure and Hosmer opposed. Hosmer said he does not have another future ordinance planned regarding property tax enforcement. With upcoming April 8 election, the issue will be taken up by a new mayor and possibly new council members.

When the towing ordinance was passed last month, Springfield Police Department declared there would be an educational period before enforcement began. With that period over, SPD may begin towing vehicles with inadequate registration starting Wednesday, March 26. Police Chief Paul Williams had previously said initially officers will go after cars that are a year or more expired.

Both Johnson and Icet said they have noticed effects already since the ordinance passed. Johnson said the assessment office is seeing large lines, which are not typical for this time of year, particularly with individuals getting their assessments for the past several past years.

Icet said over the few weeks that the new towing ordinance has been in place but not yet enforced, the collector's office has seen roughly a 30% increase in the taxes collected from the same period last year, totaling roughly $230,000 more. He said this increase is more than what he would anticipate in a normal year and attributed the change to council's action.

TPG, a global alternative asset management firm, has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy's wind turbine generator businesses in India and Sri Lanka. Siemens Gamesa is a wind power subsidiary of Germany's Siemens Energy AG.

In a statement on Wednesday, TPG said the transaction was subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals, but didn't disclose the financial details of the investment.

Mint reported in May last year that Siemens Energy had put up for sale Siemens Gamesa's India wind turbine unit to cut losses and return its global wind turbine business to profitability by 2026.

TPG Rise Climate, the global asset management firm's climate investing platform, will invest in Siemens Gamesa's India and Sri Lanka businesses through its Global South Initiative, launched with climate fund Alterra to scale climate solutions in the region.

MAVCO Investments, backed by some Murugappa group family members, and former JSW Energy chief executive Prashant Jain will also make minority investments in Siemens Gamesa's India and Sri Lanka businesses.

Following the closing of the transaction, a new independent company will be created.

Siemens Gamesa will hold a minority stake in this new company and transfer to it about 1,000 employees and its manufacturing infrastructure in India. It will also exclusively license its intellectual property and technology while developing products for the new company, TPG said in the statement.

Vinod Philip, Siemens Energy board member overseeing Siemens Gamesa, said India remains an attractive wind energy market with significant growth potential.

“The new company will serve the Indian market more effectively while also offering a long-term perspective for the employees and customers. This ensures continued support and development in this vibrant market, while Siemens Gamesa can concentrate on other core markets,” Philip said in the statement.

The new company's board will be chaired by Vellayan Subbiah, who was recently appointed as a whole-time director and designated as executive chairman of Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company, Murugappa Group's non-banking financial company. Jain will serve as executive vice chairman of the new entity and Philip will operate as Siemens Gamesa representative on its board.

“We believe onshore wind will continue to play an increasing role in India's green energy mix and this new platform, with Siemens Gamesa's world-class product manufacturing and service offering, and the backing of TPG and MAVCO will continue to accelerate the delivery of gigawatts of clean power to millions of Indians across the socio-economic spectrum,” said Ankur Thadani, partner and head of climate, Asia, at TPG.

Morgan Stanley, Kearney, Deloitte, Alvarez & Marsal, Khaitan & Co., Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton jointly advised TPG, MAVCO and Jain on the transaction.

Theodora's Pizzeria sat empty on a recent Saturday afternoon. Sussex Meat Packing has seen its weekday lunch crowd all but disappear. And Rocky's Pasties ― a 100-year-old business selling Cornish meat pies ― is down 30%.

“Customers come in and say it used to take them 10 to 15 minutes to get here," said Tom “Rocky” Rodkewitz, the manager of Rocky's. "Now it takes them an hour.”

Blame the sinkholes.

Wharton, an old mining community that long ago became a suburban homestead with a thriving North Jersey downtown, has become a victim of its legacy as a collapsed section of Route 80 ― built over the Mount Pleasant mine ― has choked the borough's streets with detours and squeezed local businesses to the breaking point.

And there is little relief in sight.

The eastbound closure of Route 80 began on Feb. 10 as a sinkhole appeared by Exit 34. That void is located just a few feet from another sinkhole that closed the same area of the highway over four days in December.

Since the discovery of the sinkhole last month, the state Transportation Department announced repairs will take longer than expected due to the possibility of additional voids in the area.

And, as if fulfilling that prediction, an additional void opened on March 19, resulting in the shutdown of westbound lanes.

The entirety of Route 80 at Exit 34 is now closed. And DOT officials have "identified 90 locations to be assessed and mitigate potential instability or possible voids."

Gov. Phil Murphy said on March 22 that repairs could take another two months.

The cause of the Morris County sinkholes are abandoned mines that once drove the region's economy, but have been inactive and unattended since the 1960s. Morris County is home to more than 100 such abandoned mines, a 2020 geographical report on the area shows.

The sinkhole saga in Morris County is not only a headache for commuters, but for owners of local businesses ― particularly in Wharton ― who are finding fewer customers entering their shops as drivers avoid the area because of the bumper-to-bumper traffic.

Theodora's Pizzeria in Wharton saw a 50% to 70% decline in customers on some weekdays since the sinkholes shut down I-80 in early February.

"No one wants to sit because they are sitting forever in traffic, it has impacted us a lot,” said owner Theodora Tzouvaras. "If this takes longer, is it really worth being in business anymore? And we are one of the smaller businesses. It is really difficult to say. They say six to eight weeks but is it really that long? They keep finding new holes."

St. Patrick's Day weekend was supposed to be one of the best days of the spring for Knotty Pine Pub in Wharton. Not so this year, said its owner, Jimmy Hill. The restaurant, which serves burgers, sandwiches, fries and, of course, alcoholic beverages, was down $1,500 from last St. Patrick's Day, Hill said. 

Warehouse and factory workers would typically take the five minute drive to Townsquare Diner for lunch, said owner Pete Sederas. But that has dried up because the drive is now taking up to 30 minutes each way.

“Their one-hour lunchtime is all on the road,” he said. 

Wharton Mayor Bill Chegwidden has likened the situation to when businesses were struggling during the COVID pandemic five years ago. But some say it's even more difficult.

“It's worse than COVID," said Rodkewitz of Rocky's Pasties. "At least there we had our takeout option,”

Tzouvaras of Theodora's Pizzeria, a staple in the Wharton community since 1996, said for her business "it feels like COVID again."

But this time, she said, it seems even more intense.

"COVID we did a lot of takeout, and takeout was always good, so that was not affected, but we didn't have this traffic," she said. "Delivery guys didn't take an extra 20 minutes to get to where they have to be, customers didn't have to sit in traffic. It's a different situation overall.”

Sussex Meat Market, a community shop that has been in business for more than 40 years, has experienced a 30% to 40% drop in businesses, owner Dirk Peereboom said.

"We used to get a big crowd for lunch, but now people don't have time to get here," he said.

Major League Barbers on South Main Street is another Wharton business that has been struggling since the sinkhole swallowed Route 80. Owner Nancy De La Cruz said most of her customers are from neighboring towns such as Dover, Lake Hopatcong, Sparta, Parsippany and Budd Lake. But they have stopped traveling to her shop over the last few weeks.

"This was supposed to be our busy season, in the spring," she said. "No one is showing up because they don't want to sit in traffic for hours.”

The barbershop has seen about a 40% decline in customers since the start of the sinkhole repairs, she said.

Still, shop owners work to endure the hardship.

“My grandparents dealth with the Great Depression, we'll be able to endure this," Rodkewitz said. "But it will be tough."

Chris Flores, a spokesperson for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, said businesses in Morris or Sussex counties that have taken a hit from local sinkhole traffic could apply for grants or loans under the COVID-era Main Street Recovery Program.

To date, the state has awarded more than $167 million to 5,000 New Jersey businesses under the program, Flores said.

Strictly speaking, the Main Street Recovery Program is not specifically for businesses affected by sinkhole traffic, but it's a means for the state to inject cash into these businesses in the short term. 

Here's a breakdown of some of the programs: 

Meanwhile, state Assemblywoman Aura Dunn, who represents Wharton in the New Jersey Legislature, along with Senator Anthony M. Bucco (R-Morris) introduced two “Road to Relief” bills this week meant to take some of the pressure off businesses affected by the sinkhole. 

“The only way to turn this around for [businesses] is to do a 180 and focus on getting them the support they need while the engineers and other experts tend to the sinkholes,” Dunn said in a Monday evening statement. 

Gov. Phil Murphy's office declined to comment Tuesday afternoon on the moves being made by the Legislature.

But Yazan Muheisen, co-owner of Pop's Bagel Shop, said the sales tax exemption would be of little help to the business, since the sales tax is often passed on to the consumer. 

“It's not the assistance that's going to make or break the business,” he said. 

As far as federal relief, Murphy would have to request a federal emergency declaration, which would open the way for business assistance, said Barbara Nitis, a spokesperson for the U.S Small Business Administration.

Typically, a governor has to request an emergency declaration from the president of the United States, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency website. 

Then the SBA will provide low-interest loans to businesses impacted by the disaster; in this case the sinkhole. 

On Saturday, Murphy said the relief that will be distributed to businesses will be determined later.

Murphy issued an emergency declaration on March 8 for Morris County to begin that process, but the potential relief is still in discussions between the SBA and governor's office.

WILLIAMSTOWN — Misti Sims, a Parkersburg South High School graduate and founder, owner and lead planner of Little Black Dress Events, signed documents Monday at Williamstown Elementary becoming their new Partner In Education.

Partners In Education is a program started by the Chamber of Commerce of the Mid-Ohio Valley that aims for partnerships that support students' growth, fosters achievement and deepens community connections

“This opportunity came up with the elementary and I was like, my heart is always going to still be with the littles, just because this is the groundbreaking part of showing them things that they may not be shown in everyday life, at their home or whatever,” Sims said. “All walks of life, all financial backgrounds come through the school as well as others.”

Sims said her son attended Williamstown Elementary and is now in sixth grade at the middle/high school. She said while he was at the elementary level she was heavily involved with the PTA and other events. She said Principal Lee Ann Cumpston approached her last year about becoming a Partner In Education. Sims said she wasn't very knowledgeable about the program and assumed schools could only have one partner and that they wrote big checks.

“The things that I can bring to the table, it's not necessarily that,” Sims said. “I'm not some big company.”

She said Cumston informed her that the program isn't just about writing checks.

“The more community we can bring into the school, the more things that we can expose kids to,” Cumpston said Monday. “And like she alluded, there are kids that come in here from all financial backgrounds and partnerships like this allow us to do special events for our students that they wouldn't otherwise be able to do.”

Sims said this was all she needed to know to make the decision to become a partner in education.

“We talked a lot about STEM during last year, and I just wanted to kind of circle back to that and just because my kid isn't here, and I just have the one, doesn't mean that I can't still be involved in some capacity. So it just means a lot to me.”

Jill Parsons, CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of the Mid-Ohio Valley, said the chamber tries to match potential partners with schools that will fit their individual level of participation in the program. 

“She (Sims) thought maybe being a partner was out of the ballpark for her, because she couldn't write a big check like a bigger company could do,” Parsons said. “But she's got passion, and she has ideas, and she has manpower that can come into a school that is different from some of the partners that can help more on a financial basis, who maybe aren't able to come into the school and help with the events.”

Parsons said the chamber uses artificial intelligence to make better connections with local businesses that will lead to longer lasting relationships. 

“We're the only county using AI to match schools and businesses,” Parsons said. “We want to create long-term relationships that extend beyond just having a child in the school.”

She said both potential partners and schools will fill out a three-minute survey listing the levels of interest and needs both are looking for.

“It might generate two or three ideas of schools and two or three businesses,” Parsons said. “Just so that relationships in the partner in education program are long term.”

Businesses interested in participating in the Partners In Education program can contact the chamber at info@movchamber.org or call 304-422-3588. 

“At the end of the day, it's about supporting our community's children and showing them what's possible,” Sims said.
