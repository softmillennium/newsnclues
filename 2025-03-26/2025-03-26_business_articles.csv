Rachel Reeves has declined to rule out hiking taxes at her next Budget, amid growing pushback from Labour MPs over welfare cuts in the wake of her Spring Statement.

The Chancellor told reporters at a press conference that she was focused on growing the economy, despite speculation she will have to find more revenue to make her sums add up – including if the UK economy is hit by the impact of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Reeves insisted: “I’m not going to write four years of budgets, I’ve just delivered a spring statement today.”

She emphasised “how determined this government is” to “live within the means that we set ourselves in the Budget” and to grow the UK’s economy in a bid to boost living standards.

Speaking in Downing Street, Reeves vowed she would not need to repeat her “once in a generation” tax-raising first budget in October, which she said had “wiped the slate clean”.

And she added: “There was lots of speculation that I was going to change taxes today, the Tories were desperate to call this an emergency budget – it was far from it.”

Her Spring Statement came as fiscal watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) halve its growth forecast for 2025 to just one per cent, which saw Reeves slice welfare spending, which is set to affect some three million households, and cut Whitehall budgets.

But despite restoring her £9.9bn headroom, the Chancellor could face further “uncertainty” with the prospect of fresh global tariffs imposed by President Trump triggering a potential trade war, which could “entirely eliminate” her breathing space, the OBR warned.

Reeves faces outcry

Reeves also faces outcry and the risk of a backbench rebellion by Labour MPs on the left of the party over her cuts to welfare spending.

Her cuts will leave some 250,000 more people, including 50,000 children, in relative poverty after housing costs across Britain by 2030, the government’s own impact assessment found.

Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged her to reverse the cuts and “end the two-child benefit cap, which has driven so many children and families into really desperate poverty”, claiming the government has now “gone further than even the Tories ever dared”.

While Liverpool MP Kim Johnson branded the move an “assault on disabled people” and “nothing short of sadistically cruel”, and Clapham and Brixton Hill MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy posted on X that she would vote to oppose the measures, adding: “No Labour MP should be voting to push children into poverty.”

Shadow Chancellor – and former Conservative work and pensions secretary – Mel Stride also criticised Reeves’ announcement on welfare, dubbing it “the worst of all worlds, a wholly inadequate level of savings on welfare with welfare costs still spiralling ever higher.

“And changes that will likely harm many vulnerable people.”

Speaking to journalists after the statement, Stride said: “There were much more significant savings to be found… but you cannot do it, and you can’t do it fairly, if you rush it.

“They have rushed it and they’ve botched it.”

But asked about rising poverty, the Chancellor said: “We’re confident the changes we are making and the support we’re providing to get people into work will result in more people having fulfilling careers, paying decent wages and, of course, that’s the best way to lift families out of poverty.”",cityam

Manchester City or Chelsea will pick up £97m if they win the expanded Club World Cup this summer in the United States.

Fifa confirmed that it would hand the winners $125m of the $1bn prize pot on Wednesday as part of a move to make the competition attractive to clubs.

Around $500m of the prize fund will be split between the 32 participating teams while the other monies will be distributed based on performance.

The 32-team distribution split will be graded based on club contribution – Manchester City and Chelsea are likely to receive a lot more than clubs from the likes of Asia and Oceania.

“Fifa will neither retain any funding for this tournament, as all revenues will be distributed to club football, nor will it touch Fifa’s reserves, which are set aside for global football development through the 211 Fifa Member Associations,” Fifa president Gianni Infantino said in a statement.

The Club World Cup will begin on 15 July, with Chelsea the first English team to play a day later – just 22 days after the conclusion of the Premier League season on 25 May.

Chelsea will face Brazil’s Flamengo, Tunisia’s Esperance de Tunis and an unnamed third team, who will replace Club Leon after the Mexican side were ejected from the tournament for having the same owners as fellow Liga MX side Pachuca.

Manchester City will face Morocco’s Wydad AC, the UAE’s Al Ain – owned by City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s brother Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan – and Juventus.

Fifa also confirmed that all revenue will be distributed to the club game with the organisation’s reserves untouched as a result of the tournament.

“In addition to the prize money for the participating teams, there is an unprecedented solidarity investment programme where we have a target of an additional $250m being provided to club football across the world,” Infantino added. “This solidarity will undoubtedly provide a significant boost in our ongoing efforts in making football truly global.”",cityam

Last week Franco Manca announced that they have become ‘dog friendly’. This a welcome turnaround for the restaurant group that turned away a guide dog from one of their venues in 2018. Fortunately, this shameful incident led to my meeting with Dave Kent, the blind gentleman who required his trusty friend Chad to lead him to a sourdough stuffed crust. My restaurant M subsequently became a supporter of Guide Dogs for the Blind. Each Christmas since, we’ve hosted a festive lunch for a hundred guide dogs and their handlers, one of the most wonderful dining rooms I’ve ever hosted.

Gaucho (another of mine) and M became dog friendly in 2010 and since then my teams and I have hosted over a hundred special lunches and brunches in honour of our four-legged friends. Highlights include a ‘doggy dance off’ during which a buxom lady placed her Maltese terrier on her ample chest and, with a shimmy, repeatedly propelled her pooch into the air, and a Valentine’s event where a poodle arrived for a ‘doggy love match’ contest in a remote control Porsche, dressed in a Madonna costume, with Erotica playing from the car stereo.

This week’s OpenTable picks (see below) are all wonderfully welcoming to canines and in the D&D collection (where I’m about to take over as chief exec) we welcome dogs to Fiume, Pont de la Tour, Madison, German Gymnasium, Butlers Wharf Chop House and the South Place Hotel. When I start next week, my labradoodle Wilbur will be by my side.

Dog dining etiquette is simple and should also apply to children: no noise, no vomiting, no interrupting other diners and, if you make a spillage from your plate or bowl, your parents or owner should offer to clean it up (waiting staff are neither nannies nor hound handlers). Here are some of my favourite dog-friendly restaurants I’ve visited of late.

Prince Arthur

A new modern gastropub in Pimlico serving a Basque menu with the addition of a little British elegance. Kilos of caviar are offered, served on either a turbot dripping potato slice (Dorian style) or on cucumber and is generously used as an ingredient throughout the menu.

I was accompanied to Prince Arthur by Giles Henton, who heads up Pommery prestige and is a lover of a devilled egg; we had four between us, each topped with 5g of Siberian Baerii caviar, of course.

Other taste sensations included cured red mullet, langoustines and a presa Iberica. My only criticism is that there is too much sea urchin on the menu and I am bored of Galician blond beef. Still, this is a fine example of a great pub and restaurant, housed comfortably together under one stylish roof. The wine list is also fantastic: Giles magnanimously opted for Dom Perignon 2013 due to its incredibly reasonable price (£175), which was a perfect pairing for our seafood and egg feast, and led to a wonderful debate around the pros and cons of DP versus Pommery Cuvee Louise.

La Mome

A dog-friendly new addition to The Berkeley Hotel, La Mome has a beautiful dining room, complete with a baby grand. It was created by brothers Ugo and Antoine Lecorche, who have made a name for themselves in their glamorous restaurants in Cannes and Monaco, which share the same name and outstanding vibe.

The menu is Mediterranean Riviera fare at its finest. The beef tartar on truffle arancini was a sensation; smoked stracciatella and focaccia was a delight; a near perfect Nicoise salad was a standout; and the veal Milanese was a hit, coming with the unusual addition of melted taleggio to bump up both the flavour and fat content. Thankfully it is a menu without the calorie count listed (the prices are enough of a reality check).

I visited with Richie Notar, founder of Nobu back in the day and a man who knows his restaurants and wines. We were also in the company of winemaker Ken Forrester, who brought his magical FMC (£120), and his unfiltered Dirty Little Secret (£180) with him. In a blind tasting, you would guess both were the best of Burgundy and four times their actual price.

La Mome is so good that I returned to this modern-day LPM a second time in three days, kickstarting the evening on this occasion with a bottle of magnificent Krug Rose, which stood up perfectly to the crudo et frito. Sublime, smoky steaks followed. My recommendation to finish your evening is to book a table on the new rooftop bar of the adjoining Emory, where legend of the international bar scene Tato Giovannoni has taken a five year residency.

The Punch Bowl

Finally to Essex, where a trip to Osbourne’s in the old town of Leigh on Sea is always a magical mix of mussels and whelks, on this occasion enhanced by a lobster roll with cockle chips served with samphire and vinegar mayonnaise.

This light lunch came prior to a trip to Paglesham, where a very British menu celebrates the regenerative farmers of Essex and the best fish found on the Cornish coastline. Squid, radicchio, saffron and pesto made from turnip tops was a delight, as was my whole lemon sole with wild garlic. Meanwhile, Mrs Williams worked through a venison hotpot with gusto. A bottle of Pinot Noir from the nearby Crouch Valley, made the trip to the land of the East Saxons most worthwhile.

Rachel Reeves faces the prospect of her newly-restored fiscal headroom being wiped out again ahead of the Autumn budget, raising the spectre of fresh take hikes in the future as she battles sluggish growth and economic headwinds.

The Chancellor had previously left herself £9.9bn of headroom but the OBR calculated the UK was in fact heading for a deficit of £4.4bn, forcing the Chancellor to make spending cuts in welfare and across the civil service in order to restore her headroom to just under £10bn once again.

In a press conference delivered after the Spring Statement, OBR committee member Tom Josephs said the headroom – the third-smallest such margin any Chancellor has set against the rules – was at risk of collapsing due to poor UK productivity and escalating global trade tensions.

“We assess the probability of meeting the target, with that amount of headroom, is basically around 50 per cent,” Josephs said.

“It would not take much to eliminate that headroom again,” he added.

“A 0.6 per cent increase in gilt and interest rates, 0.1 per cent lower productivity and the worst case tariff scenario could eliminate the headroom.”

The lack of leeway built in has left City leaders on edge.

Modupe Adegbembo, an economist at the investment firm Jefferies, said: “Given how easy it was for the headroom to be eroded by around £15bn in 5 months, we could be back in the same position by the time we get to the Autumn Budget.”

Adegbembo said the small headroom left meant tax rises were more likely.

Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, agreed: “To state the obvious, the latest public finances data was even worse than the OBR expected – signalling further downward revisions to the public finances on the horizon. Reeves’ fiscal headroom remains historically low, too – something the Treasury will need to navigate for the foreseeable future.”

“In our view, further fiscal consolidation will be likely with some modest tax hikes inevitable by year-end.”

Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, said: “The chancellor pulled the tax lever hard last October to meet her own self-imposed fiscal rules, and this time around, it’s spending which is in the firing line to balance the hole in the books created by shifting macro-economic factors, most notably interest rates and inflation expectations.

“Rachel Reeves has chosen to restore her headroom but unfortunately this is still a relatively small buffer which leaves the public finances vulnerable to small corrections in the forecast.”

“If real economic data points fail to match up with the OBR’s predictions between now and the Autumn Budget, you can be sure that will fuel further speculation on more tax rises to come.”

The OBR also confirmed it has halved its UK growth forecast for 2025 to one per cent and upgraded its inflation prediction for 2025 to 3.2 per cent.

While the fiscal watchdog said UK growth would be higher than it had previously expected after 2026, it warned that a trade war incited by President Donald Trump’s tariffs could take a hit of up to one per cent on UK growth.

No tax hikes were announced at the Spring Statement although the government will begin to receive some £40bn in taxes from next week when the rise in employers national insurance contributions kicks in.

OBR committee member Professor David Miles said that surveys showing low business and consumer confidence contributed to the fiscal watchdog’s decision to downgrade the UK’s economic outlook for 2025.

Reeves’ tax raid has exacerbated low business confidence with fewer firms planning to recruit staff.

Manufacturing has also fallen at the beginning of the year, with businesses blaming hikes to national insurance contributions (NICs).

The changes announced last Autumn include a lowering of the threshold at which employers make NICs to £5,000, plus an increase in the rate from 13.8 per cent to 15 per cent.

Economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that policy decisions made by Reeves at the Spring Statement created more uncertainty.

“Reeves has left herself with the same £9.9 billion sliver of headroom against her target to balance the current budget as she had in October, and a very similar amount of headroom against the target that debt should be falling in 2029–30,” Paul Johnson, the IFS’ director, said.

“We can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn.

“There is a cost, both economic and political, to that uncertainty. The government will suffer the political cost. We will suffer the economic cost.”

The OBR was also unable to make assessments of various Labour policies after ministers supplied the fiscal watchdog with information at late notice.

Labour’s flagship Employment Rights Bill was also not considered by the OBR as there was “not yet sufficient detail or clarity” about its impact on the economy – although the government’s own impact assessment suggests an additional cost to employers totalling £5bn.

Professor Miles said it was “difficult” to know how the Bill would look as it is currently passing through Parliament but said there could be a “mild impact” on employers.

“Probably, on balance, the risks are that it’s slightly negative for employment,” he suggested.",cityam
https://cityam.com,Spring Statement 2025: Further cuts made to Universal Credit,https://www.cityam.com/spring-statement-2025-further-cuts-reeves-announces/,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:02:13 GMT","Spring Statement 2025: Reeves makes further cuts to Universal Credit

Further cuts will be made to Britain’s welfare bill – but only save the government £3.4bn rather than the £5bn originally thought – Rachel Reeves has announced in the Spring Statement.

The Chancellor has confirmed there will be further reductions to the cost of benefits, and to government spending, after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) found last week’s initial round of welfare savings would not save the £5bn ministers had posited.

Reeves has now widened those cuts by freezing an additional Universal Credit (UC) payment made to those least able to work until 2030, following an initial cut.

It came as the Chancellor blamed “increased global uncertainty” as the budget watchdog warned she would have missed her goal of balancing the books without taking action, as it slashed growth forecasts from two per cent to one per cent for 2025.

GDP forecasts

Responding to the growth forecast, Reeves also highlighted that the OBR boosted its forecasts for subsequent years, up to GDP growth of 1.8 per cent in 2029, and said the government’s planning reforms would increase it permanently by 0.2 per cent in 2029-30, by some £6.8bn.

But the Chancellor insisted: “I am not satisfied with these numbers. That is why we on this side of the house are serious about taking the action needed to grow our economy. Backing the builders, not the blockers.”

She had to set out savings of some £14bn to ensure she met her “non-negotiable” fiscal rules.

At her budget in October she set out plans which met that goal with £9.9 billion to spare in 2029-30, but the OBR’s updated forecast would have had her miss the target by £4.1bn if not for action.

Reeves also signalled cuts in Whitehall, including “voluntary exit schemes to reduce the size of the civil service”, and technology use to “make government leaner, more productive and more efficient”, saving £3.5bn by 2029-30.

Overall, day-to-day spending, she said, would be reduced by £6.1bn by 2029-30 and it will now grow by an average of 1.2 per cent a year above inflation, down from the 1.3 per cent forecast at the time of the Budget.

Welfare changes

Speaking in the House of Commons, she told MPs: “The Labour Party is the party of work. We believe that if you can work, you should work and if you can’t, you should be properly supported.

“One in eight young people are not in employment, education or training. If we do nothing, we are writing off an entire generation… a waste of their potential and a waste of their futures.”

Following work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall’s initial announcement on welfare cuts last week, Reeves said the UC health element would be “cut by 50 per cent and then frozen for new claimants”.

The overall package of savings is worth £3.4bn, down from the £5bn the government said last week.

Seperately, the Chancellor told MPs the statement did “not contain any further tax increases”, but continued “investment in cutting-edge technology” to “crack down on tax avoidance” which she said would “raise a further £1bn”.

Reeves said her statement meant she had “restored in full our headroom against the ‘stability rule’” leaving the government a £9.9bn surplus in 2029-30.

She argued: “The UK, alongside its international peers like France and Germany has seen the cost of borrowing rise during this period of heightened uncertainty in financial markets.”

Changing world

Reeves began her speech stressing that the world was “changing before our eyes” and that the “threat facing our continent” from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has “escalated further and continues to evolve rapidly”.

In a nod to the impact of US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, she said: “The global economy has become more uncertain, bringing insecurity at home as trading patterns become more unstable and borrowing costs rise for many major economies.”

The Chancellor argued that the situation “demands an active government” and for the UK to “act quickly and decisively in a more uncertain world”.

She pledged to deliver a Budget in the autumn following a full spending review in June, “in line with our commitment to deliver just one major fiscal event a year”.

Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the country is “weaker and poorer” as a result of Reeves’ decisions.

He told MPs: “The result is the worst of all worlds, a wholly inadequate level of savings on welfare, with welfare costs still spiralling ever higher, and changes that are likely to harm many vulnerable people.”

He added: “The right response is not to duck responsibility, but to build a resilient economy. She would have us believe that that is what she is doing. But how can we believe this Chancellor? How can we trust this Chancellor?”

Stride continued: “Today’s numbers confirm it. We are poorer and we are weaker. To govern is to choose, and this Chancellor has made all the wrong choices.”",cityam

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was “not happy” about the revised figures.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has slashed its growth forecast in half to one per cent as Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was “not happy” about the revised figures.

Reeves has insisted that high growth is key to Labour’s mission in government, while Prime Minister Keir Starmer has previously suggested that it is aiming for a rate of 2.5 per cent.

However, the latest OBR verdict on the UK economy undercuts the government’s ambitions, suggesting that it is unlikely to achieve its targets.

In some positive news for Reeves, the OBR also said the UK economy would grow at a higher rate than it had previously predicted in the years between 2026 and 20230.

Reeves said the government’s commitment to “tearing down regulatory barriers” and backing of major infrastructure projects such as a third runway at Heathrow represented a “serious plan” for growth.

Separately, the OBR upgraded its inflation forecast to a peak of 3.2 per cent for the year.

The figure is lower than the Bank of England’s prediction that it will reach as high as 3.75 per cent.

Reeves said she had restored headroom worth £9.9bn after higher borrowing brought by a “period of heightened uncertainty” wiped it out.

This headroom was restored after public spending cuts were made to welfare.

City analysts said ahead of the Spring Statement that her previous headroom worth around £9.9bn had been wiped out as a result of sluggish growth and high debt repayments.

Her ironclad fiscal rules – to reduce net public debt and deliver a current balance in five years – have subsequently forced her to seek savings.

Leading City firms have reacted to Reeves’ Spring Statement with some caution.

Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter, said Reeves’ fiscal headroom remained “miniscule”.

“Labour has perhaps learned its lesson that the economy requires a more positive tone from government, and that the burden placed upon businesses at the Budget was enough for now,” she said. “How long this can last remains to be seen.”

Shamil Gohil, fixed income portfolio manager at investment firm Fidelity International, said Reeves’ headroom was “arguably not enough” given uncertainties.

“The historical average has been closer to £30bn but recent governments have run it tighter,” he said. “A £20bn number would have been more constructive for Gilts. Ultimately, the fiscal headroom is how the market quantifies and judges the Chancellor’s credibility.”

In an eleventh hour effort to meet the rules, it was revealed that the Chancellor was making further benefit cuts worth £500m as the OBR said initial savings to welfare would save less than it had planned.

In its new report, the watchdog appeared to take issue with Reeves’ delays in informing the OBR of her plans.

“Policy costings information on the direct fiscal effects of some measures was received late and without sufficient detail,” the report said.

“In addition, relatively small changes were made to the policy parameters of two welfare

measures following the costings certification deadline. As a result, we have not been able

to certify these costings but have used the Government’s estimates in this forecast and will

return to them in our next forecast.”

The welfare cuts have increased tensions within the Labour Party as some ministers have reportedly spoken out against the cuts in meetings.

The government is also making cuts to jobs in the civil service, skimming 15 per cent of its running costs.

The cuts announced will amount to more than £2bn by 2030, ministers said.

Free market think tank Adam Smith Institute director Maxwell Marlow said Reeves should have gone further and made deeper cuts.

“We can no longer tolerate the state’s gluttony,” Marlow said. “The Chancellor must cut anti-growth and anti-business taxes, such as National Insurance or Capital Gains Tax, and she must scrap more QUANGOs as a matter of urgency.”",cityam

The UK’s leading hospitality body has slammed the Spring Statement as a ‘missed opportunity’ to solve the mounting crisis in Britain’s pubs and bars.

The statement contained no phasing in of higher national insurance contributions (NICs) or extra support for the sector, despite pleas from the industry.

“Growth won’t just happen without a plan. Today’s statement was yet another missed opportunity to avoid an April cliff edge which will level a devastating £3.4bn annual increase to the sector’s tax bill,” UKHospitality boss Kate Nicholls said.

The government will increase the amount of tax employers pay on staff wages from 13.8 per cent to 15 per cent, and reduce the threshold at which employees’ wages are eligible for the tax from £9,500 to £5,000 per year.

A group of trade bodies tried to delay changes to NICs earlier this year.

“If it doesn’t act then businesses are clear that the impact on communities, employees and supply chains will be significant,” UKHospitality, the British Beer and Pub Association, the British Institute of Innkeeping and Hospitality Ulster said.

City broker Peel Hunt has warned that British pub culture is at risk due to structural pressures and tax hikes.

Hospitality was the biggest driver of economic growth in both November and December, but tax rises in the October budget “halted and reversed a year-long upgrade cycle”, Peel Hunt said.

“If the Government is serious about getting Britain working, it needs hospitality. When we were backed after the financial crash and the pandemic, we proved how we can help drive economic recovery.

“There is still time for the Chancellor to act and avert this disaster. Now is the time to back hospitality, delay the changes to employer NICs and work with us,” Nicholls said.

Emma McClarkin, CEO of the British Beer and Pub Association, offered a similar analysis.

“The Spring Statement was the perfect chance to sow the seeds of growth but Government missed the opportunity, has not listened to business, and we can now expect to see prices rise, jobs at risk, and growth downgraded.

“For a Government whose mission is growth, there is an alarming lack of a plan to boost the economy, given they’ve buried brewers and pubs under mountains of regulations, rates, and taxes.”

The BPPA predicts the sector will face an additional £70m per month, the equivalent of 5,700 jobs per month.

No change to business rates

Hospitality and retail analysts were disappointed at the lack of changes to the UK’s heavily disliked business rates system.

Instead, Reeves said that the government will publish an interim report in summer that sets out a “clear direction of travel for the business rates system”, with further policy detail to follow at the Budget this autumn.

“While it is positive that the Government is currently looking at an overhaul of the system, with the potential for two lower rates being introduced from 2026, time is a luxury that most small businesses do not have. They are struggling now, and it is disappointing to see little news from the Government on this front today,” Matt Dalton, Consumer Sector Leader at Forvis Mazars, said.

“The retail sector has faced numerous headwinds over the past few years, with a further blow coming in April as rates relief for retail, hospitality, and leisure sectors decreases.

Helen Dickinson, Chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that despite the Chancellor’s committment to “tearing down regulatory barriers and implementing policies to grow our economy and create jobs”, higher taxes mean “higher prices, fewer shops and less investment in jobs”.

“The costs from the Budget, and uncertainty about how the Employment Rights Bill and new business rates policy will be implemented, mean it will be much harder for retailers to keep creating [retail] jobs.

“The government should avoid unintended consequences and provide clarity about the implementation of these policies as soon as possible. A serious plan for retail growth would support the industry to invest in new jobs and keep prices down for customers.”",cityam

The government’s changes to housebuilding will result in a £6.8bn boost to GDP by 2029, according to OBR figures included in the Spring Statement.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the forecast the “biggest ever” positive growth impact that the OBR has projected from a non-fiscal government policy.

Changes to the UK’s housebuilding market were a cornerstone of Labour’s economic and social manifesto, with a promise to build 1.5m new homes by 2029.

After reaching office, the government made a number of significant reforms to planning.

Changes to the national planning policy framework were published in December, while the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which aims to simplify and devolve the planning process, passed its second reading in Parliament on Monday, 22 March.

In her Spring Statement, Reeves said that changes to the planning framework would help the UK build over £1.3m homes over the next five years, taking the government “within touching distance” of its manifesto promise.

The OBR concluded that changes to the planning framework will result in a 0.2 per cent, or £6.8bn, boost to GDP by 2029/2030, and a 0.4 per cent boost to GDP by 2035.

“The government’s planning reform measures have led to the biggest positive real GDP effect that the OBR has reflected in its forecast for a policy with no fiscal cost,” Reeves said.

The Chancellor said the government would use the additional income to reduce borrowing by £3.4bn in 2029-30

“This improvement in the growth outlook reflects only the changes to residential planning.

“The government is going further and faster to drive growth through ambitious supply side reforms, including via increased capital spending, regulatory reform and the Planning and Infrastructure Bill,” Reeves said.

‘Successive Governments have set less ambitious building targets and fallen far shorter’

The OBR said that the government could oversee 1.3m new homes, which would bring them “closer to that target than most commentators thought possible”, Oli Creasey, head of property research at Quilter Cheviot, said.

As well as the planning changes, the government announced a £2bn top-up into the UK’s affordable housing sector as part of its pledge to revitalise residential construction, as well as £600m to help bridge the construction skills gap.

The funds precede the government’s Spending Review on June 11, which is set to feature details of a new, multi-year Affordable Homes Programme to replace the existing scheme started under the conservatives.

“Planning offices around the country may now have the capacity (and indeed, obligation) to approve more building schemes, but that may prove to be moot if the marginal buyer cannot secure a mortgage to purchase the finished product,” Creasey warned.

“It is notable that shares in UK housebuilders are unmoved by the Spring Statement, with the sector trading down on the back of poor FY results released by Vistry this morning. Analysts are not yet upgrading their volume forecasts, knowing that buyer affordability remains the key metric that now matters to supply.”",cityam

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has revealed further details of plans to boost Britain’s defence industry, including reforms of the procurement system and the appointment of a new oversight board.

The government had already announced an extra £2.2bn will be plugged into the military amid concerns over US President Donald Trump’s commitment to European defence.

Speaking in the Commons, Reeves said the additional investment was about “increasing economic security” alongside national security.

A minimum of 10 per cent of the Military of Defence’s equipment budget will be invested in novel technologies, such as drones and artificial intelligence.

Reeves announced wide-ranging plans for industrial growth at the key centres of Barrow and Furness and Portsmouth’s naval base, as she hailed the UK’s “world-leading” defence companies.

Barrow, which is considered a hub for nuclear security, will receive additional investment and better homes for its military staff.

UK Export Finance (UKEF) will also receive a £2bn boost “to provide loans for overseas buyers of UK defence goods and services.”

Overseeing the plans will be a new Defence Growth Board to “maximise the benefits from every pound of taxpayers’ money that we spend… we will put defence at the heart of our modern industrial strategy,” Reeves said.

The government also announced its intention to reform the UK’s defence procurement system, which has been criticised for its excessive bureaucracy.

“We will reform our broken defence procurement system, making it quicker, more agile and more streamlined, giving small businesses across the UK better access to Ministry of Defence contracts,” Reeves said.

Maria Pereira, partner and International Head of Defence Sector at law firm DLA Piper, described the Chancellor’s announcement as “very encouraging.”

“SME’s play a crucial role in the UK and European defence sectors with their innovative approaches and specialised expertise, enabling them to develop cutting-edge solutions that address complex defence challenges.

“The government’s announcement today points towards smaller, more agile companies being more integrated into the defence supply chain which will harness their ability to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions and help the rapid development of the industry both here and abroad.”",cityam

The government’s workers’ rights bill will “probably [have] net negative economic impacts”, the independent fiscal watchdog has said.

The government’s workers’ rights bill will “probably [have] net negative economic impacts”, the independent fiscal watchdog has said.

Labour unveiled their workers’ rights package – the Employment Rights Bill – last year, and measures were hailed by unions as “common sense” reforms for a “fairer economy”.

But according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which published its latest report on the UK’s economy today, the bill – which is currently being debated in the House of Lords – is “likely” to have “net negative economic impacts on employment, prices, and productivity”.

According to the OBR’s forecasters in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook for March 2025: “Employment regulation policies that affect the flexibility of businesses and labour markets or the quantity and quality of work will likely have material, and probably net negative, economic impacts on employment, prices, and productivity.

“Given these potentially significant impacts, we will incorporate a central estimate of the aggregate impacts of the policy package in our next forecast.”

The OBR has not accounted for the impact of the employment measures in this forecast – or the impact of the government’s efforts to get Brits back into jobs via the Pathways to Work green paper, as “there is not yet sufficient detail or clarity about the final policy parameters”.

Wider labour market

However, on the wider labour market, they note “vacancies [are] falling” and the “unemployment rate [is] rising”, while wage growth “remains strong”.

The OBR’s forecasters added: “The loosening likely reflects weak economic growth and subdued business confidence weighing down on labour demand.

“The increase in employer NICs is also likely to be contributing to falling recruitment and rising redundancies.”

Forecasters also noted that “important design elements” of the workers’ rights bill “will only be clarified in secondary legislation”.

Commenting after the statement, Mel Stride told journalists he wanted “to see them fundamentally drop a number of the measures in that bill because this is holding back growth”.

He added: “What we are absolutely committed to as a party is to recognise that businesses, small businesses, family businesses, businesses of all sizes, are absolutely fundamental to the future of this country.

“Unless we can get growth growing, productivity improved and businesses thriving, that makes the whole world that much more difficult.”

‘Huge majority’

Asked if he was calling on Labour to drop the bill, Stride added: “i don’t think there’s any point in trying to press them into things that they’re clearly not going to do.

“They’re committed to that; we have resisted the bill all the way through… they have a huge majority so one suspects they’ll do what they decide to do.

“What we need to have is a policy that’s got businesses and growth right at its heart.”

The Spring Statement offered some reasonably good news on growth, but the margin for error is incredibly slim and the chances of further painful tax rises in autumn are high, says Julian Jessop

Not quite a non-event, but it could have been a lot worse. Rachel Reeves’ Spring Statement is unlikely to do any significant harm to business or consumer confidence, and it was largely shrugged off by the financial markets. These days that is something, at least, to cheer.

In particular, the Chancellor wisely resisted the siren calls to relax her fiscal rules to finance more spending on defence or welfare, which would have added to the upward pressures on the cost of borrowing – as we have already seen in Germany. She also ignored the cries for additional taxes on wealth, which would almost certainly backfire.

Instead, she actually kept a promise, reiterating her pledge to change taxes only in an Autumn Budget – though that may only be a temporary reprieve.

There was even some good news in the OBR’s new economic forecasts. The GDP growth projection for 2025 was halved from two per cent to one per cent, as expected, which brought it back in line with the consensus. But the numbers for later years were nudged up slightly, partly reflecting the boost from planning reforms.

Overall, however, the OBR’s forecasts are hardly a ringing endorsement of the government’s long-term strategy. Inflation and interest rates are both expected to be higher for longer, and the growth downgrade for this year reflects the fallout from the new government’s policies on tax, the labour market and energy prices, at least as much as the additional ‘global headwinds’.

The main policy announcement was a £14bn package of savings on the current budget, mainly in the form of cuts in the welfare bill and departmental running costs. This has fuelled accusations of a ‘return to austerity’ (would that be such a ‘bad thing’?), but the reality is rather different.

Public spending is still high

For a start, £14bn is just a drop in the ocean: public sector current spending is still forecast to climb to £1,351bn in 2029-30, £219bn more than in 2024-25.

Read more Spring Statement 2025 LIVE

Moreover, most of the announced savings will come from efficiency gains in public services where productivity has lagged well behind, and from cutting some benefits paid to people who may not actually need them. Again, this is hardly ‘austerity’.

Nonetheless, the late scramble to find additional savings on the welfare bill – simply to restore exactly £9.9bn of fiscal headroom – does raise the risk that some vulnerable people will lose out. Making such big decisions on the basis of spuriously precise forecasts is not a sensible approach.

The Spring Statement illustrates both the strengths and weaknesses of the UK’s current fiscal framework and the role of the OBR

Indeed, the Spring Statement illustrates both the strengths and weaknesses of the UK’s current fiscal framework and the role of the OBR. On the plus side, the independent watchdog is reported to have rejected dubious costings produced by the government as recently as last week. However, this has prompted a last-minute rush to hit fiscal targets based on five-year forecasts which will almost inevitably be proved wrong.

The margin for error is also still incredibly limited. As the OBR itself has pointed out, the fiscal headroom is the third lowest any Chancellor has had against their rules, and could easily be wiped out by new shocks, including higher interest rates and a global trade war.

There is no guarantee either that public sector productivity can catch up without fundamental reforms that will be resisted at every stage, and there will be more pressure to come from the defence budget.

There is therefore a high chance that the Chancellor will have to come back again with additional tax increases and more painful spending cuts as soon as the Autumn. For now, though, we can probably let out a sigh of relief.

If there’s one lesson Keir Starmer should learn from Liz Truss, it’s that he should sack his Chancellor Rachel Reeves, says Alys Denby

With living standards clobbered by an emergency Budget hastily cobbled together as market forces react against government policy, the spectre of Liz Truss haunted the Spring Statement in more ways than one.

First, this was a swerving change of economic course from a government that had promised stability. And given that current forecasts don’t account for the impact of Trump’s tariffs or Labour’s workers’ rights package, the Chancellor will almost certainly have to raise taxes again in the Autumn.

Second, in trying so hard to be the anti-Truss, Reeves has forced herself into £14bn of public sector cuts and accusations of a “return to austerity”. One aspect of universal credit is being reduced by a massive 50 per cent and the costs of running government are set to fall by 15 per cent (though it’s difficult to see how investing £2.5bn in measures like more funding for foster care, however commendable in themselves, will achieve this). There is a cruel irony here. Even while accepting Truss’ central analysis that growth is the only possible cure for Britain’s diseased economy, her policies will result in growth remaining below two per cent for the entire parliament.

A reminder of how she got into such an abject position. Labour won the election by promising stability as an antidote to the chaos of Liz Truss’ 45 days as Prime Minister. Positing herself as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, Reeves tightened her fiscal rules so that costs must be met by revenues by 2029/30 and debt must fall as a share of GDP over a three-year horizon instead of five. She also introduced a new Fiscal Lock Law, meaning that any major announcements on tax or spending must be accompanied by analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Today, the OBR has halved its growth forecast to one per cent, wiping out the Chancellor’s fiscal headroom, while also saying that her calculations on welfare savings were out by some £1.6bn. Without the ability to borrow, she finds herself a Chancellor of a very different kind – clapped in irons of her own making.

Reeves posited herself as the Iron Chancellor but has found herself clapped in irons of her own making

But Tories should not be tempted to schadenfreude – indeed they should support well-targeted efforts to shrink the state. Spending on benefits for working age adults is set to rise by £30bn over the course of this parliament and the number of young people who are not in work or education has gone up by 110,000 in a single year. That’s not just unsustainable; enabling such a waste of human potential is immoral.

But spending cuts alone are not the answer – just as some overspending will always be down to bad actors fiddling the system, some cuts will always fall on people in genuine need. A Whitehall in panic because all the graphs are pointing in the wrong direction is not an environment conducive to serious policy reform. Nor is there much evidence that Labour have done much advance thinking about this problem. Their manifesto only mentioned the word “welfare” twice, both in relation to animal rights. By contrast, the Conservatives laid out detailed plans to save £12bn a year, including by changing the way mental health conditions are assessed – plans which are now sounding eerily familiar.

Reeves is out of ideas

It will come as no surprise to City AM readers that this is a government with no ideas of its own, but it will disappoint those who voted so decisively for ‘change’.

The paradox of a Labour Chancellor sounding quite so Tory is not lost on Reeves’ colleagues. Mayor of Manchester Andy Burnham has said “there is no case in any scenario for cutting the support available to disabled people who are unable to work” while the home secretary’s husband Ed Balls has said squeezing benefits is “not a Labour thing to do”.

But they are less quick to offer alternatives that take account of the bond markets’ hostility to further borrowing and the clear need to increase defence spending. So allow City AM to point out that there was one other option available to her: Reversing the damaging National Insurance rise and workers’ rights legislation along with the vindictive school fee levy that have tanked confidence and driven so many wealth creators abroad.

One lesson that Starmer could take from Liz Truss: It took her just 21 days to replace her Chancellor and reverse their most harmful tax changes. Reeves delivered her first Budget 147 days ago.

Rachel Reeves delivered her Spring Statement on Wednesday afternoon.

Rachel Reeves has one of the most demanding, high profile and exhausting jobs in the country, and so – at the very least – we should forgive her for taking some freebie tickets to a Sabrina Carpenter concert. She’s had very few good weeks since entering office and the least she deserves is a good weekend.

Besides, some of the singer’s song choices at her London show seem to have been made with the Chancellor in mind; Busy Woman made an appearance, as did Sharpest Tool – which feels appropriate in light of Kemi Badenoch describing Reeves as “one of the best they’ve got on the Labour benches.” Unfortunately, the Tory leader didn’t mean it as a compliment.

Regrettably, Carpenter’s 2022 hit, Bad for Business, did not make the billing at the O2, but it would have been a fitting anthem for a Chancellor whose policies have so comprehensively sapped the confidence of employers and consumers. This government’s approach to economic growth can be summed up by the title of another Carpenter hit: Please, Please, Please.

Reeves loaded tens of billions of pounds worth of tax hikes onto businesses and caved to union demands to impose a mass of job-destroying red tape onto employers, and they now have the gall to blame our economic hardship on ‘global events.’ We will hear this excuse a lot today, from the earliest broadcast interview through the Chancellor’s Spring Statement and well into the afternoon; ministers will tell us that “the world has changed” – and that the forces driving up the cost of government borrowing and holding back economic growth are beyond our control. This is sophistry, and voters are beginning to see through it.

A YouGov poll published yesterday shows that 73 per cent of voters (including nearly 60 per cent of Labour voters) believe Labour is making a mess of the economy, with more than half – 53 per cent – saying that the Chancellor is doing a bad job. Encouragingly, most Brits now feel that the government taxes and spends too much: 41 per cent, against 23 per cent who feel the opposite. When Labour came into office last year 35 per cent thought the levels of tax and spending weren’t high enough and just 28 per cent felt they were too high. It’s only taken Labour 8 months to change their minds. Now for the really good news: according to YouGov, the most common combined approach Brits think the government should be taking is to cut taxes, cut spending, and cut borrowing.

Unfortunately, the Chancellor seems likely to disappoint; public spending will be trimmed, but with a scalpel rather than a chainsaw. The most effective action Reeves could take today would be to announce a suspension of her damaging business taxes. How could she get away with such a climbdown? Simple: she just has to point out that “the world has changed.”",cityam

By strengthening the OBR, Reeves has created severe difficulties for herself. Vital decisions about our economic future should be made by politicians, not unelected quangocrats, says Paul Ormerod

Later today we will know for certain what is in Rachel Reeves’ Spring statement, a budget to all intents and purposes. But as is usually the case these days, substantial parts of it have been widely trailed in the media.

A key theme in the commentaries on the topic is that the Chancellor has boxed herself into a corner.

Following the massive rise in the overall tax burden in the autumn measures last year, she has ruled out further increases. On the spending side, welfare benefits are to be reduced. The civil service is being asked for efficiency savings and jobs will be lost.

Certainly there is huge scope for improvements in the performance of our public services. As is by now well known, productivity in the public sector as a whole has shown no increase since 1997, a period of almost 30 years.

We might well applaud these proposals as being perhaps the most sensible step which Labour has taken since obtaining office in the July 2024 general election.

But Reeves has created serious political difficulties for herself. The civil service unions are girding up for a fight. Substantial numbers of Labour MPs are expressing serious concerns.

Reeves in a corner

The proximate cause of all her troubles seems to be the forecasts which will be published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). According to numerous leaks, the OBR has reduced the rate of growth of GDP which it is projecting. And the consequence of less economic activity is lower tax receipts for the government, which in turn puts pressure on the public finances.

The OBR was set up shortly after the 2010 election by the then Chancellor George Osborne. Its purpose is to provide independent forecasts for the economy, replacing those which were previously carried out by the Treasury.

Reeves doubled down on the importance of the OBR by, for example, legislating that no government can announce fiscally significant measures without being subject to an independent assessment by the OBR.

It is both amusing and ironic to see that Reeves’ ability to act is being seriously constrained by the very body whose powers she herself enhanced

It is both amusing and ironic to see that her ability to act is being seriously constrained by the very body whose powers she herself enhanced.

The members of the OBR, both past and present, are all distinguished economists and independent thinkers. But they have no special knowledge which means that their forecasts will be any more accurate over time than those of other forecasting groups.

The OBR exists because of the myth that if forecasts and decisions are removed from the political arena and assigned to independent experts, they will be automatically superior.

Gordon Brown made the Bank of England independent in 1997. But it can scarcely be claimed that the performance of its Monetary Policy Committee in setting interest rates to meet inflation targets is better than it was before it became independent.

We have only to look at its forecasts and decisions since the energy price rises in 2021/22 to see how groupthink can penetrate even the most august and independent of bodies and lead them to perform badly.

Rachel Reeves’ Cabinet colleague Wes Streeting is the first major politician to debunk the fantasy of the superior performance of the independent expert.

Streeting has scrapped completely the huge NHS England quango, which was created in 2012 with the explicit aim of reducing political interference in the NHS. Since then of course It has become a byword for inefficiency and waste.

Decisions on how to run the health service and the economy should be left to politicians rather than independent experts. The track record suggests they are unlikely to do a worse job. And, unlike the unelected members of quangos, they can be kicked out by the electorate.

Rather than boosting the powers of the OBR, Reeves should follow Streeting’s example and abolish it.

Simon Clarke is calling on City AM readers to play their part in a once-in-a-lifetime battle for the survival of the centre right. Unless Conservatives can renew their arguments, they will be replaced by populists who only offer anger an no ideas

“Strategy is an overworked and thus devalued word, and strategic thinking can be no guarantee of success. But certainly in business, and especially at times of discontinuity, the strategists have at least a tendency to win, while the tacticians are almost certain to lose.”

In 1977, Margaret Thatcher received the Stepping Stones report from Norman Strauss and John Hoskyns, the cover note of which contained the wise advice above. Stepping Stones set out the basis for much of her defining work when she became Prime Minister two years later.

The importance of strategy is as true today as it was half a century ago. That’s why Kemi Badenoch was right to launch the Conservative Policy Review last week, following the worst election defeat in the hundreds of years of the party’s history.

Tonight, Onward, the think tank I lead, will follow up on this by setting out our programme of work for the period between now and the next General Election in 2029. Our aim will be to think strategically – that is to say, to consider the biggest, most challenging questions of our time and not to shy away from hard truths or difficult choices.

We need urgently to demonstrate that we understand and have answers to people’s deep and legitimate frustrations about a stagnant economy, unsustainable mass migration and broken public services

We need to do this for two fundamental reasons. First, the centre right is in a battle for survival, both here in the UK and across the West. We need urgently to demonstrate that we understand and have answers to people’s deep and legitimate frustrations about a stagnant economy, unsustainable mass migration and broken public services. To do otherwise will mean extinction and replacement by the radical right, who offer anger without solutions.

Second, and paradoxically, because it is possible for the centre-right to win the next UK election. The government’s woes mean all outcomes are possible. But power without purpose is pointless. For the Conservatives to pick up where they left off last year would be utterly futile.

Canadian Conservatives show the way

In the spirit of the excellent Canadian Conservatives, Onward’s future programme of work will be targeted at the issues that matter to most people, most of the time. That means a relentless focus on themes including jobs, real living standards, energy security, crime, housing, families, healthcare and social cohesion – which means considering both immigration and integration policy.

Our three new research programmes are titled Rebuilding the Economy, Renewing our Social Contract and Reshaping the State. In each, Onward will champion evidence-led, compassionate and unapologetically centre-right solutions. We will also be very mindful that, exactly as Hoskyns and Strauss said in 1977, this is a time of discontinuity. The public know that profound change is needed, if not yet what form it should take.

What does that mean, in practice? It means questions like how we support the UK birth rate need to be on the table – there is arguably no greater challenge for our public finances than our demographics. It means we need to develop policies to deliver a high growth, low immigration economy. It means we need to champion reindustrialisation with as much seriousness as decarbonisation. It means we need to tackle the deep intergenerational unfairness arising from our broken housing market. It means we need to reimagine how our public services are delivered, and how to raise standards while bringing their costs (and our taxes) under control.

As we move forward with our work, I would warmly welcome insights and policy ideas from City AM’s readers. This needs to be a collective effort and if you want to contribute to, or support, our research, you will be playing your own part in the once in a political lifetime renewal of the centre-right.

Liam Lawson is set to be brutally relegated on the Formula 1 grid from Red Bull to junior team Racing Bulls.

The move comes after Yuki Tsunoda was last year overlooked for the seat after Sergio Perez was let go as world champion Max Verstappen’s partner at the team.

Tsunoda is set to replace Lawson at the senior team ahead of this weekend’s Japanese Grand Prix.

The 23-year-old from New Zealand is one of five drivers yet to register a point in the solo standings despite teammate Verstappen having 36 after two full races and a sprint race.

Lawson DNF’d in the opening race of the year in Melbourne, Australia, before finishing 14th in the sprint race and 12th in the main race at the Shanghai International Circuit in China.

The move is one that demonstrates the cutthroat world that is Formula 1, with every point counting towards the team title – where the majority of the prize money is dished out.

“There’s always going to be speculation in the paddock. As I say, we’ve only just finished the race here. We’ll take away the info and have a good look at it,” Red Bull Christian Horner stated after rumours emerged in China.

“Liam [Lawson] is obviously confidence-wise struggling with the car at the moment, which is why we made some significant changes today to see if we could find a more confidence-inspiring set-up for him.

“I think Liam still has got potential, we’re just not realising that at the moment. I think the problem for him is, he’s had a couple of really tough weekends, he’s got all the media on his back.

“The pressure just naturally grows in this business, and I feel very sorry for him. You can see it’s very tough on him at the moment.

world No2 Iga Swiatek complained of being aggressively verbally abused by a spectator at the Miami Open

Further concerns have been raised about the safety of women in tennis after world No2 Iga Swiatek complained of being aggressively verbally abused by a spectator at the Miami Open.

The incident, which is said to have happened during a practice session on Saturday, comes just weeks after Emma Raducanu was targeted by a stalker at a tournament in Dubai.

Five-time Grand Slam winner Swiatek’s representatives told the BBC that the man who is alleged to have harangued her had previously sent abusive messages to her online.

“The Miami incident appears to be a direct transition from verbal aggression online to harassment in the real world,” they said. “He was aggressive and taunting.

“Security is a top priority. We monitor the network to catch these types of issues. Constructive criticism is one thing, and threats, hate speech or even disturbance during training is another – this cannot be condoned.”

Miami Open organisers and the WTA Tour are reported to have put extra security in place around Swiatek after being made aware of the Polish player’s ordeal.

Britain’s Raducanu criticised the handling of her attention from a man described as “fixated” at the Dubai Tennis Championship in February.

“Since that incident I have definitely got increased attention and greater security,” she said earlier this month.

“All we can do is look at what happened and react to it in a better way, in a more positive way, rather than looking back and blaming the situation.

“Now it is being dealt with better, so for me that’s important. I’m always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I’m always with someone and always being watched.”

Raducanu opted not to press charges after the man was detained but he has been banned from future tournaments.

Lions coaches to reveal squad in May

Farrell was defence coach for the Lions’ last tour to Australia 12 years ago, when they won the series 2-1, and again for the drawn series in New Zealand in 2017.

Easterby played on the Lions’ tour to New Zealand in 2005 and capped more than a decade on Ireland’s staff by standing in for Farrell as head coach at this year’s Six Nations.

“It doesn’t get any better than a Lions tour,” he said. “It’s been a long time between gigs, but it is an exciting time and I am looking forward to getting stuck in.”

Wigglesworth played under Farrell during a decade at Saracens before coaching at Leicester Tigers and now assisting Steve Borthwick’s improving England side.

Farrell will name his Lions squad on 8 May at a live event at the O2 in London, six weeks before they face Argentina in Dublin and then depart for Australia.",cityam

The Premier League could adopt a Premflix service in some countries

The Premier League is exploring the possibility of adopting a two-pronged media sales strategy from 2029 onwards, with a direct-to-consumer model adopted in certain overseas markets but the domestic broadcast rights still sold to traditional broadcasters, such as Sky Sports and TNT Sports.

The decision to take all international broadcast production in-house from the start of the 2026-27 season, when a new operation will begin in Kensington Olympia, will give the Premier League the capability to launch their own channel for the first time, similar to the NFL’s Game Pass.

While a number of owners such as Chelsea’s Todd Boehly are lobbying for the Premier League to sell all of its media rights direct to fans through their own “Premflix” service, it is likely to be more cautious and begin that process by experimenting in a handful of overseas markets.

While the domestic rights auction dominated by Sky would remain in place, the Premier League could insist on taking over the production process, which would give it complete control of the finished broadcast product — a move likely to be welcomed by clubs.

London Broncos near Aussie takeover

An Australian consortium is close to completing a takeover of London Broncos as they plot a return to Super League.

A group of businesses is understood to have agreed terms with David Hughes, who has owned the Broncos for 28 years, and an announcement could come as soon as next month.

The sale has been brokered by Leeds Rhinos’ long-serving chief executive Gary Hetherington, who will join the Broncos at the end of the season, and former Leeds and New South Wales forward Matt Adamson, who has relocated from Australia to help run the club.

In addition, the club’s new leadership group has agreed affiliate deals with several NRL clubs, including Penrith Panthers and the new Brisbane-based Dolphins franchise, that will allow them to take their top youngsters on loan.

The Broncos’ new owners are determined to return the club to Super League, which could expand to 14 clubs next season, and have already held talks with IMG about how to improve the grading score that determines membership of the top division.

The Championship club will continue to play at AFC Wimbledon’s Cherry Red Records this season, but a future ground move for the nomadic club has not been ruled out.

Semi-automated offsides set for rollout in April

The Premier League is ploughing on with plans to introduce semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) this season ahead of another trial in the FA Cup quarter-finals this weekend, when three of the four ties will use the new technology.

An eight-minute VAR check in the Bournemouth-Wolves fifth-round tie in the first SAOT trial earlier this month has led to a further delay in the Premier League adopting a system that was originally meant to be in place last October, but referees’ chief Howard Webb remains determined to push ahead.

If the FA Cup quarter-final trial is deemed a success the clubs will be asked if they want to use SAOT in the Premier League, although the round of midweek matches next week will come too early.

Read more TNT Sports leads UK TV deal race for Michael Johnson’s Grand Slam Track

The earliest it could be introduced is the weekend of 5-6 April, although some clubs remain to be convinced about bringing it in with just eight games of the season to go.

Players get windfall for Women’s Euros

International players’ union Fifpro has secured a landmark agreement with the national associations involved in this summer’s women’s Euros for them to pass on between 30 and 45 per cent of the prize money they will receive from Uefa on to the players.

All of the 16 competing nations have signed up to the agreement, including the Football Association, although the England players’ committee is yet to accept the governing body’s offer.

Uefa has more than doubled the prize pot to £34m from the previous tournament won by the Lionesses three years ago, with the winners to receive £4.3m this time around.

The FA’s offer to the players is understood to be towards the upper end of the Fifpro bonus range, working out at around £90,000-per-player should Sarina Weigman’s side successfully defend their European title.

Negotiations between the two parties remain ongoing and will continue next month when the squad meet up for a Uefa Nations League double-header against Belgium.

Concussion lawsuit claimaints top 1,000

The group of former rugby players and footballers taking legal action against governing bodies over alleged negligence in failing to protect them from concussion-related injuries has grown to over 1,000 claimants.

Law firm Rylands Garth now represents over 700 former rugby union players, 270 from rugby league and over 100 ex-footballers in a case that is due to go to trial next year.

Many of the claimants are suffering with neurological conditions including Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease (MND), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and dementia as a result of their injuries.

The former players are seeking compensation from World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union, Welsh Rugby Union, Rugby Football League and Football Association for lost earnings, medical bills and other care costs.

The claim was launched in December 2020 when England World Cup winner Steve Thompson spoke publicly about his experiences of living with dementia in his early 40s. Nineteen players in the cohort have already lost their lives to their neurological conditions.

A case management hearing relating to the rugby claim is scheduled for June, when both parties will be asked to put forward suggestions for test claimants to the court.

An agreed list of 21 test claimants will then be used as case studies when the case goes to trial.",cityam

Libby visits Oxford for her latest Naked Wines diary

This week in Libby’s Naked Wines diary, our wine columnist visits Oxford

Simon Drake glides up to me in a jacket that looks and feels like he has skinned the Velveteen Rabbit. Indeed, it is so soft I pause for just longer than is potentially acceptable to stroke his velvety arm – before he gently pulls away and suggests a cocktail. Drake is the general manager of The Store, the hotel that has been making modern waves among the historic “dreaming spires” of Oxford – and, as I discover over a tequila, spirits are important to him.

“We have our own gin and our vodka just won third place in the World Spirits Awards, making it the highest rated vodka in the UK,” he tells me. “By the summer we plan to have the biggest bespoke spirits selection of any hotel in the UK”. The wine list is rather good, too: succinct with a preference for New World and some reassuringly recognisable producers.

Libby’s Naked Wines diary: It’s my first visit to Oxford, and the city truly is tiny

It is always wise to pack a bottle when visiting somewhere new (this time it was fine but you can never be sure of a hotel’s wine selection) and I brought Diego Spinoglio Tierra Alta Reserva 2021 (Naked Wines, £19.99; Angel Price, £15.99), an interesting blend of Merlot and Tannat from Uruguay. For those who have not tried Uruguayan wines, this is your sign to give it a go. Smooth, silky red fruits with a ripple of dark silk underneath. Both light and fresh, and seductively warming, it was an excellent end-of- the-day wine.

We took it to the terrace, the calling card of The Store, to admire the wrap-around views of the city below us. It may be a university town, but the terrace is for over 21s only, making it blissfully free of Jaegar- bomb shooting teenagers. We sipped the wine as the afternoon sunshine lit up the sandstone buildings around us.

This was my first time in Oxford, and it really is tiny. All points of interest were within a 20-minute walk of the hotel. Rising early for a bowl of Turkish eggs, sourdough toast and strong coffee, the walk to St Mary’s Church was briefer than imagined and we arrived a full half hour before it opened at 9.30am. Not exactly a hardship with the glorious architecture surrounding us bu nippy enough to make us storm the doors at the first hint of a latch click, bearing down on the sleepily surprised doorman.

Only 127 steep steps up and we had the view of Oxford to ourselves – just us, the gargoyles and one immoveable pigeon on the narrow pathway, sheltering from the wind. It’s a good idea to head up so early as by the time we left four others had climbed up and there was a certain degree of intimacy involved in getting by. From there we went to Christchurch College, where I pretended not to recognise every corner featured in the Harry Potter films and only once uttered the insufferably repeated line “You’re a Wizard Harry” in my best Hagrid growl. Fairly sure the Significant Other has never wanted me more.

Then onto the Botanic Gardens, the oldest in the UK, to look at the punts on the river and decide if we could brave it. We couldn’t. I had already lost the feeling in my fingers and toes so we retired to the Thermal Spa at The Store to warm our bones with an hour’s sauna and steaming. The restaurant, Treadwells, defined itself as “Untraditionally British”. The English carbonara may make an Italian fall off their Vespa, with its White Lake pecorino and local Speck, but it was welcome after a day’s walking. The small plates won however, with a Masala-spiced-honey spin on classic cheese on toast and a sausage roll with marmite and a tamarind dip.

Dessert was served to the bedroom at the suggestion of the staff. I would love to say our ardour was evident, but the rugby was on, and I think they saw the Significant Other’s clock-watching. Not high romance perhaps, but such observant service is a fair consolation prize.

Julian Stratschulte/dpa

According to an EY study, DAX companies in Germany reduced the number of employees 2024 by 0.5 percent.

The sales increase of 0.3 percent shows that 60 percent of companies grow despite the crisis.

The auto industry is particularly suffering, while some industries such as armaments and engine construction are flourishing.

The largest German stock exchange groups react to the economic flaut in Germany with the dismantling of thousands of jobs. After years of employment, the number of employees at the DAX companies has decreased slightly last year, a new study by the auditing and consulting company EY.

According to this, the number of employees fell in total at around 4.05 million at the end of 2024. That was around 19,300 or 0.5 percent less than a year earlier. Around half of the companies deleted jobs compared to the previous year. However, only 36 of the 40 corporations gave information about the workforce.

Stable business despite crises

It will remain with austerity measures for the time being, says Jan Brorhilker, Managing Partner at EY. Large sales or profit jumps are rather not to be expected in the current year. The geopolitical risks are as great as it has not been in decades and in view of the customs dispute with the United States, new burdens were threatened. Audi and Siemens had only recently announced the dismantling of thousands of jobs.

At the same time, the 40 DAX groups 2024 were able to increase sales by 0.3 percent. The operational profit before interest and taxes (EBIT) grew by 2.9 percent despite the economic crisis. The corporations benefited from strong shops in Europe and a good final quarter.

Auto crisis and armor boom

The EY study shows big differences according to industries: the sales fell by three percent and profit by 26 percent. In contrast, the engine manufacturer MTU Aero Engines and the armaments group Rheinmetall were able to increase sales by over a third.

Regardless of the industry crisis, car manufacturers dominate the sales ranking: VW is at the forefront of 324.6 billion euros, followed by Allianz (almost 180 billion), Mercedes-Benz (145.6 billion) and BMW (142.4 billion).

Telekom overtakes VW

Deutsche Telekom achieved the highest operational profit in 2024 with 26.3 billion euros. It replaced VW, where the operational profit broke up to 19.1 billion. Only three Dax groups-Bayer, Vonovia and Porsche SE-according to EY, posted a loss in day-to-day business.

Henrik Ahlers, CEO at EY, regarded the fact that 60 percent of the companies were able to increase sales despite the economic doldrums. On the other hand, some corporations achieved record numbers, some even built jobs. ""So there is no continuous negative trend.""

But not everyone has to pay him too. Picture Alliance

The constitutional court confirmed the solidarity surcharge. It is also compatible with the Basic Law 35 years after reunification. The Soli is a surcharge on the tax liability for income tax, corporate tax and tax on capital gains. But it does not apply to everyone. Read here who has to pay solidarity surcharge, which allowances and transitional regulations exist.

The solidarity surcharge remains. At least for now. The constitutional court has decided that the solos also corresponds to the Basic Law 35 years after reunification. Now the CDU/CSU and SPD argue about whether the solos are abolished or retained. Since 2021, not all citizens have long since been paying the tax charging, but only ""well -received"" as well as almost all companies and investors. Where are the income limits? What special rules are there? Who has to pay solidarity surcharge - and who doesn't?

For which taxes does the solidarity surcharge apply?

The solos are a surcharge on several taxes. It applies to wage and income tax, corporate tax for companies and capital gains tax. He thus meets both employees, entrepreneurs, companies and investors. In principle, however, this only gives. Because of the employees, there have been high allowances since 2021, which will take 90 percent of all taxpayers from the solos.

Lest also Karlsruhe declares solidarity surcharge as constitutional - these are the consequences for taxpayers and the future coalition

Who has to pay solidarity surcharge?

Since January 1, 2021, only taxpayers have to pay the contract for their tax liabilities from a certain amount of income. The regulation is intended to free around 90 percent of all taxpayers from Soli. In 2025, the allowance for single people is a taxable income of 73,470 euros. In the case of married, the double amount applies 146,940 euros taxable income.

The due surcharge of 5.5 percent then does not refer to income, but to the tax liability. The full sentence does not apply immediately above the exemption limit. This is followed by a mitigation zone in which the load increases slowly. From a taxable income of 114,380 euros for single people, the full solos of 5.5 percent will be opened to the income tax debt. The double limit applies again to married people.

What are the rules for companies and investors?

In addition, companies also have to pay solidarity surcharge. Many companies are managed as partnerships. Then the profits of the owner will fall on the profits - with the exemptions mentioned. Corporations such as GmbHs and stock corporations, but also corporations such as clubs and foundations have to pay the contract for corporation tax. This applies without exceptions and exemptions.

Anyone who puts money and receives interest or dividends must pay capital gains tax - and on the tax liability of the solidarity surcharge of 5.5 percent. There are no exceptions or exemptions here either. This increases the total load from 25 percent to around 26.4 percent. This also applies to foreign investors who achieve taxable capital gains in Germany.

Finally, pensioners and pensioners also pay the solidarity surcharge if they have high age income - for example from company pension schemes, rental income or investments.

She sits in a Seal U. Picture Alliance/dpa | Sven Hoppe

While German carmakers are stroking, BYD is expanding in Europe - and creates around 400 new jobs. The Chinese manufacturer pursues an independent strategy: for example through technological independence, strong pricing policy and introducing the premium market. A group spokesman explains Business Insider exclusively how BYD wants to challenge the German auto industry.

What German carmakers are not currently doing is simply making BYD: the Chinese car manufacturer hires. While VW, Mercedes and Co. shut down entire production lines and discuss the dismantling of areas, the manufacturer from Shenzhen (metropolis in the southeast of China) goes on the offensive.

The mixed group, which employs around 900,000 people internationally, is still largely unknown on German roads. But: He has already overtaken Tesla, does a lot differently than the top dogs in the industry and pursues a plan that could mix up the power structure of the auto industry.

A group spokesman has revealed Business Insider five strategies with which BYD wants to challenge the German auto industry.

What you need to know about BYD is a great Chinese mixed group. The company, founded in 1995 in Shenzhen (city in the People's Republic of China), has developed from a battery manufacturer to a global group with various business areas. BYD works in several industrial divisions, including: automotive production (BYD Auto)

electronics

Renewable energy

BYD is one of the largest companies in China with around 900,000 employees in 2024. The group has a complex corporate structure with various subsidiaries and has production facilities in several countries, including China, USA, Brazil, Japan and India. The company is already the market leader on the e-car market, sold 310,790 cars in January 2025, 44.9 percent more than in the previous year. BYD sells most vehicles in China. BYD Vice-President Stella Li and top manager Maria Grazia Davino spoke about how they want to conquer the European market in an interview with the ""Manager Magazin"": In the first step, BYD wants to produce up to 150,000 cars in Europe, the number should be doubled in the second phase. For this purpose, factories are planned in Hungary and Turkey. Production will start in 2025 in Hungary. When asked whether the purchase of VW factories would be considered, said Li: ""If Germany is competitive as a production location, we will consider it."" In China you can get a BYD car for the equivalent of 10,000 euros. SJF

1. Increase profit vigorously (and leave Tesla behind in sales)

The German press agency recently reported that the Chinese car manufacturer put a whopping leap last year. According to the statement to the stock exchange in Hong Kong, the company from Shenzhen earned around 5.1 billion euros - that is about 33 percent more than in the previous year.

Strong numbers in sales and sales:

Sales growth: +29 percent, around 99 billion euros

Sold vehicles: 4.25 million - of which 1.76 million pure electric cars

Sales of 2025: five to six million vehicles

The Byd Seal U EV Picture Alliance: Muhammed Enes Yildirim / Anadolu

While Tesla had last struggled with headwind, BYD continues to grow - also at the beginning of the new year. In 2024, Tesla was just ahead of BYD with 1.79 million pure electric cars worldwide, but the Chinese manufacturer has now outdated the Americans in turnover.

2. No combustion engines, only e-cars and plug-in hybrid

When asked by Business Insider, a spokesman for the group explained: ""Our goal is to contribute to combating global warming."" That sounds great - and is meant as part of the company's philosophy.

The motto: ""Cool the Earth by 1 degree."" In practice, this means that BYD only relies on pure electric cars and plug-in hybrids. The offer ranges from small city cars to larger SUV models.

The manufacturer relies on two factors: technological own developments and a price that is below the many European competitors. The company does not want to convince customers with image or origin - but with function and technology.

3. Offer luxury models in the premium sector with the Denza brand

Part of the strategy is also the entry into the premium segment - with the Denza brand. This should clearly differentiate itself from the main brand byd. According to the spokesman, Denza should ""expand the product portfolio in Germany by a premium brand"".

A Denza D9 at the stand of the Chinese manufacturer BYD on the so -called Open Space of the IAA 2023 Picture Alliance/dpa | Matthias Balk

The challenge: Premium is traditionally connected to brands such as BMW, Mercedes or Audi in Europe. Denza tries to redefine this idea - with a different design, other technology, but without long history.

Worth knowing: Denza was a joint venture between BYD and Mercedes. However, Mercedes got out at the Chinese electric car mark in the summer of 2024. BYD is now the sole shareholder.

Reading BYD is also selling more and more cars: the sales of the Chinese carmaker in Germany are growing as much

4. New hires and participation options for employees

Many German manufacturers dismantle staff. Not by. After all, the Chinese car manufacturer in Europe is characterizing - especially in the areas of technology and mobility solutions. There are around 60 in Germany.

The reasons for the staff structure are complex: on the one hand, BYD is only in the establishment of its Germany business. On the other hand, the group apparently works much faster internally than many European competitors: and integrates employees.

For example, according to the spokesman, ideas from German teams were taken into account ""within a few months"" in vehicle models: ""We appreciate the feedback from our employees worldwide - including the teams in Germany -"" said the spokesman.

""In fact, suggestions from our ranks were integrated into our vehicles a few months later. Employees have the opportunity to participate directly in the design of the models relevant to the German market.""

5. No wish for European adaptation?

How does BYD be a competition - for example with Tesla or established German manufacturers? The company does not publicly express itself directly. The group is also cautious when it comes to prejudices. Chinese vehicles have to struggle with skepticism in Germany - often it is about quality, security or data protection.

BYD relies on a pragmatic strategy here, according to the spokesman: ""We believe that the quality of our vehicles is convincing."" In any case, there are no large PR offensives.

What BYD could mean for the German market

It is no coincidence that the company is now expanding in Germany: the group has global ambitions beyond the Chinese home market and has extensive its own battery and vehicle technology.

For consumers, this means more selection - possibly also new price pressure on established brands. In any case, BYD is pushing to Europe with speed and technology-and is first examined as a group: At the end of 2024, allegations came from Amnesty internationally regarding human rights violations in the battery supply chains (""Tagesschau"").

It remains to be seen whether BYD succeeds in prevailing established brands around decades.",businessinsider

According to Berkshire Hathaway, an employee of FlightSafety International has won the 2025 internal competition.

Warren Buffett explains that the likelihood of such a profit is around 1 to 780 billion.

Warren Buffett's internal ""March Madness"" competition has a main winner for the first time. The investor has been organizing the cripples for employees of his companies for almost a decade - but someone had never got the main prize. Until now.

As Berkshire Hathaway now announced, an employee of the FlightSafety International subsidiary has won the 2025 competition. He rightly typed the winners of 31 of the 32 first round games of the Basketball tournament of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) - an impressive result.

The NCAA is a non -profit association in the USA that organizes and regulates university sports at more than 1,100 universities.

Employees typed 44 out of 45 games correctly

A total of 12 employees had correctly predicted a total of 31 games. But: the winner was even right with the first 29 games in a row. Only in the 30th game-the 86: 73 victory of the University of Illinois against Xavier University-his tip went. The eleven second -placed people each receive $ 100,000 (around 92,000 euros).

Incidentally, the winner followed up again in the second round: 13 correct tips in a row. He was right at 44 out of 45 games. According to Berkshire, the likelihood of this is 1 to 780 billion - provided that every game is considered a coin toss.

""I have a good feeling that we made the right decision here,"" Buffett told Wall Street Journal. What is meant is the decision to simplify the requirements for victory. This no longer needed a perfect first round.

""I'm getting older,"" said the 94-year-old. ""I want to give away a million dollars to someone as long as I am still chairman."" According to Buffett, a reward at this height would ""trigger excitement everywhere"".

Warren Buffett does not know the name of the winner

In 2014, Berkshire had launched a public challenge for the first time: one billion dollars for the right prediction of all 63 tournament games. Buffett started an internal competition two years later. Anyone who correctly typed all 48 games in front of the ""Sweet 16"" was able to win up to one million dollars (approx. 920,000 euros) per year for life. Since then, the betting game has been taking place almost every year - but so far without the main winner.

This year's winner wants to remain anonymous. ""I don't know the name,"" Buffett told the journal. Flythsafety and Berkshire themselves did not comment on any comment on request.

FlightSafety offers professional training for aviation and develops flight simulators. At the end of 2023, the company employed fewer than 5,000 of the 392,000 Berkshire employees.

Commerzbank wants to increase the remuneration of its board members from 2026 in order to remain competitive. The target remuneration for the CEO Bettina Orlopp is to increase by 15 percent. The new salary structure has already been decided by the Supervisory Board. On May 15, the proposal should be presented at the general meeting for approval.

It is going well at Commerzbank. The private bank brought in a new record gain of 2.7 billion euros last year. In the future, the top staff will also receive more money again, as the bank reports in the current remuneration report on Wednesday.

climb. The target amount of the variable remuneration increases most clearly with 30 or 31 percent, as it is said.

That is why the salaries of Commerzbank board members rise

The reason for the increase: the amount of the members of the board of directors has been stagnating since 2012. In the same period, the remuneration of the employees paid in collaborate has increased by 28.2 percent and that of 10.4 percent of non -tariff employees, according to Commerzbank.

The bank wants to remain competitive. In this way, existing board members should be kept in the company and the positions for new members should be designed attractive. So far, the remuneration was ""below the market framework"".

The new salary structure has already been decided by the Supervisory Board. On May 15, the proposal should be presented at the general meeting for approval. Then an increase in the remuneration of the Supervisory Board should also be discussed.

The remuneration report also reveals who the best paid manager of Commerzbank 2024 was: Manfred Knopf. The ex-CEO earned 5.8 million euros last year. 2.4 million euros of this will therefore be paid by payments by the cancellation of his contract.

This is the basic salary for the period from April 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 in the amount of 1.44 million euros and a transitional allowance for the period from January 1, 2026 to June 30, 2026 in the amount of 960,000 euros. According to Commerzbank, the money was paid in October 2024.

Different font colors can be found in the consolidated versions. The normal black stands for passages that the three parties have already agreed on. This affects the majority of the papers. But there are also the colors red and blue. Blue stands for passages written by the Union. Red for those who come from the SPD. These are suggestions for phrases.

In lines 260, 261 and 262, the SPD added a set to chat controls. Among them is a union in line 265 in a blue sentence regarding the withdrawal of the partialization of cannabis.

There are also text passages that are stored with a yellow background. These are areas in which no final agreement has yet been reached where there is still a need for discussion. The color can also stand for the fact that these passages will be negotiated again at a later date.

What the square brackets stand for

Some text passages, which were also written with the font colors blue and red, stand between two square brackets. These are sections that the parties have not yet agreed on and the respective claims of the individual parties. There is further negotiations between these points.

Also read this way CDU/CSU and SPD in the area of ​​health and care

This can be seen in the role of the police officer for the German Bundestag. The Union wants to abolish the role of what can be recognized by the blue script. The SPD, on the other hand, wants to ""further strengthen"" the office. So the parties are still far apart on this point.

The angular brackets are demands of the respective parties, which have not yet been negotiated. Collage: Dominik Schmitt / Business Insider Germany

These negotiations are then passed on by the working groups to a total of 19 chief negotiators. These will negotiate the outstanding points under the leadership of the party leader Friedrich Merz (CDU), Markus Söder (CSU), Lars Klingbeil (SPD) and Saskia Esken (SPD).",businessinsider

According to ""Manager Magazin"", Schufa boss Tanja Birkholz is planning to disclose the calculation formula for the creditworthiness score. The methodology should also be changed. Details are to be published from April. Later, citizens should be able to understand how their score comes about via a free app and how they can improve it. It is expected to comply with the information agency and additional effort for banks. Until the new score is used, two to three years could pass.

Schufa boss Tanja Birkholz plans to disclose the calculation formula for the central value with which Schufa evaluates the creditworthiness of the Germans, reports the ""Manager Magazin"". A claim that consumer advocates have been raising for a long time. The methodology should also be changed.

Birkholz plane, first details about the new scoring at the beginning of April. A few months later, all citizens should be able to understand which criteria influence their score - and how they can improve their creditworthiness. There should be a free app for this.

A new criterion is that the number of bank contracts no longer counts because it does not necessarily deteriorate the creditworthiness. However, it remains unchanged that two reminders lead to a negative entry.

Her predecessors would have made great effort to ensure that the formula remains secret. Birkholz, on the other hand, is of the opinion that there can be no trust from consumers without change. Without this trust, it will be more difficult for Schufa to get access to the most valuable data in the long term, according to the CEO.

According to the newspaper, Schufa chief Jurist Florian Reul expects complaints: Both consumers and specialized law firms should attack the new score in court.

Felix Lowinski, responsible for business with banks and trading companies, is also concerned: the new score means additional effort for banks. You would have to adapt your risk models and coordinate them with the financial supervision in order to include it in their credit decisions.

Some companies are currently testing the score. Experts assume that it could take two to three years before he established himself in practice.

Unsplash

Many companies ask themselves: How do I bind good talents in the team in the long term? While talents ask themselves: money is really everything - and what else do I get from my work? The answer is often not in the higher salary, but in a new understanding of remuneration. This is shown by the HR software company Personio, together with Sven Franke, an expert for New Work. We are talking about ""New Pay"": The new remuneration model links money, values ​​and culture - and shows how fair payment can really work.

""Why do I actually work - and what do I really get for it?"" More and more people ask themselves this question when they come to the office in the morning or reach for the laptop. Sure, money has to be right. But is that still enough today? What if the job pays off - but feels empty? When praise fails, development stalls and the salary does not explain how valuable your own work is?

This is exactly where a concept comes in that makes the round: ""New Pay"". The HR software company Personio took a closer look together with New Work expert Sven Franke. Here are the reasons why modern remuneration has to be more than just a transfer amount at the end of the month.

Salary alone is no longer enough: modern remuneration systems must be fair, transparent and value-oriented, says New Pay expert Sven Franke. This is the only way to make top talents in the long term. Unsplash

Salary remains important - but not only decisive

Sure, money is still a decisive factor for many: According to Personio, 56.9 percent of the employees indicate that the salary comes first for them. But-and that is the exciting part-top talents are no longer just about the naked number on the account in their career.

According to Sven Franke, co -founder of the ""New Pay Collective"", fairness, transparency and development opportunities are now at least as high in the course. Franke sums it up: ""Remuneration must be fundamentally newly thought.""

The term ""New Pay""

Here we come to the term ""New Pay"". According to Personio, there is a real change of perspective. What is meant is not just a chic new salary plan, but a completely different understanding of remuneration. Personio describes it as follows: Salary should not only pay the performance - it should also say something about corporate culture and its values.

Specifically, ""New Pay"" connects three dimensions: Financial (what does the end of the month end up?), Structural (what benefits and additional services are there?) And emotional (how does work feel - and how is it valued?).

Such a system must be considered multi -dimensional. Sven Franke, who has been a fair remuneration for more than 30 years, suggests a holistic remuneration model that connects four central levels:

Monetary remuneration: remains important, but is only part of the whole.

: remains important, but is only part of the whole. Benefits and additional services: for example further training budgets, mobility offers or health services.

: For example, further training budgets, mobility offers or health services. Intensive aspects: such as feedback culture, development perspectives or the fit between the task and individual strength.

: such as feedback culture, development perspectives or the fit between the task and individual strength. Transparency & fairness - the question of how understandable, fair and open decisions are made.

Concrete key questions should help:

Do I recognize what grows from my work?

Is my workload appropriate?

Do I feel valued - not just as a function, but as a person?

Do I get a response to my work?

Can I develop further?

This is how the entry into the new system succeeds

Personio advises to be structured in a structured manner when switching to a new remuneration system. A future -proof model can be created in seven steps:

Set goals: What should be said about the remuneration system? What values ​​and principles should it transport? Is-act analysis: Are there any gaps in justice? How transparent is the existing system? What criticism has already been expressed? Integrating stakeholders: Employees and managers must be involved and sensitized at an early stage - for topics such as salary transparency, dialogue and fairness. Develop a model: Which criteria make the individual and structural value contribution visible? Which benefits and services fit the culture? Strengthening communication: Without clear language, even the best system of effects loses effect. Training and implementation: Managers must be prepared and enabled to work with the new system. Evaluation: What ensures future viability? Which set screws have to be followed up regularly?

The conclusion is: remuneration is more than a price tag. It is much more expression of attitude - and a powerful instrument for the design of the corporate culture. If you take this seriously, you not only create fair salaries, but also trust and bond.",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,"According to the report, Gazprom expects further delivery slump in Europe",https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/interne-praesentation-zeigt-laut-bericht-wie-stark-die-gazprom-lieferungen-nach-europa-in-den-kommenden-jahren-einbrechen-koennten/,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 15:41:45 GMT","The Logo of Russian Energy Company Gazprom in Belgrade, Serbia, Saturday, September 10, 2022. (Jiji Press/Yudai Kato) Picture Alliance/dpa/Jiji Press | Yudai Kato

A 42-page internal Gazprom presentation expects that the overall deliveries of the group to Europe and Turkey are shrinking by more than five times the 2019 level this year. This is reported by the “Financial Times”, which this presentation could see. It was created last year. Accordingly, the cash flow from Gazprom will remain negative and will amount to a deficit of 15 trillion rubles by 2034.

Since Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the Russian energy giant Gazprom has stumbled. Last year, the group had to register a record loss of billions - for the first time after a quarter of a century. The reason? The former Gazprom business model, the monopoly on pipeline gas exports, is no longer open. Large parts of the deliveries to Europe have disappeared, gas prices are falling. And the future could look even darker.

This suggests at least a 42-page internal Gazprom presentation, which the “Financial Times” (FT) could see and which was created last year. Accordingly, it is expected that the total deliveries to Europe and Turkey are more than the five -time level of the level of 2019, namely to 47 billion cubic meters. In 2034, deliveries are finally to be decreased to 34 billion cubic meters a year.

According to the ""FT"" in the presentation, the cash flow will remain negative and will remain a deficit of 15 trillion rubles by 2034.

Gazprom could save money when it comes to expenses for trips and government relationships

As can be seen from the document entitled ""Gazprom Transformation"", interrupted supply chains, weakened contracts and the limited access to the European market are among the most important challenges, reports the ""FT"". The latter point had caused the company itself by stopping gas deliveries to Germany.

In addition: China as a new buyer of energy deliveries is not a substitute for the decreasing European market. Also because Russia is forced to sell its deliveries at lower prices than once to Europe. In addition, the hope of building a new pipeline has not fulfilled there.

In view of the difficult, economic situation, the Gazprom presentation leads a number of measures to reduce the costs. It should be about expenses for trips, office areas and government relationships. In addition, according to ""FT"", the space is also placed in selling assets that are not part of Gazprom's core business, such as parts or the entire Gazprom methane refueling network.

The fact is: With the billion -off deficits of the energy giant, the Russian budget also loses an enormous amount of income. For a long time, Gazprom was the most important source of money. If the group's transformation does not succeed, the only hope for a quick end of the war remains. Gazprom could open new doors for energy deliveries again.

Eoin Noonan/Web Summit via Getty Images

The US entrepreneur and billionaire Ray Dalio has a new job: as a special consultant for the new Indonesian state fund of DANANTARA. With the DANANTARA investment fund, the Indonesian government plans to invest over $ 900 billion in national industry. Dalio, the founder of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, is known for his expertise on the American and Chinese economy.

The American hedge fund of Bridgewater Associates is one of the largest of its kind worldwide. His founder Ray Dalio will now build the new Indonesian state fund Danantara as a special consultant.

As the fund announced on Monday, Dalio will belong to a “Dream team” consultant committee in the future. The economist Jeffrey Sachs and the former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra are also part of the college.

Indonesian President Prabowo Subiantoim had only launched Dantara last month. As a so -called so -called Wealth Fund, the government wants to invest with it primarily in the national economy and consolidate several state companies. The fund focuses on ""important projects that create significant added value for our country, bring real advantages, create high -quality jobs and bring long -term prosperity to the Indonesian people,"" said Prabowo.

Indonesian state funds are said to manage $ 900 billion

According to this, the DANANTARA fund will be launched with an initial investment budget of $ 20 billion (18.5 billion euros). The goal is to manage assets worth more than $ 900 billion (835 billion euros). The fund creates the money in national industrialization and projects for processing natural resources. For comparison: In 2023, the Indonesian gross domestic product was just under $ 1.4 trillion (1.4 trillion euros).

A number of states usually invest in a variety of assets such as stocks, bonds, startups and real estate. The Singapore State Investment Fund Temasek has a net location of $ 290 billion ($ 269 billion). The largest state fund in the world, the Government Pension Fund Global in Norway, manages significantly more money. Its valued volume is around $ 1.79 trillion (1.65 trillion euros).

Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975. He wrote several books on financial and economic history. In addition, he often comments on the excessive debt problems in the USA and China. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, his assets amount to $ 16.2 billion (15 billion euros). His representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

Indonesian benchmark index dropped by twelve percent

Dalio joins Danantara at a time when the state fund is put to the test in terms of transparency and corporate management.

This month, Prabowo's government has started to broadcast ownership of 40 state companies on Danatara. The state fund is directly assumed to the Indonesian president.

The concern of the initiators about Prabowo's power has contributed to a break -in of the Indonesian stock market. According to market capitalization, this is the largest in Southeast Asia.

In addition, the Indonesian benchmark index Jakarta Composite is one of the world's worst values ​​this year. It dropped by twelve percent in 2025. According to estimates by the Bloomberg business news agency, foreign-$ two billion (1.8 billion euros) has withdrawn from the market.

Picture Alliance/dpa | Sina Schuldt

In 2020, 13.8 million workers used the distance flat rate, especially people with an income between 20,000 and 50,000 euros gross. After the reform of 2022, a further increase is being debated in the current coalition negotiations. Experts criticize the measure as expensive and inmate of climate. Despite the mobility offers of employers, such as Job Germany ticket, the majority of employees remain in the car.

The distance flat rate, which is the subject of the current coalition negotiations, is mainly claimed by employees with medium -sized incomes. According to a communication from the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden, they used a total of 13.8 million workers in Germany in 2020.

Over half of the commuters (54 percent) had an annual income between 20,000 and 50,000 euros gross. Another 30 percent earned between 50,000 and 100,000 euros a year. In eleven percent of those affected, the income was less than 20,000 euros, while five percent earned at least 100,000 euros. The preferred means of transport for the way to work is still the car.

Increasing the commuter flat rate is discussed

In 2020, the distance flat rate was 30 cents per kilometer for the simple way to work. After a reform in May 2022, it increased to 38 cents from the 21st kilometer. A further increase is now being discussed as part of the ongoing negotiations between the Union and the SPD. However, experts criticize this measure as cost -intensive and environmentally harmful.

The basis for this evaluation is the wage and income tax statistics of 2020. This is only available about three and a half years after the end of the assessment year due to the long deadlines.

The average pendulum route

According to the statistics, 84 percent of commuters used a car at least on a part of their route. On average, they covered 28 kilometers on their way to work. ""The more rural a person lived, the more often they drove by car,"" said the statisticians.

In the statistics, only those cases were recorded in which the advertising costs exceeded the employee lump sum of 1000 euros at that time. People with lower advertising costs often made their shuttle routes either not asserted for tax purposes or did not submit any tax return at all.

Regardless of the actual travel costs, the distance flat rate can be used. It does not matter whether the way to work is covered by bike, public transport or car.

Despite the Germany ticket, most take the car

An investigation by the Institute for Mobility at the University of St. Gallen confirms that the car is mainly used for the way to work. Even in the summer months, more than two thirds of the respondents go to work by car or motorcycle. Of these, 83 percent state that they are traveling with a combustion engine.

Despite various mobility offers from companies, the willingness to switch to other means of transport remains low. More than half of the employers surveyed provide their employees' job Germany ticket for public regional and local transport, whereby the employees usually receive a grant for the regular public transport subscription.

Nevertheless, the study shows that only around a third of the employees would be fundamentally willing to switch to alternative means of transport. Many commuters who use the car particularly criticize inadequate timing in local public transport.

Around 1,800 employees and around 600 employers in Germany were interviewed for this investigation.

A four-day week could cause economic damage, according to the Institute of German Economy (IW). 94 percent of the companies surveyed fear value creation losses. 82 percent of companies have not tested the model. Around half sees advantages for the attractiveness as an employer, but only six percent believe that it helps against the shortage of skilled workers. The majority of working hours are considered unrealistic (only 20 percent consider it possible), while almost 70 percent fear that work will remain.

A comprehensive introduction of a four-day week with full wage compensation could have negative effects on the German economy, according to the employer-related institute of the German economy (IW). According to a survey by the institute, 94 percent of the 823 companies surveyed expressed fear that a mandatory four-day week would lead to a loss of value, the IW said in Cologne.

According to the survey, the concept has so far been little more common: 82 percent of the companies stated that they had not yet tried it. About half of the respondents also recognized positive aspects in the four-day week, especially with regard to the attractiveness of the company for applicants and specialists. Nevertheless, only six percent considered them to be a suitable measure to combat the shortage of skilled workers.

Majority of the companies sees no possibility to compensate for work

The assumption that working hours could lead to increased productivity was hardly approved among the companies surveyed: ""Only 20 percent consider working hours in their own company possible,"" it said in a message.

In contrast, almost 70 percent expressed the concern that unfinished work could remain and that Germany would be falling behind internationally. ""60 percent even find Germany's four-day week."" The IW came to the conclusion that a comprehensive and undifferentiated introduction of this working time model could result in considerable economic damage to companies and the entire German economy.

The survey explicitly referred to a four-day week with full wage compensation. According to IW, the results of the survey are representative.

Melina French Gates is one of the most successful and influential women in the whole world. The “Forbes” business magazine estimates her current assets at $ 30.2 billion (around 27.9 billion euros). But how did she bring it so far?

Probably thanks to a advice from Warren Buffett, which he is said to have given her a good two decades ago. This emerges from an article from ""CNBC Make IT"", which refers to a LinkedIn interview with Gates.

Melinda French Gates is one of the most famous philanthropists in the world. After her time at Microsoft, she founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with her husband at the time in 2000, which is committed to health, education and poverty worldwide.

Today she is particularly committed to her own Pivotal Ventures initiative, with the aim of promoting gender equality. Gates is one of the most influential voices in the global struggle against social inequality - and one of the most successful women in the world.

In an interview with LinkedIn, Gates now revealed that she is still remembering a career clause by Warren Buffett. The billion -dollar investor and chairman of the board of ""Berkshire Hathaway"" gave her in the beginning of the foundation: ""Find your goal and leave the other things left.""

Buffett was a trustee and large donor of the Gates Foundation from 2006 to 2021 and helped advance the organization's philanthropic programs in the areas of the environment, economy and humanitarian areas. By 2022, Buffett donated more than $ 36 billion to the foundation.

Sets limits and learns to say no

Melinda French Gates cane with Buffets to this day - especially when it comes to setting limits at work. You do not get off the border, you run the risk of being bombarded by inquiries about additional work, fancy colleagues and other distracting tasks. All of this stops you from doing his other work - and in the worst case leads to stress and burnout.

Gates says: ""To use your time effectively, you sometimes have to reject projects that are difficult to refuse, sometimes even inquiries from loved ones"". So she learned to say no early. In an interview with LinkedIn, she said: ""If you know immediately that it is a no, you shouldn't hesitate long, but just say no."" This clarity helps enormously in your own career.

The Journeyman Collective

Luxurious, psychedelic mushroom retreats for CEOs are the business concept of The Journeymen Collective near Vancouver in Canada. Four-day time-outs including accompanied intoxication experiences often help customers to reduce fears at their workplaces, say the founder of the retreat, Rob Grover and Gary Logan. The company has recorded an increase in bookings by 200 percent in the past two years.

This article is based on a conversation with the couple Rob Grover and Gary Logan. As the founder of The Journeymen Collective, they offer luxurious guided psychedelic mushroom retreats in the Canadian mountains near Vancouver. This report was revised for reasons of length and clarity.

Rob Grover and his partner Gary Logan are pleased with an intoxicating demand: In the past two years, bookings for their psychedelic retreat have increased by 200 percent. Grover and Logan lead Psilocybin trips accompanied in the mountains of the Canadian coastal town of Vancouver in the mountains of the Canadian coastal town. The equivalent of customers pays around 14,000 euros for four-day individual or group experiences with up to four participants at The Journeymen Collective. The salt water pool and a private cook are included in the price.

The sale and possession of the hallucinogenic substance psilocybin, which occurs in mushrooms, is prohibited in Canada. Due to legal gray areas and a lack of enforcement, mushroom tax offices and other companies are still active.

Read here what Grover and Logan report about their retreat.

CEOs book the intoxication retreat to reduce stress and make plans

Rob Grover: With guided, luxurious psychedelic trips, we turn to all those who get to know themselves better and want to better understand the world around them. That is why we all invite you to lead the best possible life with a deep curiosity.

Our customers are between 21 and 77 years old - about 60 percent female and 40 percent male. Many are entrepreneurs, CEOs and managers, founders, actors and also athletes. They often come here to learn to break through old patterns.

Maybe you suffer from stress, fear or a form of depression. You have creative blockages. Some plague the feeling of no longer being connected to personal and professional relationships. Many people say: ""Something is missing."" You are looking for the next breakthrough in life and in business.

Gary Logan: They keep the appearance on the outside. You have everything: new, chic clothes, a very family and a picture book suburban life. But when you look inside, they feel lost. Anyone who comes to us is looking for a better connection to themselves, to employees in the company and the family. Our participants have the feeling that they have reached a hurdle and just don't know how to overcome it.

""We have no idea what to expect, but we can support you""

Grover: We say to our participants: ""We know 100 percent that we have no idea what to expect. But we are 100 percent sure that we can support you with everything that comes to you."" A few tears almost always flow during the process. Sometimes they are tears of joy, but sometimes tears of grief.

One of our youngest customers said she came to us because she was afraid at work. In the long run, she would have added that a lot. In retrospect, she said: ""This fear is gone now. Now I create my customers from pure joy and freedom.""

Logan: The most common knowledge from the trips are peace of mind, serenity and silence. Participants become more conscious of their thoughts, feelings and emotions. Your ability to listen has refined and you are not always trying to find the answer to questions that have not yet been asked.

With a luxurious facility, Grover and Logan want to convey a feeling of security to their guests. The Journeymen Collective

Grover: In the professional environment, people say that they are more conscious of themselves. This encourages them to ask their team members or employers challenging questions. In doing so, they encourage the people who work with them or for them in a new way.

Participants learn how to return to the quiet state that was taught to them on the trip. They give themselves time to not only react in old patterns. A kind of internal restructuring takes place.

People don't just come for psilocybin mushroom trips-but with one intention

People come to us because we offer them a safe, trusting, caring and professional environment in which they can go. Our facility is a feel-good retreat. People think: ""If I already deal with the unpleasant aspects of myself, I can at least be comforted in a very luxurious way.""

Logan: After their stays, our customers are increasingly talking about their psychedelic trips. Many tell us that they couldn't tell anyone at first. But then your surroundings will find changes to them. If you tell about it, many say that you have been thinking about it for years, but did not know who to talk to, or knew anyone who actually did it.

Grover: A customer came with the words: ""I think I have to give up my career"". Afterwards he looked at his goals: ""I love my career. It was just all the trauma from my childhood and youth that stood in my way and I let go of them. I was busy with my career and learned more.""

It is as if you see how the lights approach in humans again. You have a new spark for life and work.

Amy Morin ist Psychotherapeutin, Autorin und Moderatorin des Verywell Mind Podcast. Sie hat diesen Beitrag für Insider geschrieben. Wenn ihr denkt, dass euer Chef narzisstische Tendenzen hat, gibt es bestimmte Anzeichen, auf die ihr achten solltet, um es zu festzustellen, sagt Morin. Narzisstische Führungspersönlichkeiten könnten andere demütigen, wenig Empathie zeigen oder so tun, als stünden sie über den Regeln. Mehr Artikel auf Business Insider findet ihr hier

Jeder von uns ist ein bisschen narzisstisch – manche mehr, andere weniger. Denn Narzissmus bezeichnet letztendlich nur, wie es um unseren Selbstwert steht. Ein gewisses Maß an Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstliebe ist normal und sogar wichtig für eine stabile Persönlichkeit. Und auch in einigen Situation sehr überzeugt von sich selbst zu sein, macht jemanden noch längst nicht zu einer schwierigen Person.

Problematisch wird es jedoch, wenn der Narzissmus übersteigert ist und Empathie und echte zwischenmenschliche Beziehungen auf der Strecke bleiben, weil sich nur noch alles um sich geht. Die narzisstische Persönlichkeitsstörung ist eine anerkannte Erkrankung, die diagnostiziert werden kann. Studien deuten darauf hin, dass etwa zwei Prozent aller Menschen davon betroffen sind, meist Männer.

Nicht jeder zeigt seine narzisstischen Verhaltensweisen jederzeit, manchmal bemerkt man erst im Laufe der Zeit, dass jemand zu Selbstverherrlichung und Arroganz neigt. Vor allem, wenn Vorgesetze solch ein Verhalten an den Tag legen, kann es schwierig sein, mit ihnen zu arbeiten.

Anhand dieser sieben Anzeichen könnt ihr erkennen, dass euer Chef narzisstische Verhaltensweisen an den Tag legt und ein übersteigertes Selbstwertgefühl hat:

1. Bewunderung ist ihnen wichtiger als alles andere

Viele Chefs fühlen sich zwar durch Komplimente und Lob geschmeichelt, aber erkennen auch, wenn sich Mitarbeiter anbiedern.

Ein Chef mit narzisstischen Tendenzen wiederum wird sich mit Mitarbeitern umgeben, die ihn mit Bewunderung regelrecht überschütten. Sie befördern Menschen, die ihnen Bewunderung zeigen, mehr als diejenigen, die die beste Arbeit leisten. Der Grund: Sie ziehen es vor, ein Führungsteam zu schaffen, das gleichzeitig ein Fanclub ist.

2. Sie verunsichern Menschen

Ein Chef mit einem ungesunden Ego wird niemals zugeben, wenn er sich irrt. Er leugnet seine Fehler – sogar gegenüber denjenigen, die den Fehler gesehen haben.

Es kann gut sein, dass sie sagen: „Das habe ich nie gesagt!“, nachdem sich herausgestellt hat, dass eine Aussage, die sie gemacht haben, nicht der Wahrheit entsprach. Manchmal bestehen sie auch darauf, etwas gesagt zu haben, was sie aber in Wirklichkeit nie gesagt haben. Wie zum Beispiel: „Ich habe Ihnen viermal gesagt, wann der Bericht fällig ist!“

Ihr Ziel ist es, um jeden Preis erfolgreich und intelligent zu wirken, und sie scheuen sich nicht, dabei unehrlich zu sein oder andere zu sabotieren.

3. Sie zeigen wenig Empathie für ihre Mitarbeiter

Wenn euer Chef darauf besteht, dass ihr mit einer „kleinen Erkältung“ zurechtkommen solltet, wenn ihr euch krankmeldet, kann das ein Zeichen für narzisstische Tendenzen sein. Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass solche Menschen Verständnis für euer Privatleben oder eure Probleme im Beruf aufbringen.

Sie könnten Mitarbeiter sogar öffentlich demütigen, um jene Angestellten einzuschüchtern, die um etwas bitten – sei es beim Urlaub oder Hilfe bei einem Projekt. Sie können auch jeden, der Bedenken über Sicherheitsthemen oder unrealistische Fristen äußert, als undankbar bezeichnen.

4. Sie benutzen Wut als eine Waffe

Sie haben Schwierigkeiten, ihr Temperament zu zügeln, aber nutzen Aggression auch als Mittel zur Manipulation. Die Stimme zu erheben, mit der Faust auf den Tisch zu hauen oder sogar jemanden vor anderen Kollegen zu demütigen, kann als Waffe eingesetzt werden, um die Leute bei der Stange zu halten.

Nur wenige Augenblicke, nachdem sie eine Person beschimpft haben, loben sie vielleicht eine andere. Ihr schneller Stimmungsumschwung ist ein klares Zeichen dafür, dass ihre Wutausbrüche eine Kontrolltaktik sind.

5. Sie prahlen damit, über den Regeln zu stehen

Euer Chef missachtet nicht nur die Regeln, er findet auch großen Gefallen daran, alle daran zu erinnern, dass die Regeln nicht für ihn gelten.

Er wird euch häufig daran erinnern: „Ihr könnt nur freitags von zu Hause aus arbeiten. Ich arbeite von zu Hause aus, wann immer ich Lust dazu habe“, oder: „Ihr könnt Konferenzräume buchen, so viel ihr wollt. Aber wenn ich entscheide, dass eine wichtigere Besprechung ansteht, werden ihr rausgeschickt.“ Sie wollen damit deutlich machen, dass sie euch überlegen sind.

6. Sie sprechen immer mit Autorität und Überzeugung in der Stimme

Eine narzisstische Führungskraft wird nie unsicher klingen oder zugeben, dass sie sich nicht auskennt. Selbst wenn sie die Antwort nicht weiß, spricht sie mit einer solchen Überzeugung, dass Menschen oft glauben, sie wüsste, wovon sie spricht.

Das ist der Grund, warum Führungskräfte mit narzisstischen Tendenzen in Krisenzeiten vorübergehend Erfolg haben. Wenn etwas schiefläuft, wenden sich die Menschen an jemanden, der selbstbewusst sagt, dass er weiß, was zu tun ist. Auch, wenn er es nicht weiß.

7. Sie arbeiten hart, um wie der Held auszusehen

Da Chefs mit narzisstischen Tendenzen Bewunderung lieben, bringen sie sich oft in Situationen, in denen sie wie ein Held aussehen können.

Sie halten vielleicht eine Sondersitzung ab, um anzukündigen, dass alle über die Feiertage einen zusätzlichen freien Tag bekommen. Und tun so, als sei es ihre alleinige Entscheidung gewesen, allen ein Urlaubsgeld zu „schenken“, damit sich alle persönlich bei ihnen bedanken können.

Oder sie veranstalten Events, bei denen sie ihre Fähigkeiten unter Beweis stellen können, zum Beispiel ein Golfturnier. Vielleicht veranstalten sie sogar üppige Büropartys, bei denen sie so tun, als würden sie persönlich für die Veranstaltung bezahlen.

So geht ihr richtig mit eurem narzisstischen Chef um

Ihr könnt nicht ändern, wie sich euer Chef verhält. Aber ihr könnt ändern, wie ihr auf narzisstisches Verhalten reagiert.

Setzt klare Grenzen, ignoriert aufdringliche Versuche, eure Aufmerksamkeit zu erlangen, und sprecht an, wenn sein Verhalten ausfällig wird. Letztendlich kann es euch helfen, das Verhalten eures Chefs weniger persönlich zu nehmen, wenn ihr erkennt, was er tut – und warum er es tut.

https://cnbc.com,Stock futures fall as investors weigh Trump's auto tariffs: Live updates,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/stock-market-today-live-updates-.html,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Donald Trump is greeted by traders as he walks the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Dec. 12, 2024.

Stock futures were lower Wednesday as investors weighed news of President Donald Trump's 25% tariff aimed at foreign cars.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 120 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures slipped 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.4% lower.

Trump had previously hinted that he would move to implement auto tariffs ahead of the April 2 date for reciprocal tariffs, which the president has labeled ""Liberation Day."" The president since beginning his second term in January has discussed imposing duties on countries that have their own tariffs on U.S. imports. Trump also noted on Wednesday that his retaliatory tariffs will be permanent for his entire second term.

Shares of General Motors pulled back 7% in extended trading following Trump's remarks, while Ford stock was 5% lower. Tesla stock gained about 1%.

The president said both where the car parts come from and where the finished production occurs will ""have very strong policing.""

""It's pretty easy to do, if parts are made in America and a car isn't, those parts are not going to be taxed or tariffed,"" Trump added.

Stocks took a leg lower and reached their lows of the session on Wednesday following news from the White House that Trump would announce the duties on imported cars later in the day.

The news comes as investors are already anxious about how Trump's retaliatory tariffs will affect the broader U.S. economy, which is already showing some signs of weakness. Consumer confidence, for example, reached a 12-year low in March, according to a Conference Board report, in the latest indication of broader pessimism toward the economy. The board's measure follows a similarly weak reading of the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers for March.

""Today was a reminder that despite the recent rebound in stocks, volatility remains as policy uncertainty lingers,"" said Daniel Skelly, Head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management market research and strategy team. ""Moreover, next week's tariff deadline will likely be more of a starting point for negotiations than a conclusion, so the market may struggle to recover in a straight line higher.""

Stocks are clinging to marginal gains this week. The S&P 500 has ticked up roughly 1% alongside the Nasdaq Composite. The 30-stock Dow has gained 1.1% so far this week.

On the economic front, investors will monitor fresh jobless claims data on Thursday, followed Friday by the March reading of the personal consumption expenditures price index. The PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of inflation.",cnbc

The Atlantic on Wednesday published the full text thread from the Trump administration's Signal group that accidentally included a prominent journalist in discussions of pending U.S. military strikes. Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, had withheld some of the contents of the thread in his bombshell report Monday revealing that he had been looped in on plans to carry out attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen. Goldberg noted in that report that some of the texts contained information that ""could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel,"" had they been read by a U.S. adversary. But Goldberg and his outlet decided to publish the full texts after President Donald Trump and others in the group chat declared Tuesday that none of the messages were classified, and said that they did not contain ""war plans,"" as The Atlantic's initial headline stated. The texts from the ""Houthi PC small group"" published Wednesday morning are unredacted, save for the name of one CIA intelligence officer, The Atlantic said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in an X post homed in on the magazine's decision to describe the thread as ""Attack Plans,"" rather than war plans, in its latest headline. ""The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT war plans,'"" Leavitt wrote. ""This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin."" Goldberg responded directly later Wednesday morning: ""I don't even know what that means ... What are they arguing, that an attack is different than a war?"" ""She's playing some sort of weird semantic game,"" he said in an MSNBC interview. The Trump administration itself has confirmed the veracity of the Signal group.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who were included in it, said in Senate testimony Tuesday that the texts were not classified. Trump later said the same, ""It wasn't classified information."" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday: ""Nobody was texting war plans. And that's all I have to say about that."" Trump's national security advisor, Michael Waltz, who reportedly invited Goldberg to the group, suggested in remarks on Tuesday that somehow the journalist may have ""deliberately"" added himself to it. Waltz provided no evidence for the claim, but said in a Fox News interview that he discussed the matter with Elon Musk, adding, ""We've got the best technical minds looking at how this happened.""",cnbc

The Treasury Department is planning to furlough a ""substantial"" level of its workforce in conjunction with Elon Musk's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government, according to a court document.

As part of a complaint in a related case, Trevor Norris, the department's deputy assistant secretary in human resources, indicated that the layoffs will be coming as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's ongoing moves to cut the federal employee rolls.

In a sworn statement, Norris said the Treasury is wrapping up plans to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order backing DOGE's activity. The Treasury currently has more than 100,000 employees.

""These plans will be tailored for each bureau, and in many cases will require separations of substantial numbers of employees through reductions in force (RIFs),"" Norris said in an affidavit.

The case involves a complaint by the state of Maryland to get a stay on the layoffs. In recent days, three judges have issued restraining orders putting temporary halts on DOGE's efforts to hit several departments.

""The Treasury Department is considering a number of measures to increase efficiency, including a rollback of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions to improve both efficiency and quality of service,"" a Treasury spokesperson said in a statement. ""No final decisions have yet been made, and any current reporting to the contrary is false.""

Bloomberg News first reported the planned layoffs.

Salt Lake City is also a major draw for finance, with one of the highest concentrations of industrial banks in the U.S.; 15 of the nation's 23 industrial banks are located in the county.

The metro's snow economy sets it apart from other cities and will once again help boost Salt Lake City's profile on an international stage when it hosts the Winter Olympic Games in 2034.

Yet some real challenges are ahead. Climate change and a lack of diversity, for example, could affect the city's future.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would impose 25% tariffs on ""all cars that are not made in the United States.""

Trump said there is ""absolutely no tariff"" for cars that are built in the U.S.

The new tariffs were codified in a presidential proclamation that Trump signed in the Oval Office. They will go into effect April 2, and ""we start collecting April 3,"" he said.

Trump White House aide Will Scharf said the new tariffs apply to ""foreign-made cars and light trucks."" He clarified that they come in addition to duties that are already in place.

Scharf said the tariffs will result in ""over $100 billion of new annual revenue"" to the U.S.

Specifics about the proclamation were not immediately clear. Most vehicles are assembled from thousands of parts that may originate from dozens of different countries.

Trump said there will be ""very strong policing"" on which parts of a car are hit with tariffs.",cnbc

President Donald Trump said that tariffs will likely be more ""lenient than reciprocal,"" as the April 2 tariff deadline looms for a number of levies to go into effect.

""I'll probably be more lenient than reciprocal, because if I was reciprocal, that would be very tough for people,"" Trump said Tuesday in an interview with Newsmax.

""I know there are some exceptions, and it's an ongoing discussion, but not too many, not too many exceptions,"" the president added.

The White House later clarified the president's remarks, saying the Trump administration will no longer take into account non-tariff barriers countries raise against the United States to determine the reciprocal tariff rate, as told to CNBC's Eamon Javers.

Non-tariff barriers include factors such as a value-added tax (VAT) — which is a tax on the final consumption of a good or service based on the value added at each production stage — as well as wage suppression and currency manipulation.

The softening stance on tariffs from the Trump administration could soothe investors worried a global trade war will slow down the U.S. economy.

Already, consumer and corporate sentiment have taken a hit. On Tuesday, the Conference Board said its measure for consumer expectations on business, income and labor dropped to a 12-year low.

Stocks have struggled recently, with the S&P 500 dropping 3% in the past month. The benchmark also dipped into correction territory amid the tariff pressures, briefly trading more than 10% below a record set in February.

https://cnbc.com,"Tesla shares drop on plunging European sales, concerns about Trump's tariffs",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/tesla-drops-on-slowing-european-sales-concerns-about-trump-tariffs.html,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","White House Senior Advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attends a cabinet meeting held by U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on March 24, 2025 in Washington, DC.

Tesla shares fell almost 6% on Wednesday as data from Europe showed slowing sales last month, and investors grew increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump's plan for tariffs.

The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) revealed on Tuesday that Tesla saw a 40% year-over-year drop in new vehicle registrations in Europe in February, while overall battery electric vehicle sales were up 26%.

Meanwhile, the White House said on Wednesday that President Trump will announce new tariffs on auto imports in the afternoon. The president has hyped April 2 as ""liberation day"" and ""the big one"" for rolling out his plan to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners, but Trump hinted earlier this week that auto tariffs could arrive sooner.

Movements of this magnitude have become commonplace for Tesla's stock. On 14 separate days this year, Tesla shares have gained or lost at least 5%. Wednesday's selloff, alongside a 2% drop in the Nasdaq, followed a five-day rally that included a 12% jump on Monday.

The trend for the year has been downward, particularly since President Trump began his second term in January, and brought Tesla CEO Elon Musk with him to the White House. Tesla shares are down 36% since Inauguration Day, after falling 28% in February, the steepest drop for any month since December 2022.

Following the ACEA report on Tuesday, RBC analysts wrote in a note that the February numbers only represented a drop of about 11,000 Tesla vehicle registrations in Europe, and emphasized that data for the month ""might not be indicative of true demand.""

New car buyers in Europe, the analysts said, ""could be holding out for the Model Y refresh,"" or a ""new affordable model,"" which they expect in the second half of the year.

Tesla is set to fully ramp up production of the redesigned version of its Model Y SUV next month. The company implemented partial production shutdowns at certain factories earlier this year to upgrade Model Y manufacturing lines.

Some prospective EV buyers have been turned off of late by Musk's political rhetoric and his work for the Trump administration, where he's leading an effort to slash federal government spending, cut the federal workforce, and has said he wants to privatize many services, including social security.

William Blair analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday that, ""pushback from Musk's foray into politics"" has led to ""brand damage and even vandalism,"" for Tesla at a time when the company's supply has been impacted by its Model Y changeover, and ""Chinese competition continues to heat up.""

Still, the firm maintained its buy recommendation on Tesla's stock, pointing to growth in the company's energy storage business, and its prospects in driverless ride hailing. Musk has promised that Tesla will kick off a robotaxi service in Austin in June. The company has yet to begin production of its dedicated robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab.

Alphabet's Waymo is already operating a commercial robotaxi service in Austin and other markets. And in China, several automakers are now offering an equivalent to Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised — a premium, partially automated driving system — as standard options rather than a paid service.

In China this week, Tesla renamed its FSD system ""Intelligent Assisted Driving,"" according to CNEVPost, after previously branding it as ""Full Self-driving Capability."" Tesla's system in all markets still requires a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

https://cnbc.com,"Utah governor signs online child safety law requiring Apple, Google to verify user ages",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/utah-adopts-child-safety-law-requiring-apple-google-to-verify-user-ages.html,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on Wednesday signed a bill that requires Apple and Google's mobile app stores to verify user ages and require parental permission for those under 18 to use certain apps, the governor's spokesperson told CNBC.

The law is the first of its kind in the nation and represents a significant shift in how user ages are verified online, and says it's the responsibility of mobile app stores to verify ages — putting the onus on Apple and Google, instead of individual apps like Instagram, Snapchat and X, to do age checks.

The App Store Accountability Act, or S.B. 142, could also kick off a wave of other states, including South Carolina and California, passing similar legislation.

The law is designed to protect children, who may not understand apps' terms of services and, therefore, can't agree to them, said Todd Weiler, a Republican state senator and the bill's sponsor.

""For the past decade or longer, Instagram has rated itself as friendly for 12 year olds,"" Weiler said at a state senate committee hearing in January. ""It's not.""

Apple and Google will need to request age verification checks when someone makes a new account in the state. That will most likely have to be done using credit cards, according to Weiler. If someone under 18 opens an app store account, Apple or Google will have to link it to a parent's account or request additional documentation. Parents will have to consent to in-app purchases.

Neither company immediately returned a request for comment on Wednesday.

Meta, X and Snap said on Wednesday they applauded Cox and Utah for passing the bill, and encouraged other states to consider similar approaches.

""Parents want a one-stop-shop to oversee and approve the many apps their teens want to download, and Utah has led the way in centralizing it within a device's app store,"" the companies said in a joint statement. ""This approach spares users from repeatedly submitting personal information to countless individual apps and online services.""

The Utah law is slated to take effect on May 7, but it is expected to be challenged in a legal fight over its validity. The state passed a similar age-verification law related to pornography in 2023, and arguments whether that law violates free speech were heard by the Supreme Court in January.

Utah's adoption of the law is also the latest shot in a long-running skirmish between Facebook-parent Meta and Apple.

Meta, which supported the bill, argues that app stores are the best place to do age verification on minors, instead of on individual apps. Meta has recently shifted its policy strategy to seek strategic advantages for itself and shift antitrust scrutiny onto Apple, CNBC reported last month.

Apple says it makes the most sense for apps themselves to do age verification, and that due to privacy reasons, it doesn't want to collect the data needed for age verification.

The ""right place to address the dangers of age-restricted content online is the limited set of websites and apps that host that kind of content,"" according to a paper Apple posted on its website last month.

Utah's bill raises privacy and safety risks, Google said in a blog post on March 12.

""There are a variety of fast-moving legislative proposals being pushed by Meta and other companies in an effort to offload their own responsibilities to keep kids safe to app stores,"" Google Director of Public Policy Kareem Ghanem wrote. ""These proposals introduce new risks to the privacy of minors, without actually addressing the harms that are inspiring lawmakers to act.""

The push for age verification comes after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, X CEO Lina Yaccarino, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and other social media CEOs appeared before Congress in January 2024 for a hearing focused on online child safety.

There, lawmakers criticized the companies, saying they failed to stem online child sexual exploitation on social media apps and needed to do more. Zuckerberg appeared rattled during the hearing after senators told him he had ""blood on your hands."" However, the legislation that came out of the meeting, the Kids Online Safety Act, failed to advance in Congress late last year.

Meta has also been hit with a number of lawsuits filed by states relating to the well-being of children on Facebook and Instagram.

Avey helped launch 23andMe in 2006 alongside Paul Cusenza and Anne Wojcicki, who resigned as CEO on Friday. The company went mainstream due to its popular at-home DNA testing kits, but struggled in recent years to generate recurring revenue, stand up viable therapeutics and research businesses and assuage privacy concerns.

""My time at the company was cut short in 2009, when my co-founder Anne convinced the board that she should run the company,"" Avey wrote in a post on social media site X. ""And I must be honest, I was frustrated with the direction the company took after that point.""

23andMe, which reached a peak market cap of about $6 billion, was worth around $14 million as of market close on Wednesday.

""Without continued consumer-focused product development, and without governance, 23andMe lost its way, and society missed a key opportunity in furthering the idea of personalized health,"" Avey wrote.

Last March, 23andMe's independent directors formed a special committee to evaluate the company's potential paths forward. All seven members resigned from the board in September and said they disagreed with Wojcicki about the ""strategic direction for the company.""

""After my departure, she architected a majority vote for herself that eliminated board governance, even as it expanded over the following funding rounds,"" Avey said. ""For better or worse, the buck stopped with her. It came as no surprise when the board resigned last year.""

Wojcicki submitted multiple proposals to take the company private herself, but all were rejected, even after the company appointed new board members. The special committee ""unanimously determined to reject"" Wojcicki's most recent proposal earlier this month.

If 23andMe's Chapter 11 plan is approved by the court, the company will ""actively solicit qualified bids"" over a 45-day process. Wojcicki still plans to pursue the company as an independent bidder, she said in a post on X on Monday.

""There are many cautionary tales buried in the 23andMe story,"" Avey said. ""Striking a balance between the desire for founder control and board oversight is essential; otherwise, why have a board at all?""

https://cnbc.com,"The concern with CoreWeave’s 250,000 Nvidia chips ahead of its IPO",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/the-concern-with-coreweaves-250000-nvidia-chips-ahead-of-its-ipo.html,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","With 250,000 highly-desired Nvidia graphics processors, CoreWeave has become one of the most prominent ""GPU clouds,"" a status it hopes investors will value when it debuts on the public markets.

But the world of artificial intelligence hardware is moving so quickly that it raises questions about how long those chips will remain on the cutting edge and in demand. It's a concern that could impact investor demand for shares of CoreWeave, one of the most anticipated IPOs in years.

CoreWeave, which rents out remote access to computers based on Nvidia AI chips, said in a financial filing this month that most of its AI chips are from Nvidia's Hopper generation. Those chips, such as the H100, were state-of-the-art in 2023 and 2024. They were scarce as AI companies bought or rented all the chips they could get in the wake of OpenAI ushering in the generative AI age with the release of ChatGPT in late 2022.

But these days, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says that his company's Hopper chips are getting blown out of the water by their successors – the Blackwell generation of GPUs, which have been shipping since late 2024. Hopper chips are ""fine"" for some circumstances but ""not many,"" Huang joked at Nvidia's GTC conference last week.

""In a reasoning model, Blackwell is 40 times the performance of Hopper. Straight up. Pretty amazing,"" Huang said. ""I said before that when Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away.""

That's great for Nvidia, which needs to find ways to keep selling chips to the companies committed to the AI race, but it's bad news for GPU clouds like CoreWeave. That's because the New Jersey company models the future trajectory of its business based on how much it anticipates being able to rent Nvidia chips out for over the next five to six years.

Huang may have been kidding, but Nvidia spent much of its event detailing just how much better its Blackwell chips are. In Nvidia's view, the best way to decrease the high cost of serving AI is by buying faster chips.

Blackwell systems are in full production and shipping to customers, and Nvidia plans to introduce an upgraded version of Blackwell in late 2026. When new chips come out, the older chips — the kind CoreWeave has a quarter of a million of — go down in price, Huang said. So too does the price of renting them.

Older chips don't just stop working when new ones come out. Most companies, including CoreWeave, plan to use Hopper chips for six years. But Nvidia is telling customers that its newer, faster chips are capable of producing more AI content, which leads to more revenues at a better margin for clouds.

An H100 would have to be priced 65% lower per hour than an Nvidia Blackwell GB200 NVL system for the two systems to be competitive in price per output to a renter. Put another way, the H100 would have to rent at 98 cents per hour to match the price per output of a Blackwell rack system priced at $2.20 per hour per GPU, SemiAnalysis estimated, speaking generally about AI rentals.

H100s rented for as much as $8 per hour back in 2023 and often required long commitments and lead times, but now, usage of those chips can be summoned in minutes with a credit card. Some services now offer rented H100 access for under $2 per hour.

The industry could be entering a period where the useful life of AI chips is reduced, Barclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a note on Friday. He was focused on hyperscalers — Meta , Google and Amazon — but the trend affects smaller cloud providers like CoreWeave, too.

""These assets are becoming obsolete at a much more rapid pace given how much innovation and speed improvements happen with each generation,"" Sandler wrote.

This threatens company earnings if they end up depreciating older equipment faster, he said.

CoreWeave says that if there were to be changes to the ""significant"" assumptions it makes about the useful lifetime of its AI infrastructure, it could hurt its business or future prospects. CoreWeave has also borrowed nearly $8 billion to buy Nvidia chips and build its data centers, sometimes using the GPUs it amassed as collateral.

Analysts and investors are also increasingly asking questions about the useful lifespan of these new AI systems and whether their financial depreciation schedules should be accelerated because the technology is improving so fast.

CoreWeave says in its filing that it seeks to offer state-of-the-art infrastructure and says it will continue spending to expand and improve its data centers.

""Part of this process entails cycling out outdated components of our infrastructure and replacing them with the latest technology available,"" the New Jersey company said. ""This requires us to make certain estimates with respect to the useful life of the components of our infrastructure and to maximize the value of the components of our infrastructure, including our GPUs, to the fullest extent possible.""

CoreWeave and Nvidia maintain a good relationship. CoreWeave will certainly buy more chips from Nvidia, which owns more than 5% of the New Jersey company.

""We're super proud of them,"" Huang said last week.

But Nvidia's road map for releasing new chips that it proudly touts will make their predecessors obsolete is a threat to CoreWeave's ambitions.

Amazon has lost the chief medical officer of its pharmacy division after five years at the company.

Dr. Vin Gupta, who most recently served as the medical chief of Amazon Pharmacy, joined Amazon in 2020 as the company was in the early stages of a multiyear effort to build out a health-care business.

Gupta has joined Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP, a professional services firm, as a managing director to lead a portfolio dedicated to health innovation, according to a release. Amazon did not immediately name a successor for Gupta, whose LinkedIn profile says he left last month.

""We are grateful to Dr. Gupta for all of his contributions to Amazon Health Services and wish him the best in his next endeavor,"" an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC in a statement Wednesday.

Gupta said in an emailed statement that Manatt, like Amazon, ""is deeply focused on scaled impact to address problems which matter to patients nationwide,"" including care access and the use of artificial intelligence ""at the point of need.""

For Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Gupta's exit marks another high-profile departure across the health businesses. Earlier this month, One Medical CEO Trent Green announced he would step down from leading the primary care chain in April, after less than two years in the role. Amazon acquired One Medical for $3.9 billion in 2023, five years after snapping up online pharmacy PillPack for about $750 million.

In addition to his role within the pharmacy business, Gupta held several other positions over the course of his five years at the company, including Covid response lead and chief medical officer of new products in Amazon's devices and services unit.

Gupta joined Amazon months before it launched its pharmacy offering, a service that was born out of the PillPack deal in 2018. In his role as chief medical officer, Gupta helped roll out a prescription perk for U.S. Prime members called RxPass and expanded its program for medication delivery by drones.

Gupta was also involved with a moonshot incubator at Amazon called Grand Challenge, which launched under founder Jeff Bezos as a way to develop experimental businesses, including health-care initiatives.

However, the changes are not cause for concern. The news Analysts at Barclays on Wednesday struck an upbeat tone on Honeywell despite modestly revising their price target on the stock to $247 a share from $251. The new target still implies roughly 16% upside from Tuesday's close, and analysts doubled down on their buy rating. In fact, the analysts said Honeywell is one of their preferred stocks within their multi-industry coverage universe — part of the reason is simply out how of favor it has been, down nearly 6% year to date while the broader S & P 500 industrial sector is up around 1%. Its forthcoming split into three separately traded entities and other portfolio shakeups also give the stock some ""self-help characteristics,"" analysts wrote. That can appeal to certain investors. When it reports first-quarter results in the coming weeks, Barclays suggested that Honeywell may end up raising the low end of its 2025 guidance, given the conservative starting point issued earlier this year. ""Despite investor apathy, we think potentially conservative guidance / the scope for guide raises could reignite interest,"" the analysts wrote. The firm also added that ""the upside potential remains substantial"" when it comes to Honeywell's sum-of-the-parts valuation due to the split. The stock is up less than 1% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Barclays lowered Eaton's price target to $315 from $325, implying a roughly 5% increase from Tuesday's close. The firm maintained their hold-equivalent rating on the stock. In general, analysts said uncertainty on the sustainability of AI investments in the coming years from the hyperscalers — companies that provide large-scale cloud computing infrastructure — remains an overhang on Eaton's stock because it supplies electrical equipment used in data centers. Still, analysts said Eaton's exposure to data centers, aerospace and utility grid upgrades should lead to ""sales and earnings growth superior"" to its peers. Finally, analysts tweaked their price target on Dover to $205 a share from $213, citing ""ongoing top-line softness"" in short-cycle industrial names. The call implies more than 15% upside for the stock, as of Tuesday's close. Analysts forecast that company sales could ""see some acceleration"" through fiscal year 2025 as headwinds in the beverage-can business ease. Big picture It's a complicated backdrop for industrial stocks right now, partially due to economic and trade policy uncertainty. There's also company-specific factors for investors to contend with. Honeywell is breaking up into three companies after activist investor Elliott initiated a $5 billion-plus stake in the industrial giant last year. The hedge fund wanted Honeywell to separate its aerospace and automation businesses. That's because the conglomerate has had a lengthy period of weak organic revenue growth. On top of that, management has delivered disappointing guidance for the past several quarters. Meanwhile, Dover and Eaton are dealing with investor questions regarding the impact of artificial intelligence spending on their businesses. These were brought front and center again Tuesday after Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai warned of a potential potential building in data centers. Both companies play a role in the build out of data centers by offering thermal connectors in Dover's case, while Eaton provides power management solutions. Both stocks were lower Wednesday, along with a host of others in the broader AI and data center trade . Bottom line We never enjoy seeing analysts lower their price targets on portfolio names. But, in this case, there's no cause for concern. Not only are the reductions very small, but they aren't based on major concerns with each companies' fundamentals. In the case of Honeywell, it was great to see Barclays prediction that management could raise the low end of its 2025 outlook. We upgraded Honeywell to a buy-equivalent 1 rating after its February quarterly earnings report. Part of the reason why was the company's sensible guidance, which helped reset expectations. Management made it clear its forecast does not assume a recovery in the short-cycle business as it had in 2024. Shares sold off as a result of the earnings release. In our view, there was little room for more downside. We've picked up more shares of Honeywell twice since then. ""Since they finally gave a conservative guide, we thought it was a good chance to buy because if there is a recovery, then you're going to have upside,"" said Jeff Marks, the Investing Club's director of portfolio analysis. ""There's [also] the three-part breakup, which we think will create value."" Barclays understandably is worried about investors being more cautious on AI-related industrials such as Eaton. Not only has Eaton been adamant about its data center business holding up, but management's commentary on its other end markets such as utilities and aerospace, have been reassuring, too. As we wrote in Wednesday's Homestretch , if the market was oversold we would be considering adding to a stock like Eaton on the pullback. We most recently bought Eaton on March 13. We've bought Dover twice into weakness this month. CEO Richard Tobin has dispelled some of our concerns about order growth trends at multiple industrial conferences — first in late February and then again in mid-March .

According to analyst Michael Elias, Microsoft walked away from the two data centers — which were expected to have more than 2 gigawatts of capacity — in the U.S. and Europe over the past six months. The Windows and Xbox company has also delayed or canceled data center leases over the past month, he added. Microsoft traded 1.3% lower Wednesday, snapping a three-day rebound, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped more than 2%. Artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia tumbled 6%, bringing its one-month decline to more than 13%. Vertiv Holdings, a provider of infrastructure and services for data centers, slid 11% on Wednesday, its worst day since July. ""In our view, the pullback on new capacity leasing by Microsoft was largely driven by the decision to not support incremental Open AI training workloads,"" Elias wrote in a research note published Wednesday. ""However, we continue to believe the lease cancellations and deferrals of capacity points to data center oversupply relative to its current demand forecast."" According to Elias, Google parent Alphabet is stepping in to take over some of the backfill capacity Microsoft's canceled leases have left globally, while Meta Platforms is assuming the void in the U.S. market. ""Both of these hyperscalers are in the midst of a material Y/Y ramp in data center demand,"" Elias said. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

https://cnbc.com,"There's a reason friends fight on vacation: 'Friendships rely on a balance of closeness and personal space,' one therapist says",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/the-white-lotus-girls-trip-shows-why-vacations-can-ruin-friendships.html,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","The third and most-viewed season of ""The White Lotus"" features a crew of self-absorbed tourists navigating a rather tense luxury vacation. Of all the bizarre dynamics at play in the HBO Max show — kissing brothers, potentially murderous May-December romances, a rogue gun — the most captivating one might be the girls' trip. Three childhood best friends, played by Michelle Monaghan, Leslie Bibb, and Carrie Coon, who take pride in the longevity of their relationship, are quickly finding out they might not have much in common anymore. Perhaps the reason this storyline nearly monopolizes viewers' attention is because it's all too familiar. In ""The White Lotus,"" what is supposed to be a bonding victory-lap turns out to be a war zone of passive aggression. For anyone who has traveled with friends, this is a painfully accurate portrait. Travel experts and therapists agree that vacations have the propensity to fracture relationships, and even the deepest connections are a trip away from potential ruin.

'I felt like she was shaming me for not spending more money'

One reason for this unfortunate phenomenon is that many of the guardrails that everyday life provides disappear when you travel, says Eman Almusawi, a therapist at A Better Life Therapy. ""Friendships rely on a balance of closeness and personal space,"" Almusawi says. ""When that balance is thrown off, especially on vacation, people might respond in ways that catch us off guard."" Routines help us manage our emotions and, as a result, protect our relationships. ""When we're out of our usual environment, it's easy for our friends, and even ourselves, to slip into what therapists call the 'adaptive child' mode — where we act from a more emotional, less controlled place,"" Almusawi says. Christie Tate experienced this firsthand when she and a friend traveled from Chicago to San Francisco in 2023. Tate, 51, is a writer and authored the book ""BFF: A Memoir of Friendship Lost and Found."" The tension started before they even reached the Bay Area. Tate's friend has ""a lot more resources"" and decided to fly first class while Tate opted for economy. Her friend also booked them a hotel that was out of Tate's budget. And money is an infamously taboo topic among friends. ""I find that anything I can't talk about in relationships gets gummy and becomes toxic,"" Tate says.

When the two landed, Tate expressed that she felt judged for spending less and her friend felt judged for wanting to spend more. ""I felt like she was making it a moral issue and she felt like I was making a moral issue,"" Tate says. ""I felt like she was shaming me for not spending more money. The facts are I don't have that kind of money."" This became a pain point for the entire trip. How much money each of them was willing to spend on transit, meals, museum tickets, excursions, all had to be discussed. ""Expectations butt up against reality and that's painful,"" Tate says. ""You feel like, 'I took the time off work and I spent all this money. It should be smooth sailing.' It's not realistic and you add in other people and their expectations and their bank accounts and it's bound to crash."" Ultimately, Tate says she gained some important communication skills, but also realized that isn't what she wanted to be doing on a vacation. ""In retrospect, the challenges that came up were really important and enriched me as a person,"" she says. ""But that's not fun. It's not fun to be enriched and grow."" While the two friends keep saying they should do another trip together, they ""haven't pulled the trigger,"" Tate says.

'A good trip is just a really heightened experience of life'

Despite vacations being the site of relational turmoil, they also facilitate the type of bonding that can only really happen when you're out of your comfort zone. Tour guide Danielle Oteri has navigated dozens of group trips through southern Italy and New York City, and they're all typically made up of the same archetypes: the planner, the drinker, the one who is quietly boiling with resentment. ""I've seen some lunatics,"" she says. But the friction is often punctuated with extraordinarily fun moments, ones you don't get in your day-to-day. ""A good trip is just a really heightened experience of life,"" Oteri says. ""With that it can also really put pressure on people's weak points or their attitude or their reluctances. What's best about that person and what's worst about that person is probably all going to occur."" In ""The White Lotus,"" we see this all play out during the full moon festivities. These three women are desperately grasping to have an experience they can't have at home, and in doing so all of their best and worst qualities surface.

https://cnbc.com,Ramp up portfolio income – and save on taxes – with these assets,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/ramp-up-portfolio-income-and-save-on-taxes-with-these-assets.html,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","With Tax Day approaching and investment returns harder to come by of late, how much you save on taxes can boost your portfolio's performance and income. A strategic approach toward managing a portfolio's taxes – namely tax-loss harvesting and tax deferral – can help lift after-tax returns by about 2% per year, according to Neuberger Berman . The boost is known as tax alpha. Tax-loss harvesting refers to strategically pruning losing positions to realize losses and offset capital gains elsewhere in your portfolio. You don't have to be a million-dollar investor to realize the benefits of these strategies – or to make missteps that could cost you money at tax time. ""This is a broad generalization, but most people have no idea how their portfolio impacts their taxes,"" said Catherine Valega, certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Green Bee Advisory in Burlington, Mass. ""Most people have no idea how their assets work and combine to relate into what their tax bill will be."" Using income now or later The tools you need to manage the taxes paid now and in the future include taxable brokerage accounts, tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) plan or individual retirement account) and tax-free accounts (including your Roth IRA). Which of these accounts you choose for your income-generating holdings will depend on your priorities, according to Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar. ""To the extent you prioritize income producers, you'll want to focus your attention on your tax-sheltered vehicles in an effort to avoid having to pay taxes on those distributions,"" she said. Tax-deferred accounts, for instance, might be a great place to keep high-yield and corporate bonds and the funds holding them. That's because the interest income they produce is subject to ordinary income tax rates, which can be as high as 37%. Real estate investment trusts are generally another contender for tax-deferred accounts, due to the sizable dividend yields they offer. By holding them in an IRA, investors defer taxes on the dividends they receive until they begin withdrawing income. Dividend-paying stocks and funds may be contenders for taxable brokerage accounts, particularly if the dividends are taxed at the same rate as capital gains (0%, 15% or 20%) and the investor is planning on spending the money. ""You still get distributions year in and year out, so unless you're looking for spending money, even dividend-paying stocks may be better in a tax-sheltered account, where you aren't paying taxes year to year even at a lower rate,"" said Benz. Municipal bonds , which offer tax-free income at the federal level – and at the state level if the investor is a resident of the issuing state – could best belong in a brokerage account. However, Treasury bills could go in either taxable or tax-deferred accounts, depending on the time horizon and how the interest income is being used, Benz said. The tax-season sweetener for Treasury interest income is that it's subject to federal levies but exempt from state and local taxes. US1Y 1Y mountain U.S. 1-year Treasury bill yield over the past year. ""We went through periods where yields were so low for so long that nobody thought about the income they might've received, but if you're not using cash for living expenses, it may make sense to keep them in a tax-sheltered account,"" she said of T-bills. Consider that while the yield on the 1-year T-bill is well off the highs it hit last year when it surpassed 5%, it's still yielding roughly 4.1%. Managing taxes on portfolio income In addition to being mindful of asset location, Valega uses a strategy with her clients that's known as direct indexing . This entails buying the individual stocks of an index and then managing the portfolio to benefit from tax-loss harvesting by trimming losing positions and offsetting realized gains. For high-net-worth clients, she's been using portfolios of individual muni bond issues on the fixed income side. She prefers this over buying muni bond mutual funds or exchange traded funds, as her clients intend to hold onto their issues until maturity and would rather not be subject to the price swings seen in bond funds. She encourages investors to stash 12 months to 18 months of expenses in an emergency fund, and while this comes with a tax bill – interest from certificates of deposit and most money market funds is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income – it's not as much of a surprise as it might've been a year or two ago. ""Why are your taxes higher? Because you earned some nice income,"" said Valega. ""We are a year or two down that cycle, and people are starting to be aware that it's an issue, but it's a nice problem to have.""",cnbc

OpenAI expects revenue will triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, CNBC has confirmed.

Bloomberg was first to report on the revenue figure, which was confirmed to CNBC by a source familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the number is private.

Microsoft , OpenAI's principal investor and key strategic partner, recorded $13 billion in annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter, up 175% from a year earlier.

Earlier this week, OpenAI announced some key changes in the C-suite. CEO Sam Altman will shift his focus away from day-to-day operations and focus more on research and product, the company said, while operating chief Brad Lightcap's role will expand to oversee ""business and day-to-day operations.""

OpenAI is facing increased competition in generative artificial intelligence from other high-value startups such as Anthropic and Perplexity and tech giants including Google and Microsoft.

As of last month, SoftBank was set to invest $40 billion in OpenAI at a $260 billion valuation. Part of the funding is expected to be used for OpenAI's commitment to Stargate, the joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle announced by President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, OpenAI announced it would introduce native image generation within ChatGPT. The feature has begun rolling out to ChatGPT PLUS, Pro and Team users, as well as users of ChatGPT's free tier, when they use OpenAI's 4o model.

Market update: Stocks are getting hit Wednesday, putting the S & P 500 on pace to break its three-session win streak. Headlines around President Donald Trump preparing to announce tariffs on autos as soon as Wednesday may have caused the market's losses to accelerate. The S & P 500 has made a nice move off its recent bottom on March 13, but there is still a high level of uneasiness and uncertainty ahead of Trump's reciprocal tariffs expected on April 2. AI sell-off: Stocks tied to the buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure are getting hit the hardest Wednesday on concerns about tariffs, other trade restrictions, and new environmental rules out of China that would prohibit the use of Nvidia's H20 chips in data centers in favor of more energy-efficient technology. This could spell trouble for chip sales, but the bark is likely worse than the bite because Nvidia's chips have the highest compute power and are best equipped to handle the most demanding workloads. The impact of the rules also is unclear, based on the Financial Times story that first publicized their existence. The article indicated the rules were introduced last year, but to date have not been strictly enforced. The market remains hypersensitive to concerns about an oversupply of data centers. The group, which extends beyond chip makers to industrial companies like Club name Eaton and Vertiv , trades volatilely on every data point — both good and bad. On Tuesday, Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai warned about a potential bubble in the AI infrastructure buildout. Our pushback has been that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said new reasoning models like DeepSeek's RI consume 100 times more compute than non-reasoning AI models such as those that first underpinned early versions of ChatGPT. But that hasn't stopped fears of oversupply. A new analyst report from TD Cowen on data centers said portfolio holding Microsoft has once again canceled plans for new projects in the U.S. and Europe. It's a similar story from the same analyst who raised flags in late February about Microsoft pulling back its data center footprint. At the time, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC the company's plan to spend over $80 billion on infrastructure this fiscal year was on track. This latest report may be stoking fears about oversupply and excess capacity, but the note mentions Club names Alphabet and Meta Platforms took on some of the leases and capacity. Our takeaway from this is that any cancellation by Microsoft may be related to its evolving relationship with OpenAI and not as much as an industry call as the market is making it out to be. As part of Project Stargate , OpenAI is establishing a closer relationship with Oracle for some of its computing needs. If the market was oversold, we would be more interested in buying some of the AI data center buildout stocks like Broadcom or Eaton . However, the S & P Short Range Oscillator was a plus 1.92% after Tuesday's session, meaning the market was closer to overbought territory (plus 4% and higher) than oversold (minus 4% and lower.) The S & P Oscillator is our trusted momentum indicator that helps guide our decision to put money to work, or take some off the table when rallies look extended. Up next: The key earnings report after the closing bell Wednesday is Jefferies Financial Group . The investment bank's results and commentary will provide a look at the state of mergers-and-acquisition activity, as well as other capital markets action. That is all relevant for Club name Goldman Sachs . It's no secret that the rebound in M & A activity we expected at the start of the year has failed to materialize, but trading volumes have been strong. With the first major initial public offering of the year coming later this week from CoreWeave, we will soon see if the market has an appetite for new listings, which could lead to more companies going public.
