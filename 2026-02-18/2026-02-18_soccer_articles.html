                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tournament expected not to be held every two years Uefa is ready to back Fifa's proposed expansion of the Club World Cup to 48 teams for the next edition in 2029 in a sign of improving relations between their respective presidents, Aleksander Ceferin and Gianni Infantino. Real Madrid proposed a two-year cycle for the Club World Cup during talks with Fifa in Miami in June last year, although given the opposition from Uefa and all the domestic European leagues that idea has not progressed. In a related development, last week Real ended their five‑year legal battle with Uefa by withdrawing formally from the European Super League. They appear ready to fall in line with the global football establishment led by Infantino, Ceferin and Nasser al-Khelaifi, the Paris Saint‑Germain president who chairs European Football Clubs. Infantino then said in a speech at the general assembly of European Football Clubs in Rome last October that expansion was on the agenda, saying Fifa was working “to see how we can make this event bigger, even better, even more impactful”. Uefa's opposition was a potentially significant obstacle, but another remains with Fifa subject to legal action from the lobby group European Leagues that has been taken to the European Commission. While some at Uefa remain concerned that the huge financial rewards of the Club World Cup will have a destabilising effect on European football, an expansion to 48 clubs is regarded as less disruptive than making it a biennial event. Uefa's position is the latest sign of improved relations with Fifa, which reached a nadir when Ceferin and a group of European delegates including the Football Association chair, Debbie Hewitt, staged a walkout at Fifa congress in Paraguay last May in protest at the late arrival of Infantino, who had been on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East involving Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman. With Ceferin and Infantino likely to seek re-election for fourth terms next year, sources close to both men have indicated that a period of calm is in both their interests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There will be 111 days between the day the 2026 MLS season kicks off and the U.S. men's national team's World Cup opening match against Paraguay in Los Angeles, leaving many players scrambling for form and opportunity within that spell. Here, Sports Illustrated takes a look at five USMNT players to keep an eye on in MLS, at least early this season. He's been one of Pochettino's top MLS contributors and has had ample time under the Argentine manager since he earned a call into the 2025 January camp. The shift to a three-man backline with wingbacks also serves him well, and he could been seen as an invaluable national team player within months. Now close friends with German legend Thomas Müller, Berhalter enters this season as the heartbeat of Vancouver Whitecaps FC midfield, after racking up four goals and 11 assists in 29 regular-season games in 2025. His presence, particularly his set-piece delivery with the USMNT, also stood out, with a goal and three assists in nine caps. Among those highlights is a perfectly curled set-piece finish against Uruguay in a friendly and pinpoint free-kick delivery for Chris Richards's winning goal in Gold Cup play against Saudi Arabia. With Christian Pulisic's concerning bill of health at AC Milan, the USMNT needs someone who can deliver a potent set piece, and that looks to be Berhalter. All signs point to Matt Freese being the No. Freese's ability as a pure shot-stopping backstop makes him stand out. Still, he will want to maintain his consistency from 2025 and continue developing his skills as a distributor out of the back, which is a key factor for a three-man backline on the international stage. It's been quite the rise for a goalkeeper who only made his USMNT debut at 26 last June and went on to start all but one match over the rest of 2025, leading into the World Cup year. A two-time MLS All-Star and now the highest-paid defender in MLS on a new contract, he will look to establish himself as a starter for the Stars and Stripes and to enjoy another strong season with FC Cincinnati. The Eastern Conference won't be easy, and much of Cincinnati's focus remains on the central attacking pieces of Evander and Kévin Denkey. Still, Robinson's experience, skill and leadership at the back could be vital. He missed out on the 2022 World Cup due to a torn Achilles' tendon a few months before kickoff, adding a little more motivation to stay in and stay healthy through the start of the MLS campaign. There is every indication that Cristian Roldan will play a key role for the USMNT at the World Cup, given his impressive showings in each of the six fall friendlies, notably with a pair of assists against Australia last October. His best use, however, might just be kickstarting transitions, as he has done with the Sounders and USMNT as a defensive midfielder at times. Having experience playing at the 2022 World Cup won't hurt either, even if he didn't get any minutes at that tournament.

Philadelphia Union's Subaru Park will play a huge part in a team's preparations ahead of and during this summer's FIFA World Cup 2026 tournament.

Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations champion, will use Subaru Park as a team headquarters and one of its training bases during the 2026 World Cup tournament.

According to a Philadelphia Union news release, the Côte d'Ivoire 'Les Éléphants' will also train at the WSFS Bank Sportsplex in Chester, Pennsylvania.

Here's where to find Subaru Park, and if you can watch Côte d'Ivoire train and practice.

Subaru Park is located at 1 Stadium Drive in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

The WSFS Bank Sportsplex is on Seaport Drive in West Chester.

Most FIFA World Cup training and practice sessions are closed to the general public, but that rule may be relaxed as the tournament approaches.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup group stage will begin on Thursday, June 11 2026, and run through Sunday, July 19.

Canada, Mexico and the United States are 2026 FIFA World Cup host countries.

According to FIFA, Lincoln Financial Field in South Philadelphia is set to host six 2026 FIFA World Cup matches, including two matches featuring Côte d'Ivoire:

Travel rental platform Airbnb is rolling out a $750 incentive to attract new hosts in the 16 North American cities gearing up to welcome millions of visitors for the FIFA World Cup in mid-2026.

New “entire home” hosts who successfully fulfill their first guest stay between now and July 31 will qualify for the payout under the program, Airbnb said, describing it as the company's largest-ever incentive for new hosts.

Last month, FIFA said it received more than 500 million ticket requests for the 2026 World Cup during a 33-day application window.

Demand for lodgings during the FIFA World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, has been skyrocketing. 

On match days, vacation rental prices are up as much as 50% from a year ago in some host cities, according to travel data firm AirDNA.

Airbnb expects hosts in the New York-New Jersey area, Boston and Los Angeles to earn the most during the tournament, projecting per-host earnings above $5,000 in all three markets.

Beyond the three host nations, FIFA received most ticket applications from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.

The World Cup could provide a much-needed boost to US international inbound travel demand, which was down 5.4% through November 2025, per the US National Travel and Tourism Office.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Premier League striker Dave Kitson has revealed he was the 'Secret Footballer', a pseudonym he used to pen articles and books during his playing career without revealing his identity. The series focused on what goes on behind the scenes in elite-level football, with topics ranging from matchdays to transfers and contracts. Many punters attempted to unmask the author while he was still playing, but Kitson has now confirmed he was behind the phenomenon. 'The Secret Footballer' series created plenty of intrigue during its run, with fans fascinated by the insights provided in a weekly newspaper column which often shedded light on the more frustrating aspects of professional football. Five books were also published under the pseudonym, some of which were written as memoirs, but the secrecy of the author often prompted debate among supporters. Groups were even formed online as people attempted to solve the mystery of his identity, but that has now come to an end with Kitson revealing he is the former Premier League striker who penned the books and newspaper columns. He would later turn out for the likes of Stoke City, Portsmouth, Sheffield United and Oxford United before retiring in 2015 after a brief spell with Arlesey Town. I've never said that out loud before. It was an idea that came to me when I wasn't happy with where football was going and I needed an outlet to express it for my own mental health. It helped me process what was going on in football. "It started as something that wasn't about naming names. It was about explaining what happens in the industry and why. "I would write and leave people to form their own opinions. Now everyone has a podcast and an outlet. "It changed football in this country and led to overhauls at the highest levels, which I'm proud of. But the stress and anxiety were immense." Kitson also spoke about how the death of Gary Speed in 2011 played a role in his decision to end his career as 'The Secret Footballer'. Speed, a former midfielder for Leeds United, Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers among others, was found dead at his home at the age of 42. Kitson said: "The worst thing that happened was when I wrote a column about mental health called 'Sometimes There's Darkness Behind the Light.' "Nobody talked about mental health in football then. I said there was a mental health epidemic and I predicted it was only a matter of time before someone took their own life. On Sunday, Gary Speed was found dead. That's when the Secret Footballer stopped being fun." Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Kitson has tried his hand at punditry since retiring as a player but now predominantly works as a motivational speaker in the mental health sphere. In 2020, the former striker apologised to Raheem Sterling having appeared to suggest the former Manchester City star had "made himself a target" for racism two years earlier. "And if he, or anyone, wants to discuss that matter with me, and what I intend to do, I'm more than happy to have that chat and put his mind – and that of other players - to rest."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Outrage is spreading in the US as reports claim a 2030 World Cup host nation plans to kill roughly three million stray dogs, prompting boycott calls. Morocco was confirmed in 2023 as a co-host alongside Spain and Portugal, a decision that animal rights groups say has coincided with an alleged campaign to cull stray dogs in several cities. In Defense of Animals, a US-based advocacy group, said: 'These wounded, terrified animals are hauled off to remote sites, where they are poisoned or shot and dumped in mass graves, many still alive. Images showing dogs bleeding, butchered and dying from gunshot wounds in the streets have circulated widely on social media, fueling calls among Americans for a boycott of the 2030 World Cup. Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator, called the allegations 'animal abuse,' adding: 'Every dog lover should BOYCOTT FIFA! Images showing dogs bleeding, butchered and dying from gunshot wounds in the streets have circulated widely on social media, fueling calls among Americans for a boycott of the 2030 World Cup A FIFA spokesperson told Daily Mail that during its bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup, Morocco emphasized its commitment to animal welfare, noting government efforts to expand clinics and support programs for stray dogs. FIFA also said it is working with the animal welfare group International Animal Welfare and Protection Coalition (IAWPC), which convened a global panel of senior legal and animal welfare experts to review Morocco's draft regulations; their recommendations have now been submitted to Moroccan authorities. Morocco's Embassy in London has denied the claims, insisting there is no cull of stray dogs and citing what it described as the country's commitment to humane and sustainable animal management. A spokesman said last year that Morocco launched a Trap, Neuter, Vaccinate, Release program in 2019 and is investing in clinics, veterinary services, and municipal hygiene systems, adding: 'It is entirely untrue that Morocco is planning to cull stray dogs ahead of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.' However, the IAWPC said it 'has documented widespread and systematic killings of both stray and owned dogs across Morocco, which it says are being carried out by so-called “death squads” in preparation for the country's role as co-host of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.' Les Ward MBE, Chairman of the IAWPC, said in a statement: 'These killings are taking place every single day, in full view of children, tourists, and local communities. Since the IAWPC campaign began, it has become clear to us and everyone else, that we are dealing with a slippery and untrustworthy government. An estimated three million stray dogs live on Morocco's streets Animal activist groups claimed to have seen documentation recording the dog killings 'They make claims that have no basis in reality, including that the killing has ended, when every Moroccan knows it is happening every single day.' The IAWPC has offered to help Morocco implement large-scale, humane dog population control strategies such as Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (TNVR), but says its repeated offers have been ignored. People need to boycott this FIFA World Cup in Morocco,' another X user posted. Hollywood actor Mark Ruffalo has also thrown his support behind the IAWPC campaign to stop the killings in an X post that reads: 'Killing millions of dogs to prepare for a global sporting event is not progress, it's a moral failure. Humane solutions exist, and choosing compassion over violence is a responsibility we all share.' By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Competition will be fierce with a strong roster going into the Cup Emma Hayes has called in her roster for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup and it gives a glimpse into the state of the USWNT heading into a year that will conclude with World Cup qualification. She called in a strong, experienced roster with no uncapped players and some key positions that can be solidified with good performances in the tournament. The players who are and are not included say a lot about those players and about how the team is shaping up this year. Some of the players who are not in the picture have been in recent callups or might have been expected to get a look for the Cup have some work to do in order to make future rosters. Bethune has some work to do if she wants to fit into the aggressive style Hayes needs in the midfield and for now will be sitting on the bubble when it comes to making the national team unless she steps up in the NWSL this year. Sophia Wilson - The striker isn't ready yet but that can change. Wilson is aiming for an NWSL opening day return but won't get a chance to train with the USWNT for the SheBelieves Cup. The striker depth is decent but with her skill and fit in Hayes' system well established, she can still be in the picture for upcoming callups. Some players are making a return after being absent from the team or did well enough in recent callups to earn a place on the team. Those spots are looking more solid but depth around the field will make claiming an ongoing role with the team a challenge. Jameese Joseph - The midfielder will have a chance for her third cap following her first international goal against Chile in January. She obviously did enough to get another look and it seems like Hayes wants to get a clear picture of options for striker this year. Claire Hutton - Hayes set high expectations for the midfielder in January and she has met them. The midfielder is here to stay. In general the midfield depth is a big strength of the team and the 20 year-old just made a huge move to Bay FC from the KC Current in a deal worth $1.1 million. It will be no surprise seeing her anchor the midfield throughout the Cup. That said, she has work to do to start over Claudia Dickey who made six starts in 2025 and one this year. What if our best soccer players were winter sports athletes? The soccer tournaments will once again be a nationwide affair. What a fun window for the WNT! Emma's dancing, Rodman's joy, and USWNT officially back after recent rout of Chile</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinity Rodman has stepped into 2026 with clarity, confidence, and a contract that reset the market. After weeks of uncertainty, her National Women's Soccer League future is secure with the Washington Spirit, thanks to a reported three-year deal worth $2 million annually — the highest salary in global women's soccer. And in her long-awaited return to the United States women's national soccer team, she didn't just blend in. Now, with coach Emma Hayes calling her back in for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup, Rodman is positioned as a central figure in the early build toward the 2027 World Cup. “I'm just motivated to be on the field as much as I can,” Rodman said after Spirit training in suburban D.C. “I've felt really good in national team camp [last month], and then coming into preseason [getting] a lot of minutes” in two friendlies. The idea of testing herself abroad was real. “There's also times where I'm like, ‘OK, I'm not ready to do something or I need to be in a stable situation, comfortable in the U.S.'” The internal tug-of-war was ongoing. Ultimately, unfinished business in Washington won out. “There's still more to do, and if I do make a big jump or a big decision like that, I want to feel like I've fully fulfilled what I want to do in D.C. before I'm bouncing around everywhere, if that makes sense.” It makes perfect sense for a player who won an NWSL title as a rookie in 2021, then landed on the losing side of the last two finals. “We have redeeming to do,” she said. Spirit coach Adrián González called her “super excited” in camp and emphasized how critical her return is not just for the club, but for the league's growth. The 23-year-old forward is no longer just a rising star. Through her performance, personality, and marketing power, she has become the face of U.S. soccer talent based in the U.S. Injuries limited her to 15 regular-season matches, two playoff appearances as a substitute, and one U.S. friendly. “With contract matters behind her, Rodman aims to have a year without interruption or distraction.” That means consistent minutes, chemistry with new teammates, and building toward Washington's March 13 opener against the Portland Thorns at Audi Field. “Having a lot of new faces this year and more internationals, there's still a lot of connections to be built in certain units on the field, so I'm excited to see those grow.” Close friend and U.S. teammate Croix Bethune was traded to the Kansas City Current after requesting a move. “We're very close friends, so I was just really sad about that, in general. She has to do what's best for her.” Then, with a grin, “Unfortunately, Kansas City. Off the field, Rodman found a rare scheduling sweet spot. Because Spirit camp timing aligned, she was able to attend boyfriend Ben Shelton's tournament in Greater Dallas, where he pushed toward his fourth tour title. “Him being able to win that conveniently on my off days was amazing,” she said with a smile. I'm 2-0 in semis when she shows up for that.” Rodman, ever practical, described their balance clearly. “We do really good at being there for each other, but also trying to be realistic at times where it's like, ‘OK, that's a little much. That's going to exhaust us,'” she said. “Yeah, big moments I try to show up for. Thankfully, I was there for Dallas, but we go with the flow.” Rodman enters her sixth professional season healthy, financially secure, and central to both club and country plans. The National Women's Soccer League needed to keep her. Now the focus narrows: SheBelieves Cup, NWSL redemption, and laying bricks toward 2027.

United States soccer star Christian Pulisic has earned the nickname “Captain America” in Italy as AC Milan's leading goal scorer last season and American fans are hoping he brings that energy to the U.S. national team during the World Cup in the summer. Reporting for TODAY, NBC's Peter Alexander sits down with Pulisic for a discussion about his early love for the sport, his first children's book “Christian's Soccer Superpowers,” and living out his dream in Italy.Feb. 18, 2026

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Soccer is poised to present a fiscal 2027 budget projecting record revenue of $397M, driven largely by this summer's FIFA World Cup in North America. That represents a 30% increase over the updated revenue forecast for fiscal 2026, which runs through March 31, and a 50% jump from fiscal 2025. The proposed FY27 budget, set to be presented for approval at U.S. Soccer's Annual General Meeting on Saturday in Atlanta, incorporates significant one-time World Cup revenue and expenses. Although the document does not break out gross tournament figures, it projects a net $5M investment tied to ticketing, hospitality, marketing campaigns, sporting preparation and player payments. Notably, World Cup legacy funds from FIFA have not been factored into the budget. U.S. Soccer has not publicly indicated how much it expects to receive from FIFA and said it lacks clarity on the timing and potential use restrictions. Commercial activity represents the largest share of budgeted revenue at $269M, including $227M from sponsorship, licensing and fan engagement. Sporting revenue, which includes projected World Cup prize money, is pegged at $21M. FIFA is distributing a record total of $655M to the 48 participating nations, with individual payments ranging from $9M to $50M depending on how far a team advances. Sponsorship income associated with the training center is included in commercial revenue. Overall, U.S. Soccer projects a $6M operating surplus after investment in fiscal 2027, more than three times the forecasted surplus for fiscal 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Noahkai Banks scored on his first Augsburg start, against Wolfsburg in October 2025 Adam Pretty/Getty Images You would not think it to look at him: calm under pressure, fierce in the tackle and every inch the imposing modern centre-back, but Noahkai Banks felt anxious flying to New Jersey last September. The teenager had been called into his first international camp with the USMNT, and suddenly — despite eye-catching Bundesliga appearances, praise from U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino and the confident demeanour that typifies him — he felt a flicker of self-doubt. “So I thought maybe the older guys would think, ‘Who's that? Players like (Christian) Pulisic and (Tim) Weah helped me a lot.” Banks might not have made it onto the field in the subsequent friendlies against South Korea and Japan, but he left the camp with an extra spring in his step and a head brimming with information. This included tips on positioning from former centre-back Pochettino, chats with veteran defender Tim Ream, and some great stories to tell the family WhatsApp group. Where some coaches may try to dampen down expectations, Pochettino took a different route. “I saw him playing in Germany and he's a massive talent,” the Argentine said. Little wonder, then, that Banks' progress with Augsburg in the Bundesliga — Germany's top flight — has continued since. Now 19, he is becoming one of the league's standout young players. His physical capabilities have meant that playing in a team battling to avoid being dragged into the relegation zone in his breakthrough season has not phased him. He even marked his first start for Augsburg in October with a goal in the third minute of a 3-1 win over Wolfsburg. Banks has not looked back since, starting the 16 subsequent league games bar one, when he was suspended against Bayern Munich, but he came straight back into the side thereafter. “I was so chill after, but the emotions were crazy. My mom was sitting in the first row, and I saw her crying. He spent his childhood in the Bavarian town of Dietmannsried, and grew up wanting to emulate Bayern Munich and Germany World Cup winner Jerome Boateng. At the age of seven, he joined Augsburg's academy. He ranks highly for “true” tackles per 1,000 opposition touches — a metric that combines tackles won, tackles lost, and fouls committed while attempting a tackle — to give an indication of how often a player looks to put their foot in and challenge. Combined with a high true interception rate, it paints the picture of an aggressive, front-footed defender who is proactive and does not shy away from a challenge. He is an outlet for his team and has good vision on the ball. Banks has drawn plaudits for his passing accuracy and has the best long-pass completion rate of any Bundesliga center-back to have played 900+ minutes this season. His calmness under pressure was evident during the 2-2 draw with Freiburg last month at Augsburg's WWK Arena. He quickly picked a pass upfield and delivered it perfectly to team-mate Fabian Rieder. His passing range is clear again in the images below. This time, he helped under-pressure Augsburg get up the field with purpose against Werder Bremen last December. In this passage of play, Banks spotted space for Robin Fellhauer and played a clever long pass that allowed the wing-back to get behind Bremen's back line and create a chance with a dangerous cutback. “It has been a great year so far, because I didn't expect to play that much, to be absolutely honest,” Banks says. Despite his abundant self-belief, he prefers not to talk too much about his chances of making this summer's World Cup, even with speculation growing that he may get another call-up for the friendly games against Belgium and Portugal next month. After that, Pochettino will begin to finalise his roster for June. “It's not the right moment to think about the World Cup for me, because we have a lot of games left here (at Augsburg),” he says. “So I really just focus — a lot of players say it, but I really mean it — on the games we have here. Until then, Banks says his attention is on Augsburg's campaign, while also keeping warm in a harsh German winter by spending rare days off indoors watching action films. “The Equalizer and Man on Fire because I love Denzel Washington,” he says. Don't rule out Banks becoming the leading man in a U.S. jersey before long.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Morocco is poisoning, shooting and burning stray dogs alive to clean the streets ahead of the 2030 World Cup, animal rights activists have alleged. Morocco has started killing stray dogs as part of a campaign linked to preparation for the 2030 World Cup. Weeks ago, reports emerged that the North African nation would cull more than three million dogs ahead of the sporting extravaganza. Animal rights activists alleged that this was being done to make the country appealing to tourists, fans and media during the World Cup, and dispel any negative image that is associated with strays. Now they claim that Morocco has started killing the dogs using brutal means. They allege the dogs are being caught through horrific means. Their bodies are then disposed of in mass graves. Marrakech has reportedly become the designated "kill centre" where dogs are being killed in warehouses. A local report published last month suggested that the dogs are taken to the facility, which has meat hooks and washable flooring, in vans where they are "processed". Some witnesses also alleged that in a few places, the dogs are being starved and then burned alive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(WHDH) - Foxboro town leaders are still waiting for the money to pay for security during the FIFA World Cup this summer. The select board refused to grant an entertainment license that would allow the World Cup to be played at Gillette Stadium. FIFA said they are not responsible, and the Boston 26 Host Committee said they have to wait for the federal government to pay them. “I've got to be honest with you, it baffles my mind that you guys are sitting here in front of me right now and we still have no idea where this money is coming from,” said select board member Mark Elfman. “We're not prepared to issue this license unless everything is in place,” said select board vice chair Stephanie McGowan. “I've seen people saying, ‘Oh, there's no way, they won't.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CHESTER, Pa. (WPVI) -- The national soccer team for Cote d'Ivoire, or Ivory Coast, will use the Philadelphia Union's stadium as its official training site during this summer's FIFA World Cup, bringing one of the tournament's elite squads to the Philadelphia region. Organizers said the decision marks a historic moment for Chester and the Delaware Valley as the team prepares for its first World Cup appearance since 2014. "It is a world-class facility for world-class athletes," said Meg Kane, the Philadelphia Soccer 2026 host city executive. We're thrilled," added Philadelphia Union President Tim McDermott. McDermott added Ivory Coast will have full access to both Subaru Park and the WSFS Bank Sportsplex. "We have built this facility to host things like this and bring in world-class powerhouses around the globe," he said. "The other part that's really exciting for us is the fans they will draw," she said. "One of things I love is their nickname, Les Elephants," she said. "Because it is symbolic to the animal that represents their nation, but also for strength and heritage, and I think that's something that resonates in our community." Ivory Coast is scheduled to play two matches in Philadelphia, including the city's opening game on June 14 against Ecuador. I think they will love Chester and Delaware County, and I think we will fall in love with them too."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Foxboro, Massachusetts is doubling down on its threat to cancel the FIFA World Cup matches at Gillette Stadium if it does not receive the security money needed to host the event. Seven games are set to be played at the stadium, called Boston Stadium for the tournament, including a quarter-final match. They are scheduled to start on June 13 and end in July. The town can't afford to front the $7.8 million needed for security and wait to be reimbursed later. We have to secure that facility for 39 days straight," said Bill Yukna, a member of the town's select board. The board explained that it will withhold the essential entertainment license until they are reimbursed several million dollars. Everyone thinks we have a football stadium in this town. But with that being said we're a small town. We have 18,000 people," said select board member Stephanie McGowan. "It comes down to sounding like Foxboro is being the bad guys here, but we really aren't. All we're trying to do is protect our citizens," Yukna said. "The White House task force is working on a daily basis to work with DHS and FEMA on that. We're being told it's expected any day now," said Boston 2026 Host Committee Chair Mike Loynd. Homeland Security is currently shut down due to government funding that lapsed on Saturday. It's unclear if that will have an impact on when the town can expect its own funding. FIFA officials deferred any questions about funding to the Boston Host Committee. When WBZ-TV asked the officials about the funding Tuesday evening, they said they were late to dinner. "I'm shocked you're not sitting here in front of us right now   saying 'We've got the money for you,'" said select board member Mark Elfman. The Foxboro Police Department, Massachusetts State Police and Boston Police were awarded a collective $11 million in grant funding to protect against "malicious drone activity" during the games and American 250 events.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FOXBOROUGH — The Town of Foxborough still can't get an answer to where its $7 million-plus in security outlays for this summer's World Cup games planned for Gillette Stadium is going to come from. And until they get their answer, the town's select board members made it quite clear at a Tuesday night meeting that their answer is a flat “no” to granting the entertainment license FIFA, the Kraft Group, and the Boston 26 host committee need to stage seven games over 39 days. “I've got to be honest with you, it baffles my mind that you guys are sitting here in front of me right now and we still have no idea where this money is coming from,” said select board member Mark Elfman to two FIFA representatives in attendance and Boston 26 host committee CEO Mike Loynd. “I'm shocked you're not sitting right here in front of us right now, saying, ‘We've got the money for you.' Kevin Clark, FIFA's head of venue operations for the Boston games, said his organization's role is to “work operationally with the stadium” and is “not in a position to comment on the financial requirements. A representative of the Kraft Group, which owns the stadium, was not there to speak on its behalf. The stadium and FIFA want to sign the lease that will allow their temporary landlord-tenant arrangement to activate. But that lease requires the town's issuance of an entertainment license. “You guys are still looking at us saying, ‘We don't know where it's coming from,' and we have townspeople who are saying, ‘There's two billion-dollar organizations that are running this, the Krafts and FIFA — what's the problem?' “And now we're coming around to where we've got to wait on grant money from the federal government. “We're not prepared to issue this license unless everything is in place,” said McGowan. “I've seen people saying, ‘Oh, there's no way, they won't [issue the license].' Select board member Debbie Giardino pointed out the obvious. “It just makes me a little concerned when the question was asked on where the money was going to come from, and both you guys are almost pointing at each other,” she said. “All we're asking for is a collaboration that gets us the answer as to ‘Who?' The next select board meeting is scheduled for March 3, with the license issuance deadline set for March 17.</p>
