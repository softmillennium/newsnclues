The survey, conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, also found strong connections between support for Christian nationalism and support for the Republican Party and President Donald Trump in particular. “I think the threat is (to) our democracy,” said Public Religion Research Institute CEO Melissa Deckman. Most Christian nationalists want America to be a theocracy ruled explicitly by biblical principles, often interpreted through a fundamentalist lens. Many also think only Christians should be able to hold political office. While the vast majority of Americans do not support Christian nationalist ideals, the survey found that about 11% of Americans are active Christian nationalists while another 21% are sympathizers. Researchers categorized most Americans — 64% — as either skeptics or rejecters of Christian nationalism. “But politically, why it's so important to measure is that we now have a political party where you have prominent Christian nationalists in charge right within the Republican Party, whether it's in the Trump administration, and, the executive branch, that really have disproportionate influence and folks like the speaker of the House is someone that would endorse this currently in Congress.” The findings were based on interviews with more than 22,000 adults conducted throughout 2025. Backers of the ideology were far more likely to express support for political violence than their fellow Americans. But ruby red Idaho has become a center for Christian nationalist thought, as the home of influential pastor Doug Wilson's, whose Christ Church and connected national education and church networks have helped shape a generation of far-right leaders. Wilson has called for America to be run as an explicitly Christian nation. Idaho-based pastor and writer Ben Cremer said that school of thought should worry Americans. “Every American would have their lives dictated by the set of beliefs by a single Christian sect, whether they aligned with those beliefs or not,” he said. “First, Jesus called us to love our neighbors as our selves — that is part of his greatest commandment to us,” he said. Secondly, it is carrying this harm out in the name of my sacred faith.” Christian nationalism, until recently a fringe ideology, has been in the spotlight in recent years, as Donald Trump has become receptive to the movement's ideas and even appointed some Christian nationalists to prominent positions. Deckman said if Americans want to see Christian nationalism banished to the fringes again, demographics are on their side. “I guess the answer is … voting,” she said. You know, younger Americans are more secular, they're less likely to be conservative Christians. I think it's just a matter of people voting right and getting enough people who are willing to challenge these kinds of viewpoints within the Republican Party.” Correction: This story was updated at 9:45 a.m. Feb. 17, 2026, to correct the percentage of Americans who sympathize with Christian nationalist ideals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Materials obtained in a FOIA request show ICE agents have grossly ignored their training this past year. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Use of force incidents reported to ICE spiked during the first two months of the second Trump administration despite agents receiving training on respecting individuals' constitutional rights, according to recently obtained documents. American Oversight, a nonprofit government watchdog group, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request last year, seeking information on the Trump administration's plan to escalate immigrant enforcement. The training materials also indicate that agents were also trained to respect constitutional rights of those who observed and documented  their activities, and that “citizens and noncitizens” could not be“stopped or detained by law enforcement without cause and/or a warrant,” including in their own homes. “Officers were advised that they must obtain a warrant before searching an individual or making an arrest, and that they are required to identify themselves as immigration enforcement ‘as soon as it is practicable and safe to do so' when making an arrest,” the report from American Oversight also noted.”The officers were told their badges should be ‘clearly displayed when making a stop for officer safety/liability,' but were advised they are not required to publicly identify themselves before making an arrest.” ICE agents and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration officers have failed to observe these rights on multiple occasions, forcing their way into homes without the proper documentation. The training materials also advised ICE agents that they could use “necessary and reasonable” force to quell “disruptive protesters” — but it also said that agents had a duty to attempt to deescalate the situation and issue warnings of arrest before doing so. The materials obtained by American Oversight also explicitly informed agents that they cannot enter into people's homes — including immigrants without documentation — without a judicial warrant, and advised that administrative warrants do not authorize agents to enter homes or businesses. Officers in these incidents shattered car windows, deployed chemical agents, used extreme physical force to detain people, and killed at least one individual. Despite ICE's increased use of force, the agency tended to ignore its own faults, focusing instead on prosecuting those who allegedly committed violence against agents. During that same period, 28 assaults on ICE agents were reported,” the report from American Oversight noted, adding that, in response to that smaller number, “the head of ICE's Office of Firearms and Tactical Program Use of Force Analysis Unit…suggested ways to increase prosecutions [against residents] in these instances.” “Officials did not make any similar comments on addressing the use of force by ICE officers, though there were more than twice as many of such incidents reported,” the report stated. As a result, Rahman ended up losing consciousness while in custody. But according to training materials, ICE agents are told to engage in use of force during vehicle stops only “where probable cause can clearly be established and there is some element of danger or threat.” Force should be “minimal,” and the manual explicitly states that agents do not receive “qualified immunity” for targeting people with “no immediate threat,” the documents state. “Be mindful of your words and actions when performing your duties in public as it is likely that bystanders are in possession of recording devices and generally have the right to record you,” the materials state. Yet there are several examples of ICE and other DHS agents retaliating against people who dare to record them, including wrongly telling those who are recording their actions that it is illegal to follow and document their on-the-job activities. Despite documented instances of ICE agents breaking the law and ignoring training materials, Trump administration officials have defended their actions as legal. Residents have been subjected to unnecessary violence from agents, resulting in people being “hospitalized, bystanders swept up in operations, and even the death of a U.S. citizen,” Chukwu told Politico, adding: “These records demonstrate a stark disconnect between the constitutional standards on which ICE claims to train its officers and the abusive and deadly enforcement practices we see detailed in these incident reports and on the streets of American cities in places like Minneapolis.” The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate candidate says campaign saw boost in 24 hours since Colbert said CBS told him not to air segment for fear of triggering FCC equal-time rule The outlet reported today that the Department of Transportation is drafting a law that would prohibit local jurisdictions from using federal transit money to assist undocumented migrants. “The change wouldn't stop undocumented immigrants from using public transportation,” Politico reports. “However, it would seek to prevent local agencies or towns from using public transportation to move unauthorized immigrants around the city or outside it to another state, a person familiar with the plan said.” Democratic voters are still lacking optimism about their political party since President Donald Trump's 2024 win, a recent poll reveals. Only around seven in 10 Democrats have a positive view of the Democratic party, the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found. Increasing negative views of Trump and other Republicans may help their party later this year. Several Democratic lawmakers will boycott Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday 24 February, and instead attend a rally on the National Mall. These include senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, as well as progressive representatives Pramila Jayapal and Greg Casar. In a statement, Van Hollen said that he would not attend the joint address to Congress next week. “Trump is marching America towards fascism, and I refuse to normalize his shredding of our Constitution & democracy,” he said. “You don't pay a person the amount of money that Wexner was paying Epstein for just financial advice. They were very close for a long period of time,” Garcia said of the 88-year-old billionaire who employed Epstein as a personal money manager for 20 years. “We have a lot of questions about the finances, the relationship, what Wexner knew, who Jeffrey Epstein also received money from, what was actually Wexner's larger involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell, and we hope those questions will be answered.” Garcia added that the questions from lawmakers to Wexner will be “pretty direct” during today's deposition. The lawmaker is also determined to understand why Wexner's name – along with those of other high profile men – were redacted in the justice department's latest release of documents. Why are we protecting Jeffrey Epstein's, essentially, benefactors?,” Garcia said. In an interview with MSNOW, Democratic congresswoman Jasmine Crockett addressed the claims from Stephen Colbert that CBS told him not to air a television interview with James Talarico, the Texas state lawmaker running for US Senate. Colbert said the decision stemmed from a concern that it would trigger a legal requirement to provide equal access to Talarico's campaign rivals – which includes Crockett. The congresswoman said that her team received a call from Paramount Skydance – CBS's parent company – who told her that Colbert could, in fact, move forward with airing the Talarico interview but would need to offer Crockett equal time. “I did not get a request from the Colbert show to go on … I've been on Colbert multiple times, and frankly, if we would have gotten an offer that would have been great, but we're in the middle of early voting, so I'm kind of focused on being in Texas at this moment,” Crockett told MS Now. Speaking to MS Now, Crockett added that she had “no love” for CBS News editor Bari Weiss, nor for the FCC chair Brendan Carr. “I think it probably gave my opponent the boost he was looking for so I think it's probably better than he didn't get on, and that they went straight to streaming.” Wexner is facing scrutiny for his association with Epstein – who served as his personal money manager from the mid-1980s until 2007, when Epstein was under investigation for sex crimes. He then stepped away from managing Wexner's personal finances. The businessman, who also owned Bath & Body Works, later discovered that Epstein had been mismanaging funds, and severed ties with him. While Wexner has vehemently denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, he is under renewed dissection after his name appeared in the latest tranche of documents released by the justice department, which showed a 2019 FBI document that listed Wexner as a co-conspirator of Epstein. The 88-year old has never been convicted of a crime, and maintains that he has cooperated with officials at each juncture of their investigations into Epstein, who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019. Last week, congressman Ro Khanna, revealed that Wexner's name was one of six high-profile men whose names were redacted in the latest document drop by the Department of Justice. Wexner will testify for lawmakers in New Albany, Ohio, and several Democratic members of the committee will hold a press conference after the deposition. “They asked me to turn on the water,” he said of a 1m sq ft warehouse nearby that the federal government recently purchased for $128m, with plans to use it for locking up as many as 10,000 detainees as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation plan. In a handful of locations – such as Ashland, Virginia and Kansas City, Kansas – local opposition appears to have thwarted such plans. Taylor contacted Jon Ossoff, a Democratic senator who has also opposed ICE's plans for the town, and Mike Collins, a Republican congressman who has told Taylor that the federal government will be in touch. A reminder that Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and then president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are representing the US at the talks in Geneva. This comes just weeks after Trump posted and deleted a racist video to social media that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama at apes. Also today, we'll hear from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who hold a briefing for reporters at 1pm ET. More than a dozen health and environmental justice non-profits have sued the Environmental Protection Agency over its revocation of the legal determination that underpins US federal climate regulations. Fifteen members of Congress have written to Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, demanding to know what steps the United States has taken in response to the mistreatment of a Palestinian-American teenager who spent nine months in Israeli detention. The letter, led by Senator Peter Welch and first seen by the Guardian, is centered around the case of Mohammed Ibrahim, a Florida resident who was 15 when Israeli soldiers arrested him during a raid on his family's West Bank home in February 2025. He was charged with throwing objects at moving vehicles before being released on 27 November following a guilty plea and suspended sentence, and was taken directly to hospital upon his return. In an interview with the advocacy group Defense for Children International – Palestine while still detained, Mohammed described receiving three small pieces of bread and a spoonful of yogurt for breakfast, with no dinner provided. “There has been case after case of Palestinians, including hundreds of children, swept up in the Israeli military justice system, where they are not only denied basic rights of due process but subjected to systematic physical and psychological abuse,” the lawmakers wrote in the 16 February letter. Court documents from the US District Court Southern District of Florida show judge Roy K Altman set a trial date of 15 February next year. Unless instructed otherwise by subsequent order, the trial and all other proceedings in this case shall be conducted in Courtroom 12-4 at the Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. U.S. A US immigration judge has blocked the deportation of a Palestinian graduate student who helped organize protests at Columbia University against Israel's war in Gaza, according to US media reports. Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested by immigration agents last year as he was attending an interview to become a US citizen, AFP reported. Mahdawi had been involved in a wave of demonstrations that gripped several major US university campuses since Israel began a massive military campaign in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas militants' deadly 7 October, 2023 attack. A Palestinian born in the occupied West Bank, Mahdawi has been a legal US permanent resident since 2015 and graduated from the prestigious New York university in May. He has been free from federal custody since April. In an order made public on Tuesday, Judge Nina Froes said that President Donald Trump's administration did not provide sufficient evidence that Mahdawi could be legally removed from the United States, multiple media outlets reported. Americans believe that wealthy and powerful people are rarely held accountable, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found after the release of millions of records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's connections in elite US business and political circles. Some 69% of respondents in the four-day poll, which concluded on Monday, said their views were captured “very well” or “extremely well” by a statement that the Epstein files “show that powerful people in the US are rarely held accountable for their actions.“ Among both Republicans and Democrats, more than 80% said the statement described their thinking at least somewhat well. CBS earlier this week attempted to address Stepen Colbert's allegations about a corporate mandate not to broadcast the James Talarico interview. “Let's just call this what it is,” he said on Monday. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. We start with FCC commissioner Anna M Gomez criticizing CBS for what she called “corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech”. Her comments follow talkshow host Stephen Colbert accusing the Trump administration and CBS of censorship after he said the network told him not to air a television interview with a Texas Democrat running for Senate. This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech. The FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes or to create a climate that chills free expression. On his show, Colbert told viewers of the Late Show that network lawyers told him he was also prohibited from talking about their refusal to air his interview with James Talarico, a Texas state representative seeking his party's nomination to challenge the Republican incumbent, John Cornyn, for a Senate seat in November. “He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said, stemming from a concern that it would trigger a legal requirement to provide equal access to Talarico's campaign rivals. Donald Trump's former receptionist, Chamberlain Harris, 26, will be sworn in on Thursday as the newest member of the US Commission of Fine Arts, just in time to review his ballroom plans. Police officers “surrounded and arrested a man who ran toward the U.S. Capitol with a loaded shotgun” on Tuesday, the United States Capitol Police said. A US immigration judge has ended the Trump administration's efforts to deport Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian green-card holder and Columbia University student who helped lead protests at the school over the Israeli assault on Gaza After Republican congressman Randy Fine posted an Islamophobic comment to social media over the weekend, the backlash from Democrats has been swift.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the Florida Legislature ramps up efforts to rename the Palm Beach International Airport after President Donald Trump, a recent trademark filing has some state lawmakers wondering if the Trump family is looking to profit. But some Democrats raised concerns about related trademark applications that were filed last week by the private entity that handles licenses and trademarks for the Trump Organization. Democratic Florida state Rep. Shevrin Jones was initially on board with the name change and supported it in a committee vote, saying he would have done the same for a Democratic president. But he said the trademark application was one of the two things that changed his mind (the other being the racist video recently posted and deleted on Trump's Truth Social account, which depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes). “No president, Democrat or Republican should be able to benefit” from an airport trademark license, Jones said. Jones quickly filed an amendment to explicitly prevent the Trump Organization from profiting off the trademark, but it failed. “To be clear, the President and his family will not receive any royalty, licensing fee, or financial consideration whatsoever from the proposed airport renaming,” said Kimberly Benza, Trump Organization director of executive operations. She stressed that the Florida bill requires a license agreement from The Trump Organization but that they are “willing to provide this right to his hometown county at no charge.” Still, the trademark applications for “DONALD J. TRUMP INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT,” “PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT” and “DJT” raised eyebrows, given Trump's known interest in renaming buildings, train stations or airports after himself, the broad scope of the applications and the potential for his family to profit. The trademark application is unusual — hubs named for leaders like Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy or Bill and Hillary Clinton were not protected with trademark filings by the former presidents or their families, trademark attorney Josh Gerben told CNN. “Normally, the private individual who's being honored isn't protecting his or her name as a trademark,” Gerben said. Plus, the trademark includes a lengthy list of goods and services that would fall under its purview. It includes watches, clocks, jewelry, clothing, collectible coins, tie clips, belts, restaurants, airport baggage check-in, airport construction and “plastic slippers used in the airport environment when going through security to keep feet and socks clean.” Benza did not respond when asked to clarify whether the Trump Organization would collect any royalties or licensing fees related to merchandise specifically. That includes preventing infringement on third-party platforms and setting quality standards in connection with the brand. Trump has also specifically pitched renaming Washington's Dulles International Airport after himself, as well as New York's Penn Station, CNN previously reported. North Carolina GOP Rep. Addison McDowell introduced legislation to rename Dulles after Trump, which was cosponsored by a handful of Republicans and is still under discussion, according to a staffer of a member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. But those efforts could be complicated by the Palm Beach airport renaming, since two airports named after Trump could cause significant confusion. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Josh Gerben's name.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A New York-based NGO has  launched a global initiative to rename the nation's overseas  missions, most of which operate under the name "Taipei," to  "Taiwan Representative Office (TRO)," according to a news  release. Speaking at the event, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Huang Jie (黃捷) said she  believed this renaming campaign would enable the  international community to see Taiwan clearly without the  constraints of an ambiguous identity. Taipei City  Councilor Miao Po-ya (苗博雅) said the use of "Taipei" in the nation's overseas  missions is a lingering irony of history. The "Taipei" label was once used to avoid political  sensitivity, and it is now time for a change amidst evolving  global geopolitics, said Miao, who was also in attendance. "Taiwan is a de facto country," Miao said, adding it  deserves a name that can accurately reflect its national  standing and strength. Most of Taiwan's overseas missions in countries without  formal diplomatic ties use the "Taipei" designation --  primarily as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office  (TECO). There are, however, a few exceptions, notably in  Lithuania, where the mission is officially titled the  Taiwanese Representative Office. Earlier this month,  Lithuania's Prime Minister Inga Ruginien? A total lunar eclipse coinciding with the Lantern Festival on March 3 would be Taiwan's most notable celestial event this year, the Taipei Astronomical Museum said, urging skywatchers not to miss it. Taiwan would be able to observe one of the lunar eclipses in its entirety on March 3. The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) yesterday held a ceremony marking the delivery of its 11th Anping-class offshore patrol vessel Lanyu (蘭嶼艦), saying it would boost Taiwan's ability to respond to Beijing's “gray zone” tactics. Ocean Affairs Council Deputy Minister Chang Chung-Lung (張忠龍) presided over the CGA event in the Port of Kaoshiung. Designed for long-range and protracted patrol operations at sea, the Lanyu is a 65.4m-long and 14.8m-wide ship with a top speed of 44 knots (81.5kph) and a cruising range of 2,000 nautical miles (3704km). The US should cancel the US visas or green cards of relatives of KMT and TPP lawmakers who have been blocking the budget, Grant Newsham said                                        A retired US Marine Corps officer has suggested canceling the US green cards and visas of relatives of opposition Taiwanese lawmakers who have been stalling the review of a proposed NT$1.25 trillion (US$39.7 billion) special defense budget.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Delta Air Lines flight from Houston to Atlanta made an emergency landing early Wednesday after a passenger tried to access the cockpit, the pilot told air traffic controllers. Delta flight 2557, a Boeing 717 aircraft, had just taken off from Houston's Hobby Airport when the pilot declared an emergency. Eight-five passengers and five crew members were on board, according to Delta. “We had a passenger get up and try to access the cockpit,” the pilot can be heard in a radio recording with air traffic control captured by Broadcastify. “Can you coordinate and have security standing by?” “(He is) in cuffs in the back of the aircraft, but he did assault another passenger, so we would like that other passenger checked out,” the pilot told air traffic control. In 2025, there were 1,621 unruly passengers reported to the Federal Aviation Administration. Wednesday, the plane signaled an emergency using its transponder and landed back at Hobby Airport about 17 minutes after taking off. The police are there waiting,” an air traffic controller told emergency responders. Delta later told CNN that the passenger “approached crew and customers but did not make contact with or attempt to access the flight deck.” “The safety of our customers and crew is paramount, and Delta has zero tolerance for unruly behavior,” the airline said in a statement. “We apologize to our customers for this experience and delay in their travels.” The flight later took off again and arrived in Atlanta about 90 minutes behind schedule.</p>

Denmark's Prime Minister said on Friday that she and her Greenlandic counterpart held a constructive meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but warned that Trump's desire to acquire Greenland hadn't changed. Canada and France set to establish diplomatic presence in Greenland amid Trump threats King Frederik will later on Wednesday visit a school and the headquarters of Denmark's Joint Arctic Command in Nuuk, as well as Royal Greenland, the island's largest company and seafood producer. The Danish royal family traditionally makes annual visits to Greenland, often appearing in the island's national dress, which includes a white anorak for men and an elaborate beaded collar in bright colours for women, as well as sealskin boots. King Frederik has spent extended periods of time in Greenland, including a four-month expedition on the island's ice sheet. On Thursday, the King will visit Maniitsoq on the west coast, around 140 km north of Nuuk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moscow will consistently continue to support Havana in protecting its sovereignty and security, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, opening talks with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla. He also called Washington's actions against Havana unacceptable. Parrilla said that his country is committed to joint projects and agreements with Moscow, despite all difficulties. Russia calls on the United States to "show common sense, a responsible approach, and ditch plans for a naval blockade" of Cuba, Lavrov said. He called the US actions against Cuba and statements about Russian-Cuban relations unacceptable. Moscow "categorically rejects" far-fetched accusations of cooperation between Russia and Cuba as allegedly posing threats to the United States or other countries, Lavrov said. According to him, Russia will "consistently continue to support Cuba" in protecting its "sovereignty and security." According to him, Cuba will continue to "resolutely move forward in protecting its independence and sovereignty," maintain its course, and seek effective solutions for the economy. Cuba "will always be ready for a respectful dialogue on equal terms with any country," he said. Parrilla said that Havana will stick to the joint projects and agreements with Moscow, despite the difficulties.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Zuckerberg will testify in an unprecedented social-media trial that questions whether Meta's platforms deliberately addict and harm children. Meta's CEO is expected to answer tough questions on Wednesday from attorneys representing a now 20-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, who claims her early use of social media addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Zuckerberg has testified in other trials and answered questions from Congress about youth safety on Meta's platforms, and he apologized to families at that hearing whose lives had been upended by tragedies they believed were because of social media. This trial, though, marks the first time Zuckerberg will answer similar questions in front of a jury. Social-media companies stand trial in pair of landmark cases starting this week The case, along with two others, has been selected as a bellwether trial, meaning its outcome could impact how thousands of similar lawsuits against social media companies would play out. Much of Mosseri's questioning from the plaintiff's lawyer, Mark Lanier, centred on cosmetic filters on Instagram that changed people's appearance – a topic that Lanier is sure to revisit with Zuckerberg. He is also expected to face questions about Instagram's algorithm, the infinite nature of Meta' feeds and other features the plaintiffs argue are designed to get users hooked. Meta is also facing a separate trial in New Mexico that began last week. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Assistant to hard-left parliamentarian among those held over fatal attack on 23-year-old Quentin Deranque Eleven suspects, including a parliamentary aide to France's hard-left party, have been arrested in connection with the killing last week of a far-right activist in an incident that has shocked the country and laid bare its deep political divisions. Quentin Deranque, 23, died on Saturday after sustaining a severe brain injury. The Lyon prosecutor, Thierry Dran, said he had been “thrown to the ground and beaten by at least six individuals” during an incident last week. Hassan and other members of LFI have condemned the killing. The first wave of arrests was announced late on Tuesday, as Dran said nine suspects had been arrested. Those detained included people who were suspected of having participated in the violence and others who had provided support to them, sources told Agence France-Presse. Hours later, two more suspects were arrested: a man who the prosecutor said was suspected of being directly linked to the violence as well as his partner, who was suspected of trying to help him evade justice. As videos of last week's deadly confrontation continued to circulate on social media, Mélenchon called for calm. Images broadcast by TF1 of the alleged attack showed several people hitting three others who were lying on the ground, two of whom managed to escape. One witness told AFP: “People were hitting each other with iron bars.” Némésis, the anti-immigration collective linked to Deranque, has blamed the killing on La Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist youth group co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament. La Jeune Garde – which was dissolved in June – has denied any links to the “tragic events” and Arnault has called the killing “horrific”. “It is essential that the perpetrators of this ignominy be prosecuted, brought to justice and convicted. Hatred that kills has no place among us,” he wrote on social media.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine has imposed a new package of sanctions against Belarus's leader, Alexander Lukashenko, for helping Russia to sustain its war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 18. We will work with our partners so that this has a global effect," Zelensky said. Russia reportedly deployed a network of drone-control relay systems in Belarus in late 2025 that expanded its ability to strike northern Ukrainian oblasts, including Kyiv and Volyn. These systems enabled some attacks on energy and rail infrastructure that otherwise "would not have been possible," according to Zelensky. More than 3,000 Belarusian companies, Zelensky added, are supplying Russia with machinery and components, including parts used to manufacture missiles. Russia is also building infrastructure on Belarusian territory for the future deployment of its Oreshnik missile, which Zelensky noted was "an obvious threat not only to Ukrainians but to all Europeans." "Lukashenko has for quite some time been trading Belarus's sovereignty for the continuation of his personal power, helping the Russians circumvent global sanctions over this aggression, actively justifying Russia's war, and now further increasing his own participation in scaling up and prolonging the war," Zelensky said. The move to punish Lukashenko for aiding Russia's war effort has come amid U.S. President Donald Trump's easing of some U.S. sanctions against Belarus.

WASHINGTON, February 18. /TASS/. US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff has announced significant progress in negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement on the social network X following the conclusion of the first day of trilateral discussions in Geneva.

According to Witkoff, the United States "moderated a third set of trilateral discussions with Ukraine and Russia." He also stated that the "success [of the current US administration] in bringing both sides of this war together has brought about meaningful progress." "Both parties agreed to update their respective leaders and continue working towards a deal," Witkoff declared.

A source in the Russian delegation told TASS earlier that the participants in the trilateral talks on Ukraine in Geneva had agreed to continue contacts tomorrow. According to the source, today's six-hour talks were very tense.

A new round of trilateral talks on Ukraine involving Russia, the United States, and Ukraine began in Geneva on Tuesday. The Russian delegation is led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.</p>
