                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Apollo III continues FutureBit's mission to decentralize hash power through low-power, individual-focused systems. Founder John Stefanopoulos highlighted the device's role in strengthening Bitcoin decentralization, referencing the company's 2024 milestone of mining a modern-era sovereign solo block. “In 2024, our customers mined one of the first modern- era sovereign solo blocks, sending shockwaves through the industry and proving that industrial scale wasn't a prerequisite for meaningful participation in Bitcoin,” Stefanopoulos said. Key specifications include up to 18 TH/s in Turbo Mode, up to 15 J/TH efficiency in Eco Mode, an integrated full Bitcoin node with solo mining capability, and a desktop‑class controller featuring 8 ARM cores, 8 GB RAM, and a 2 TB SSD. Designed for continuous operation in a home or office, Apollo III provides more than 10 TH/s while consuming power similar to standard household electronics. FutureBit's Apollo line of home Bitcoin miners, including the Apollo II with 10 TH/s and a full Linux node, makes mining at home accessible while promoting network decentralization. While home mining is no longer competitive for profit, it offers privacy, education, and the ability to verify balances without relying on third parties. Home miners can contribute to decentralization both geographically and in block template diversity, reducing the influence of large industrial pools and potential regulatory capture. By empowering individuals to mine and run their own nodes, FutureBit seeks to foster a more resilient, distributed, and user-controlled Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Magazine is published by BTC Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum co-founder recently shared a blog post about Iran's surveillance state. He used it to make a broader point about freedom and technology. His comments come as tensions between the US and Iran are heating up fast. Buterin says freedom advocates are making a mistake. Calling something dystopian sounds like an aesthetic complaint, not a real argument. This is a good post on the impact of surveillance in Iran:https://t.co/TzSqUE2JOo IMO one mistake that freedom advocates often make is that we talk about privacy violation and surveillance as "dystopian", using the word as a semantic stop sign: we know it… Governments with total surveillance can stay in power forever. They only need a small group of loyalists with weapons and technology. Small coalition governments, he noted, are the most dangerous kind. Buterin sees privacy technology as part of the solution. He called basic internet, around 1 Mbps, a global human right. In his view, it should sit outside nation-state control. Crypto tools that protect privacy can reduce the risk of total government control. Buterin pointed out that US and Israeli tech companies also run surveillance operations. Iran, Russia, and China focus on deep control within their borders. Western surveillance is broader but spreads across the globe. Both types pose serious threats to individual freedom. The Kobeissi Letter reported on X that Axios revealed evidence of an imminent US-Iran conflict. The expected campaign would be far larger than recent operations. Over 150 military cargo flights have already moved weapons to the Middle East. Oil prices jumped above $64 per barrel on the news. War in a major oil-producing region tends to shake global markets hard. Weeks-long "full-fledged" war unlike the Venezuela operation, sources say Historically, geopolitical crises push investors toward safe-haven assets. Bitcoin has increasingly played a similar role in some portfolios. A prolonged US-Iran war could drive more interest in decentralized assets. At the same time, market fear can trigger sell-offs across all asset classes, including crypto. Crypto, Vitalik argues, is not just a financial tool.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 network, Base, is changing the technology that powers it, stepping back from relying on Optimism's OP Stack, the toolkit it originally launched on. In a blog post titled “The Next Chapter for Base,” the team said it plans to take more control over its own code and infrastructure. Instead of depending on multiple outside teams for key upgrades and changes, Base will consolidate everything into a Base-managed codebase. In simple terms, Base was built using Optimism's technology, but now it wants to steer more of its own ship. Optimism is a layer-2 blockchain on top of Ethereum that aims to reduce settlement times and transaction costs. The company said it will still work with Optimism for support and will remain compatible with OP Stack standards during the transition. For everyday users and developers, nothing should immediately change. "This unification does not mean Base will be built in isolation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the crypto industry intensifies its focus on Layer 2 scalability and privacy-enhancing solutions, Blockchain DMD's development team published a comparative architectural review of its newly launched V4 mainnet and widely adopted zero-knowledge proof systems. DMD Diamond, originally founded in 2013, recently deployed its V4 mainnet built on Honey Badger BFT (HBBFT) consensus combined with POSDAO governance. According to the announcement, while ZK rollups and privacy protocols are gaining momentum, they depend on a secure, decentralized, and cost-efficient base layer — a role Blockchain DMD states DMD Diamond is engineered to fulfill. The analysis outlines several fundamental distinctions between DMD Diamond's Layer 1 architecture and zero-knowledge technologies: Zero-knowledge systems, by contrast, rely on mathematical cryptographic proofs that validate information without revealing underlying data. These solutions are typically deployed on top of existing base-layer networks. Rather than framing zero-knowledge technologies as competitive alternatives, Blockchain DMD's announcement emphasizes interoperability and synergy. The technical analysis identifies three primary advantages DMD Diamond offers to ZK-based applications: The company stated that the analysis is part of a broader initiative to position DMD Diamond as an infrastructure optimized for high-performance decentralized applications requiring security, fairness, and scalability. Founded in 2013, DMD Diamond is one of the longest-running Layer 1 blockchains focused on security, interoperability, and decentralized governance. The ecosystem is community-driven, with stakeholders collectively guiding protocol development and long-term strategic direction.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence will take white-collar workers' jobs and threaten to crash the US economy, which Arthur Hayes says will pave the way for Bitcoin to reach a new record high. In his latest missive, the Maelstrom chief investment officer argues that large language models from OpenAI and Anthropic will push office workers out of their jobs and trigger a financial downturn, as those workers fail to repay their loans. Eventually, that will force the Federal Reserve to step in and print money to avoid deflation spiralling out of control, Hayes argues. When that happens, Bitcoin is set to hit a new all-time high. “Deflation is bad, but ultimately good for fiat credit-sensitive assets like Bitcoin,” Hayes wrote in his Tuesday blog. His forecast may serve as a slight balm for investors who've been burned by the market downturn that has shaved 45% Bitcoin's price since it reached its $124,000 record in October. During that time, the overall crypto market has lost about half of its total value, or $2 trillion. Companies will replace white-collar workers with AI tools, which means those workers will be unable to pay their debts. If enough of them default on their loans, banks will suffer roughly $527 billion in losses, per Hayes' estimates. “This will be a rerun of the regional bank crisis in early 2023 that destroyed three banks in a fortnight,” Hayes wrote. As the crisis continues, traders will likely dump their stocks to avoid being swept up in the banking crisis, which will cause the stock market to collapse, Hayes argues. To be sure, the BitMEX co-founder doesn't say this will happen tomorrow or maybe not even this year, only that he believes it will happen. Hayes has form when it comes to making bullish Bitcoin bets. In the past, he's predicted that Bitcoin will pump thanks to the Fed printing money to bail out its Japanese counterpart, the central bank's Reserve Management Purchases programme, falling mortgage rates, and commercial banks lending to strategic industries. In January, he also suggested that the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro would give the US access to the Latin American country's oil, which would keep inflation down and give the Fed an excuse to cut interest rates. Low interest rates usually incentivise investors to bet on riskier assets like Bitcoin. In December, he predicted that Bitcoin's price would reach $200,000 by March.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We are pleased to announce that two further individuals have been convicted following our extensive investigation into the unlawful accessing and sale of personal information obtained from over 400 garages across the UK, as well as claims management and insurance companies. Munro, while working for two different companies during 2015 and 2016, accessed thousands of records without legitimate authority or consent, receiving payments totalling £16,000. He was charged with four offences: two under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and two under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998. He was also charged with four offences: two under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and two under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998. Both men pleaded guilty to all offences at an earlier hearing. Following this, both men appeared at Minshull Street Crown Court on 11 February 2026 where Chipoma was handed a 10 month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, as well as being ordered to complete 240 hours of unpaid work. This brings the total number of people prosecuted in our largest nuisance call investigation to 10. Three people have been cautioned in relation to this case. We welcome a guilty verdict in a trial related to the unlawful accessing and obtaining of people's personal information from vehicle repair garages to generate potential leads for personal injury claims. A jury at Bolton Crown Court this week found Craig Cornick, 40, of Prestbury, guilty of conspiracy to unlawfully obtain personal data contrary to the Data Protection Act. Earlier in the month, the jury returned a not guilty verdict for Cornick and Thomas Daly, 35, of Macclesfield, for a charge of conspiracy to access computer systems without authority contrary to the Computer Misuse Act. Cornick and Daly join six other men who had all previously pleaded guilty to the offences listed below: All the defendants are due to return to court on 11 July, where it is proposed Proceeds of Crime Act and cost issues will be discussed, with sentencing following at a later date. “Most of us have had nuisance calls asking if we've been in a crash. At best they're annoying but at worst they cause real upset and fear, especially to vulnerable people, and have a real impact on the businesses affected. This case uncovered a vast, murky criminal network where crash details were stolen from garages across England, Scotland and Wales and traded to fuel distressing predatory calls. This has been an enormous and complex case which has seen ICO staff use both technical expertise and investigative skills to work tirelessly to track down those responsible and hold them accountable on behalf of the public.” We initially started this investigation in 2016 when the owner of a car repair garage in County Durham contacted the regulator, saying he was worried his customers blamed him for the nuisance calls they were receiving about personal injury claims. The defendants were found to have conspired together between 2014 and 2017, where they accessed or obtained personal data of people from vehicle repair garages without their consent. We are pleased to announce that two further individuals have been convicted following our extensive investigation into the unlawful accessing and sale of personal information obtained from over 400 garages across the UK, as well as claims management and insurance companies. This means that most of the remaining data protection provisions of the Act have come into force, except for the requirement for organisations to have a complaints procedure which is due to commence on 19 June 2026 and some ICO governance provisions which will follow at a later date. We have fined MediaLab.AI, Inc. (MediaLab), owner of image sharing and hosting platform Imgur, £247,590 for failing to use children's personal information lawfully. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has opened formal investigations into X Internet Unlimited Company (XIUC) and X.AI LLC (X.AI) covering their processing of personal data in relation to the Grok artificial intelligence system and its potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content. We have reprimanded Staines Health Group for sending excessive medical details about a terminally ill patient to their insurance company. We have updated and enhanced our guidance on international transfers of personal information, making it quicker for businesses to understand and comply with the transfer rules under UK GDPR.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last updated on Feb 18, 2026 at 6:44 PM (UTC+4) Edited by Amelia Jean Hershman-Jones During the wild craze that was dubbed the next Bitcoin, Justin Bieber once bought a ‘Bored Ape' NFT for millions of dollars – but fast forward four years, and it's almost worthless. In a bid to recreate the Bitcoin boom that has made common tech gurus into billionaires, we've had schemes like Dogecoin, Metaverse tokens, and NFTs. The latter might be one of the biggest currency collapse stories we've had since Wall Street, though, as ultra-wealthy people poured a lot of money into these avatar-like mascots. One of those was Justin Bieber, who bought Bored Ape Yacht Club for $1,301,550 in January 2022, but it's now worth less than what it costs to get an oil change in his cars. Although Ferrari is trying to revive NFTs, the cryptocurrency fell flat on its face shortly after booming in 2022. Now, it's over 99 percent, as current NFT rates suggest that the BAYC avatar is worth just $12,000 today. The designers, Yuga Labs, were even sued for using celebrity endorsements, like Justin Bieber, in order to convince others to begin investing in the scheme. Snoop's token is worth $60,000 today, although his investment did reap rewards with a recent collection based on the celebrity, managing to raise $12 million. Gary Vaynerchuk's $4 million CryptoPunk token was the runner-up, now worth less than $50,000. It really was a huge investment blunder for everyone, all of whom could have had a similar fate to this Bitcoin investor if they chose the right pot to grow their money in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite small glimmers of hope for blockchain technology, from continued hype around stablecoins to sustained hope for market structure legislation, sentiment is at an all-time low, especially because there's no easy villain like Gary Gensler or Sam Bankman-Fried to blame for sinking prices. Amid the winter, the blockchain venture firm Dragonfly Capital managed to close its $650 million fourth fund, avoiding the “mass extinction event” suffered by its peers, as general partner Rob Hadick put it. The simple reason for its success is timely investments into a number of category winners that convinced its backers to re-up the war chest, including Polymarket and the stablecoin card issuer Rain. Dragonfly began in 2018 as a partnership between Alex Pack, then leading crypto deals for Bain Capital Ventures, and Bo Feng, a veteran of the early Chinese internet ecosystem. The firm had a rocky first few years, including a breakup with Pack that has become lore in blockchain VC circles, as well as an abandonment of China amid the government's crypto crackdown. But led by Haseeb Qureshi and Tom Schmidt, Dragonfly built a name for itself as one of the top investors in the space. After Hadick came over from the traditional finance side in 2022, though, Dragonfly shifted its focus, realizing that crypto was quickly converging with fintech. Schmidt told me that crypto is going through “the biggest meta shift” he has experienced during his time in the industry, as investors realize that there will be fewer native tokens for apps—the previous model for crypto VCs—and more tokens that represent real-world assets like stocks and private credit funds. Is this a comedown for blockchain technology, which began as a rebellion against Wall Street and governmental control of global finance? But even as crypto loses its sheen, Schmidt says it's important to not lose sight of the bigger picture, which is that digital internet money has gone from “zero to a trillion dollars in 10 years.” Term Sheet Podcast…This week, Redpoint partner Meera Clark defines what “greatness” looks like in founders and explains why revenue is an outdated metric.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Logan Paul's NFT has collapsed — what about the collections of other celebrities? Five years later, the collection's floor price has fallen to around 0.08 Ether, or approximately $155 at current prices near $1,965, according to data reviewed on NFT marketplace OpenSea.

However, just one year later, Paul had accepted he made a “mistake” claiming “it's worth essentially nothing.” I've immortalized this mistake in 99 Originals with an exact replica helmet & outfithttps://t.co/OzBRdQPxUK pic.twitter.com/srD2h4SgO7 While Paul has always denied wrongdoing, the backlash has been amplified by controversy surrounding CryptoZoo, an NFT-based game project he promoted in 2021 that was later criticized after failing to deliver key features. CryptoZoo was marketed as a blockchain game in which users would buy NFT “eggs” that could hatch into hybrid animals and generate token rewards. The project drew complaints from buyers who said they had spent thousands of dollars on NFTs and tokens but were unable to recoup funds after development stalled and prices fell. Paul has previously said he intended to make affected CryptoZoo buyers whole and has blamed the project's failure on advisers and developers. The renewed attention has extended beyond NFTs into other tokenization ventures tied to Paul's brand — including a separate controversy involving the fractionalization of a rare Pokémon card. Earlier this week, Paul set a Guinness World Record after selling his rare Pikachu Illustrator Pokémon card for nearly $16.5 million — making it reportedly the most expensive Pokémon card sale in history. He had purchased the card for $5.3 million in July 2021. The record sale, however, reignited criticism over Paul's 2022 decision to fractionalize ownership of the card through Liquid Marketplace, a platform which eventually collapsed. "The reason why this is a scam… is because this illustrator card, if you look at it, it's not a PSA Gem Mint 10. Some investors were temporarily unable to access their holdings, and the episode prompted legal action in Canada. Paul has said the platform's shutdown was beyond his control and that he later paid to restore the site so users could withdraw funds. He claimed that only 5.4% of the card had been fractionalized, representing roughly $270,000 in outside investment. Pop star Justin Bieber purchased Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #3001 in January 2022 for 500 ETH, roughly $1.29 million at the time, according to blockchain data. Bieber's specific NFT has not recently sold, making its exact market value uncertain. Rare traits can usually command premiums, but valuation typically tracks close to the collection floor. The Cozomo wallet has been linked to a vast array of NFTs, including CryptoPunks, Art Blocks, and other high-value works that were widely traded during the market's peak. Individual CryptoPunks sold for more than $10 million during the boom, but prices have since fallen substantially. As of Feb. 18, CryptoPunks' floor price stands at roughly 29.8 ETH, according to listings on OpenSea. At today's trading price, that equates to approximately just $55,000. Because the Cozomo portfolio contains NFTs of varying rarity — including pieces that may trade far above floor prices — its total value cannot be determined without recent sales. Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker purchased a BAYC NFT in 2022 for approximately $241,000, according to reporting at the time. As with Bieber's NFT, current valuation tracks with BAYC floor prices, 6.10 ETH on OpenSeam, which stands at just approximately $12,184 at today's trading prices. Famously, Hilton appeared on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where she and Fallon displayed their respective Bored Ape NFTs and discussed the emerging trend. Falling NFT trading volumes are frequently cited as evidence that the market has completely failed. But analysts have cautioned that turnover alone can be a misleading gauge of underlying demand. During the 2021–2022 boom, according to Dr. Efstathios Polyzos in a recent opinion piece for CCN, exceptionally high trading volumes were driven by rapid flipping and short-term momentum strategies. In many cases, tokens changed hands multiple times within days or even hours as traders sought quick profits. In today's market, which has massively decreased in terms of prices, OpenSea transaction records show that holding periods have lengthened since the market's peak. While overall transaction counts have fallen sharply, remaining trades have reflected a matured market — focusing on longer investment strategies or specific use cases. Even when and if NFT floor prices hold steady in Ethereum terms, their dollar value is still fluctuating depending on the overall crypto market. By 2025, total NFT supply had ballooned to an estimated 1.34 billion tokens, roughly 25% higher year over year, as low-cost minting platforms made it easier than ever to launch new collections. This rapid expansion and accessibility heavily diluted scarcity, a core pillar of what made NFT pricing models so valuable. While early collections such as CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club benefited from limited supply and first-mover advantage, thousands of newer projects have struggled to maintain demand. By early 2026, overall NFT sales volumes remain an estimated 70% to 80% below peak levels reached during the speculative surge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly a year after launching a nationwide crypto payment system for tourists, merchants say hardly anyone is using it — raising questions about who the experiment really serves. Last May, Bhutan became the first country to launch a nationwide crypto payment network for tourists. Visitors to the Himalayan kingdom could pay for their visas, flights, hotels, and meals in more than 100 cryptocurrencies via Binance. Within the first month of its launch, over 1,000 merchants signed up to receive payments in crypto. In Thimphu, the QR codes displayed by local businesses to receive crypto payments gather dust. “It has been four to five months, but no customer has used it until now,” Sonam Dorji, who works at Lotus Peak Enterprise, a handicraft store on the premises of the Le Meridien hotel, told Rest of World. “Mining bitcoin gives [Bhutan] a currency to purchase imports that it didn't have before, so I understand why the political establishment in the country wants to go for digital payments,” Jay Zagorsky, a professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, told Rest of World. “However, just because the central bank is pushing Bhutan society toward digital payments does not make it sensible.” Abundant rivers and mountainous terrain make hydroelectric power plentiful in the kingdom, and domestic consumption is low given its population of less than a million people. Bhutan uses the surplus electricity generated from renewable sources to power its crypto mining operations. Bhutan's infrastructure, however, does not support widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies for transactions. One-third of Bhutanese people are not literate — a necessary criterion to navigate digital payments, Zagorsky said. The country also suffers from an unstable power supply, which can make digital payments challenging. The typical customer deals with power cuts 19 times a year, due to causes that are only under the power companies' control, according to a government report. One-fifth of businesses in Bhutan own or share a ground generator, World Bank data shows. “Using crypto as legal tender means items like bitcoin need to be accepted by all types of businesses, from large to very small, at all times for any debt,” Zagorsky said. “Countries with shaky infrastructures and low rates of literacy are not the best places for introducing new types of legal tender, especially when other small countries like El Salvador, who have tried it, did not see the experiment succeed.” Compared to the Latin American country, it saw barely any adoption among its citizens, given low internet penetration and frequent power outages. The current system instantly converts crypto payments to ngultrum for merchants. “Initially, there was talk about expanding crypto payments to other sectors, but in practice, I haven't seen this happen in any significant way yet,” Ugyen Dendup, the co-founder of Bhutan's first AI startup NoMindBhutan, told Rest of World. “It exists in a kind of gray area: Some people push for it, some are cautious, and enforcement or guidance isn't very clear,” he said. “Because of this, it's hard to say whether Bhutan is moving toward making bitcoin legal tender.” American companies are staging boxing matches with VR-controlled Chinese humanoids to enthusiastic fans. The crypto-based prediction platform is hiring Mandarin-speaking staff and adding Lunar New Year bets, even as it remains blocked in China. Western automakers are chasing rare earth-free motors but China's cost advantage remains difficult to crack.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Integration aims to make food distribution transparent, leak-proof and beneficiary-centric In a landmark move blending financial innovation with welfare delivery, the Government of India has launched a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)-based Digital Food Currency pilot in Gujarat, marking the first integration of programmable digital money into the Public Distribution System (PDS). The pilot was inaugurated by Amit Shah in the presence of Prahlad Joshi, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, and Bhupendra Patel, along with senior state and central officials. CBDC Integration: A Structural Upgrade to India's Food Security Architecture Describing the initiative as a milestone reform, Prahlad Joshi said that integrating CBDC into the PDS architecture represents a decisive step toward transparency, efficiency and beneficiary empowerment. India's PDS — the world's largest food distribution network — serves over 80 crore beneficiaries. Under the new framework, digital coupons generated via the Reserve Bank of India will be credited directly to beneficiaries as programmable digital rupee (e₹). These coupons can be redeemed at Fair Price Shops (FPS) using QR codes or voucher codes for entitled foodgrain quantities. The programmable nature of the digital rupee ensures that funds can be used exclusively for foodgrain transactions, thereby minimizing misuse and enhancing accountability. Officials indicated that the CBDC-enabled system will reduce dependence on repeated biometric authentication and mitigate operational issues associated with e-POS devices. By generating a real-time, traceable digital trail of transactions, the platform enhances monitoring and oversight while simplifying the user experience for beneficiaries. In addition, Fair Price Shop dealers will receive their margins in real time, improving cash flow efficiency and strengthening trust across the distribution chain. Following its initial implementation, the program will expand to the Union Territories of Chandigarh, Puducherry, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu as part of a phased national rollout strategy. He emphasized that CBDC integration aligns with the government's “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance” approach by strengthening transparency and ensuring that beneficiaries receive their entitled foodgrains with greater awareness of their rights. The CBDC pilot builds upon extensive digital reforms undertaken by the Department of Food and Public Distribution in recent years. These include end-to-end digitization of ration cards, nationwide portability under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) framework, Aadhaar-enabled e-POS authentication, and real-time supply chain monitoring through platforms such as Ann Chakra. Grievance redressal systems like Ann Sahayata have further strengthened citizen-centric accountability. The pilot, which currently covers a limited number of beneficiaries, is positioned as a proof-of-concept for integrating programmable digital currency into large-scale welfare systems. If successful, it could redefine subsidy delivery mechanisms by replacing traditional cash or in-kind transfer inefficiencies with a secure, traceable and purpose-bound digital alternative. As the pilot scales up, it may offer a replicable governance model for other social protection schemes, positioning India at the forefront of digital public infrastructure innovation in welfare administration.
