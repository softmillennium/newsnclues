                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lara Trump revealed her father-in-law President Donald Trump has a speech he's ready to give at the “right time” on extraterrestrial life. Trump shared that intel during a podcast interview with New York Post reporter Miranda Devine on Wednesday, less than a week after ex-President Barack Obama caused a stir when he said UFOs are “real.” Based on what Lara Trump said, the commander-in-chief is itching to make his own big announcements on aliens too. “Do you think he's about to make an announcement on UFOs? Miranda, we all want to know!” Trump said. and so that of course led us to believe — Eric [Trump] and I were like ‘Oh my gosh, if he won't even like fully tell us, maybe there's more to it. She also told Devine that the president has talked “a little different” about the topic of UFOs than others, which leads her to believe there's more President Trump knows about it than he's letting on. “I don't have any information, I feel like there might be information out there, and hopefully it's going to be able to be told to us very soon, we'll see,” Lara Trump added. Her answer comes after Obama said last weekend that ETs aren't just Stephen Spielberg characters. “They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,” Obama told progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen. “There's no underground facility,” he continued, adding, “unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States.” That got a fair amount of attention on X and elsewhere online. And the topic of aliens has been in the news more in recent years, even before Obama and Lara Trump spoke out. Retired Maj. David Grusch told the House Oversight Committee's national security subcommittee in 2023 “that he had been denied access to some government UFO programs but that he knows the ‘exact locations' of UAPs in U.S. possession,” NPR reported. And just last summer, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) told Joe Rogan that she has seen evidence of “interdimensional beings.” Watch above via Devine's Pod Force One show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether the temperatures are dropping outside or you're placing ice cube trays in the freezer, everyone knows that once water drops to 0°C (32°F), it will freeze. Water molecules have a particular bent shape that causes them to stack into clusters shaped like hexagons as they freeze.” It is this crystalline pattern that allows all water (with a few odd exceptions) to freeze at the set temperature. This means that, unlike water, most oils do not freeze at a set point. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign explains what is happening in these cases: The molecules get stuck when cold, but not in any simple regular arrangement.” This is much more than just an interesting science fact that could win you points on trivia night. Most people experience the results of oil's properties on a daily basis. Your car engine (and millions of other products that require lubrication) uses oil to reduce friction. Of course, in very cold weather, the oil does become thicker and more viscous, which means your car's engine has to work harder to get things moving than it would in hot weather. This can even result in slight damage to the internal parts of the engine, especially if you start your vehicle and immediately start driving aggressively. It is, however, recommended that you let your car run for a minute before driving in extremely cold temperatures, and for the first several miles of driving, you accelerate more slowly than normal to help minimize any negative impact. The science behind oil and how it reacts to temperature is incredible.

On October 6, 1970, the deep-sea drilling vessel Glomar Challenger returned to port in Lisbon, Portugal, bearing a cargo that would revise history. The recovered cores pointed toward a startling conclusion: About 6 million years ago, the sea had turned into a desert: a vast, barren, salt-filled bowl more than two kilometers [1.2 miles] deep. "Cascading at a rate of 10,000 cubic miles per year, the Gibraltar Falls would have been 100 times bigger than Victoria Falls and 1,000 times more so than Niagara.… What a spectacle it must have been for the African ape-men, if any were lured by the thunderous roar." —The Red Sea experienced 'one of the most extreme environmental events on Earth' 6 million years ago —Epic 11-foot-tall sea level rise drove Vikings out of Greenland —Colossal underwater canyon discovered near seamount deep in the Mediterranean Sea However, fresh doubts have arisen recently about every part of this story, from the mega-desert to the mega-Niagara. Many geologists have argued for a much briefer desiccation followed by a far more gradual refilling of the Mediterranean. The most startling recent twist is that the floodway, if there was one, may not have been anywhere near the present-day Strait of Gibraltar, which separates southern Spain from Morocco. For 50 years, new research suggests, we have been looking for signs of a megaflood in the wrong place. In the present-day Mediterranean, about three times more water is lost every year to evaporation than is recaptured from rainfall and rivers. This outflow prevents salt from accumulating in the Mediterranean. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. But what would happen if the strait were constricted, or shut off entirely? Given the hugely negative budget of fresh water, "sea level" in the Mediterranean Sea would drop rapidly, by as much as a kilometer in 2,000 years. Such a scenario would have seemed like science fiction until the Glomar Challenger's 1970 expedition. The next day, Hsü and his co-lead scientist, William Ryan of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, found out why. "It brought up buckets full of gravel," Ryan says. Seafloors don't often contain beds of gravel, and when they do, it is usually continental rocks washed down from the adjacent land. But this gravel had marine fossils and rock, mixed with crystals of gypsum. "When Ken held up the gypsum crystals, he turned to me and asked, 'Do you think the Mediterranean dried out?'" The same story was repeated at every stop. Ryan and Hsü found other evaporites like halite (sodium chloride, aka table salt). But a considerable amount of dissent has emerged in the last 20 years. In part, the dissent reflects an improved understanding of what was occurring on Earth and in the area 6 million years ago. Take the evaporites, for example: They do not have to form via evaporation, says sedimentologist and stratigrapher Vinicio Manzi of the University of Parma in Italy. They can also form by precipitation from a sufficiently concentrated brine. This can happen underwater, so there is no need to posit that the Mediterranean went bone dry. Those, too, Manzi and his colleagues can explain: The sinking of briny water can produce downhill currents ("dense shelf water cascading," in geology lingo) sufficiently strong to scour out a canyon. The idea of a single evaporation event also faces a mathematical problem: The existing salt deposit is too big to be explained by a single evaporation event. It represents about 5 percent of the salt in the world's oceans (and may have originally been 7 to 10 percent). There, gypsum beds alternate with shale beds that are rich in organic material and could have formed in periods when the gateway between the Atlantic and Mediterranean was open. There are 16 beds in all, with ages spaced about 23,000 years apart. This periodicity is well known to geologists: It's the time it takes for Earth's axis (like a wobbly top) to trace one complete circle. However, Manzi's group strongly dissents, arguing that the Gibraltar gateway remained open, but shallowed to such an extent that the water flowed through it in one direction only — in but not out — resulting in a runaway buildup of salt. Data from chlorine isotopes suggest that the drawdown was not uniform. At its lowest point, in the western Mediterranean, sea level was 800 meters below its present level, while east of present-day Sicily it was at least twice as deep as that. If so, the east and west portions must have been separated by a land bridge. Indeed, there is evidence of African animals crossing over to Europe during this time. The halite stopped precipitating and there is evidence for a variety of sea levels in the Mediterranean during this time. Widespread fossils of a shrimp-like animal called an ostracod suggest that the waters became much less salty, so that the Mediterranean was a sea-sized lake (and indeed, this stage is sometimes called the Lago-Mare stage). Using a computer to model erosion, he argues that the Mediterranean was gradually refilling during Stage 3. With the shores of the Mediterranean being so newly exposed and so steep, its edges would have rapidly eroded toward today's Black Sea, which at that time was a much larger freshwater lake called the Paratethys. The first connection between them could have been established at this time. The ostracods got a new home, and the Mediterranean got a vast new supply of water, which according to the computer simulation raised its surface to within 300 meters of its current level. According Krijgsman, this interpretation conveniently reconciles the conflicting evidence. "In the fight between a desiccated and full Mediterranean," says Krijgsman, García-Castellanos' paper does the job "if you want to sit in the middle and give everyone credit for their observations." Hsü's original Scientific American article devotes only half a page to it and adduces little in the way of evidence. Fifty years later, Ryan wrote a 100-page retrospective; only three pages are about the megaflood. Shouldn't this extraordinary flood have left very clear scars? Geologists have found submerged flood-like deposits off Malta — but that's a long way from Gibraltar, the putative source of the flood. Also, if the Atlantic drained into a nearly empty Mediterranean basin, then sea levels around the world should have dropped by about nine meters — an anti-flood to pay for the Mediterranean flood. There is no sign that this happened, says García-Castellanos. A recent deep-sea drilling expedition to the Strait of Gibraltar turned up more questions than answers. Any megaflood that passed through the Strait of Gibraltar would have passed also through the Alboran basin. While still on board the ship, she wrote that the cores were "exquisitely laminated in a variety of colors. This incredibly fine lamination requires very quiet, low energy conditions." Final results have not been published yet, but Flecker reports also that they found no salt layer and no evidence that the salinity crisis had ever touched the Alboran Sea. "A feature that you must take into account, and nearly nobody does, is that the present physiography of the Mediterranean is very different from the Messinian one," says Booth Rea. One possibility, he suggested, is that the gateway was somewhere to the east, through a volcanic arc of islands that once connected Africa to the Balearic Islands. Other possibilities include channels through Spain or Morocco, which are above sea level now but were underwater as recently as 7 million years ago. "Salt giants" — that is, massive salt deposits like the one underneath the Mediterranean — have formed at other times in Earth's history, when basins were trapped between two tectonic plates. Their effects on climate and biodiversity have likely been huge: In this event, 89 percent of exclusively Mediterranean marine species died out. And a slight shallowing of the Strait of Gibraltar (or whatever the true gateway was) might be all that was needed to trigger these vast changes. "In some sense, this is more terrifying," says Manzi, because it shows that "you can reach extreme conditions without extreme events."

But despite the barriers Burlison is committed to finding evidence of extraterrestrial life. He said: “If I come under any hard evidence, whether it's physical or video evidence that is absolutely definitive, I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe.” He added that no government has a right to withhold such information from its citizens. Burlison has previously been granted access to secure locations across the US, such as the infamous Area 51, which have decade-old ties to UFOs and secretive government projects. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Barack Obama recently said he believes aliens are real — but clarified that he has never seen one and does not believe they are being held at Area 51. That leaves a lingering question: Where are the aliens? The National UFO Reporting Center collects reports of unexplained flying objects and unidentified anomalous phenomena for investigation. Since its founding in 1974, the organization says it has processed more than 180,000 reports nationwide. In New York state alone, the center has logged 6,309 UFO and UAP sighting reports. The earliest reported New York sighting dates back to 1790 in Carlisle. According to the database, the unnamed witness — whose account was submitted in 2007 — described seeing what was believed to be a meteor while playing the fiddle outside on a summer night. The most recent report was filed Feb. 5 in Poughkeepsie. While thousands of sightings have been reported in New York, many have later been attributed to planets, stars, aircraft or even Chinese lanterns. — Madison Scott is a journalist with the Democrat and Chronicle who covers breaking and trending news for the Finger Lakes Region.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than six years after Jeffrey Epstein died in a federal jail cell, the US government remains engaged in a sweeping cover-up. Millions of documents related to Epstein's criminal enterprise remain unreleased. Even the so-called “unredacted” files remain inaccessible to the public and are viewable only by a small number of members of Congress, where they are still redacted in any case. At the same time, the Justice Department claims it has found no evidence of a broader criminal network and has brought forward not a single new charge, despite documentary proof that Epstein continued to operate internationally after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. A recent New York Times article in its Epstein series, “The Epstein Files and the Hidden World of an Unaccountable Elite,” published February 12, provides a textbook example of this method. The article, written by Robert Draper, begins with admissions that demolish years of official denials. “In unsparing detail,” Draper writes, “the documents lay bare the once-furtive activities of an unaccountable elite, largely made up of rich and powerful men from business, politics, academia and show business.” The files, he continues, “tell a story of a heinous criminal given a free ride by the ruling class in which he dwelled.” The Times situates Epstein's impunity within the broader social crisis produced by American capitalism, noting that his “Caligula-like antics” unfolded amid “rising populist anger and ever-growing inequality,” the collapse of manufacturing, and the subprime mortgage crisis that cost millions of workers their homes. It catalogs Epstein's documented relationships with former President Bill Clinton, billionaires such as Elon Musk, senior financiers, royalty and political operatives across the globe. Having established this factual record, however, the article abruptly reverses course. Among the supposed “conspiracies” is Epstein's death in federal custody, which has been accepted uncritically by the media as a suicide. Newly released video logs from the Metropolitan Correctional Center show an unaccounted-for figure moving toward Epstein's cell on the night of his death. As reported by CBS News, both the FBI and the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General had already logged the unidentified orange-clad figure in their internal timelines years ago, while refusing to disclose this publicly. Senior officials repeatedly suggested that no one approached Epstein's cell. The breakdown of surveillance cameras, guard staffing, recordkeeping and evidence preservation has never been explained. Forensic doubts raised by Dr. Michael Baden, who stated that Epstein's neck injuries were “extremely unusual in suicidal hangings” and consistent with homicidal strangulation, have been brushed aside. Despite documenting Epstein's “remarkable web of connections,” the Times nevertheless insists that his “influence on American policymaking was negligible.” His associates, the paper claims, were “farther down the food chain,” and “notably absent” were prosecutors, judges or law enforcement officials who could have protected him. This argument collapses under the Times' own reporting. Within 24 hours, the paper documented a “friendly, and transactional” relationship between Epstein and Thorbjørn Jagland, a former prime minister of Norway and head of the Nobel Committee, a relationship that has since led to criminal corruption charges in Norway. The Times also reported on the resignation of Kathryn Ruemmler, Goldman Sachs' top lawyer and a former Obama White House counsel, after documents revealed she advised Epstein on managing media scrutiny and his response to sex crime allegations while receiving gifts, travel and career assistance. Epstein maintained intimate, transactional relationships with senior government officials, global financiers and corporate legal architects long after his 2008 conviction. It is, in fact, not a conspiracy theory to state that the Trump administration is engaged in a cover-up. It is an objective fact, demonstrated by the administration's own actions. The Trump administration has redacted Trump's name and image from released materials, withheld documents placing him in contact with Epstein during periods of investigation, and allowed Trump to falsely claim the files exonerate him. To describe accusations of a cover-up as “conspiracy theories” requires ignoring the documentary record. But in response to the Epstein files, antiestablishment voices have advanced the claim that Jewish networks and interests are corrupting American society. Ana Kasparian, the host of a popular left-wing online news show, described Epstein's network as a “pedophile ring/Israeli blackmail operation.” The month before, she asked an Israeli interlocutor, “Why are you monsters always slaughtering innocent children and shaking us down for money?” Briahna Joy Gray, former press secretary for Bernie Sanders, called Epstein's network a “ring of billionaire pedophiles with ties to Mossad” engaging in “full-on blackmail.” Evidence that Epstein maintained relationships with senior Israeli officials, facilitated covert diplomacy or operated within intelligence-adjacent networks is not antisemitic, any more than opposition to the genocide in Gaza is. Reporting by Drop Site News shows that Epstein facilitated back-channel diplomacy involving former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US officials during the Syrian civil war. Leaked emails show Epstein advising Barak, arranging meetings, sharing intelligence-adjacent information and pressing for US military intervention against Iran and Syria. These are matters of state policy and intelligence operations, not religious identity. To describe such reporting as antisemitic is itself a blatant slander. Exposing covert diplomacy, blackmail networks and imperialist maneuvering is not an attack on Jewish people. It is an exposure of the criminal ruling class. That the Washington Post advances this smear is not accidental. The paper is owned by Jeff Bezos, has recently laid off hundreds of workers, functions as a long-standing conduit for US intelligence agencies and has played a central role in downplaying Israel's genocide in Gaza while advocating expanded military confrontation with Russia and China. In both cases, the aim is the same: to sever documented facts from their political implications, delegitimize opposition and shield the institutions of wealth, intelligence and imperialist power that enabled Epstein's crimes and continue to block justice.</p>
