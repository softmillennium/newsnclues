            A Delta Air Lines flight from Houston to Atlanta made an emergency landing early Wednesday after a passenger tried to access the cockpit, the pilot told air traffic controllers.
    


            Delta flight 2557, a Boeing 717 aircraft, had just taken off from Houston's Hobby Airport when the pilot declared an emergency.  Eight-five passengers and five crew members were on board, according to Delta.
    


            “We had a passenger get up and try to access the cockpit,” the pilot can be heard in a radio recording with air traffic control captured by Broadcastify. “Can you coordinate and have security standing by?”
    


            After confirming the cockpit was secure, he requested police and paramedics meet the plane when it landed.
    


            “(He is) in cuffs in the back of the aircraft, but he did assault another passenger, so we would like that other passenger checked out,” the pilot told air traffic control.
    


            In 2025, there were 1,621 unruly passengers reported to the Federal Aviation Administration. So far, in 2026, there have been 126.
    


            Wednesday, the plane signaled an emergency using its transponder and landed back at Hobby Airport about 17 minutes after taking off. Emergency vehicles accompanied the plane to the gate.
    


            “They are coming to the gate. The police are there waiting,” an air traffic controller told emergency responders. “Follow the aircraft to the ramp.”
    


            Delta later told CNN that the passenger “approached crew and customers but did not make contact with or attempt to access the flight deck.”
    


            “The safety of our customers and crew is paramount, and Delta has zero tolerance for unruly behavior,” the airline said in a statement. “We apologize to our customers for this experience and delay in their travels.”
    


            The flight later took off again and arrived in Atlanta about 90 minutes behind schedule.
    


            The FAA is investigating the incident.

            A recent FCC inquiry to ABC about a possible “equal time” rule violation at “The View” raised concerns at CBS that “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” could be targeted next, according to people familiar with CBS's deliberations.
    


            The government pressure clearly had an impact. Lawyers for CBS contacted Colbert's show during his Monday taping. The unusual intervention became a national news story when Colbert told viewers all about it that evening.
    


            In a follow-up on Tuesday night, Colbert said of CBS parent company Paramount, “I'm just so surprised that this giant, global corporation would not stand up to these bullies.”
    


            The “bullies,” in Colbert's telling, are Trump administration appointees who are using antiquated FCC regulations to pressure Trump critics on broadcast TV.
    


            Many critics are now calling out CBS for flinching rather than forcefully standing up to politically motivated intimidation.
    


            “Just like the Jimmy Kimmel fiasco from last year, the FCC didn't have to actually do anything — just issue threats bold enough to scare those who control broadcast networks to obey in advance,” longtime media critic Eric Deggans wrote.
    


A late-night monologue, a shocking suspension – and a reinstatement. Jimmy Kimmel's still taking risks



            The threats have come from FCC chair Brendan Carr, who indicated last month that his Trump-aligned agency will enforce the “equal time” rule that previous agency heads downplayed.
    


            The rule states that if one candidate for public office gets free airtime on a local TV or radio station, the other candidates for that office have a right to airtime, too.
    


            FCC regulations do not apply to cable channels like CNN or streaming platforms like YouTube, which is why Colbert directed his fans to YouTube on Monday night.
    


            The CBS intervention stemmed from Colbert's interview with James Talarico, a Texas state representative and rising star in the Democratic Party, who is currently running in the Texas Senate primary.
    


            The other leading candidate in the race is Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who has also appeared on Colbert in the past, but not during this Senate primary campaign.
    


            A strict reading of the “equal time” rule indicates that the third candidate in the race, Ahmad Hassan, would also qualify for equal time.
    


            But the rule contains big exemptions for news coverage, and for the past two decades, that exemption has also been thought to apply to late-night and daytime talk shows.
    


            Carr is trying to eliminate those exemptions — and observers say it's no coincidence that those shows skew left. President Donald Trump frequently inveighs against Colbert and other late-night hosts.
    


            Carr “had not gotten rid of [the exemption] yet, but CBS generously did it for him,” Colbert asserted Tuesday night.
    


            Colbert said CBS “told me unilaterally that I had to abide by the equal time rules, something I have never been asked to do for an interview in the 21 years of this job.”
    


            CBS said in a statement that “The Late Show” was given “legal guidance” about how to abide by the FCC regulations.
    


            Talarico leaned into the controversy on Tuesday, incorrectly claiming that Trump's FCC “refused to air” the interview, when in fact CBS made that decision.
    


            “Trump is worried we're about to flip Texas,” Talarico wrote on X.
    


            His team also noted that the YouTube video registered millions of views. Curiosity about the controversy helped the interview attract a much larger audience than it would have on the traditional CBS platform.
    


            The attention was timely for Talarico — coming at the start of the primary's early voting window — and lucrative for his campaign.
    


            On Wednesday morning, the campaign said it raised $2.5 million, a single-day record for Talarico, in the 24 hours after the “censored” “Late Show” visit.
    


            Colbert predicted something like this would happen.
    


            As soon as Carr came out in January and foreshadowed a more aggressive approach to “equal time,” Colbert talked about it on “The Late Show.”
    


            “I've got to watch what I say about Trump because Johnny Law is once again coming after yours truly here,” he quipped.
    


            Colbert cited a New York Times headline about a looming late-night “crackdown” by the FCC and said, “So, let's talk about these new crackdown rules that my lawyer warned me not to talk about.”
    


            A few weeks later, Colbert was back on the air saying lawyers had been in touch about the Talarico interview.
    


            The CBS decision-making was informed by the FCC's action against ABC.
    


            As Reuters first reported on February 7, Carr opened an investigation into “The View” after Talarico was interviewed on that show. (Crockett has previously appeared on “The View,” too.)
    


            The FCC did indeed send a “letter of inquiry” to ABC about “The View,” a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.
    


            A letter is the FCC's first step in assessing whether a violation has occurred. There has been a back-and-forth with ABC since then, the source added.
    


            The FCC's enforcement powers are limited. Despite the president's repeated calls for station licenses to be revoked, any such action is exceedingly unlikely and would trigger lengthy legal challenges.
    


            Still, the recent scrutiny of ABC weighed on CBS management, because it signaled an uncertain regulatory environment.
    


            ABC declined to comment on the FCC inquiry about “The View.” But a network source told CNN that the program “regularly hosts sitting leaders and political candidates to discuss differing viewpoints. The format is consistent with how the show has operated for years.”
    


            That's likely what the FCC was told, as well.
    


            When CBS cancelled Colbert's show last summer, in a change that takes effect this May, Trump celebrated the decision and said he thought ABC's Jimmy Kimmel would be canned next.
    


            ABC briefly suspended Kimmel's show last September amid public pressure from Carr, highlighting both the FCC chair's use of his platform to browbeat broadcasters, as well as the public backlash to the government intimidation of broadcasters.
    


            Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said on Tuesday that Carr has been wielding FCC power “in new and laughable ways.”
    


            “By putting pressure on late-night talk shows critical of the Trump administration while openly admitting that conservative talk radio is immune from the FCC's ire, he's making himself the poster boy for big government putting its thumb on the scale of political debate,” Corn-Revere said.
    


            Carr did not respond to requests for comment on the Colbert matter.

            The US Food and Drug Administration has reversed course and will review a new mRNA flu vaccine from Moderna, the pharmaceutical company said Wednesday.
    


            About two weeks ago, the FDA sent Moderna a letter in which it refused to accept the application to review its first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine — a rare move by the federal agency that raised concern about another setback for the technology that's been a target of some Trump administration health officials.
    


The FDA told Moderna that its application didn't contain an “adequate and well-controlled” trial because the control arm didn't reflect the “best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study,” according to the letter, that Moderna posted online. It didn't identify any safety or efficacy concerns, the company said.
    


            But Moderna has since met with the FDA and “proposed a revised regulatory approach” with different pathways by age, according to a news release from the company.
    


            Moderna is now “seeking full approval for adults 50 to 64 years of age and accelerated approval for adults 65 and older, along with a post-marketing requirement to conduct an additional study in older adults,” the news release said.
    


            “Discussions with the company led to a revised regulatory approach and an amended application, which FDA accepted,” Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement. “FDA will maintain its high standards during review and potential licensure stages as it does with all products.”
    


            If the FDA approves the vaccine, it could be available for people ages 50 and older for the upcoming 2026-2027 flu season.
    


            Last week, Moderna said that the initial refusal from the FDA was inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency.
    


            “We appreciate the FDA's engagement in a constructive Type A meeting and its agreement to advance our application for review,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. “Pending FDA approval, we look forward to making our flu vaccine available later this year so that America's seniors have access to a new option to protect themselves against flu.”

Abuses carried out by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein could meet the definition of crimes against humanity, the UN has claimed, while demanding accountability for the suspected perpetrators.

The UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) released a statement in response to the millions of files released by the US government related to criminal investigations into the late financier.

The files reveal instances of “sexual slavery, reproductive violence, enforced disappearance, torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, and femicide,” reads the document penned by a group of independent experts and published on Monday.

“So grave is the scale, nature, systematic character, and transnational reach of these atrocities… that a number of them may reasonably meet the legal threshold of crimes against humanity,” it states.

Epstein, who according to the authorities died by suicide in jail in 2019, moved in circles that included figures from politics, entertainment, and business. He faced criminal investigations in the US over allegations that he operated a system to recruit and sexually exploit young girls.

While Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted, “questions persist regarding the potential involvement of additional individuals” and financial structures linked to the alleged criminal enterprise, the UN wrote in a press release on Tuesday.

The UNHRC has urged the US and other countries to prosecute those implicated in the scandal, stating that “resignations alone” are not enough.

“It is imperative that governments act decisively to hold perpetrators accountable. No one is too wealthy or too powerful to be above the law,” they state.

The release of the Epstein files, totaling over 3.5 million pages, has triggered a wave of resignations across several countries. In the UK, the political fallout has been most severe, with three senior officials in Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government stepping down, and the brother of King Charles, Andrew, losing his titles.

In the US, a top Wall Street law firm chairman and a prominent New York arts school chair have resigned. In Europe, national security advisers in Slovakia and Norway have stepped down, along with the president of the Swedish UNHCR and a former French culture minister.

MOSCOW, February 18. /TASS/. Russia, like many other countries, consistently opposes the blockade of Cuba by the United States, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

""Russia consistently opposes the blockade of the island, like many countries in the world,"" he told a briefing.

The United States has renewed its blockade of Cuba, declaring its intention to overthrow the republic's communist government by one means or another. In particular, Washington has imposed an embargo on all supplies of fuel, which is already in short supply on the island. The United States had previously succeeded in halting oil supplies to Cuba from Mexico and Venezuela, with American forces even kidnapping President Nicolas Maduro in the latter.

To further aggravate the situation, the US administration also announced its intention to impose proportional import duties on goods from countries that dare to supply Cuba with fuel. Nevertheless, the Russian Embassy in Havana stated that Moscow would soon begin delivering oil and petroleum products as humanitarian aid.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, February 18. /TASS/. Moscow will consistently continue to support Havana in protecting its sovereignty and security, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, opening talks with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla. He also called Washington's actions against Havana unacceptable.

Parrilla said that his country is committed to joint projects and agreements with Moscow, despite all difficulties.

TASS has compiled the key statements by the foreign ministers.

Russia calls on the United States to ""show common sense, a responsible approach, and ditch plans for a naval blockade"" of Cuba, Lavrov said.

He called the US actions against Cuba and statements about Russian-Cuban relations unacceptable.

Moscow ""categorically rejects"" far-fetched accusations of cooperation between Russia and Cuba as allegedly posing threats to the United States or other countries, Lavrov said.

According to him, Russia will ""consistently continue to support Cuba"" in protecting its ""sovereignty and security.""

Cuba is concerned about the deterioration of the international situation and the United States' actions, which pose a threat to the sovereignty of all countries, the foreign minister said.

Senate candidate says campaign saw boost in 24 hours since Colbert said CBS told him not to air segment for fear of triggering FCC equal-time rule

Following the decision by The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to air its interview with James Talarico on YouTube, the Texas Democratic Senate candidate said that his campaign raised $2.5m in the 24 hours since Colbert said that CBS told him not to air the segment, for fear of triggering the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) equal-time rule.

The Trump administration is working to block states and cities from offering free transportation to undocumented immigrants, according to reporting from Politico.

The outlet reported today that the Department of Transportation is drafting a law that would prohibit local jurisdictions from using federal transit money to assist undocumented migrants.

In some states and cities, officials have offered free buses to help migrants reach sources, including intake shelters or shelters.

“The change wouldn't stop undocumented immigrants from using public transportation,” Politico reports. “However, it would seek to prevent local agencies or towns from using public transportation to move unauthorized immigrants around the city or outside it to another state, a person familiar with the plan said.”

The transportation department's proposal is part of a package of measures that the White House is considering to include in the transportation reauthorization bill slated to go to Congress this year.

Democratic voters are still lacking optimism about their political party since President Donald Trump's 2024 win, a recent poll reveals.

Only around seven in 10 Democrats have a positive view of the Democratic party, the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found.

“While the overwhelming majority of Democrats still feel good about their party, they're much less positive than they've been in the past,” the AP reports.

The midterm elections are still months away. Increasing negative views of Trump and other Republicans may help their party later this year. Favorable views of the Democratic party plummeted after the 2024 election.

Several Democratic lawmakers will boycott Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday 24 February, and instead attend a rally on the National Mall.

So far, at least 12 Democratic members of Congress will skip the State of the Union. These include senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, as well as progressive representatives Pramila Jayapal and Greg Casar.

The event, dubbed the “People's State of the Union”, is being coordinated by progressive media network MeidasTouch and the liberal advocacy group MoveOn. Attorney and commentator Katie Phang and former anchor Joy Reid will co-host the rally. The event's organizers say it will spotlight federal workers, immigrants and Americans affected by the Trump administration's policies.

In a statement, Van Hollen said that he would not attend the joint address to Congress next week. “Trump is marching America towards fascism, and I refuse to normalize his shredding of our Constitution & democracy,” he said. “This cannot be business as usual.”

Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, said Les Wexner's deposition will be “very important” to the ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, in an interview with MSNOW on Tuesday.

“You don't pay a person the amount of money that Wexner was paying Epstein for just financial advice. They were very close for a long period of time,” Garcia said of the 88-year-old billionaire who employed Epstein as a personal money manager for 20 years. “We have a lot of questions about the finances, the relationship, what Wexner knew, who Jeffrey Epstein also received money from, what was actually Wexner's larger involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell, and we hope those questions will be answered.”

Garcia added that the questions from lawmakers to Wexner will be “pretty direct” during today's deposition. “We know he has significant information as to why he was providing so much money to Epstein,” he said. The lawmaker is also determined to understand why Wexner's name – along with those of other high profile men – were redacted in the justice department's latest release of documents.

“Why the cover-up? Why we protecting possible co conspirators? Why are we protecting Jeffrey Epstein's, essentially, benefactors?,” Garcia said.

Following the decision by The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to air its interview with James Talarico on YouTube, the Texas Democratic Senate candidate said that his campaign raised $2.5m in the 24 hours since Colbert said that CBS told him not to air the segment, for fear of triggering the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) equal-time rule.

In an interview with MSNOW, Democratic congresswoman Jasmine Crockett addressed the claims from Stephen Colbert that CBS told him not to air a television interview with James Talarico, the Texas state lawmaker running for US Senate. Colbert said the decision stemmed from a concern that it would trigger a legal requirement to provide equal access to Talarico's campaign rivals – which includes Crockett.

The congresswoman said that her team received a call from Paramount Skydance – CBS's parent company – who told her that Colbert could, in fact, move forward with airing the Talarico interview but would need to offer Crockett equal time.

“I did not get a request from the Colbert show to go on … I've been on Colbert multiple times, and frankly, if we would have gotten an offer that would have been great, but we're in the middle of early voting, so I'm kind of focused on being in Texas at this moment,” Crockett told MS Now.

In the end, the Talarico interview was instead broadcast on Colbert's YouTube page, which is out of the remit of the FCC. In a statement, CBS said that The Late Show was not prohibited from broadcasting the segment, instead the network “provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates”.

Speaking to MS Now, Crockett added that she had “no love” for CBS News editor Bari Weiss, nor for the FCC chair Brendan Carr. “It is important that we resist,” she said. “I think it probably gave my opponent the boost he was looking for so I think it's probably better than he didn't get on, and that they went straight to streaming.”

Today, congressional lawmakers on the House oversight committee continue their investigation into the handling of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes with a deposition of Les Wexner, the billionaire and former CEO of Victoria's Secret.

Wexner is facing scrutiny for his association with Epstein – who served as his personal money manager from the mid-1980s until 2007, when Epstein was under investigation for sex crimes. He then stepped away from managing Wexner's personal finances. The businessman, who also owned Bath & Body Works, later discovered that Epstein had been mismanaging funds, and severed ties with him.

While Wexner has vehemently denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, he is under renewed dissection after his name appeared in the latest tranche of documents released by the justice department, which showed a 2019 FBI document that listed Wexner as a co-conspirator of Epstein. The 88-year old has never been convicted of a crime, and maintains that he has cooperated with officials at each juncture of their investigations into Epstein, who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019.

Last week, congressman Ro Khanna, revealed that Wexner's name was one of six high-profile men whose names were redacted in the latest document drop by the Department of Justice.

Wexner will testify for lawmakers in New Albany, Ohio, and several Democratic members of the committee will hold a press conference after the deposition.

On a recent morning Eric Taylor, city manager for a small Georgia town of about 5,000 residents called Social Circle, was contacted by a staffer from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“They asked me to turn on the water,” he said of a 1m sq ft warehouse nearby that the federal government recently purchased for $128m, with plans to use it for locking up as many as 10,000 detainees as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation plan.

“I told them I'm not going to do it,” Taylor said. “Not until they come and talk to me.”

The local official, together with the town's mayor and police chief, have all publicly opposed the Department of Homeland Security's plans to open what could become one of the largest immigration detention centers in the US – in a rural town with 19th-century buildings downtown, and horse and cattle farms and hay for sale on the outskirts.

ICE's warehouse purchase in Social Circle is one of several dozen across the US in recent weeks. In a handful of locations – such as Ashland, Virginia and Kansas City, Kansas – local opposition appears to have thwarted such plans.

In the case of Social Circle, officials and residents alike only learned of the Trump administration's plans to buy the empty warehouse from a 24 December Washington Post report – and since then have been clamoring for the federal government's attention, to no avail. Taylor contacted Jon Ossoff, a Democratic senator who has also opposed ICE's plans for the town, and Mike Collins, a Republican congressman who has told Taylor that the federal government will be in touch.

Donald Trump is in Washington today. We'll hear from the president at 3pm ET, when he hosts a Black History Month reception in the East Room of the White House. This comes just weeks after Trump posted and deleted a racist video to social media that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama at apes. The White House ultimately blamed a staffer for the move, and distanced the president from the backlash.

Also today, we'll hear from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who hold a briefing for reporters at 1pm ET.

More than a dozen health and environmental justice non-profits have sued the Environmental Protection Agency over its revocation of the legal determination that underpins US federal climate regulations.

Filed in Washington DC circuit court, the lawsuit challenges the EPA's rollback of the “endangerment finding”, which states that the buildup of heat-trapping pollution in the atmosphere endangers public health and welfare and has allowed the EPA to limit those emissions from vehicles, power plants and other industrial sources since 2009. The rollback was widely seen as a major setback to US efforts to combat the climate crisis.

The suit was brought by the American Public Health Association, American Lung Association, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and 11 other public health and environmental organizations. The lawsuit was filed by green legal organizations Clean Air Task Force and Earthjustice and it names the EPA and the agency's administrator, Lee Zeldin, as defendants.

“EPA's repeal of the endangerment finding and safeguards to limit vehicle emissions marks a complete dereliction of the agency's mission to protect people's health and its legal obligation under the Clean Air Act,” said Gretchen Goldman, president and CEO at the Union of Concerned Scientists, another one of the groups behind the lawsuit. “This shameful and dangerous action by the Trump administration and EPA Administrator Zeldin is rooted in falsehoods not facts and is at complete odds with the public interest and the best available science.”

Fifteen members of Congress have written to Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, demanding to know what steps the United States has taken in response to the mistreatment of a Palestinian-American teenager who spent nine months in Israeli detention.

The letter, led by Senator Peter Welch and first seen by the Guardian, is centered around the case of Mohammed Ibrahim, a Florida resident who was 15 when Israeli soldiers arrested him during a raid on his family's West Bank home in February 2025. He was charged with throwing objects at moving vehicles before being released on 27 November following a guilty plea and suspended sentence, and was taken directly to hospital upon his return.

The then 16-year-old was severely underweight, having lost roughly a third of his body weight, and had suffered a scabies skin infection a few months into his detention, the state department told his family at the time, according to correspondences seen by the Guardian.

Mohammed told family members and US consular officers that he and other Palestinian minors held in the same cell were beaten, threatened, pepper-sprayed and denied adequate food and medical care over the course of his detention.

In an interview with the advocacy group Defense for Children International – Palestine while still detained, Mohammed described receiving three small pieces of bread and a spoonful of yogurt for breakfast, with no dinner provided.

“There has been case after case of Palestinians, including hundreds of children, swept up in the Israeli military justice system, where they are not only denied basic rights of due process but subjected to systematic physical and psychological abuse,” the lawmakers wrote in the 16 February letter. “While such abuses are never permissible, we are especially concerned that cases involving abuse of US citizens in the West Bank be thoroughly investigated and that those responsible are brought to justice.”

A judge in Florida has set a trial date in US president Donald Trump's $10bn defamation lawsuit against the BBC over a Panorama programme.

Court documents from the US District Court Southern District of Florida show judge Roy K Altman set a trial date of 15 February next year.

The order, made on 11 February, said:

This matter is set for trial during the Court's two-week trial calendar beginning February 15, 2027. Counsel for all parties shall also appear at a calendar call at 1:45 p.m. on February 9, 2027.

Unless instructed otherwise by subsequent order, the trial and all other proceedings in this case shall be conducted in Courtroom 12-4 at the Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. U.S. Courthouse, 400 N. Miami Avenue, Miami, Florida 33128.

A US immigration judge has blocked the deportation of a Palestinian graduate student who helped organize protests at Columbia University against Israel's war in Gaza, according to US media reports.

Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested by immigration agents last year as he was attending an interview to become a US citizen, AFP reported.

Mahdawi had been involved in a wave of demonstrations that gripped several major US university campuses since Israel began a massive military campaign in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas militants' deadly 7 October, 2023 attack.

A Palestinian born in the occupied West Bank, Mahdawi has been a legal US permanent resident since 2015 and graduated from the prestigious New York university in May. He has been free from federal custody since April.

In an order made public on Tuesday, Judge Nina Froes said that President Donald Trump's administration did not provide sufficient evidence that Mahdawi could be legally removed from the United States, multiple media outlets reported.

Americans believe that wealthy and powerful people are rarely held accountable, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found after the release of millions of records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's connections in elite US business and political circles.

Some 69% of respondents in the four-day poll, which concluded on Monday, said their views were captured “very well” or “extremely well” by a statement that the Epstein files “show that powerful people in the US are rarely held accountable for their actions.“

Another 17% said the statement described their views “somewhat well,” while 11% said it didn't reflect their thinking. Among both Republicans and Democrats, more than 80% said the statement described their thinking at least somewhat well.

CBS earlier this week attempted to address Stepen Colbert's allegations about a corporate mandate not to broadcast the James Talarico interview.

“The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,” the network said in a statement.

“The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.

“The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”

Colbert has accused the Trump administration of censoring critics and has been particularly critical of FCC chairman Brendan Carr.

“Let's just call this what it is,” he said on Monday. “Donald Trump's administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV.”

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I'm Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with FCC commissioner Anna M Gomez criticizing CBS for what she called “corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech”.

Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC, was appointed by former president Joe Biden to the five-person board in 2023. Her comments follow talkshow host Stephen Colbert accusing the Trump administration and CBS of censorship after he said the network told him not to air a television interview with a Texas Democrat running for Senate.

Gomez said in a statement:

This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech.

The FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes or to create a climate that chills free expression.

CBS is fully protected under the First Amendment to determine what interviews it airs, which makes its decision to yield to political pressure all the more disappointing.

On his show, Colbert told viewers of the Late Show that network lawyers told him he was also prohibited from talking about their refusal to air his interview with James Talarico, a Texas state representative seeking his party's nomination to challenge the Republican incumbent, John Cornyn, for a Senate seat in November.

“He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said, stemming from a concern that it would trigger a legal requirement to provide equal access to Talarico's campaign rivals.

In the end, the interview was instead broadcast on Colbert's YouTube page, which is out of the remit of the Federal Communications Commission. CBS has disputed Colbert's account, saying that the network only “provided legal guidance” that broadcasting the interview could violate the FCC directive.

Environment minister says Alcoa cleared known habitat of protected species to enable bauxite mining

Get our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast

The environment minister, Murray Watt, has handed a $55m penalty to the US mining giant Alcoa for unlawful land clearing for bauxite mining in Western Australia's northern jarrah forests, south of Perth.

As Watt announced the “unprecedented” remediation order, he said he had also granted the company an exemption to clear further habitat for 18 months while the government considered a proposal for an extension of the company's mining operations to 2045.

Watt said the penalty – known as an enforceable undertaking – was for clearing that occurred from 2019-2025 in known habitat for nationally protected species without an approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

WA's northern jarrah forests are habitat for species including the endangered carnaby's and baudin's black cockatoos.

The $55m penalty, which relates to more than 2,000 hectares of cleared land, requires Alcoa to fund environmental and research measures, including $40m to secure permanent ecological offsets to compensate for the habitat destruction.

“It's the largest conservation‑focused commitment of its kind,” Watt said.

A further $5m will go to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy for conservation programs for affected species, $6m to state government invasive species control projects, and $4m to the University of Western Australia for research into invasive fauna control in the northern jarrah forests.

Alcoa said in a statement that while it “maintains it has operated in accordance with the EPBC Act” it had agreed to pay for the measures.

“The funding supports the health of the Northern Jarrah Forest, including programs and research that improve habitat for threatened species and control invasive flora and fauna,” the company said in a statement.

Watt said he had used an existing national interest provision in Australia's nature laws to allow for further clearing for bauxite mining for 18 months.

It would appear that this is the first time the exemption has been used in a way that benefits the commercial interests of a mine.

The exemption is separate to a new power included in last year's overhaul of the EPBC Act, which allows the minister to approve projects in breach of nature laws.

Watt said the “time limited exemption” would allow Alcoa to continue clearing while the government used a strategic assessment process to consider the company's proposed expansion of its Huntly and Willowdale mining operations, about 100km south of Perth, until 2045.

He said the exemption “ensures the continued supply of bauxite and supports future gallium production, critical for renewable systems like solar panels and wind turbines”.

Watt said it would secure a “stable supply of minerals vital for our net zero transformation and defence industries, while strengthening partnerships with the United States and Japan”, and would allow Alcoa to sustain its operations which employed about 6,000 workers.

Alcoa's spokesperson said the company would limit clearing under the exemption to 800 hectares per year and would “increase annual rates of new rehabilitation to 1,000 hectares per year by 2027”.

The company's president and chief executive, William Oplinger, said: “We are committed to responsible operations and welcome this important step in transitioning our approvals to a contemporary assessment process that provides increased certainty for our operations and our people into the future.

“We appreciate the government's recognition of the important contributions of our operations to the Australian economy.”

Matt Roberts, the executive director of the Conservation Council of Western Australia, said while the significant penalty issued to Alcoa was welcome, “we're talking about a company that strip-mines the northern jarrah forest”.

“It cannot be rehabilitated to its original state after it's been strip-mined. Therefore rehabilitation is not equal to the damage they're doing to our forest,” he said.

“It's in our national interest to preserve the natural world that we have carriage of and in that sense there's a national interest to preserving a jarrah forest that exists nowhere else in the world.”

The Biodiversity Council, an expert group founded by 11 Australian universities, expressed concern that Watt's decision to issue a national interest exemption set a “dangerous precedent”.

“Having reviewed the EPBC Act exemptions register this appears to be the first time that a commercial activity has been given an exemption on economic grounds since the commencement of the Act in 2000,” said Lis Ashby, the Biodiversity Council's policy and innovation lead.
  “The national interest exemption was intended for matters of emergency response, defence and national security, not as a convenience for resource companies committing environmental offences.”
  She said the public did not want to see WA's environment “sacrificed for international profit”.

“The government must stop prioritising the ‘operational certainty' of a foreign corporation over the survival of our unique biodiversity.”

Tania Constable, the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, said the council was “encouraged that sensible and pragmatic collaboration between the government and a significant critical minerals producer has recognised the importance of Alcoa Australia's operations and the company's strategic role in the ongoing development of Australia as a minerals powerhouse”.

“This outcome will allow Alcoa to undergo a more rigorous method of assessment while guaranteeing operations, and thousands of jobs in the local WA community.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Unresolved ‘sensitive' issues in peace talks are fate of occupied territories in east Ukraine and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant

Zelenskyy said there has been no agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the key issues at the US-mediated talks in Geneva.

“We can see that some groundwork has been done, but for now the positions differ, because the negotiations were not easy,” the Ukrainian president told reporters after the talks had finished, according to the AFP news agency.

He listed the fate of occupied territories in Ukraine's east and the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russia has taken control of, as the unresolved “sensitive” issues in the peace talks.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there has been no agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the key issues at the US-mediated talks in Geneva. “We can see that some groundwork has been done, but for now the positions differ, because the negotiations were not easy,” the Ukrainian president told reporters after the talks had finished, according to the AFP news agency.

The latest round of US-mediated peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Geneva on Wednesday ended without a major breakthrough, as fighting continues in a war that will enter its fifth year next week. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said no agreement had been reached on the thorniest questions at the negotiations in Switzerland, accusing Moscow of “trying to drag out” the process.

Ukraine has sanctioned the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko for providing military support to Russia and enabling “the killing of Ukrainians”, Zelenskyy has announced. Lukashenko, one of Russian president Vladimir Putin's closest allies, has allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory as a launchpad for its invasion of Ukraine.

Russia has demanded for evidence after five European countries accused Moscow of poisoning the outspoken Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a dart frog poison. The UK, France, Germany Sweden and the Netherlands said on Saturday that laboratory testing of samples from Navalny's body had confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.

Slovakia has threatened to cut emergency electricity supplies to Kyiv if it does not reopen a pipeline that brings Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary. Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico, who is a close ally of Putin's along with Hungary's Viktor Orbán, declared a state of emergency over oil supplies.

Four South African men who were lured into fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine landed at Johannesburg's main airport on Wednesday, public broadcaster the South African Broadcasting Corporation reported. Police were waiting at OR Tambo International Airport, the SABC said. A police spokesperson declined comment, directing enquiries to the foreign affairs ministry.

Ukraine's sports minister has condemned the decision to allow six Russians and four Belarusians to compete under their nation's flags at next month's Winter Paralympics as “disappointing and outrageous” and said Ukraine officials will not attend the opening ceremony or other official events as a result. “The flags of Russia and Belarus have no place at international sporting events that stand for fairness, integrity, and respect,” said Matvii Bidnyi in response to the International Paralympic Committee's decision on Monday.

Russia and Cuba on Wednesday criticised the US energy blockade of the Caribbean island in a show of solidarity in Moscow, where Havana's foreign minister was due to meet with president Vladimir Putin. Cuba's top diplomat Bruno Rodriguez travelled to traditional ally Russia seeking help as his country reels from a severe fuel crisis – intensified by Washington's de-facto oil blockade.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was open to a social media ban for children. “If children today, at the age of 14, have up to five hours or more of screen time a day, if their entire socialisation takes place only through this medium, then we shouldn't be surprised by personality deficits and problems in the social behaviour of young people,” he said in an interview with the podcast Machtwechsel.

Heavy snow and rain across Romania left 200,000 homes without electricity on Wednesday, energy minister Bogdan Ivan said, with traffic blocked on motorways and national roads and dozens of trains delayed. Public transport in the capital, Bucharest, was struggling under 40 cm (16 inches) of snow, Reuters reported. Fallen trees halted road and rail traffic, schools closed in several towns and 10 ambulances in six counties were snowed in, the national emergency response agency said.

France has launched wide-ranging investigations into human trafficking and financial fraud among contacts of the late convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein following the release of a trove of files on his activities. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told France Info radio on Wednesday that the investigations will rely on publicly available material alongside complaints filed by child protection groups.

“The greatness of America,” wrote the 19th-century French diplomat, political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville, “lies not in her being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.”

For a brief moment at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) last weekend, European leaders half-thought that their most heartfelt wish – the return of the old US, that believed in the EU ideal and backed a rules-based world order – had been granted.

The previous year on this same stage, US vice-president JD Vance had delivered a gut punch: a brutal ideological assault accusing Europe of abandoning “fundamental values”, and questioning whether the US and EU still had a common agenda.

This year, secretary of state Marco Rubio gave a speech so markedly different in tone that the sheer relief at hearing something other than abuse saw the audience – led by Germany's defence and foreign ministers, plus 40-odd US officials – give him a standing ovation.

Rubio played a soothing tune. The US and Europe “belong together”, he said: if Americans came across as direct and urgent, it was because they know European and US destinies were forever intertwined. The US would “always be a child of Europe”.

Four South African men who were lured into fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine landed at Johannesburg's main airport on Wednesday, public broadcaster the South African Broadcasting Corporation reported.

Police were waiting at OR Tambo International Airport, the SABC said. A police spokesperson declined comment, directing enquiries to the foreign affairs ministry.

A foreign ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment, Reuters reported.

South Africa's government said in November that it would investigate how 17 of its citizens joined mercenary forces in the Russia-Ukraine conflict after the men sent distress calls for help to return home.

President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke to Russian president Vladimir Putin by telephone earlier this month, and Ramaphosa's office said after the call that the two leaders had “pledged their support to the process of returning South Africans fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine“.

Under South African law, it is illegal for citizens to provide military assistance to foreign governments or participate in foreign armies unless authorised by South Africa.

“Of the 200,000 homes affected so far, roughly 86,000 were reconnected to power, there are ... 266 towns affected,” Ivan told reporters.

He added Romania's power consumption was 7.4GW on average, with surplus wind and hydro production being exported. Production and consumption were up 11% and 6% on the year, respectively, he said.

Zelenskyy said the status of Russian-occupied territories in eastern Ukraine and the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which remains under Moscow's control, were among the most contentious unresolved issues.

The second day of talks ended after just two hours, signalling scant progress and underscoring how distant a deal still appears, despite Donald Trump's promises to end the war on the first day of his presidency.

Read the full report by our Russian affairs reporter Pjotr Sauer here:

Back in Ukraine news, Slovakia has threatened to cut emergency electricity supplies to Kyiv if it does not reopen a pipeline that brings Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary. 

Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico, who is a close ally of Putin's along with Hungary's Viktor Orbán, declared a state of emergency over oil supplies. He said he had ordered the release of 250,000 tonnes of oil from emergency reserves in response to the interruption of oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline.

Ukraine said the pipeline, which runs from Russia through its territory to Slovakia and Hungary, was shut down after being damaged during a Russian attack near the western Ukrainian city of Brody.

Fico claimed the repair work had finished and accused Ukraine of blocking oil supplies in order to “blackmail” Hungary, which opposes Kyiv from joining the EU. Orbán repeated this accusation, saying on social media that Ukraine was “trying to pressure us to support their EU membership”.

“Thankfully, Hungary has a government that doesn't bow to blackmail,” he said.

Fico threatened to end electricity supplies to Ukraine, saying: “If the president (Zelenskyy) believes these supplies are not important, we can decide to withdraw from the electricity supply accord.”

Ukraine has been grappling with severe power outages in several cities including the capital Kyiv, which officials have blamed on delibate Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.

Denmark's King Frederik has arrived in Greenland for a three-day visit in show of support for the autonomous Danish territory after Trump repeatedly demanded control of the island.

AFP news agency reported that the king waved to well-wishers at Nuuk airport and was greeted by Greenland's prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

France has launched wide-ranging investigations into human trafficking and financial fraud among contacts of the late convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein following the release of a trove of files on his activities.

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told France Info radio on Wednesday that the investigations will rely on publicly available material alongside complaints filed by child protection groups.

One will focus on human trafficking, the other on crimes including money laundering, corruption and tax fraud.

Russia and Cuba on Wednesday criticised the US energy blockade of the Caribbean island in a show of solidarity in Moscow, where Havana's foreign minister was due to meet with president Vladimir Putin.

Cuba's top diplomat Bruno Rodriguez travelled to traditional ally Russia seeking help as his country reels from a severe fuel crisis – intensified by Washington's de-facto oil blockade.

US president Donald Trump cut off key supplies of Venezuelan oil to Cuba after ousting Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro and has threatened sanctions on states that sell oil to Havana.

Rodriguez met with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov ahead of seeing Putin, with the long-serving Russian diplomat using Soviet-era language to criticise Washington.

“We call on the US to show common sense and refrain from the military-maritime blockade of the island of freedom,” Lavrov said.

Ukraine officials to boycott Winter Paralympics opening ceremony over Russian athletes

Ukrainian officials will not attend the opening ceremony or other official events of the Winter Paralympics over the decision to allow six Russians and four Belarusians to compete under their nation's flags, Ukraine's sports minister said.

“We thank every official from the free world who will do the same. We will keep fighting,” Matvii Bidnyi said.

The Guardian's chief sports reporter, Sean Ingle, has more on this story here:

Russia has demanded for evidence after five European countries accused Moscow of poisoning the outspoken Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a dart frog poison.

The UK, France, Germany Sweden and the Netherlands said on Saturday that laboratory testing of samples from Navalny's body had confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia. In a joint statement, the five countries said Russia “had the means, motive and opportunity” to administer the poison to Navalny, who was in a remote Arctic penal colony serving a 19-year sentence. He died in February 2024 which the Kremlin said at the time was of natural causes.

Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: “All the accusations against Russia were of the ‘highly likely' variety. There were no specific details. It was purely a proclamation to become the opening act of the Munich (security) conference and to overshadow the Epstein files.

“We demand they hand over concrete data on this issue.”

In Germany, chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was open to a social media ban for children.

“If children today, at the age of 14, have up to five hours or more of screen time a day, if their entire socialisation takes place only through this medium, then we shouldn't be surprised by personality deficits and problems in the social behaviour of young people,” he said in an interview with the podcast Machtwechsel.

He said he was generally sceptical of bans but saw the consequences of mobile phone use. “I think the priority must be how to protect children at an age when they also need time to play, learn, and concentrate at school,” he added.

Merz said his government is considering “various ways of handling it in a more restrictive manner”, including an age limit and forcing platforms to verify users' ages.

It follows moves made by several countries to ban social media to children under the age of 16. The first to introduce such a measure was Australia, where platforms such as TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat were required to remove accounts held by under-16s or face heavy fines since December.

India said it was discussing age restrictions with social media firms, while France's National Assembly backed a bill that would ban social media access for under-15s.

Earlier this week Keir Starmer pledged action on young people's access to social media in “months, not years”, but said that it did not necessarily mean a complete ban on access for under-16s.

Outside of Ukraine, prosecutors in France have opened two new investigations linked to Jeffrey Epstein as they urged potential victims to come forward. 

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probes were launched to examine the alleged sexual offences and possible financial crimes connected to the convicted sex offender. The investigations are seeking to use the millions of files released by the US government related to Epstein, Beccuau added.

“All that data … some will shed light on others to be able to get a well-informed, very broad, panoramic view,” Beccuau told the French broadcaster France Info.

Beccuau called on all potential French victims to come forward, saying: “We want to stand with these victims. We will receive all statements they wish to make.”

Beccuau also said some material from old investigations is to be revisited in the light of new revelations. She was referring to the investigation into French modelling agency executive Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate of the US financier, who died in custody in 2022.

Brunel was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022 after having been charged with raping minors. The case against him was dropped in 2023 in the wake of his death, with no other person charged.

Zelenskyy said there has been no agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the key issues at the US-mediated talks in Geneva.

“We can see that some groundwork has been done, but for now the positions differ, because the negotiations were not easy,” the Ukrainian president told reporters after the talks had finished, according to the AFP news agency.

He listed the fate of occupied territories in Ukraine's east and the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russia has taken control of, as the unresolved “sensitive” issues in the peace talks.

Ukraine sports minister slams Russia's Winter Paralympics entry as ‘deeply outrageous'

Ukraine's sports minister has condemned the decision to allow six Russians and four Belarusians to compete under their nation's flags at next month's Winter Paralympics as “disappointing and outrageous”.

Dancing humanoid robots on Monday took center stage during the annual China Media Group's Spring Festival Gala, China's most-watched official television broadcast. They lunged and backflipped (landing on their knees), they spun around and jumped. Not one fell over.

The display was impressive, but if robots can now dance and perform martial arts, what else can they do?

Experts have mixed opinions, with some saying the robots had limitations and that the display should be viewed through a lens of state propaganda.

Developed by several Chinese robotics firms, the robots performed a range of intricate stunts, including martial arts, comedy sketches and choreographed dance moves alongside human performers.

Clips circulating online quickly drew comparisons with last year's Lunar New Year broadcast, which also featured dancing robots, but with noticeably simpler movements.

Kyle Chan — an expert in China's technology development at Brookings Institution, a Washington-based policy organization — said that Beijing uses public robot performances to “dazzle domestic and international audiences with China's technological prowess.”

“Unlike AI [artificial intelligence] models or industrial equipment, humanoid robots are highly visible examples of China's technological leadership that general audiences can see on their phones or televisions,” he said.

Pointing to intensifying competition in the tech space between China and the US, Chan added: “While China and the US are neck-and-neck on AI, humanoid robots are an area where China can claim to be ahead of the US, particularly in terms of scaling up production.”

Georg Stieler, the head of robotics and automation at the global technology consulting firm Stieler Technology and Marketing, also emphasized the symbolism of China's prime time broadcast.

“What distinguishes the gala from comparable events elsewhere is the directness of the pipeline from industrial policy to prime-time spectacle,” Stieler said in a statement.

Comparing this year's performances with last year's — when viewers saw “fundamentally a single choreographic mode” with limited motions including walking, twisting and kicking — Stieler said that one key signal of China's robot progress is “the ability to run large numbers of near-identical humanoids in synchronized motion with stable gaits and consistent joint behavior.”

However, “stage performance does not equate to industrial robustness, yet,” he added.

What the robots did was the result of being trained for a routine “hundreds or thousands of times — you could not just tell them to change direction or do something completely different.”

“These dance motions involve very little environmental perception and are essentially imitation learning plus a balance-keeping controller. That has little bearing on reliability in unstructured environments, a prerequisite for factory-grade deployment. Also the progress in dexterity is not as fast as in locomotion,” he added.

The unveiling of China's latest generation of robots underscores the country's broader technological ambitions.

By the end of 2024, China had registered 451,700 smart robotics companies, with a total capital of 6.44 trillion yuan (US$932.15 billion), according to state data.

Major government projects such as “Made in China 2025” and the 14th Five-Year Plan, have made robotics and AI key Beijing priorities.

Morgan Stanley projects that China's humanoid sales will more than double to 28,000 units this year; and Elon Musk has said he expects his biggest competitor to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its flagship humanoid Optimus.

“People outside China underestimate China, but China is an ass-kicker next level,” Musk said last month.

Marina Zhang (張越), a technology professor at the University of Technology Sydney, said that such a visible showcase likely hints at a new phase in China's manufacturing masterplan, “where robotics becomes a linchpin in the shift from low-cost assembly to high-end, smart manufacturing.”

US artificial intelligence (AI) chip titan Nvidia Corp unveiled tie-ups with Indian computing firms yesterday as tech companies rushed to announce deals and investments at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.

Mumbai cloud and data center provider Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) said it was teaming up with Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, to build what it touted as “India's largest gigawatt-scale AI factory.”

“We are laying the foundation for world-class AI infrastructure that will power India's growth,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang (黃仁勳) said in a statement that did not put a figure on the investment.

L&T said it would use Nvidia's powerful processors to provide data center capacity of up to 30 megawatts in Chennai and 40 megawatts in Mumbai.

Nvidia said it was also working with other Indian AI infrastructure players such as Yotta Data Services Pvt Ltd, which will deploy more than 20,000 top-end Nvidia Blackwell processors as part of a US$2 billion investment.

Dozens of world leaders and ministerial delegations have come to India for the summit to discuss the opportunities and threats, from job losses to misinformation, that AI poses.

Last year India leapt to third place — overtaking South Korea and Japan — in an annual global ranking of AI competitiveness calculated by Stanford University researchers.

However, despite plans for large-scale infrastructure and grand ambitions for innovation, experts say that the country has a long way to go before it can rival the US and China.

This year's AI conference has also brought a flurry of deals. On Tuesday, India's Adani Group said it would invest US$100 billion by 2035 to develop “hyperscale AI-ready data centers,” a boost to New Delhi's push to become a global AI hub.

Microsoft Corp said it was investing US$50 billion this decade to boost AI adoption in developing countries, while US AI start-up Anthropic PBC and Indian IT giant Infosys Ltd said they would work together to build AI agents for the telecoms industry.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva are expected to deliver a statement at the end of the week about how they plan to address concerns raised by AI technology.

Experts say that the broad focus of the event and vague promises made at previous global AI summits in France, South Korea and Britain mean that concrete commitments are unlikely.

Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research group Futurum, said that nonbinding declarations could still “set the tone for what acceptable AI governance looks like.”

However, “the largest AI companies deploy capabilities at a pace that makes 18-month legislative cycles look glacial,” Patience said. “So it's a case of whether governments can converge fast enough to create meaningful guardrails before de facto standards are set by the companies themselves.”



                                                                                OpenAI has warned US lawmakers that its Chinese rival DeepSeek (深度求索) is using unfair and increasingly sophisticated methods to extract results from leading US artificial intelligence (AI) models to train the next generation of its breakthrough R1 chatbot, a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News showed.
In the memo, sent on Thursday to the US House of Representatives Select Committee on China, OpenAI said that DeepSeek had used so-called distillation techniques as part of “ongoing efforts to free-ride on the capabilities developed by OpenAI and other US frontier labs.”
The company said it had detected “new, obfuscated methods” designed to evade OpenAI's defenses                                    


NEW IMPORTS:

On the other hand, Mercedes-Benz Taiwan said it is planning to lower the price of its five models imported from the US after the zero tariff comes into effect.
Tesla in a statement said it has no plan to adjust the prices of the US-made Model 3, Model S and Model X as tariffs are not the only factor the automaker uses to determine pricing policies.
Tesla said

Minogue launched her first own-label wine in 2020 in partnership with celebrity drinks expert Paul Schaafsma, starting with a basic rose but quickly expanding to include sparkling, no-alcohol and premium rose offerings.
The actress and singer has since wracked up sales of around 25 million bottles, with her carefully branded products pitched at low-to mid-range prices in dozens of countries.

A New York-based NGO has  launched a global initiative to rename the nation's overseas  missions, most of which operate under the name ""Taipei,"" to  ""Taiwan Representative Office (TRO),"" according to a news  release.

Ming Chiang (江明信), CEO of Hello Taiwan,  announced the campaign at a news conference in Berlin on  Monday, coinciding with the World Forum held from  Monday through Wednesday, the institution stated in the  release.

Speaking at the event, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Huang Jie (黃捷) said she  believed this renaming campaign would enable the  international community to see Taiwan clearly without the  constraints of an ambiguous identity.

""The new generation is eager to engage with the world,""  she said.

Taipei City  Councilor Miao Po-ya (苗博雅) said the use of ""Taipei"" in the nation's overseas  missions is a lingering irony of history.

The ""Taipei"" label was once used to avoid political  sensitivity, and it is now time for a change amidst evolving  global geopolitics, said Miao, who was also in attendance.

""Taiwan is a de facto country,"" Miao said, adding it  deserves a name that can accurately reflect its national  standing and strength.

Most of Taiwan's overseas missions in countries without  formal diplomatic ties use the ""Taipei"" designation --  primarily as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office  (TECO).

There are, however, a few exceptions, notably in  Lithuania, where the mission is officially titled the  Taiwanese Representative Office. Earlier this month,  Lithuania's Prime Minister Inga Ruginien? described  allowing the name as comparable to having ""jumped in  front of the train and lost.""



                                                                                A total lunar eclipse coinciding with the Lantern Festival on March 3 would be Taiwan's most notable celestial event this year, the Taipei Astronomical Museum said, urging skywatchers not to miss it.
There would be four eclipses worldwide this year — two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses — the museum's Web site says. 
Taiwan would be able to observe one of the lunar eclipses in its entirety on March 3. 
The eclipse would be visible as the moon rises at 5:50pm, already partly shaded by the Earth's shadow, the museum said.
It would peak at about 7:30pm, when the moon would

Ocean Affairs Council Deputy Minister Chang Chung-Lung (張忠龍) presided over the CGA event in the Port of Kaoshiung. Representatives of the National Security Council also attended the event.
Designed for long-range and protracted patrol operations at sea, the Lanyu is a 65.4m-long and 14.8m-wide ship with a top speed of 44 knots (81.5kph) and a cruising range of 2,000 nautical miles (3704km). 
The vessel is equipped with a                                    


DEFENSE:

The Executive Yuan has proposed the budget for major weapons purchases over eight years, from this year to 2033.
However, opposition lawmakers have refused to review the proposal, demanding that President William Lai (賴清德) first appear before the Legislative Yuan to answer questions about the proposed budget.
On Thursday last week, 37 bipartisan US lawmakers sent a letter to Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜), the heads

10:24 JST, February 18, 2026

Tokyo, Feb. 18 (Jiji Press)—Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's cabinet resigned en masse on Wednesday morning.

Takaichi, who also heads the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, became the first female prime minister of the country in October last year. With her initiative, the LDP forged a new coalition partnership with the Japan Innovation Party, after Komeito decided to leave the ruling camp.

The Diet, the country's parliament, will kick off a special session later on Wednesday, following the Feb. 8 House of Representatives election, which ended with the LDP securing over two-thirds of the 465 seats in the all-important Lower House.

During the day's session, an election for the prime minister will take place in both Diet chambers, with Takaichi expected to be reelected as prime minister.

The special Diet session will run for 150 days until July 17.

Ukraine has imposed a new package of sanctions against Belarus's leader, Alexander Lukashenko, for helping Russia to sustain its war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 18.

""We will significantly step up efforts to counter all forms of his facilitation of the killing of Ukrainians. We will work with our partners so that this has a global effect,"" Zelensky said. 

Russia reportedly deployed a network of drone-control relay systems in Belarus in late 2025 that expanded its ability to strike northern Ukrainian oblasts, including Kyiv and Volyn. These systems enabled some attacks on energy and rail infrastructure that otherwise ""would not have been possible,"" according to Zelensky. 

More than 3,000 Belarusian companies, Zelensky added, are supplying Russia with machinery and components, including parts used to manufacture missiles. 

Russia is also building infrastructure on Belarusian territory for the future deployment of its Oreshnik missile, which Zelensky noted was ""an obvious threat not only to Ukrainians but to all Europeans.""

""Lukashenko has for quite some time been trading Belarus's sovereignty for the continuation of his personal power, helping the Russians circumvent global sanctions over this aggression, actively justifying Russia's war, and now further increasing his own participation in scaling up and prolonging the war,"" Zelensky said.  ""There will be special consequences for this.""

The move to punish Lukashenko for aiding Russia's war effort has come amid U.S. President Donald Trump's easing of some U.S. sanctions against Belarus. The diplomatic thaw between the U.S. and Belarus led to the release of multiple political prisoners. 

Belarus was also invited to join Trump's so-called Gaza Peace Board, created to oversee a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas brokered by the U.S. last October.

Mark Zuckerberg speaks during an event in Redwood City, Calif., in November, 2025. The trial marks the first time the Meta CEO will face questions in front of a jury.Jeff Chiu/The Associated Press

Mark Zuckerberg will testify in an unprecedented social-media trial that questions whether Meta's platforms deliberately addict and harm children.

Meta's CEO is expected to answer tough questions on Wednesday from attorneys representing a now 20-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, who claims her early use of social media addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Meta Platforms and Google's YouTube are the two remaining defendants in the case, which TikTok and Snap have settled. 

Zuckerberg has testified in other trials and answered questions from Congress about youth safety on Meta's platforms, and he apologized to families at that hearing whose lives had been upended by tragedies they believed were because of social media. This trial, though, marks the first time Zuckerberg will answer similar questions in front of a jury. And, again, bereaved parents are expected to be in the limited courtroom seats available to the public.

Social-media companies stand trial in pair of landmark cases starting this week

The case, along with two others, has been selected as a bellwether trial, meaning its outcome could impact how thousands of similar lawsuits against social media companies would play out.

A Meta spokesperson said the company strongly disagrees with the allegations in the lawsuit and said they are “confident the evidence will show our long-standing commitment to supporting young people.”

One of Meta's attorneys, Paul Schmidt, said in his opening statement that the company is not disputing that KGM experienced mental health struggles, but rather that Instagram played a substantial factor in those struggles. He pointed to medical records that showed a turbulent home life, and both he and an attorney representing YouTube argue she turned to their platforms as a coping mechanism or a means of escaping her mental health struggles.

Zuckerberg's testimony comes a week after that of Adam Mosseri, the head of Meta's Instagram, who said in the courtroom that he disagrees with the idea that people can be clinically addicted to social media platforms. Mosseri maintained that Instagram works hard to protect young people using the service, and said it's “not good for the company, over the long run, to make decisions that profit for us but are poor for people's well-being.”

Much of Mosseri's questioning from the plaintiff's lawyer, Mark Lanier, centred on cosmetic filters on Instagram that changed people's appearance – a topic that Lanier is sure to revisit with Zuckerberg. He is also expected to face questions about Instagram's algorithm, the infinite nature of Meta' feeds and other features the plaintiffs argue are designed to get users hooked.

Meta is also facing a separate trial in New Mexico that began last week.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said he would consider a ban on social media for under-16s. Meanwhile, Berlin's ambassador to Iran is summoned for a reprimand over ""anti-Iranian activities"" in Germany. DW has more.

Here are the major headlines from Germany on Wednesday, February 18, 2026: 

The German men's ice hockey team's hopes for a Winter Olympic medal melted in the face of Slovakia on Wednesday.

Slovakia comfortably won the quarterfinal match 6-2 against the German team led by NHL star Leon Draisatl of the Edmonton Oilers. 

""This hurts,"" Draisatl said after the game. ""There were simply too many mistakes today: I don't even know how many counterattacks we allowed."" 

""We deserved to be eliminated,"" he concluded. 

Although bookmakers did not anticipate a German medal, and indeed slightly preferred Slovakia's chances for success in Milan, Germany was expected to put up a sterner fight against the same country that eliminated it from the 2022 Games in Beijing. 

Coach Harold Kreis said that although he did not want to make excuses, the fact that Germany played two games in consecutive games while Slovakia had three rest days could have played a role. 

Germany's last Winter Olympic ice hockey medal was silver in 2018.

Germany's slowing property construction industry picked up pace slightly in 2025, new figures from the government's Destatis statistics office showed on Wednesday.

In 2023, authorities approved the construction of a total of 238,500 new houses and apartments, combining both all-new constructions and renovations of pre-existing buildings. 

That's a 10.8% increase, or 23,200 more residences, than in 2024. It also bucks a consistent downward trend since 2021, when the overall figure was considerably higher even than last year. 

Construction Minister Verena Hubertz, a Social Democrat, welcomed the figures, saying ""the trend turnaround in house building has begun."" 

""The atmosphere in the industry has improved and investments are also rising,"" she said. 

She said that reduced bureaucratic hurdles and other promotional project would lead to the positive trend continuing in 2026, 

However, the German construction industry federation's head tim-Oliver Müller struck a more cautionary tone, saying: ""Not everything that gets approved necessarily gets built."" 

Deutsche Bahn says it has been targeted by a cyberattack that disrupted its digital services.

The German railway company said a so-called DDoS attack hit its IT systems around midday Tuesday, causing outages in travel information and booking tools on its website and in the Navigator app.

In a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack, an IT system is effectively bombarded with requests from a large number of sources, causing it to become overloaded and, in the worst case, crash. Many such attacks are considered a form of digital vandalism.

Deutsche Bahn had informed customers about the disruptions on Tuesday afternoon, and by the evening said the systems were largely running stably again.

On Wednesday morning, further problems occurred, and the company later cited the cyberattack as the cause.

""Our defensive measures took effect in order to keep the impact on our customers as low as possible,"" Deutsche Bahn said.

The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) is contesting the official outcome of Germany's 2025 federal election, with the Constitutional Court now set to review the case.

The populist left party has filed an election review complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court, the news magazine Stern reported, with a court spokesperson confirming this to news agency DPA.

In the 177-page submission, the BSW cited eight sworn affidavits from voters as evidence of alleged counting errors.

Party leader Amira Mohamed Ali told Stern the results were ""provably false"" and pointed to structural problems in the vote count that disadvantaged the BSW.

Sahra Wagenknecht said the party had demonstrated ""irregularities and systematic counting errors"" against it, stressing that the complaint is not about forcing entry into parliament but about correctly determining the election result and maintaining public trust in democracy.

The BSW narrowly missed the 5% threshold in the Feb. 23, 2025 election, winning 4.981% of second votes, falling short by 9,529 votes nationwide.

The party argues that miscounts could mean it should have secured seats, which would have changed the distribution of mandates and left Chancellor Friedrich Merz's CDU-SPD coalition without its own majority.

The Bundestag's election review committee examined the objections for months, but a majority found them unfounded, and parliament rejected a recount.

Racism in German public authorities is often embedded in routine, according to a new study.

Researchers at Leipzig's Research Institute for Social Cohesion, known as FGZ, have published the findings after a three-year review of job centers, immigration offices, police and customs, courts, health, youth and public order agencies, and social work.

The study found evidence of racist discrimination across all institutions when it comes to discretion and organizational culture. This occurs in different forms and levels of intensity, it said.

The researchers said language barriers pose a key structural risk, with support Germa application procedures varying widely depending on the case.

They reported that some applicants receive proactive help, while people with limited German skills are sometimes turned away or told their language ability is the problem.

The study also said regional differences in public attitudes and the broader social climate can be reflected in administrative practice.

Researchers recommended setting up independent complaint offices, expanding anti-racism training and reflection programs, and actively recruiting people from groups affected by discrimination at all levels of the civil service.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he has been surprised by the standing ovation for US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the Munich Security Conference last week.

Merz told the podcast ""Machtwechsel"" on Tuesday, ahead of the CDU party congress, that he would have struggled to stand up even if he had been in the room.

Last year, US Vice President JD Vance caused a stir at the conference with his sharp criticism of European allies.

Merz said Rubio's speech had reflected the worldview of the current US administration ""in friendlier packaging.""

Merz argued the reaction in the hall was driven by low expectations among participants.

""The community was pleased that an American was standing at the front who still addressed them as friends. That alone triggered a certain emotion.""

For him personally, Merz said, this wouldn't have been enough.

Before the speech, the chancellor said he had spoken at length with Rubio and discovered some common ground. ""For example, he still considers NATO important,"" said Merz.

Iran has summoned Germany's designated ambassador in protest, citing what it called ""anti-Iranian activities"" in Germany.

State media reported that Axel Dittmann was told of the Iranian government's objections during a meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Tehran.

The broadcaster said the move was linked to what it described as ""destructive"" positions taken by German politicians. It was unclear when the meeting took place, and Germany's Foreign Office did not initially comment.

The backdrop appears to be a large demonstration against Iran's leadership in Munich, where around 250,000 people gathered on Saturday. Several German politicians expressed solidarity with the protest movement, including Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann of the FDP and CDU foreign policy lawmaker Armin Laschet.

The rally was held on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference and was called for by Reza Pahlavi. Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, has emerged as a prominent opposition figure abroad.

Iran's security forces cracked down violently on mass protests in early January. The activist network HRANA has reported that more than 7,000 people were killed.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has also sharply criticized Iran's leadership.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he supports raising the minimum age for platforms like Instagram and TikTok, warning that teenagers spending five hours or more a day on screens can face social and personality problems.

Merz made the comments on the politics podcast ""Machtwechsel"" as a state branch of his conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) from Schleswig-Holstein submitted a proposal to set the minimum age at 16, paired with mandatory age verification.

""If children today, at the age of 14, have up to five hours or more of screen time a day, if all socialization takes place only through this medium, then we shouldn't be surprised about personality deficits and problems in the social behavior of young people.""

Merz said he has ""a lot of sympathy"" for the idea, as well as a similar proposal from his party's coalition partners, the center-left Social Democrats, who have outlined a tiered model including a full ban for children under 14.

The chancellor stressed he is usually cautious about bans but argued the priority must be protecting children at an age when they need time to play, learn, and focus in school.

Merz added that while children should learn how to handle electronic media in school, the argument that they must be introduced early ""does not hold up,"" comparing it to giving alcohol to elementary school pupils.

Guten Tag from the DW newsroom in Bonn.

As you join us, the debate on a social media ban for children up to the age of 16 has attracted comment from Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Merz says he is open to the idea, preferring that youngsters should be protected and have time to play and learn in the real world.

Germany is joining the list of nations considering a ban on social media for children, with both coalition partners drawing up plans. Meanwhile, figures show German industry cut around 124,000 jobs in 2025. DW has more.

This blog has now closed. We will be back in the morning with more updates from Germany on Wednesday. 

Here are the major headlines from Germany on Tuesday, February 17, 2026:

Iran has summoned Germany's ambassador in Tehran to protest what it described as ""anti-Iran activities"" in Germany.

It comes after around 250,000 people attended a protest against the Islamic Republic during the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.

The protesters were addressed by Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last shah of Iran, who has positioned himself as a potential new leader should the Islamic Republic fall.

""Following anti-Iran activities in Germany and destructive positions taken by officials of this country against the Islamic Republic of Iran in violation of international law, Axel Dittmann, Germany's ambassador in Tehran, was summoned to the foreign ministry and Iran's strong protest was conveyed to him,"" the official IRNA news agency said on Tuesday.

""The German ambassador said he would convey Iran's strong protest and deep dissatisfaction to Berlin.

A spokeswoman for Germany's foreign office in Berlin confirmed to the AFP news agency that the ambassador had been summoned, but did not offer details.

The German pharmaceutical giant Bayer has reached a $7.25-billion (€6.13-billion) settlement in a series of United States lawsuits related to a weedkiller which experts have said can cause cancer.

Bayer's US subsidiary Monsanto, which it acquired in 2018, is facing a class action from tens of thousands of plaintiffs who have attributed cancer to glyphosate, the active ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup.

Glyphosate manufacturer Bayer rejects the argument, as do several European institutions, but a panel of World Health Organization (WHO) experts have classified it as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""

Now, Bayer, based in the western German city of Leverkusen, hope that the agreed payments, which are to be made over 21 years and be reduced annually, can draw a line under the lawsuits.

Bayer chief executive Bill Anderson said the settlement – which must yet be approved by a court in St Louis, Missouri – ""provides an essential path out of the litigation uncertainty.""

The company, which also owns and operates German Bundesliga football club Bayer Leverkusen, insists that the settlement does not constitute any ""admission of guilt.""

A politician from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been fined €11,600 ($13,730) after a court ruled that a motif used on an election campaign poster in 2024 resembled a Nazi salute.

Wilko Möller, who represents the AfD in the state parliament in the northeastern state of Brandenburg, was found guilty of using symbols associated with unconstitutional organizations.

According to state prosecutors, Möller had commissioned a poster depicting ""pro-family"" policies and had explicitly requested that it show blond parents visibly protecting their children.

The resulting poster, which was displayed around the northeastern city of Frankfurt (Oder) – as opposed to the much larger Frankfurt (Main) in Hesse – showed a man and a woman with their arms extended at 45-degree angles forming a roof shape over three children sat on a sofa.

Prosecutors said the design created an ""optical correlation with the so-called Hitler salute (Hitlergruss)"" – and the court agreed.

However, while Möller was found guilty, the graphic designers were not and were acquitted.

Prosecutors in Aschaffenburg have charged a man with murder more than 41 years after the violent death of a trainee nurse in northern Bavaria.

Authorities said the former boyfriend of the 19-year-old Maria Köhler is accused of strangling her with a mesh scarf on July 30, 1984, out of jealousy and revenge.

More than three‑quarters of households in Germany spoke only German at home in 2024.

New figures from the Federal Statistical Office show 77% used exclusively German, while 17% spoke German plus another language. Just 6% did not use German at all at home.

Ahead of International Mother Language Day on February 21, officials said 15.5 million people primarily used another language at home. Turkish was the most common, followed by Russian and Arabic.

Among multilingual households, German remained the main language for about a quarter.

And in households with a family migration history, 22% spoke only German, while 23% spoke no German at home.

The northern state of Lower Saxony's internal intelligence agency will monitor the Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party as a ""surveillance object of considerable import"" on the far-right. 

Interior Minister Daniela Behrens and the state's intelligence agency head Dirk Pejril announced the move at a press conference on Tuesday.

Germany's economy is only slowly emerging from its downturn, with sentiment brightening slightly but remaining gloomy.

Helena Melnikov, managing director of the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), said the recovery was moving upward only in tiny steps.

A survey of around 26,000 companies has shown only a marginal improvement in business conditions at the start of the year.

Some optimism has come from export expectations, with 22% of firms forecasting higher shipments over the next 12 months — up three points from autumn.

The DIHK has slightly raised its economic outlook and is now expecting 1% growth in 2026, in line with the federal government.

Germany has been lagging internationally in growth, according to the DIHK.

The association previously forecast 0.7% growth for 2026 in November, while large-scale government spending on infrastructure and defense has been providing support.

The weak mood has long since reached the labor market, the DIHK said.
About 12% of companies plan to expand staffing, while 23% expect their workforce to shrink.

The digital industry group Bitkom says that 44% of people aged 65 and older now use social networks, up from 15% five years ago.

Bitkom said 1,004 people aged 65 and above were surveyed from September to October 2025. Usage was highest among those aged 65 to 69, with about two-thirds active on social media. Among people aged 70 to 74, the figure was 56%.

Use dropped in older age groups. Only 30% of those aged 75 to 79 reported using social networks, and 24% of those aged 80 and above.

Facebook was the most widely used platform among seniors, cited by 60%, followed by StayFriends at 31%. X was used by 20%, Instagram by 19%, and only 5% of social media users aged 65 and older said they used TikTok.

Germany's inflation rate is holding at 2.1% in January, confirming preliminary data and showing price pressures have strengthened at the start of the year, particularly with food and services.

Consumer prices were up only 0.1% from December, as cheaper energy partly offset higher costs elsewhere, according to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis). Energy prices fell 1.7% year over year, with household electricity down 3.2% and gas down 2.5%, helped by lower grid fees and the removal of the gas storage levy.

Food inflation accelerated to 2.1%, up from 0.8% in December, with especially steep increases for sweets and chocolate. Prices also climbed for fruit and meat, while butter, oils, and potatoes became noticeably cheaper compared with a year earlier.

""Overall, consumer price increases intensified at the beginning of the year,"" said Destatis President Ruth Brand. ""Food prices, in particular, rose more sharply in January than in the preceding months.""

Core inflation, excluding food and energy, remained elevated at 2.5%, highlighting persistent pressure in other sectors. Services rose 3.2% year over year, driven by higher costs in social facilities, transport, and rents.

Germany's industrial companies have cut around 124,100 jobs last year, showing an increasingly negative trend after 56,000 positions were lost the year before, according to an analysis by auditing firm EY.

EY said employment in industry has fallen by about 266,200 jobs, or nearly 5%, since the pre-pandemic year of 2019, with the sharpest reductions recorded in the automotive sector.

Weak revenue performance has driven job losses, the report said, with industrial turnover shrinking by 1.1% in nominal terms, after a steeper 3.5% decline the previous year.

EY found the auto, paper and textile industries were among the weakest performers, each posting revenue declines of roughly 3%.

Nearly 50,000 jobs were lost in the automotive industry alone last year, EY said, bringing the sector's job cuts since 2019 to around 111,000, a drop of 13%.

In contrast, employment rose against the broader trend in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry and in the electrical industry, up 3% and 2% respectively.

""German industry is in a deep crisis,"" EY's Jan Brorhilker said, adding that it would take a clear and sustained upswing to prevent further erosion in employment.

Germany has been debating tougher limits on children's access to social media, with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) now backing restrictions and proposing a formal ban for those under 14.

SPD leader Lars Klingbeil, who serves as Chancellor Friedrich Merz's deputy, told Der Spiegel that clear rules were needed. ""Protecting young people from the flood of hatred and violence on social media is ‌a top priority,"" he said.

A discussion paper signed by SPD lawmakers and state politicians called for platforms to block access for under-14s and to create special youth versions for ages 14 to 16, without algorithm-driven feeds, personalized content, endless scrolling or autoplay.

The paper also proposed making opt-outs from algorithmic recommendation systems the default for users over 16.

The move followed a similar proposal from Merz's conservatives, who have called for a ban for under-16s that is set to be discussed at their party conference.

Coalition pressure has made it increasingly likely the government will push for restrictions, although media regulation in Germany is handled at the state level and would require nationwide coordination to agree consistent rules.

The debate has been influenced by Australia's ban on social media for under-16s and growing European discussions on curbing platform access for children.

Germany last year appointed a special commission to examine online harms facing young people, with a report expected later this year.

Guten Tag from DW's newsroom in Bonn.

You join us as the debate rumbles on in Germany, as in many other countries around the globe, about a partial or full social media ban for under-16s.

Both coalition parties have mapped out how the measure might work in practice.

Australia has already introduced such a ban, and many of Germany's European counterparts are thinking about doing the same.

Materials obtained in a FOIA request show ICE agents have grossly ignored their training this past year.

Use of force incidents reported to ICE spiked during the first two months of the second Trump administration despite agents receiving training on respecting individuals' constitutional rights, according to recently obtained documents.

American Oversight, a nonprofit government watchdog group, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request last year, seeking information on the Trump administration's plan to escalate immigrant enforcement.

After suing the administration for  failing to release the records, American Oversight obtained documents that were published in a report on the group's website earlier this week. The documents contradict several Trump administration talking points that sought to downplay violence committed by ICE agents over the past year.

The documents show that high-ranking ICE officials were aware of a surge in reporting of excessive violence by agents as far back as March. The training materials also indicate that agents were also trained to respect constitutional rights of those who observed and documented  their activities, and that “citizens and noncitizens” could not be“stopped or detained by law enforcement without cause and/or a warrant,” including in their own homes.

“Officers were advised that they must obtain a warrant before searching an individual or making an arrest, and that they are required to identify themselves as immigration enforcement ‘as soon as it is practicable and safe to do so' when making an arrest,” the report from American Oversight also noted.”The officers were told their badges should be ‘clearly displayed when making a stop for officer safety/liability,' but were advised they are not required to publicly identify themselves before making an arrest.”

ICE agents and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration officers have failed to observe these rights on multiple occasions, forcing their way into homes without the proper documentation. 

The training materials also advised ICE agents that they could use “necessary and reasonable” force to quell “disruptive protesters” — but it also said that agents had a duty to attempt to deescalate the situation and issue warnings of arrest before doing so.

Multiple videos of demonstrations against ICE and other immigration agencies show that agents have ignored this instruction, including in the shooting death of Alex Pretti.

The materials obtained by American Oversight also explicitly informed agents that they cannot enter into people's homes — including immigrants without documentation — without a judicial warrant, and advised that administrative warrants do not authorize agents to enter homes or businesses.

The materials obtained stated that, in the first two months of 2025, there was a 353 percent increase in the reporting of excessive use of force by ICE agents. Officers in these incidents shattered car windows, deployed chemical agents, used extreme physical force to detain people, and killed at least one individual.

Despite ICE's increased use of force, the agency tended to ignore its own faults, focusing instead on prosecuting those who allegedly committed violence against agents.

“Emails show 67 incidents of ICE officers' use of force were reported between Jan. 19 and March 20, 2025. During that same period, 28 assaults on ICE agents were reported,” the report from American Oversight noted, adding that, in response to that smaller number, “the head of ICE's Office of Firearms and Tactical Program Use of Force Analysis Unit…suggested ways to increase prosecutions [against residents] in these instances.” 

“Officials did not make any similar comments on addressing the use of force by ICE officers, though there were more than twice as many of such incidents reported,” the report stated.

In spite of the training provided to agents, immigration officers appear to blatantly disregard their training, with little to no repercussions for agents who have violated those rules.

For example, Aliya Rahman, a disabled Minneapolis resident who was not interfering with ICE activities, was still pulled out of her car and detained by agents while she was on her way to a medical appointment. The agents had demanded that Rahman move her vehicle, even though there was nowhere else for her to go at the time. After dragging her out of the vehicle, they brought her to a detention center, denying her medical care in the process. As a result, Rahman ended up losing consciousness while in custody.

“I'm disabled trying to go to the doctor up there, that's why I didn't move,” Rahman later said in an interview.

But according to training materials, ICE agents are told to engage in use of force during vehicle stops only “where probable cause can clearly be established and there is some element of danger or threat.” Force should be “minimal,” and the manual explicitly states that agents do not receive “qualified immunity” for targeting people with “no immediate threat,” the documents state.

In a section titled “Negative Media and Social Media Coverage,” ICE training materials recognize that the prevalence of smartphones and social media means their work will now be documented more widely. The materials also note that such actions — “copwatching” — is “protected by the First Amendment.”

“Be mindful of your words and actions when performing your duties in public as it is likely that bystanders are in possession of recording devices and generally have the right to record you,” the materials state. 

Yet there are several examples of ICE and other DHS agents retaliating against people who dare to record them, including wrongly telling those who are recording their actions that it is illegal to follow and document their on-the-job activities. 

Despite documented instances of ICE agents breaking the law and ignoring training materials, Trump administration officials have defended their actions as legal. 

“Our ICE agents are following the law and are running their operations according to training,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in January. 

Chioma Chukwu, the executive director of American Oversight, said the materials the group received from its FOIA request contradict Noem's claims, showing a “deeply troubling picture of the violent methods used by ICE.”

Residents have been subjected to unnecessary violence from agents, resulting in people being “hospitalized, bystanders swept up in operations, and even the death of a U.S. citizen,” Chukwu told Politico, adding: “These records demonstrate a stark disconnect between the constitutional standards on which ICE claims to train its officers and the abusive and deadly enforcement practices we see detailed in these incident reports and on the streets of American cities in places like Minneapolis.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

This year families are creating makeshift spaces for prayer and planning communal meals on the wreckage of our homes.

For the third consecutive year, Ramadan unfolds as Gazans continue to endure crushing living conditions that strip us of our most basic human rights and dignity. The war may have nominally stopped, but its suffering has not. More than 83 percent of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed, while Israeli forces still control more than half of the Gaza Strip. As a result, many Gazans now live in overcrowded camps, sheltering in flimsy tents that offer no protection from the bitter cold of winter nor the heat of summer. These tents have turned daily life into a living nightmare, depriving families of the ability to experience the spiritual essence of Ramadan as we once did before the war.

Before the war in Gaza began, Ramadan was always a month eagerly awaited, when streets and homes were decorated with colorful lanterns and golden crescents. Traditional markets were filled with an array of dates, nuts, coffee, desserts, and pickles. Islamic nasheeds (devotional songs) resonated through the streets, creating a special and sacred atmosphere. Families would patiently await the Maghrib adhan — the call to prayer that occurs at sunset — to break their long day of fasting, gathering around iftar tables filled with a variety of delicious and vibrant foods, special drinks, and desserts made only during Ramadan, such as kharoub (a sweet drink made by steeping carob) and qatayef (pancake-like dumplings stuffed with nuts or cream). Children would run into the streets after our fast-breaking evening iftar meal, playing on swings, enjoying fireworks, and sharing laughter. Most importantly, mosques were filled with worshippers performing the Taraweeh nightly prayers, sacred ritual that fostered a sense of peaceful togetherness.

Over the past two Ramadans, all of us in Gaza were deprived of nearly everything that once made the month special. Streets that had once remained crowded late into the night fell silent by the afternoon, resembling ghost towns — no decorations, no lights, only an overwhelming emptiness. We fasted for long hours, and if we were fortunate, we broke our fast with nothing more than canned food, lentil soup, or bread made from expired flour. Most of the time, we ended iftar still hungry, painfully remembering how abundant and diverse our iftar tables had once been, shared in the warm presence of our loved ones. Moreover, relentless bombardment and bloody massacres prevented us from performing Taraweeh prayers together in the few remaining mosques, most of which had been destroyed by Israeli forces. In those years, Ramadan was for the first time stripped of its spiritual beauty, transformed from a month of mercy and reflection into one marked by pain and suffering.

Despite the terrible living conditions that persist in the current moment, many in Gaza see this Ramadan as a chance to reclaim some of the joys of the holy month that were lost over the past two years.

We cannot celebrate Ramadan as we did before Israel's war on Gaza, however, because the genocide has left nothing in our lives intact — many families have lost their homes, their loved ones, or both, and some are still unable to return to the neighborhoods they once called home, which remain under Israeli control. Access to basic necessities has become a luxury we can no longer afford. Moreover, the reality of living in tents has forced many into a life reminiscent of the Nakba. Yet, despite all this, the people around me remain determined to observe Ramadan in a way that feels markedly different from the previous two Ramadans spent amid war, making the most of what little they have.

 People have begun decorating their tents with lanterns and crescents made from humanitarian aid boxes.

Signs of resilience and hope are visible in the ways people have begun decorating their tents with lanterns and crescents made from humanitarian aid boxes, painting murals, cleaning the streets of rubble, and stringing illuminated lights. Traditional markets, such as Al-Zawya Market, have reopened, offering a variety of Ramadan goods and decorations. Dessert shops have started preparing an array of Arabic sweets that Gazans love to enjoy after iftar, including qatayef, kunafa (a crunchy, buttery dessert made with shredded phyllo dough), and awameh (deep-fried dough balls soaked in fragrant syrup). Families plan to hold communal iftars beside the rubble of their homes and are making makeshift mosques for Taraweeh prayers. Musaharatis walk through neighborhoods, beating drums as a way of welcoming Ramadan.

Alham Al-Harazeen 43, told me that before the war, Ramadan in her Al-Zaytoun neighborhood carried a special warmth. “I clearly remember how my daughters and I used to clean and decorate our home,” she said. “We worked tirelessly to prepare the iftar table with different kinds of food — desserts, salads, cheese-stuffed sambosa, and roasted chicken. We would invite friends to share iftar with us in our garden, under the olive trees my husband planted.”

She added that her home has since been completely destroyed and that her neighborhood now lies under Israeli control. Al-Harazeen and her family are currently living in a tent in western Gaza City. “We dreamed that the implementation of the second phase of the ceasefire would allow us to spend this Ramadan in our destroyed neighborhood, but that did not happen,” she told me.

Families plan to hold communal iftars beside the rubble of their homes and are making makeshift mosques for Taraweeh prayers.

Despite the harsh living conditions in the tents and the distance from her neighborhood, Al-Harazeen said her family is trying to cope and preserve the spirit of Ramadan, especially for the sake of their children. “For my young children, I cleaned the tent, bought a new carpet, colorful decorations, and prayer clothes, and prepared an empty space in front of the tent where we could have iftar meals,” she said. “I just want them to feel that this Ramadan is different.”

Sojood Al-Khor, 23, told me that for her family, Ramadan this year will be entirely different from the two Ramadans experienced during the war, which were distorted by pain and suffering.

She explained that the spiritual beauty of the past two Ramadans was destroyed as fear and depression dominated people's lives, alongside the hardships of displacement, heavy bombardment, constant anxiety, and the bitterness of loss. She also pointed to the severe shortage of food and clean water, saying, “We used to fast knowing that our iftar would be nothing more than a bowl of lentil soup.”

She added, “Today, we are awaiting Ramadan with great enthusiasm. We long to hear the call to prayer echoing through the streets, to eat healthy and delicious food, followed by qatayef — sweets from which the occupation deprived us for years.”

Al-Khor continued, “We will eat maqluba [a layered dish of spiced rice, meat and vegetables], traditional maftoul [bulgur couscous], and Palestinian musakhan [roasted chicken with sumac]. We will drink juice and clean water. We will celebrate without rockets interrupting our joy and without the screams of loss.”

She concluded, “We thank God for this blessing and ask Him to preserve it, make it complete, and spare us from returning to suffering once again.”

Meanwhile, Ahmed Al-Bourdini, 43, told me that, like many Gazans, he had hoped to enjoy this Ramadan after two years of deprivation. However, the harsh reality surrounding him has made that impossible.

“I live in a torn tent that does not have enough space for my seven family members. I also lost my job as a carpenter as a result of the war. I see the markets filled with types of food we have been deprived of for years, but I cannot afford to buy any of them,” Al-Bourdini said. “The only food we have throughout the day is what my children receive from the charity kitchen — nothing more than lentils, rice, or beans — meals we have grown tired of eating.”

“We will gather around the iftar table, but we will still be missing many of our loved ones, including my aunt, my uncle, and my friends, who were killed in the war.”

“It breaks my heart that Ramadan is coming and I cannot afford to prepare a vibrant, delicious iftar table for my children,” he said.

Samar Alsindawi, 27, said that although she sees this Ramadan as an opportunity to reclaim some of the joys she and her family were deprived of, it remains a sad one.

“This Ramadan allows us to feel some of the spiritual essence of the holy month,” she told me. “I can see decorations, and markets resonating with Islamic nasheeds and filled with foods we were long deprived of, including vegetables, fruits, eggs, and chicken. However, we are still missing many things that made Ramadan special and can never be restored. We lost our home and our neighborhood — the very place that once gave Ramadan its meaning — and now most of us are living in tents in the streets.”

“We will gather around the iftar table, but we will still be missing many of our loved ones, including my aunt, my uncle, and my friends, who were killed in the war — the people we laughed with, shared iftar with, and prayed Taraweeh alongside,” she concluded. “Without them, every Ramadan will feel empty.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

 Latin America's Warning for U.S. Democracy

 Gustavo Flores-Macías

In August 2025, residents of Washington, D.C., awoke to a sight familiar in much of Latin America but rare in the United States: uniformed military troops patrolling city streets as part of a federally directed campaign against crime. Although violent crime in the country's capital had fallen that January to its lowest point in over 30 years, on August 11 President Donald Trump signed an executive order that declared a “crime emergency” in the city, arguing that extraordinary measures were necessary to restore control. But the subsequent deployment of the National Guard—a military reserve force that can serve at both the state and federal levels in response to domestic crises or international conflict—signaled something beyond a wish to address a public safety concern. It represented a transformation in how the United States governs itself.

What unfolded in Washington was not an isolated episode. Over the course of Trump's second term, his administration has sent or attempted to send units of the National Guard to major U.S. cities including Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, New Orleans, and Portland, framing each case as a response to crime, unrest, or threats to public order. Together, these cases mark the gradual erosion of the long-standing boundary between civilian policing and military force.

For American observers, such a shift may feel unprecedented. In Latin America, however, it is a well-worn path. Across the region, politicians have deployed the armed forces to fight crime, promising that their presence will produce swift improvements in public safety and restore order. These policies often begin as temporary responses to emergencies, but they rarely remain so. Instead, military involvement in domestic law enforcement becomes normalized, power concentrates in the executive, civilian institutions weaken, and civil liberties erode. Democratic institutions hollow out, slowly but surely.

The United States has long resisted this temptation. The separation of civilian policing from military force, deeply ingrained in both U.S. law and custom, has acted as a bulwark for American democracy. But the National Guard deployments, as sustained policing under federal command, challenge that separation. State governors can and have used National Guard troops to address local emergencies, but such operations are typically limited to assisting with natural disasters, riots, crowd control, and guarding buildings rather than participating in sustained law enforcement missions. And once the line between soldier and police officer is blurred, it is extraordinarily difficult to redraw. This is a reality Latin Americans know all too well, and one Americans may soon come to learn.

The political logic behind militarizing policing is straightforward. Crime generates fear, and fear creates a demand for visible, decisive action. Militaries—which are often among countries' most trusted institutions—offer executives a powerful symbol of order, discipline, and resolve. Deploying soldiers to the streets signals strength, even when the underlying drivers of crime remain untouched.

For leaders confronting insecurity, militarizing policing is politically expedient precisely because it is legible, dramatic, and immediate. Regardless of its effectiveness, it tends to be popular because it offers a seemingly simple and decisive solution. It reassures communities by conveying a sense of retaking lost control. But no matter how popular it may be, militarization has harmful consequences for democratic institutions. Crime emergencies—often called “states of exception” in Latin America—give executives opportunities to expand their powers, degrade legislative and judicial oversight, and marginalize opponents. Civilian police forces stagnate or weaken while soldiers take on policing functions for which they are poorly suited. Government forces' accountability declines and human rights abuses rise as soldiers ill equipped to protect civilians operate without constraints.

The Latin American experience shows how easily the militarization of internal security can become entrenched. Consider Mexico. In the 1990s, presidents increasingly used the military for internal security, dramatically expanding deployments after President Felipe Calderón declared a “war on drugs” in 2006. Two decades later, homicide rates in the country remain high, and abuses by security forces—including extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances—have become widespread. Even left-of-center presidents who campaigned on demilitarization, such as Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who led the country from 2018 to 2024, have found it politically costly and institutionally challenging to reverse course. Once soldiers replaced civilian police in the fight against organized crime, the boundary between emergency and normal governance dissolved.



Brazil's experience follows a similar pattern. Presidents have repeatedly sent troops into urban neighborhoods, including Rio de Janeiro's favelas, to combat gangs and drug trafficking. Between 1992 and 2025, Brazilian executives have issued an average of about five decrees to “guarantee law and order” every year, and these military interventions have become normalized. Residents in certain areas have grown accustomed to periodic deployments involving patrols, searches, and arrests conducted by soldiers rather than police. The Brazilian armed forces' excessive use of force in policing operations is well documented. But comprehensive statistics on abuse are hard to come by, and because soldiers' actions during policing operations fall under military jurisdiction, victims cannot easily hold them to account for civil rights violations. Civilian nongovernmental organizations struggle even to scrutinize and document the extent of the abuse.

The military's central role in Brazilian law enforcement is driven in part by the country's legacy of military rule between 1964 and 1985. But the case of Ecuador illustrates how rapidly militarization can take hold even in a country without a long history of military rule. Beginning in the late 2010s and accelerating after a surge in organized criminal violence in 2021, successive Ecuadorian governments have increasingly turned to the armed forces for domestic policing. Presidents have declared repeated states of exception, authorizing soldiers to patrol streets, conduct searches without warrants, and assist police operations in urban centers and prisons. Although these measures were initially framed as temporary responses to extraordinary violence, they quickly became routine. Today, military deployments are no longer exceptional but an expected component of public safety policy. Although popular, such measures have done little to resolve underlying criminal dynamics. The country's homicide rate, for example, increased more than fivefold between 2020 and 2025. Moreover, much-needed efforts to reform policing have taken a back seat as government funds are channeled toward military operations. 

El Salvador demonstrates the end point of this trajectory. In 2022, President Nayib Bukele implemented a 30-day state of exception that suspended citizens' rights of free association and assembly, due process, and access to legal counsel. His administration also established the government's right to detain people indefinitely before trial, conduct trials in absentia, and sentence minors as adults. Because of a steady reduction in violent crime since 2018—the year before Bukele took office—and the measures' popularity, that state of exception has now been renewed 47 times by the legislature, which Bukele's party controls, transforming into a permanent governing framework. The crackdown has sharply reduced reported homicides, but it has also radically transformed El Salvador's regime, creating a system that perpetuates mass incarceration, indefinite detention, and the dismantling of judicial independence. Elections still occur, but meaningful constraints on executive power have largely vanished.

These and other cases in the region differ in context and outcome, but they share a common arc. Militarized public safety blurs the civilian-military divide, expands executive authority, and weakens institutions designed to constrain it. Even when its effectiveness is limited and its costs to liberal democracy are clear, military involvement in domestic policing becomes difficult to unwind once it is normalized.

This pattern raises an important question whose answer is often assumed rather than sought: Does militarized policing actually work? The popularity of military deployments, which enables their persistence, rests on the promise of restored order and reduced violence. Yet the empirical record is far less clear. In fact, existing research offers little support for the claim that military policing reduces crime over the long term. In the aftermath of Mexico's militarization, its homicide rate more than tripled from nine to 29 homicides per 100,000 people between 2006 and 2019. Ecuador, for its part, went from being one of the safest to one of the most violent countries in the region; between 2020 and 2023, its homicide rate increased from seven to 44 homicides per 100,000 people. Although Brazil's national homicide rate has gradually declined in recent years, the country's northeast has seen a surge in violent crime exacerbated, at least in part, by the government's militarized response.

Studies have found that at best, troop deployments in Latin America might temporarily suppress violence but do not address the structural drivers of crime, from poverty and inequality to generalized corruption. Even worse, the measures can be counterproductive, possibly even increasing violence in the long term. Extensive evidence, including from research by the political scientists Robert Blair and Michael Weintraub on Colombia and my own with the Latin America scholar Jessica Zarkin on Mexico, suggests in fact that using soldiers in policing operations leads to more violence and human rights abuses than deploying civilian police does. Moreover, militarization often undermines civilian police forces by diverting their resources to the military, eroding public trust in them, and generating the perception that civilian institutions writ large are unable to solve society's problems, all of which hinders accountability and much-needed reforms.



El Salvador's drastic reduction of violent crime is often hailed as a successful case of militarization. After the country's homicide rate peaked in 2015, the highest in the Western Hemisphere that year, El Salvador's reported homicide rate is now the lowest in the hemisphere. Although the steep downward trend began before Bukele took office, this continued decline has earned Bukele sky-high popularity among Salvadorans—who had been desperate for solutions to insecurity—and, in 2024, a comfortable reelection to a second presidential term.

But Bukele's path to his alleged success should be no example for a liberal democracy that prizes its citizens' civil liberties and freedoms. The state of exception that paved the way for Bukele to get results on public safety has come through a suspended constitutional order in which anything goes. According to Amnesty International, thousands of arbitrary detentions and violations of due process have taken place since the state of exception began. This is hardly an example for addressing crime in a democratic system in which checks against government abuse are paramount to that system's survival.

The United States is unlikely to be immune to these dynamics. Although the National Guard has some key domestic roles, including providing disaster relief, addressing health emergencies, and controlling riots, units are not trained primarily for ongoing civilian policing. The military's rules of engagement, organizational culture, and legal frameworks differ fundamentally from those of police departments. These mismatches raise the risk of rights violations while offering little assurance that public safety will improve.

The deeper impact of these deployments is not on crime statistics but on the constitutional order. Militarized policing strengthens the executive at the expense of all other levels of government. State and local governments, which often know the needs of their communities the best, are sidelined from essential decision-making in favor of military commanders, who are often disconnected from the communities that their policies affect.

Emergency declarations also make it difficult for other branches of government to check executive power. Afraid of coming across as soft on crime, legislators become less likely to question emergency measures, and legislative oversight weakens. Although courts are typically less sensitive to public opinion, the declaration of crime emergencies often restricts or eliminates habeas corpus—which prevents unlawful detention—and due process, making judicial review harder, raising the bar for legal challenges, and increasing judicial deference to both the executive and the military.



Latin America's experience with militarization makes this clear. In Mexico, civilian courts have shown considerable deference to the armed forces. And even though constitutional changes in 2014 established that soldiers could be tried in civilian courts for crimes against civilians, in practice, military authorities often limit or block the ability of civilian prosecutors to access evidence and collect testimony from witnesses. According to the nonprofit organization Washington Office on Latin America, 97 percent of abuses by the armed forces that are investigated by the Mexican attorney general's office go unpunished. Civilian police departments receive little funding, and the military has become increasingly involved in public life, including in building and managing infrastructure projects.

In Ecuador, organized crime groups are now considered “terrorist and belligerent nonstate actors” following a January 2024 declaration of internal armed conflict, which limited citizens' freedom of assembly and transit and expanded the military's ability to conduct home searches without a warrant. President Daniel Noboa has consistently renewed states of exception, turning them into the norm. In El Salvador, Bukele's party replaced every judge on the country's constitutional court under the guise of protecting the president's crime-fighting agenda. In Brazil, surveys during Jair Bolsonaro's presidency, which lasted from 2018 to 2024, suggested that nearly half the population would have supported the military staging a coup to take power—a direct consequence of the military's increasing involvement in public affairs and the erosion of faith in the ability of civilians to resolve society's problems.

American democracy has long benefited from a clear institutional separation between civilian and military roles. This division has been a central tenet of U.S. governance since the founding of the republic, shared even by those with opposing political views. Alexander Hamilton, a Federalist, warned that military establishments undermine republican government, infringe on civil liberties, and lead to despotism. Brutus, an anonymous but widely read Antifederalist, expressed graver concerns that manufactured crises would serve as a pretext for attempts by the military to override civilians' liberty. In 1807, Congress passed the Insurrection Act to clarify confusing prior legal frameworks that allowed the president to call on state militias in cases of violent revolts such as the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion. But in passing the act, the legislature was careful to limit the executive branch's ability to deploy federal troops domestically: it can do so only when federal law cannot be enforced through regular channels or when state authorities cannot or will not protect citizens' constitutional rights. Then, in 1878, Congress adopted the Posse Comitatus Act as a form of late institutional repair, an effort to address the founders' early concerns about military abuse; it sought to prevent the military deployments that took place in the South during Reconstruction. The act expressly forbids the use of federal troops to execute domestic laws except under specific circumstances, such as the need to address an insurrection.

These normative and legal frameworks explain why Washington had historically gone to extreme lengths to avoid militarized policing. The Insurrection Act, for its part, has been invoked only in extraordinary circumstances, such as when President Dwight Eisenhower deployed federal troops to Arkansas in 1957 to enforce school desegregation. In the United States, a clear civil-military separation has always limited the president's ability to govern by force instead of by law. Its erosion, even a partial or incremental one, risks reshaping the balance of power in ways that would outlast any single administration. It also risks undermining the public's trust in civilian governments.



The United States still has options. Governors and mayors are engaging in legal fights to assert state and local control over public safety. The judiciary has served as a check against some deployments: in December, the Supreme Court allowed lower court rulings against the federalization of the National Guard in Chicago to stand. But these safeguards depend on political will and a generalized understanding of the negative consequences that come with blurring the line between soldiers and police. Although some may see the militarization of policing as a necessary evil to advance the agenda of a government they support, the use of these measures tends to outlive the leaders who adopt them, becoming available to future governments with very different visions.

Once militarized policing becomes normalized, efforts to demilitarize face broad resistance: from voters accustomed to displays of force, from security institutions hesitant to give up their expanded power and resources, and from leaders reluctant to relinquish their broadened authority. Every time troops are deployed to American communities for public safety reasons, even if temporarily and even if they seem to be contributing to reductions in crime, this central pillar of our democracy erodes. If Americans come to accept military patrols as a routine response to crime, the distinction that once protected U.S. democracy may fade quietly—without a dramatic rupture, but with lasting consequences.

            Witkoff and Kushner.
    


            It sounds like an elite law firm, a 1970s cop show or even a duo of visionary architects, since they hope to turn battlefields into futuristic cityscapes.
    


But Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are running President Donald Trump's freelance peacekeeping franchise, on which global stability, countless lives and their boss's best hope of that elusive Nobel Peace Prize depend.
    


            The pair were in the thick of it Tuesday, on an extraordinary double-barreled day of diplomacy in Geneva, huddling with Russian, Ukrainian and Iranian officials. They're expected back in Washington this week for a meeting of the Board of Peace — Trump's personal big-dollar private global diplomacy network.
    


            The two super-rich, well-connected American dealmakers are charged with ending one vicious war and preventing one that might be about to erupt. Success in either case would be a huge achievement, but both goals seem intractable.
    


            Trump's hopes for a deal with Iran, as he masses a vast armada within shooting distance, only crawled forward Tuesday. The Iranians touted an understanding on “guiding principles.” But Vice President JD Vance told Fox News that while things “went well” in some ways, Tehran won't acknowledge some of Trump's red lines.
    


            The first of two days of talks between Ukraine and Russia also highlighted a big potential roadblock: the question of whether Moscow really wants to end the fighting or is only playing at diplomacy to buy time for battlefield wins.
    


            Still, talks are taking place. Given global skepticism about the prospects for agreements and of the Witkoff and Kushner double act, this is an achievement in itself and a mark of Trump's desire to work for peace.
    


            Witkoff and Kushner's latest efforts come at a perilous moment for the world and a politically tenuous one for Trump's presidency.
    


            ► Their biggest win so far — the ceasefire in Gaza — is fragile amid renewed fighting. The transition to the disarmament of Hamas still seems like a pipe dream. A possible renewal of full-scale war would worsen the misery of Palestinian civilians and again threaten Israeli security.
    


            ► At the same time, the Ukraine war is grinding through another winter, amid battlefield carnage and Russian attacks on defenseless civilians. The longer the war goes on, the greater the risk that it spills over into a NATO-Russia conflict. Maybe no one can end the war. But Trump probably has a better chance than anyone.
    


            ► The president, meanwhile, is getting inexorably dragged closer to a war with Iran that he may have to fight to save face and protect his own credibility. But polls show Americans don't want it.
    


            Each separate negotiation risks running into the same brick wall — the parties' refusal to compromise on issues they see as existential to national survival or honor. For President Vladimir Putin, this means fighting on at least until he seizes the reminder of the eastern Ukrainian Donbas region on which he's already spent tens of thousands of Russian lives. The government in Kyiv cannot cede the region — as the Trump administration apparently wants — because of its own massive casualties and because it forms fortifications vital to the defense of the capital.
    


            Iran has its own potential deal-breakers. While it's ready to discuss concessions on a nuclear program already shattered by US attacks last year, Tehran is refusing to bargain away its ballistic missile program and regional proxy networks, which it views as crucial to the survival of the Islamic revolutionary regime.
    


            Trump sometimes appears willing to take any deal to celebrate clinching it. But he'd lose face if he inks an agreement that offers Tehran sanctions relief and looks like the Obama-era nuclear pact he destroyed. He said on Friday that regime change “would be the best thing that could happen.” But if he tries to force it, he may unleash regional, political and economic consequences he can neither predict nor control.
    


            “If the parties want a limited and achievable agreement, they're going to have a deal,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, told CNN's Becky Anderson on Monday. “If they want to go for overreach, they're going to have a war.”
    


            Witkoff and Kushner might be unorthodox. But they have the indispensable credential every successful peace negotiator needs — empowerment by the president. Special envoy Witkoff, a wealthy real estate developer, has been a Trump friend for decades. Kushner has no official government role. But he's the husband of Trump's daughter Ivanka, and therefore family. Neither appears to have any political ambition outside polishing Trump's legacy.
    


            Each man personifies Trump's unique brand of foreign policy. They're business tycoons who disdain formal diplomatic and governmental structures and seem to see every global conflict as a potential real estate deal. Each also has huge commercial interests in the Middle East and elsewhere, a concern for critics who believe Trump makes no distinction between his own interests and the nation's.
    


            “We can't spend our time focused on perception as much as we have to focus on the facts,” Kushner told CBS' “60 Minutes” in a joint interview with his partner in October. “We're here to do good. These are impossible tasks.”
    


            But their double act also stirs concern among US allies and former US officials. Part of it is down to inexperience. Witkoff, for example, seems to emerge from meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin singing the Kremlin strongman's tune. “I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,” he said last year, of a man who launched an illegal, unprovoked invasion and has massacred thousands of Ukrainians.
    


            Concern grew over a transcript of a phone call reviewed and transcribed by Bloomberg last year that showed Witkoff coaching a top Russian official on how to talk to Trump. And a 28-point peace plan he drew up last year could have been written by Moscow. It took weeks of diplomatic sanding down, including by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, before it could serve as the basis for talks.
    


            Still, despite huge skepticism that their quasi-official partnership could master the diplomatic game while bypassing traditional US foreign policy norms, Witkoff and Kushner are responsible for one of the most significant foreign policy successes of Trump's second term: the Gaza ceasefire deal.
    


            Their quiet diplomacy and networks in the region — both in Israel and the Gulf states that will be asked to finance rebuilding — secured an official end to the fighting based on 20-point peace plan. This included the return of living and deceased Israeli hostages from Gaza in return for significant releases of Palestinian prisoners and large quantities of humanitarian aid entering the devastated strip.
    


            But the first stage of the deal — as difficult as it was — is the easy part. The second stage involves the disarming of Hamas, the entry of an international stabilization force to bolster a transitional technocratic government and the initiation of a reconstruction plan to be monitored by the Board of Peace. Trump said Sunday that members had pledged $5 billion toward rebuilding and thousands of troops to the stabilization force. “The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History,” he said on social media.
    


            But Phase 2 of the plan seems, for now, like a nonstarter. There's little chance nations will put their troops into a war zone, and at least 11 people died in Israeli airstrikes over the weekend, Reuters reported. And both Israel and Hamas regularly accuse the other of sabotaging the ceasefire agreement.
    


            “Boards of Peace don't mediate conflicts. Mediators mediate conflicts. The president knows this,” former US Middle East peace negotiator Aaron David Miller told CNN's Richard Quest last week. “He mediated, unlike all of his predecessors (and) brought (an) extraordinarily a degree of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to do phase one, and he has got his son-in-law and one of his best friends, Steven Witkoff, mediating or trying to mediate deconfliction with Iran and Russia-Ukraine.”
    


            But Miller argued that arms decommissioning was still a long shot. “The notion that Hamas is going to give up its guns before the Israelis withdraw, or frankly, before Hamas gets an opportunity to take over the Palestinian National Movement, which is what they want, is slim to none. And I am sorry to say, for the sake of the 2 million Palestinians in Gaza and Israeli civilians, slim already left town.”
    


            This reality points to a major liability of the Witkoff-Kushner approach. Conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine can superficially seem like land disputes, but they are far more complex than a knotty business problem. For those involved, the land is more than a future construction site. It's alive with symbolism and encapsulates history, identity and survival.
    


            Trump's impatience also means Witkoff and Kushner are under the kind of pressure that can lead to superficiality. Successful US peace efforts usually followed painstaking and intricate diplomacy. The Camp David Accords in the Carter presidency were the culmination of an entire term of preparatory work. The Dayton Accords that ended the war in the former Yugoslavia followed months of daring wartime diplomacy and relentless US duress on the parties led by Richard Holbrooke, the most talented American diplomat of his generation.
    


            The US also played a key role in the British government's Northern Ireland efforts — which took years to deliver the decommissioning of the IRA's weapons and eventual peace.
    


            Still, history also shows that using unofficial envoys outside the government's official structures can work.
    


            President Franklin Roosevelt maintained layers of personal emissaries in World War II to outwit other power centers in the government and to ensure he was the sole American with a full overview of the conflict. President Richard Nixon and his national security adviser Henry Kissinger set up a parallel foreign policy operation to cut out the State Department — much as Trump has done — and they opened a historic channel to communist China.
    


            But Trump's evisceration of the department has deprived his administration of institutional memory and expertise that might have built on any breakthroughs by Kushner and Witkoff.
    


            Ultimately, breakthroughs may require more than drive-by summits in Geneva. And America's amateur peacemakers may have Trump's ear, but they have yet to prove they belong in the geopolitical big leagues alongside a Machiavellian Putin, a manipulative political survivor like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the theocratic fascism of Hamas.

            Microsoft says it is on track to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring artificial intelligence to lower-income countries, as concerns mount over the technology's potential to deepen inequality.
    


            The announcement was made Wednesday at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where leading tech executives, government officials and AI researchers are debating how to use AI to solve real-world problems.
    


            Policymakers globally are increasingly worried that the unequal adoption of AI risks widening income and development gaps between rich and poor countries. In December, the United Nations Development Project called for global cooperation on standards and safety to ensure the technology “functions as a shared public good rather than a concentrated advantage.”
    


            At the summit, Microsoft likewise expressed the need for cross-border partnerships to prevent poorer countries from being left behind.
    


            “We need to act with urgency to address the growing AI divide,” Microsoft president Brad Smith and chief responsible AI officer Natasha Crampton said in a joint statement. “Artificial intelligence is diffusing at an impressive speed, but its adoption around the world remains profoundly uneven.”
    


            The company's $50 billion commitment to developing economies by 2030 compares with the roughly $80 billion that Microsoft invested into data centers last year alone, more than half of which was directed to a single economy: the United States.
    


            A recent Microsoft report found that AI usage in the global north, a catch-all term for developed and high-income countries, is roughly twice that of the global south — and growing.
    


            “This disparity impacts not only national and regional economic growth, but whether AI can deliver on its broader promise of expanding opportunity and prosperity around the world,” Smith and Crampton said.
    


            They warned that, just as unequal access to electricity has exacerbated a growing economic gap between the global north and south, without urgent action, the AI divide could perpetuate that disparity in the century ahead.
    


            On the other hand, the technology could be used positively to help poor countries leapfrog older development pathways. “If AI is deployed broadly and used well by a young and growing population, it offers a real prospect for catch-up economic growth for the Global South,” said Smith and Crampton.
    


            “It might even provide the biggest such opportunity of the 21st century,” the pair said.
    


            Microsoft's $50 billion investment will, among other things, help to build the data centers crucial to providing the computing power needed to run AI models. Extending internet access is another focus.
    


            Only about 36% of Africa's population had broadband internet access in 2022, according to the World Bank. That compares with some 90% of US households, official figures show.
    


            The AI Impact Summit, hosted by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highlights the country's ambition to position itself as an AI leader in the global south.
    


            High-profile attendees include Sam Altman of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai who is due to deliver a keynote address on Friday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic candidates have notched a series of wins in recent special elections — but a new AP-NORC poll finds views of the Democratic Party among rank-and-file Democrats have not bounced back since President Donald Trump's victory in 2024. 

Only about 7 in 10 Democrats have a positive view of the Democratic Party, according to new polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. While the overwhelming majority of Democrats still feel good about their party, they're much less positive than they've been in the past.




The midterm elections are still many months away, and lackluster favorability doesn't spell electoral doom. Other factors could benefit Democrats this year, including broadly negative views of Trump and other Republicans. Additionally, recent polling has found that independents tend to identify more with the party that's out of power, which could boost Democrats this year too. Historically, the party not in the White House has picked up seats in Congress in midterm elections.

But the lack of enthusiasm could be a longer-term problem for the party. Democrats' favorability of their party plummeted after the 2024 election, from 85% in September 2024 to 67% in October 2025. And despite overwhelming victories in November's off-season elections and a string of wins since then, those views haven't recovered. Other polling indicates that Democrats are deeply frustrated with their party.

At the same time, there's some potential good news for Democrats in the new poll. Although Republicans are slightly more enthusiastic about their own party, Americans in general don't think highly of either party. Health care is on many Americans' minds this year, and it's an issue where Democrats have a large advantage, according to the survey. Meanwhile, Republicans have lost some ground on two of Trump's signature issues, the economy and immigration, although Americans don't necessarily trust Democrats more on those issues as a result.




Other polling suggests that Democrats' post-2024 slump is unusually large.

In Gallup's measure of favorability, Democrats' positive views of their own party declined about 12 percentage points in the last year. That marked the lowest measure in that question's history, which dates back to 2001. Notably, Democrats did not see a similar decline after their first loss to Trump in 2016.




That diminished view of the Democratic Party in the AP-NORC polling is consistent regardless of Democrats' age, race, ideology or educational background — suggesting that appealing to a specific group or two won't fix the problem. 

A separate survey from the Pew Research Center last fall found roughly two-thirds of Democrats in September said their own party made them “frustrated” compared to just 4 in 10 Republicans.

Among those frustrated Democrats, about 4 in 10 felt their party was not fighting hard enough against Trump while about 1 in 10 said there was a lack of good leadership or a cohesive agenda. 

It's not just Democrats — Americans aren't thrilled with either party right now.

Roughly one-quarter of Americans have a negative view of both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, according to the AP-NORC data. That double-negativity is especially sharp among independents and Americans under 45.

About half of U.S. adults only view one party positively, and only about 1 in 10 feel good about both parties. 

But Democrats' loss of goodwill is more recent. Polling over the last 25 years from Gallup shows that Americans used to feel much more positively toward the Democrats. Around 2010, public sentiment turned against the Democrats. Since then, at least half of Americans have held unfavorable views of the party, according to Gallup. 




Negative views of the Democrats now rival the most negative points in time for the Republicans.

With health care at the top of Americans' priority lists as costs and premiums rise, Democrats have a possible advantage going into the midterm year. 

About one-third of U.S. adults — 35% — trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared to 23% for the Republicans. That is broadly in line with the last time the question was asked in October 2025. 

At the same time, Republicans have lost some ground on the issues that were key to Trump's reelection — the economy and immigration. But Democrats haven't managed to capitalize on it. Only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults, 31%, say Republicans are the party they trust to handle the economy, down slightly from 36% last year. But Democrats haven't made any gains on this issue; rather, slightly more Americans now say they trust “neither” party to handle the economy. 




Neither party has an edge on who is better equipped to manage the cost of living, which was first asked in the most recent poll. 

Republicans are also down slightly on handling immigration. Only about one-third of U.S. adults trust them to better handle immigration, an apparent decrease from 39% in October. Democrats didn't appear to benefit from that shift either.

The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. The margin of sampling error for Democrats overall is plus or minus 6.0 percentage points.

NEW DELHI (AP) — A private Indian university was booted from a top artificial intelligence summit in New Delhi on Wednesday after one of its staffers displayed a commercially available robotic dog made in China, claiming it was the university's own innovation.

According to two government officials, Galgotias University was ordered to take down its stand at the summit a day after the university's professor of communications, Neha Singh, told state-run broadcaster DD News that robotic dog Orion was developed by the Centre of Excellence at the university. 

Internet users, however, quickly identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, sold by China's Unitree Robotics with a starting price tag of $1,600 and used widely in research and education.

On Wednesday, Singh told reporters she never explicitly claimed the dog was university's own creation, but only an exhibit.

The incident was an embarrassment for host country India, the two government officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. 

A statement from Galgotias on Tuesday said the university was “deeply pained” and described the incident as a “propaganda campaign” that could spread negativity and harm the morale of students working to innovate, learn and build their skills using global technologies.

Then, in a new statement on Wednesday, the university apologized for the confusion and said Singh, its representative at the AI summit pavilion, was not authorized to talk to the media and was “ill-informed.” 




“She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and in her enthusiasm at being on camera, gave factually incorrect information,” it said. 

It wasn't immediately clear if the university had removed its booth from the summit.

Still, the episode underscores the high stakes for India as it tries to cast itself as a global hub for AI and advanced manufacturing, drawing billions of dollars in investments while stressing credibility and local innovation.

The summit kicked off on Monday with some organizational hiccups as attendees and exhibitors reported long queues and delays at the venue. Several exhibitors took to social media to complain that their personal belonging and products on display were stolen. Organizers later said the items were recovered and returned.

The India AI Impact Summit, billed as a flagship event in the Global South, is attended by at least 20 heads of state and governments, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a session Thursday. 

Also expected to attend are Google's Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, Qualcomm's CEO Cristiano Amon, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft's President Brad Smith and AMI Labs Executive Chairman Yann LeCun.

GENEVA (AP) — The latest U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Moscow and Kyiv over Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine ended Wednesday with no sign of a breakthrough and with both sides saying the talks were “difficult,” as the war's fourth anniversary approaches next week.

The negotiations in Switzerland were the third round of direct talks organized by the U.S., after meetings earlier this year in Abu Dhabi that officials described as constructive but which also made no major headway. Expectations for significant progress in Geneva were low.

“The negotiations were not easy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the talks broke up and he spoke briefly by phone from Kyiv with his negotiating team. 

He earlier accused Russia of “trying to drag out negotiations” while it presses on with its invasion — an accusation he and European leaders have repeatedly made in the past.

Despite that, some progress was made on military issues although political differences remain deep, including over the future of land in eastern Ukraine that is occupied by the Russian army and that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to keep, Zelenskyy said.

The head of the Russian delegation, Putin adviser Vladimir Medinsky, told reporters that the two days of talks in Geneva “were difficult but businesslike.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that it's “too early” to speak about the outcome of the talks. Putin has been receiving reports about progress in Geneva, he said.

Both sides said a new round of talks is set to take place.




Zelenskyy described the military discussions as “constructive,” adding that the armed forces of both countries considered how any future ceasefire might be monitored.

“Monitoring will definitely be carried out with participation of the American side,” he said in a voice message shared in a media group chat on WhatsApp.

U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on social media that Washington's push for peace in Ukraine over the past year has “brought about meaningful progress,” without elaborating.

The two armies remain locked in battle on the roughly 1,250-kilometer (750-mile) front line, while Russia bombards civilian areas of Ukraine daily. 

Hours after the first day of talks ended on Tuesday, Russian drones killed a woman and injured a 6-year-old girl and 18-month-old toddler in the southern Ukraine city of Zaporizhzhia, officials said.

Overnight, Russia launched one ballistic missile and 126 long-range drones at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian air force.

Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian and American envoys in Geneva met with representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. 

Europe's participation in the process is “indispensable,” Zelenskyy said.

European leaders, mindful of Putin's wider ambitions, say their own security is at stake in Ukraine and have insisted on being consulted in peace efforts.

Russia and Ukraine appear to still be far apart on their demands for a settlement.

Zelenskyy has offered a ceasefire and a face-to-face meeting with Putin. But Moscow wants a comprehensive agreement before committing to a truce.

Putin's key goals remain what he declared when Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022: Ukraine must renounce joining NATO, sharply reduce the size of its army and protect Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow's orbit.

Additionally, Putin wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four eastern regions Moscow has occupied but doesn't fully control.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine won't surrender land to Russia.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Late-night host Stephen Colbert said his interview with Democratic Texas Senate candidate James Talarico was pulled from Monday night's broadcast over network fears it would violate regulatory guidance from the Trump administration on giving equal time to political candidates.

Colbert's statements overshadowed Tuesday's start of early voting for Texas primaries that feature a heated Democratic race between Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett. Four-term Republican Sen. John Cornyn also faces the fight of his long career against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt.

Colbert said CBS lawyers said in “no uncertain terms” that Talarico could not appear on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” broadcast because the network feared violating guidance from the Trump administration. Colbert nevertheless interviewed Talarico for nearly 15 minutes and posted the video on YouTube, because online material does not fall under the equal-time rule. 

“Then I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on. I could not mention me not having him on,” Colbert said. “And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.”

CBS disputed Colbert's account, saying its attorneys only “provided legal guidance” that broadcasting an interview with Talarico could trigger the Federal Communications Commission's equal-time rule. 

Crockett expressed skepticism about the “mania” playing out on the first day of early voting, “which feels kind of convenient.”




Both Talarico and Crockett have built national profiles through viral social media clips as media organizations have navigated around changing broadcast guidance issued under President Donald Trump governing how they interview political candidates. 

Talarico posted a nearly minute-long clip of his interview with Colbert on X, calling it “the interview Donald Trump didn't want you to see.” During the interview, Talarico said he thinks Trump is worried that Democrats can win the Texas seat. 

“The administration was playing politics and was trying to control what a late-night show puts on air, something that's never been done before,” Talarico told reporters during a news conference Tuesday in Austin after he voted early. “The executives at CBS were willing to go along with it.”

Crockett suggested that Colbert could have avoided an issue with the FCC by having her on the show, as he has in the past. Both she and Talarico also have appeared on ABC's daytime show “The View.” 

She told reporters after voting early in Dallas that she still was looking into the situation but added: “I've done Colbert a number of times. I've done ‘The View' a number of times. I've done (Jimmy) Kimmel a number (of times). I've done all of these shows a number of times.”

On the Republican side, Paxton stepped up what had been a low-key campaign with a rally Monday evening in Tyler in eastern Texas, while Cornyn had his own rally Tuesday in Austin. Hunt released a new television ad on Tuesday.

Broadcast networks have been required to give equal time to political candidates, but that rule hasn't traditionally been applied to talk shows. 

In January, the Federal Communications Commission issued new guidance warning late-night and daytime hosts that they need to give political candidates equal time. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, questioned the talk show exemption and posited that hosts were “motivated by partisan purposes.” 

The public notice said the FCC had not seen evidence that talk shows would qualify for an exemption from the rule for “bona fide news.” Carr has often criticized network talk shows, suggesting last year that probing “The View” — whose hosts have frequently been critical of Trump — over the exemption might be “worthwhile.”

The FCC did not immediately respond Tuesday to a message seeking comment.

Colbert's days as host are limited, following CBS' announcement last year that it was canceling his show this May for financial reasons, shuttering a decades-old TV institution in a changing media landscape.

But the timing of that announcement — three days after Colbert criticized the settlement between Trump and Paramount Global, parent company of CBS, over a “60 Minutes” story — led two U.S. senators to publicly question the motives behind the move, which served to remove from air one of Trump's most prominent and persistent late-night critics.

Meanwhile, Talarico and Crockett are hoping to avoid a May 26 runoff by capturing at least 50% of the Democratic vote in the March 3 primary. While Paxton also is, until Friday, the only ad his campaign ran had attacked Hunt.

Hunt is trying to appeal to voters seeking an alternative to Cornyn but uneasy about Paxton. The Texas attorney general beat a 2023 impeachment trial on corruption charges and reached a deal to end a long-running securities fraud case but now faces a contentious divorce over allegations of adultery.

Hunt's new ad shows photos of him with Trump, hitting Cornyn over his long political career and declaring, “This is our moment to end the status quo.” 

But Paxton's campaign has been airing its own ad featuring video clips of him with Trump since Friday. The president had not endorsed any candidate as of Monday. 

Paxton on Monday night portrayed Cornyn as a creature of the Washington establishment, adding, “Well, I'm not their person and I'm never going to be their person.” 

Paxton looks like the GOP's front-runner, even though Cornyn's campaign and allied super PACs had spent more than $54 million on television advertising since last year, according to the ad-tracing service AdImpact. 

Republican Senate leaders in Washington say Paxton would require hundreds of millions of dollars more to defend in a general election than Cornyn would — and that the party shouldn't have to spend in a state Trump carried by over 13 percentage points. 

Cornyn hit on those concerns during his Austin rally, saying nominating Paxton would “take a toll on everybody on the ballot” for the GOP.

“We'll pay the price of having an albatross like our corrupt attorney general around their neck,” he said.

PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) — The person who opened fire Monday during a youth hockey game at a Rhode Island ice rink was specifically targeting family members, killing an ex-wife and son as many fans dived for cover while a handful rushed the shooter to stop the attack, authorities said.

Pawtucket Chief of Police Tina Goncalves said the shooter's ex-wife Rhonda Dorgan and adult son Aidan Dorgan were killed and three others were injured: Rhonda Dorgan's parents, Linda and Gerald Dorgan, and a family friend Thomas Geruso, all of whom remained in critical condition Tuesday afternoon, Goncalves said

Police identified the shooter as 56-year-old Robert Dorgan, who died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Dorgan also went by the names Roberta Esposito and Roberta Dorgano, authorities said.

Goncalves said there was “no indication” there would be violence at the ice rink in Pawtucket on Monday afternoon, adding that Dorgan had been to many hockey games to watch family members play before without incident. 

Gender identity apparently was a contributing factor to Dorgan's wife filing for divorce in 2020 after nearly 30 years of marriage.

Court filings show Rhonda Dorgan initially wrote “gender reassignment surgery, narcissistic + personality disorder traits” as reasons for filing but crossed that out and wrote “irreconcilable differences which have caused the irremediable breakdown of the marriage.”




Court documents show that two shared the same last name even prior to getting married. Authorities have not provided additional details about the same name.

Under the name Roberta Dorgano, Dorgan posted on X that Rhonda Dorgan “hates the person who stole her husband” while posting about the couple's marital troubles in 2018. A year later Dorgan wrote on social media: “Transwoman, 6 kids : wife – not thrilled,” and encouraged people to not let being transgender stop them from creating a family.

A day before the shooting, Dorgan responded on X to anti-transgender posts by actor Kevin Sorbo and Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones by saying that constant criticism of transgender people is “why we Go BERSERK.”

Goncalves on Tuesday credited several “good Samaritans” who intervened and quickly stopped the attack 

At least three bystanders were able to contain Dorgan in the middle of the stands as the crowd fled and ran around them, but said Dorgan was still able to reach for a second firearm and died of a self-inflicted gunshot, Goncalves said.

The hockey game was livestreamed by LiveBarn, a streaming platform for youth sporting events, whose videos have been shared on social media showing players on the ice as popping sounds are heard. Chaos quickly unfolds as players on benches dive for cover, those on the ice frantically skate toward exits and fans flee their seats.

LiveBarn's social media account has been issuing warnings to those who shared the video that they do not have permission to do so. 

Michael Steven, who recorded video after the shooting, recalled crying parents trying to locate their children outside the arena and young people being taken out on stretchers.

“It happens far too often in our nation,” Steven told reporters.

Members of the community held a vigil at Slatersville Congregational Church in North Smithfield in the evening Tuesday.

“It's absolutely mind-boggling that this could happen to people we know and love and support through everything,” said Amy Goulet, whose son is a hockey player in the community.

Dorgan was an employee of General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, a ship building facility in Bath, Maine, that contracts with the U.S. Navy, David Hench, a spokesperson for the shipyard, said Tuesday. Co-workers said Dorgan often used the first name Roberta at work.

A colleague, Destiny Mackenzie, recalled that she and Dorgan would often talk about family. Mackenzie said Dorgan's ex-wife never came up in conversation but a hockey-playing son was a frequent topic. 

“What was supposed to be some seniors' only chance at playoff games is now ruined,” she wrote in a message to The Associated Press. “Images that these kids and family's now have to live with. That's who I send my condolences to is those families.”

Mackenzie also said Dorgan had a bad temper that sometimes led to screaming matches with colleagues.

Another co-worker said Dorgan appeared to be split on the issue of transgender acceptance, one second being proud of transitioning and the next, embarrassed. That co-worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of workplace reprisals, said they knew Dorgan owned guns but was unsure how many. 

Dorgan briefly served in the Marine Corps, enlisting on April 26, 1988, according to military records provided by the service. Less than three months later, on July 13, Dorgan was separated from the service with the lowest military rank.

Maj. Jacoby Getty, a Marine Corps spokesman, told The Associated Press that the rapid discharge indicated Dorgan's character “was incongruent with Marine Corps' expectations and standards.”

Getty declined to provide more detail.

Monday's shooting came nearly two months after the state was rocked by a shooting at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, as well as left a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor dead. Authorities later found Claudio Neves Valente, 48, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a New Hampshire storage facility.

Charlotte Drinkwater, 23, has been visiting Nantucket, Massachusetts, for more than 20 years and shared her ideal day on the island in a viral TikTok video.

Nantucket may be the perfect summer destination for coastal New England vibes, but new data shows that the famously picturesque island off the coast of Massachusetts is not without some flaws.

Recent wastewater surveillance reporting shows once again, as it has before, that cocaine levels in sewer water have been well above the national average from July 2025 to February 2026. 

In October, levels spiked to 2,948.70 nanograms per liter, while the national average remained under 1,000.

There was another spike of 2,815.50 nanograms per liter on Nantucket in December while the national average was just over 1,000, the same reporting shows.

Fox News Digital reached out to the town of Nantucket for comment, which noted its public dashboard with relevant data. ""Nantucket, like communities across the country, is not immune to the growing public health crisis of substance misuse and overdose,"" the town's website acknowledged.

There were an average of 40,000 visitors on most days in July and August between 2021–2022 — with peak days welcoming above 60,000, according to Cape and Islands, a local publication. 

In October 2025, cocaine levels spiked to 2,948.70 nanograms per liter, while the national average remained under 1,000. (iStock)

""During COVID, a lot of these communities, and most communities, decided that it was important for them to start testing the water to see if there were any spikes in COVID in the region,"" Randolph Rice, a Maryland attorney and legal analyst, previously told Fox News Digital.

""But what Nantucket has now decided to do as of the beginning of the summer is to actually start testing for other types of substances, particularly drugs, nicotine and other items… within the system there. And what they're finding is that there is a high level of cocaine,"" added Rice.

Boxing legend Mike Tyson, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and White House senior advisor Calley Means spell out their mission against ultra-processed food and obesity on 'My View.'

Red meat has long been blamed for raising blood sugar and diabetes risk, while chicken is widely seen as the healthier option — but a new study challenges that age-old advice.

Researchers at the Indiana University School of Public Health–Bloomington and the Illinois Institute of Technology put a common dietary recommendation for people with prediabetes to the test.

They found that blood sugar levels, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol and inflammation markers did not change in any meaningful way when participants ate lean beef versus chicken, according to the research, which was published in Current Developments in Nutrition in December.

RFK JR BACKS BEEF, DECLARING 'WAR ON PROTEIN IS OVER' AS HE THANKS AMERICA'S CATTLE RANCHERS

The study followed 24 adults with prediabetes. About 70% of them were male, and they ate either unprocessed beef or chicken every day for four weeks — then switched. 

Participants incorporated the meals — including burgers, fajitas, burritos, stews and stir-fries — into their regular diets.

A new short-term study found no significant differences in blood sugar levels when adults with prediabetes ate beef versus chicken. (iStock)

After each month, researchers checked blood sugar levels, insulin response and how well the pancreas — the organ that controls blood sugar — was working. They also examined pancreatic β-cell (beta cell) function, a key marker of diabetes progression.

""If eating beef were to worsen beta-cell function, that would provide evidence to suggest it might be causing increased diabetes risk,"" Kevin Maki, the Illinois-based lead researcher, told Fox News Digital. ""We did not find evidence of that in our study.""

PEOPLE LOST WEIGHT WHILE EATING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOOD — HERE'S THE SECRET

The researchers stressed that this was a short-term study and only looked at unprocessed beef. 

It did not look at fast food or processed meats like bacon or deli slices, which remain more strongly linked to poor health outcomes.

Chicken is often seen as healthier than red meat, but a new study found similar short-term effects on blood sugar. (iStock)

The average American consumes about 1.6 ounces of unprocessed red meat per day — roughly half a serving — an intake level that Maki said is appropriate.

""Our recommendation is to follow a healthy dietary pattern that emphasizes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, seafood and healthy fats,"" Maki said. ""Animal-based proteins — including beef — can fit into that pattern.""

HEART DOCTORS SAY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE MAKING COMMON GROCERY MISTAKES — SIMPLE SWAPS CAN HELP

Experts not involved in the study said longer-term research and studies that include a more balanced mix of male and female participants are still needed.

""For someone with prediabetes, the takeaway is that eating unprocessed beef as part of an otherwise healthy diet did not worsen short-term diabetes risk factors — but we still need longer-term data before making broad recommendations,"" Dr. Mia Kazanjian, a Connecticut-based radiologist, told Fox News Digital.

""These randomized controlled trials conflict with observational studies, which do suggest an association between red meat and type 2 diabetes,"" she added.

""This study is better at showing what happens over a month than what happens over a decade.""

Observational studies track eating habits and health outcomes over many years, while randomized controlled trials are designed to isolate the effects of specific foods.

An FBI official says investigative genetic genealogy is underway in the Nancy Guthrie investigation. This after DNA found on a glove matching the type worn by the subject seen in surveillance video outside Guthrie's home the morning she disappeared resulted in no CODIS hits. DNA recovered inside the home also yielded no matches.

The search for Nancy Guthrie entered its third week on Sunday. The 84-year-old disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, 17 days ago.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos cleared Nancy Guthrie's family as suspects in her disappearance case, calling them ""victims"" who have been cooperative.

Authorities still have no suspects or persons of interest, though Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said more law enforcement operations are expected in the coming days.

A glove with a DNA profile of an unknown male has been recovered, and appears to match the pair worn by a subject seen in surveillance video outside Nancy Guthrie's home, the FBI said Sunday. Investigative genetic genealogy is underway after the DNA resulted in no CODIS hits.

The FBI released a description of the suspect seen in a mask and gloves tampering with the doorbell camera in front of Nancy Guthrie's home in the early morning hours of Feb. 1 around the time she went missing. The suspect is described as a male between 5'9” - 5'10” tall, with an average build and was seen carrying a 25-liter ""Ozark Trail Hiker Pack"" backpack.

The FBI increased its reward to $100,000 for information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.

Coverage for this event has ended.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said the Nancy Guthrie case is far from being cold, stressing that it will not be considered cold as long as there are leads to pursue.

The sheriff said 400 investigators continue to work on thousands of tips and leads, according to NBC News.

""As long as we have the ability to chase a lead, it's not cold,"" Nanos said on Tuesday, according to the outlet.

'We're not going to give up. We're going to find Nancy, and we're going to find out who did this,"" he added.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos on Tuesday made a plea to the suspect in Nancy Guthrie's kidnapping, urging the individual to ""just let her go.""

""Just let her go. It will work out better for you in the long run,"" Nanos said, according to Fox 10. ""Take her to a park. Take her to the hospital. Just let her go.""

The sheriff also appeared to remain optimistic, saying the investigation continues to be a rescue operation and not a recovery mission.

""You have no proof, nobody does, that she's not [alive],"" Nanos said. ""I'm going to have that faith. Sometimes that hope is all we have.""

When asked when the mission might turn into a recovery effort, Nanos said 400 investigators are remain in the field pursuing leads.

""My team, 400 people out there in the field today, woke up this morning and went out there with the hope and the belief that they're going to find Nancy, and she's going to be okay,"" Nanos said.



The archbishop of New York on Tuesday led a prayer on NBC's ""Today"" show calling for the safe return of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of the show's co-host, Savannah Guthrie.

Archbishop Ronald Hicks was selected by Pope Leo XIV in December to take over the position, and he assumed the role earlier this month.

Hicks was asked by NBC host Hoda Kotb about any words he wished to share with the Guthrie family, as authorities continue to search for the missing woman.

""It's heartbreaking,"" he said. ""It's hard to watch.""

""I want to just extend my absolute support, and especially my prayers, not only my own prayers, but she has a community of people who are praying for her and for her mom and for the entire family,"" Hicks continued.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told NBC that he has seen a photo that could show the suspect in the Nancy Guthrie case wearing a ring, but said investigators will analyze the image before drawing any conclusions.

“I look at the same photo you look at and I get, I see it,” Nanos said.

He added that the image would be reviewed more closely by investigators.

“I'm going to give that to my team,” he said. “They'll look at that. They'll analyze it and we'll see. Maybe, maybe it is.”



Investigators have not yet obtained video from additional cameras at Nancy Guthrie's home.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told NewsNation correspondent Brian Entin that authorities still do not have video from Guthrie's other cameras and that the video is currently “in the hands of Google.”

It was not immediately clear what type of cameras were involved or how long it may take for investigators to retrieve the material. 



Investigators looking to track down Nancy Guthrie's suspected kidnappers are turning to a relatively new technology that has been attributed to solving some of the most prolific criminal and cold cases in American history.

Investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) is defined as ""the science of using genetic and genealogical methods to generate leads for law enforcement entities investigating crimes and identifying human remains,"" according to the International Society of Genetic Genealogy.

Investigators use a DNA sample to search for genetic familial matches, ultimately looking to narrow down potential identities by zeroing in on close relatives of the individual.

On Tuesday, the FBI confirmed to Fox News Digital that IGG was being used to test DNA found on a glove discovered two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home and other DNA samples found inside her house.

Find out more about how IGG could help solve the case.

This is an excerpt from a story by Fox News Digital's Julia Bonavita.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos addressed speculation involving Adult Protective Services in the case of missing 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, clarifying that after a neighbor made a call, APS sent an investigator to her home the day she was reported missing.

“The day she was reported missing a neighbor called Adult Protective Services,” Nanos said. “They sent an investigator to check on her.”

Fox News Digital's Michael Ruiz contributed to this report.



U.S. Border Patrol confirmed to Fox News its elite BORSTAR search and rescue team used the bright blue shirt seen lying along the walkway at Nancy Guthrie's home as part of a K-9 scent search at the property.

Border Patrol says the BORSTAR team, along with a K-9, was called to Guthrie's home twice — first on the night she went missing and later when the FBI returned to the residence. During those deployments, the team conducted a search using the scent from the blue shirt.

Fox News Digital previously reported that Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said the bright blue shirt was used by a U.S. Border Patrol K-9 team and had been left behind and later retrieved. The shirt was visible on video recorded by Fox News Digital on Feb. 3, two days into the search.

The garment was seen lying near blood drops on Guthrie's front steps.

Fox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said investigators are now debriefing recent forensic findings and prioritizing additional lab work as the investigation into the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie continues.

Nanos told Fox News Digital that the next phase will include separating merged DNA samples recovered inside Guthrie's residence, conducting further testing and evaluating whether any viable material could be used for investigative genetic genealogy or entered into CODIS.

Nanos said each step requires laboratory analysis before investigators can move forward.

Fox News Digital's Michael Ruiz contributed to this report.



Two men wearing badges were seen entering a home next door to Nancy Guthrie's residence as the investigation into the missing 84-year-old woman continues.



The men spent a few minutes inside the neighboring home before exiting and returning to a vehicle parked in the driveway. 



An FBI official tells Fox News Digital that investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) is already underway in the Nancy Guthrie investigation.

IGG is a forensic method that uses crime scene DNA to identify potential relatives through public genealogy databases when traditional law enforcement databases like CODIS produce no matches.

Earlier Tuesday, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Department said the unknown male DNA profile on a glove found two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home did not result in any CODIS hits. The DNA found in her home also produced no hits, according to the sheriff's department.

“The DNA found at the property is being analyzed & further testing needs to be done as part of the investigation,"" the sheriff's department said on X.

CeCe Moore, the chief genetic genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, told Fox News Digital she has full confidence that investigative genetic genealogy will be able to identify that DNA contributor.

""Thanks to the power of investigative genetic genealogy, it is just a matter of time now until they discover who that DNA belongs to and the investigators are able to pursue those leads and, hopefully, provide answers to Nancy's family,"" she said.



Authorities deployed specialized Bluetooth and Wi-Fi detection technology during the search for Nancy Guthrie, according to a statement from Parsons Corporation, which said it began assisting the Pima County Sheriff's Department earlier this month.

“At the beginning of February, the Pima County Sheriff's Department requested our support, and we immediately began deployment of BlueFly® units and personnel to Arizona to assist with the search for Nancy Guthrie,” the company said.

Parsons described BlueFly® as “a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sensor intended for search and rescue operations in challenging environments,” adding that the technology “has been used on a variety of air and ground vehicles, and on foot in austere terrain.” The system “provides first responders with a heat map to identify signals within a search area.”

According to the statement, BlueFly® was used Feb. 3 during the sheriff department's search and rescue helicopter operation over the Guthrie neighborhood and was later deployed in additional search efforts by helicopter, ground vehicles and on foot.

“Due to the sensitivity of the investigation, we will not provide additional details on ongoing operations,” the company said.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said there is no evidence Nancy Guthrie was taken across the border into Mexico, though investigators are aware of the region's proximity as the search for the 84-year-old continues.

During an interview with Fox News' Jonathan Hunt, Nanos was asked whether authorities were considering the possibility that Guthrie may have been transported into Mexico.

“You know, I'm sure the FBI has looked into that as well, but no,” Nanos said. “We check all the leads we have…we're like everybody else. We know where Mexico is in relationship to this, and it's a possibility. But no, we have nothing to indicate that.”

Nanos emphasized that investigators are continuing to follow available leads but have not uncovered any information suggesting Guthrie was taken across the border. The investigation remains ongoing.

Two men were seen walking the grounds of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie's property Tuesday as the search continues for the missing woman.

Drone footage captured by Fox's Flight Team shows the pair moving around the residence and into the backyard before entering the garage through an exterior-facing door.

It was not immediately clear who the two men were or whether they were law enforcement officials connected to the investigation, which remains ongoing. Authorities have released few details about the latest steps in the case.

An Arizona gun store owner says an FBI agent showed him pages of photos and names tied to a kidnapping probe and asked him to check for recent gun purchases – even as Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos disputes reports investigators have narrowed their focus to specific people.

Phillip Martin, co-owner of Armor Bearer Arms in Tucson, told Fox News an FBI agent visited his store with three pages containing photos and the names of roughly 18 to 24 people, asking whether any had purchased a firearm there within the past year.

“He actually had given me a list of paper, list of people that had pictures and names on it, and he wanted to know if I could help him pull up in my system if any of these people have purchased a gun in the last year,” Martin said.

Martin said he was initially skeptical but agreed to help out of sympathy for the victim's family.

“Anything that could help them find the person I was willing to help,” he said.

According to Martin, he typed each last name into the store's system, which would display identifying information if the person had made a purchase. He said none of the names returned a match.

The agent, Martin said, told him investigators planned to visit other gun shops to check whether anyone on the list had bought a firearm in the past year.

During an interview with Fox News' Jonathan Hunt, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos pushed back on reports that investigators were asking gun stores about around 40 people.

“That's not true,” Nanos said when asked whether authorities had narrowed the suspect pool to a few dozen individuals.

Nanos said investigators have not zeroed in on a specific group but are instead working through evidence that includes DNA, Ring camera footage and potential leads tied to a Walmart.

“We haven't narrowed it down to anything other than we have pieces of evidence that we're looking at to try to find this individual,” Nanos said.

The unknown male DNA profile on a glove found two miles from the home of Nancy Guthrie has been run through the FBI's DNA database – and did not result in any hits, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt in an interview on Tuesday.

DNA recovered from Guthrie's home also did not match records in the FBI database, Nanos said. The sheriff confirmed that the DNA on the glove was different from the DNA found inside the home.

The FBI confirmed the news to Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

“We're hopeful that we're always getting closer, but the news now, I think, is we had heard this morning that, of course, the DNA on the glove that was found two miles away was submitted for CODIS. And I just heard that, CODIS had no hits,” Nanos said.

The sheriff's department later provided clarity, writing on X: “The DNA that was submitted to CODIS was from the set of gloves found 2 miles away.

“It did not trigger a match in CODIS & did not match DNA found at the property,” it said. “The DNA found at the property is being analyzed & further testing needs to be done as part of the investigation.”



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told Fox News on Tuesday that a blue shirt seen lying along the walkway leading up to Nancy Guthrie's home had been left by federal law enforcement.

Nanos said the bright blue shirt was used by a U.S. Border Patrol K-9 team. The shirt was left behind and then retrieved.

The shirt was seen on video recorded by Fox News Digital on Feb. 3, two days into the search for Nancy Guthrie. The shirt was not far from a trail of blood drops on Nancy Guthrie's front steps.

Fox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report.



A Milwaukee attorney told FOX6 Milwaukee that he is offering a new $100,000 reward in the Nancy Guthrie case.

Michael Hupy, who is also the president of Milwaukee Crime Stoppers, said he is offering the reward locally through Crime Stoppers for any information that leads to an arrest.

""She's an 84-year-old woman and I don't like the way the investigation and reward is being handled. I think it could have been done much better,” Hupy told the station. “I think if the $100,000 was put up through crime stoppers – we could be further along.""

Hupy said he believes that even though the FBI has its own $100,000 reward, its requirement for personal information may discourage tips from the public. Crime Stoppers allows tipsters to remain anonymous.

""This woman has been missing for two or three weeks and no leads have amounted to anything,” he told the station. “So if the person who knows who the perpetrator is doesn't want his name exposed, wants a reward and has information that will lead to an arrest – crime stoppers is the perfect place to do it.”

He said the reward will be posted through Crime Stoppers of Tucson.

“No one did it, so I am doing it,” Hupy said of his reward offer.

A vehicle parked outside a home in Catalina Foothills that was raided by the FBI on Friday was towed away by an insurance company — not law enforcement — on Monday.

A neighbor told Fox News Digital that the vehicle, which appeared to have significant front end damage, was towed at the request of State Farm after it was totaled in a crash last week. 

The neighbor added that the car's owner is “pissed” about the Friday night raid, and his mother is upset because she doesn't know what's going on — but everyone wants Nancy Guthrie found.

A retired detective told “FOX & Friends” how investigators in Nancy Guthrie's disappearance may have examined her family members before clearing them in the case.

Jon Buehler, who worked as an investigator on the Laci Peterson missing persons case in California over two decades ago, detailed the process that law enforcement usually goes through when trying to pin down a suspect in such a case.

“Generally, what you're going to do is you're going to take a look at where family members were when the abduction took place and verify their alibi that they weren't involved in it,” Buehler said. “You're going to take a look at their friends and associates and make sure that none of them have a criminal record or past history of violence or anything like that, maybe gambling debts or things like that, that would put them in a position to target Nancy.”

Buehler noted that the process requires “a lot of legwork” by detectives that would keep them busy.

“But if the sheriff said that he's confident that they're not part of it, then we have to go with that,” Buehler said, referring to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos announcing that investigators cleared the Guthrie family — including siblings and spouses — in the case.

The sheriff's announcement came as the FBI was awaiting forensic testing results on a glove that had a DNA profile of an unknown male. The recovered glove appears to match the gloves of the subject seen in the surveillance video, the FBI has said.

Buehler said that a timeline on getting results in a case like this will likely be expedited to the “front of the line” due to the intensity of the media coverage and public interest.

He added, however, that the timeline on getting the results is “not like plugging in a wall socket or anything like that,” and may take time.

“It takes those criminalists in the lab time to find the results and quantify them, get them written down, and then have ready to go to the next step, whoever's going to look at it, whether it's Quantico or an intermediary, that's going to determine the quality is still there for further examination,” the retired detective said.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told local Tucson station KOLD13 that Nancy Guthrie's family members were ruled out as suspects “in the first few days” of the investigation.

Nanos on Monday issued a public message clearing the Guthrie family out of concern they were being unfairly targeted amid the investigation into the 84-year-old's disappearance.

Nanos described the Guthrie family as “nothing but cooperative and gracious” and emphasized that they are victims in the case.

NBC News national law enforcement and intelligence correspondent Tom Winter said the sheriff likely felt so strongly about making such a statement because there has been a lot of incorrect online speculation surrounding the case.

“Throughout the entirety of this investigation, there's not a single person that I have talked to that's been briefed on it, is familiar with all the facts of the case, that has ever said there was a single piece of evidence that tied back to any member of the Guthrie family, period,” Winter said on NBC's “Today.”

While detecting the signal of Nancy Guthrie's pacemaker may be like searching for a needle in a haystack, an expert says it remains the best hope of finding the missing 84-year-old, Griff Jenkins, co-host of ""FOX & Friends Weekend,"" reported from Tucson, Arizona, on Tuesday morning.

Jenkins reported that Dave Kennedy, who created the new Bluetooth “signal sniffing” technology, told him that the type of pacemaker Nancy Guthrie has is “the best we could hope for.”

“It essentially every one to three minutes sends a simple ping up that says, ‘Hey, iPhone. Are you there?' Well, in this case, if the ‘signal sniffer' in the sky can pick it up, it can locate it, do a triangulation of directional antennas and within an hour they could possibly find her,” Jenkins reported.

Jenkins also flew in a helicopter over the search area's challenging terrain of rough hills and steep culverts, providing a birds-eye view similar to what law enforcement has seen while using the new high-tech Bluetooth scanner in the search for Nancy Guthrie.

“It's much like hunting for a needle in a haystack,” Jenkins said.

An FBI official told Fox News Digital DNA recovered from a glove believed tied to the suspect in the Nancy Guthrie case is still undergoing quality control testing at the sheriff's private lab in Florida after being sent from Tucson on Feb. 12.

Once that process is complete, the profile is expected to be entered into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, in the near future – possibly as soon as tonight – which could determine whether it matches anyone in the national database.

When asked whether more than one suspect could be involved, the official pointed to FBI Director Kash Patel's comments on “Hannity” last week referencing “persons of interest,” indicating investigators are not ruling out the possibility of multiple individuals.

FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss President Donald Trump's efforts to reduce drug prices, expedite R&D and establish new vaccine requirements.

A Democratic Senate candidate endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is being slammed for allegedly flip-flopping on one of his primary campaign issues.

Abdul El-Sayed, the progressive candidate who previously ran an unsuccessful bid for Michigan governor, has made ""Medicare-for-all"" a hallmark of his Senate campaign.

However, as the Michigan Senate primary race heats up, El-Sayed's Democratic opponent, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, is accusing him of backing down from a full ""Medicare-for-all"" stance and of ""rewriting definitions to have it both ways.""

Roxie Richner, an El-Sayed campaign spokesperson, responded by telling Fox News Digital, ""Dr. El-Sayed is and has always been for ‘Medicare-for-all' — guaranteed public health insurance for every American. Cradle to grave. No premiums, deductibles, or co-pays."" 

""Dr. El-Sayed would be the first Democratic doctor elected to the U.S. Senate since 1969, and he looks forward to passing ‘Medicare-for-all' into law,"" added Richner.

El-Sayed's campaign website page on ""A Healthier America"" cites a book he co-authored in 2021 in which he wrote that limiting private alternatives to ""Medicare-for-all"" would be important to ensuring providers accepted the insurance. The book advocates for ""Medicare-for-all"" as a type of ""monopsony"" in healthcare, in which there is only a single buyer of medical services, the government. 

""By insuring all Americans, M4A becomes a monopsony in healthcare. This is different from a monopoly, where there's only one seller of a good; in a monopsony there's only one buyer of a good. That gives the single buyer considerable negotiating leverage, which Medicare could use to rein in the cost of drugs, hospital stays, and physician services,"" the book reads. 

In a November post on X, El-Sayed explained that this monopsony ""would instantaneously create a disciplining feature against rising prices,"" because it ""takes out the profit motive on the payer end of the transaction."" 

The book further states that ""because alternatives to M4A [Medicare-for-all] would be limited, participation of providers would be virtually guaranteed."" 

""Instead of spending time and money dealing with the arcane requirements of hundreds of different health plans […] providers could use one streamlined system that would free up resources to focus on clinical care,"" the books reads. 

The latest version of the federal ""Medicare-for-all"" Act, introduced in the Senate by Sanders, includes language that would effectively ban most comprehensive private insurance plans and relegate private insurers to providing limited supplemental care. 

The legislation would make it unlawful for ""a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act; or (2) an employer to provide benefits for an employee, former employee, or the dependents of an employee or former employee that duplicate the benefits provided under this Act.""

El-Sayed testified before the Senate in support of the ""Medicare-for-all"" Act in 2022, calling it ""the clearest pathway to universal, durable healthcare insurance, bar none"" and saying that ""cradle to grave coverage would do away with the premiums, co pays, deductibles that leave even privately insured Americans rationing their healthcare today."" 

The year before, in an interview with NerdWallet, El-Sayed said that under a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan, the government would be ""buying you out"" of your private insurance plan but would allow ""a few insurance companies that offered a sort of concierge-level service for folks who wanted to pay for that.""

In a 2024 episode of the ""America Dissected"" podcast, El-Sayed emphasized that ""we don't really need private health insurance in this country.""

He said that ""private health insurance is a system by which you have a middleman in our healthcare system making a tremendous amount of money that is leading to a number of the biggest problems in American healthcare whether that's the fact that our costs continue to spiral upward, whether that's the fact that nearly ten million people in our country don't get health insurance at all, or it's the fact that we are consistently in this country, unable to guarantee, even people who are insurance access to the health care they need.""

In October, El-Sayed knocked McMorrow for advocating for allowing a public option under universal healthcare, writing on X, ""a public option can't deliver healthcare to every Michigander. Medicare for All can."" Politico, in December, reported El-Sayed slamming McMorrow's call for universal healthcare with a public option as ""incoherent.""

""Now a public option is exactly that; it's just an option. There is no reason why it would actually address any of the foundational problems in our system. It wouldn't bring down the rising costs. It wouldn't guarantee people healthcare, and we don't really know how much it would cost,"" he said. 

Yet, while speaking on the Brian Tyler Cohen podcast in January, El-Sayed suggested that under ""Medicare-for-all,"" ""if you like your insurance from your employer or from your union, that can still be there for you.""

Days later, speaking on radio channel WDET, he again said, ""'Medicare-for-all' is government health insurance guaranteed for everyone, regardless of what circumstances you're in. If you like your insurance through your employer or through your union, I hope that'll be there for you. But if you lose your job, if your factory shuts down, you shouldn't be destitute without the healthcare that you need and deserve."" He also said, ""If you have a public option, what happens is, the private health insurance system will try to dump all of the most expensive patients onto that public option, vastly increasing the cost of that public option and making it unsustainable.""

El-Sayed's campaign website states that he ""believes in expanding Medicare to cover every single American from cradle to grave while sustaining the option for workers to keep supplemental private insurance their unions or employers may provide."" Amid criticism from McMorrow, El-Sayed doubled down on his ""Medicare-for-all"" messaging in a January fundraising message, in which he wrote that ""private insurance could supplement or duplicate Medicare.""

Meanwhile, McMorrow has accused him of not being honest on ""Medicare-for-all."" 

""On an issue as important as healthcare, you have to be honest about what you're fighting for,"" McMorrow wrote in a public reply to El-Sayed, adding, ""The ‘Medicare-for-all' legislation that you've championed completely eliminates private health insurance as it exists today.""

Sanders' office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Dr. Colleen Fitzpatrick, president and founder of Identifinders Forensic Genealogy, analyzes the results of the DNA test of a glove recovered in the Nancy Guthrie search on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

TUCSON, Ariz. — Investigators looking to track down Nancy Guthrie's suspected kidnappers are turning to a relatively new technology that has been attributed to solving some of the most prolific criminal and cold cases in American history. 

Investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) is defined as ""the science of using genetic and genealogical methods to generate leads for law enforcement entities investigating crimes and identifying human remains,"" according to the International Society of Genetic Genealogy. 

Investigators use a DNA sample to search for genetic familial matches, ultimately looking to narrow down potential identities by zeroing in on close relatives of the individual. 

On Tuesday, the FBI confirmed to Fox News Digital that IGG was being used to test DNA found on a glove discovered two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home and other DNA samples found inside her house.

The move comes after both samples did not find a match in the nationwide law enforcement database, CODIS – which only includes individuals previously known to authorities.  

The technology has been used to solve several high-profile cases in recent years, with the FBI now turning to IGG in hopes of identifying the DNA found on the glove discovered two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home and other samples located inside the house. 

Here is a look at previous cases in which IGG helped authorities locate their suspect.

Immediately following the brutal murders of four University of Idaho college students on Nov. 13, 2022, investigators raced to track down the person responsible for killing Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Kaylee Goncalves.

Using DNA found on a Ka-Bar knife sheath left behind at the crime scene, authorities sent samples to forensics lab Othram after coming back empty-handed when using CODIS.

Othram was then able to create a DNA profile that matched items pulled from Bryan Kohberger's family trash at their Pennsylvania home, leading investigators to ""a male as not being excluded as the biological father of Suspect Profile,"" according to the affidavit. 

Kohberger was subsequently taken into custody on Dec. 30, 2022 and pleaded guilty to the quadruple murders last summer as part of a plea deal to escape the potential death penalty. 

He is serving four consecutive life sentences, plus another 10 years.

NANCY GUTHRIE CASE INVESTIGATORS FIND SET OF BLACK GLOVES NEAR ROADSIDE

More than three decades after 13 people were murdered and dozens more raped, IGG led investigators to finally track down one of the most prolific killers in California's history. 

Using DNA collected from the crime scene, authorities were able to match a profile created for the Golden State Killer to online genetic profiles. The results pointed investigators toward a relative of former police officer Joseph James DeAngelo, who was arrested in 2018 and later charged with dozens of crimes.

""We were confident that he was born between 1940 and 1960,"" Paul Holes, a former investigator with the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office, told Fox News during a 2021 interview for the Fox Nation documentary and Fox News Audio Podcast ""Grim Tide: Hunting the Long Island Serial Killer.""

""The common ancestors that we used were great, great-grandparents. These were people who were born in the 1840s, and we built a family tree that consisted of thousands,"" Holes said. ""And then ultimately, we landed on a California branch with a small number of… males of the right age. And then, at that point, it's just ‘Investigation 101.' Who are these men and could any of them be somebody that we need to look at closer to being the person that is responsible?""

Prosecutors previously called DeAngelo's decades of crimes ""simply staggering,"" encompassing 87 victims at 53 separate crime scenes spanning 11 California counties.

NANCY GUTHRIE CASE: ALL OF THE PROPERTIES SEARCHED BY AUTHORITIES SINCE DISAPPEARANCE

DeAngelo pleaded guilty to 13 murders and 13 rapes in 2020, and was later handed multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole. 

Nearly 25 years after the body of an unidentified little girl was discovered in a 55-gallon drum barrel near New Hampshire's Bear Brook State Park, investigators used genetic genealogy to crack the final name included in the infamous Allenstown Four.

From 1985 to 2000, authorities located four bodies stuffed in barrels in what was later ruled as homicides, with three of the individuals being identified as Marlyse Elizabeth Honeychurch, 24, and her two daughters, Marie Elizabeth Vaughn, 6, and Sarah Lynn McWaters, 1. 

However, the identity of the final victim remained unknown until 2025, when authorities used genetic genealogy to determine the young girl was Rea Rassmussen, according to the National Center for Missing and Endangered Children.   

All four victims are believed to have been murdered by serial killer Terry Peder Rasmussen, the biological father of Rea, who was suspected of killing at least six women and two children prior to his death in 2010.

The break in the case came in 2024, when the New Hampshire State Police partnered with the DNA Doe Project and learned the unidentified child's mother was a woman named Pepper Reed. 

Reed's family reportedly told investigators she was last seen in Texas during Christmas of 1975, and later moved to California while pregnant. Her family identified Terry Rasmussen as the father of the child, which was later confirmed by a birth record located in Orange County, California.

Using DNA samples from Reed's sole surviving sibling, investigators were able to confirm Rea Rassmussen's identity. She is believed to have been between the ages of 2 and 4 when she was killed. 

However, Reed remains missing and is believed to have been murdered by Terry Rasmussen, who was later convicted of killing girlfriend Eunsoon Jun in 2002.

Investigators identified Talbott as a suspect after uploading DNA found at the crime scene to the public genealogy website GEDMatch. The technology pointed to two second cousins of Talbott, which allowed investigators to construct a family tree and ultimately identify him as their primary suspect. 

Detectives used a discarded coffee cup to obtain Talbott's DNA, which matched the evidence found at the crime scene.

The case was the first time genetic genealogy had been used to put a suspect on trial, with prosecutors reportedly using Talbott as an example showcasing the power of genetic genealogy testing. 

""Folks aren't going to get away with murder anymore when we have this information,"" prosecutor Adam Cornell said, according to FOX 13. ""If you're a killer and you're out there, then this office and other law enforcement around the country may be coming for you.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The point Rep. Randy Fine made so badly","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/4461034/the-point-rep-randy-fine-made-so-badly/","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

Rep. Randy Fine (R-FL) threw a social media hand grenade on Sunday, tweeting, “If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one.” 

He did not mention race but his words echoed old segregationist rhetoric that lumped minorities and dogs together as though they were two types of lesser creatures. The congressman's phrasing was provocative and it drew the sort of righteous disapproval you'd expect.

“Disgusting bigotry,” Jake Tapper, of CNN, wrote on X. 

“Absolutely evil,” David French, of the New York Times, wrote. 

“You disgusting pr*ck,” Piers Morgan wrote.

Rep. Fine's ugly wording gave the commentariat permission to dismiss him as a bigot and a jerk. But he was responding to something real.  

Dogs are a beloved feature of American life, cossetted and petted and treated like honored family members. Dogs live in 87 million U.S. homes. Some have their own beds; some share their owners' beds. They are in favorite photos on shelves and in bookcases. Some owners call themselves “pet parents” of “fur babies.” This goes too far for some of us, but it indicates how dear dogs are to traditional U.S. life.

But in Islam, dogs are considered foul and unclean.   

There is genuine tension here.  

Rep. Fine was also not tweeting in a vacuum. He was responding to an activist colleague of New York City's Muslim mayor Zohran Mandami.  

“Finally, NYC is coming to Islam,” wrote Nerdeen Kiswani last week. “Dogs definitely have a place in society, just not as indoor pets. As we've said all along, they are unclean.”  

Having stoked the controversy, Kiswani then ran away from it. She claimed her tweet was “obviously a joke.” This is disingenuous. Her comments were not “obviously” in jest, and there is good reason why they were taken in earnest. Islam reviles dogs. And those who advocate political Islam increasingly demand that the West sacrifice its own ways and adopt theirs.

This arrogant demand is not confined to Muslims in the United States. Over in Britain, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is toying with the idea of curtailing the ancient freedom of the British people to take their dogs on long rambles in the countryside. His stated interest is to make country life “less white,” making it more attractive to Muslims from Pakistan and Bangladesh who don't like dogs.  

Westerners have gotten used to accommodating vocal minorities, but this is not a small ask. It is a huge one. The leader of the British government contemplates interfering in a pleasure long enjoyed by the people of the land he temporarily governs to appease the sensitivities of immigrants from foreign cultures.

Think it can't happen here?  

Read Kiswani's tweet again: “Finally, NYC is coming to Islam.”  

This isn't just about dogs.  

The public has long had reservations about Islam, seeing its culture and beliefs as antithetical to U.S. values. This is not just about disliking the amplified Muslim call to prayer five times a day, although that's important because it makes our own cities feel foreign.

It is also about fundamental differences between what is acceptable in the West and what is practiced in the Muslim world. People look abroad and see the death penalty for adultery, execution for gays, and the “honor killings” of rape victims. Then the people of the West look at their own cities and see women shrouded in burqas, fighting-aged men massed defiantly in streets praying like an army before battle, the creeping advance of Sharia law, the spread of Islamic schools, and violent protests in support of Islamist terrorism.

In the West, we are comfortable with the idea of the separation of church and state. In the U.S., indeed, we insist upon it. In Islam, there is no such separation in theory and often none or little in practice. Many Muslims say plainly — preaching it every Friday — that public policy should be based on the Koran. For centuries, they believed, and many again believe, that the peoples of Islam, the ummah, should be dedicated to conquest and the subjugation of infidels. That's us. 

Conquest is not always carried out at the point of a sword. All over the West, it's being achieved by horrifyingly rapid immigration, invited by subsidies offered by welfare states. The scale of this problem is increasingly apparent. Japan and Italy are taking action. Both have lately acknowledged the danger and are acting to protect their cultures and traditional ways. 

DEMOCRATS ARE OVERREACHING ON IMMIGRATION

It is harder for an assimilationist country such as the U.S. to recognize the danger, but as long as Islamists see our society gripped by suicidal tolerance, they will know that we lack the will to resist.  

A high-placed Islamist in New York City advanced the idea that it is gross to keep a dog as an indoor pet. Whatever you think of a U.S. congressman allowing himself to be baited and clumsily trolling her for what she wrote, it is she who put the idea out there in the first place. It was she, in the triumph of Mamdani's unprecedented election victory, who decided it was a good moment for an activist Muslim to poke Americans in the eye once again.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani proposed a 9.5% property tax increase on Tuesday as part of his plan for the city's “preliminary budget.” Mamdani said the tax hike was necessary to offset a $5.4 billion budget shortfall in the city due to financial mismanagement by previous administrations. Mamdani's proposal comes months after his mayoral campaign focused on affordability issues and lowering the cost of living.

As part of his $127 billion city budget proposal for fiscal 2027, which begins in July, he described the property tax increase as a “last resort,” predicated on Gov. Kathy Hochul's (D-NY) refusal to implement a tax hike on affluent New Yorkers and corporations. Mamdani emphasized the proposed property tax increase could be avoided if Hochul agreed to taxing the wealthy.

Today, I'm releasing the City's preliminary budget. After years of fiscal mismanagement, we're staring at a $5.4 billion budget gap — and two paths. One: Albany can raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy and the most profitable corporations and address the fiscal imbalance between…

“Today, I'm releasing the City's preliminary budget,” Mamdani posted on X. “After years of fiscal mismanagement, we're staring at a $5.4 billion budget gap — and two paths.” 

“One: Albany can raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy and the most profitable corporations and address the fiscal imbalance between our city and state,” he said. 

“The other, a last resort: balance the budget on the backs of working people using the only tools at the City's disposal,” Mamdani said. 

“The first path matches a structural crisis with a sustainable and fair solution. I know where I stand,” Mamdani added. “New Yorkers voted for bold change and competent leadership. We will deliver both, and we look forward to partnering with Albany to protect working New Yorkers.”

If approved, it would be the first property tax increase in New York City since 2003, according to reports.

Hochul and other Democrats blasted Mamdani's idea, saying she didn't think it was “necessary.” 

“I'm not supportive of a property tax increase,” Hochul said at a press conference in New York City. “I don't know that that's necessary, but let's find out what is really necessary to close that gap.”

New York City Council Speaker Julie Menin also criticized the idea, emphasizing that it should not even be considered. Menin and City Council Member Linda Lee, the council's finance committee chairwoman, released a statement dismissing the idea, Politico reported.

“At a time when New Yorkers are already grappling with an affordability crisis, dipping into rainy day reserves and proposing significant property tax increases should not be on the table whatsoever,” read the joint statement.

Mamdani would need City Council approval to make his proposed property tax increase a reality, should it come to that point.

Mamdani administration officials said that the proposed tax hike would generate an additional $3.7 billion in revenue, the New York Daily News reported. However, it is also believed that such an increase would disproportionately affect black neighborhoods in New York City.

Citizens Budget Commission, a self-described “nonpartisan, nonprofit civic organization whose mission is to achieve constructive change in the finances and services of New York City and New York State government,” dismissed Mamdani's proposal and criticized the rationale behind it.

“Mayor Mamdani's preliminary budget proposes a false choice: either the state raises personal income and business taxes, or the city raises property taxes and saps money from reserves, including those to protect New Yorkers from a recession,” said Andrew Rein, president of the CBC. “The best choice is to eliminate spending that does not improve New Yorkers' lives and make government more efficient and effective.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) offered Republicans a suggestion on Tuesday on how to ensure a competitive Senate seat remains in GOP hands. 

Fetterman contended that President Donald Trump and Republicans have the opportunity to “lock down” Sen. John Cornyn's (R-TX) hotly contested seat by coming together to endorse the incumbent over two other leading GOP candidates looking to beat Cornyn in a three-way primary. Fetterman's comments echo the viewpoint that, among the GOP field, Cornyn holds the most viable chance of beating a field of Democratic contenders eying a chance to flip the seat blue. 

“For me, like for Texas, for example, Cornyn is a reasonable Republican, and now that would be money in the bank. But now I don't know why politically — I'm not sure why the Republicans and the president wouldn't sit on that and just lock down Texas,” Fetterman said during an interview on Fox Business Network's Mornings with Maria.

Fetterman's comments came hours after Trump told reporters he couldn't endorse a GOP candidate in the race, saying it was too difficult to pick between Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX). Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) has also stayed neutral as the March primary inches closer, even as recent polling has not appeared favorable to Cornyn's hopes of winning the March 3 primary outright, instead handing Paxton and Hunt an edge, according to surveys aggregated by the New York Times.  

“They've all supported me. They're all good, and you're supposed to pick one. So, we'll see what happens, but I support all three,” Trump said Monday evening. “I just haven't made a decision on that race yet. It's got a ways to go.”

The three Republicans have angled to portray themselves as the most pro-Trump candidates as they vie for Trump's endorsement. The divisive three-way race could likely head to a May 27 runoff, which would only be averted if one of the contenders tops 50% of the vote in the primary next month. 

In 2020, Cornyn won a fourth term in office by under 10 percentage points, marking the closest reelection battle of his career. 

COLBERT POSTS JAMES TALARICO INTERVIEW ON YOUTUBE AFTER CBS PULLS IT OFF AIR OVER FCC EQUAL TIME RULE

His latest bid has attracted millions in funding, with former Republican Gov. Rick Perry's Lone Star Freedom Project promising Tuesday the group would spend “whatever we need” to keep Cornyn in office. Perry's group has already spent nearly $18 million on the race, according to the Texas Tribune. 

Whoever wins the March contest will likely face either Reps. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) or Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, whose recent interviews with The View and Stephen Colbert have drawn scrutiny due to the Federal Communications Commission's equal-time rule, in the general election. The pair are the Democratic front-runners in the Senate race and have engaged in an intense rivalry ahead of the party's primary.

The ouster of the spokesperson Dave Butler, a colonel, shows that the defense secretary's culling is far from over. 

Sign up for our newsletter about national security here.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a Pentagon meeting last year, passed a note to Army Secretary Dan Driscoll about one of Driscoll's top aides, asking, in effect: Why hasn't this guy been fired yet?

The aide, Colonel Dave Butler, a former infantry officer, is a longtime leader in Army public affairs (not a specialty Hegseth embraces) who worked closely with the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley (whom Hegseth despises). On Thursday, Hegseth finally got his way: Butler was pushed out.

The issue was not that Butler was incompetent in his job; quite the opposite. Both Driscoll and the Army's chief of staff, General Randy George, are said to have valued his advice, experience, and the reforms that he initiated—and it was their endorsement, when combined with Butler's previous assignment with Milley, that ruined his chance of making the rank of general.

Defense secretaries don't usually get involved in decisions about the careers of colonels and other mid-level commanders, given that the lead civilian in the Pentagon is supposed to oversee war planning, a department of 3 million people, and America's nuclear arsenal. Ever since the World War I era, when the United States established a large-scale standing force, individual branches have typically had a say in promotions and other personnel decisions. These choices are supposed to be based on merit.

Hegseth, more than any other of his predecessors, has weighed in on the makeup of the military's top leaders. He has fired or sidelined dozens of three- and four-star officers, in many cases without any clear reason other than their perceived disloyalty to Hegseth's beliefs, alleged support for diversity programs, or coziness with people regarded as foes of the administration.

With Butler's removal, Hegseth has displayed a willingness to reach further down in the ranks—there are roughly 4,000 colonels in the Army alone—and demonstrated that, one year after his appointment, he still doesn't feel that his campaign of purges has gone far enough.

“The secretary of defense is spending his time doing things that those well below his pay grade should be doing,” Kori Schake, who directs foreign and defense policy at the American Enterprise Institute and released a book last year about civil-military relations, told us. “And he is not doing the things that only the secretary of defense can do.”

Hegseth's office referred our questions to the Army. The spokesperson Cynthia Smith said in an email that Butler would retire: “His integral role in the Army's transformation efforts will be missed.”

Butler, who declined to comment, wasn't a typical colonel. Over the past dozen years, he emerged as a powerful force within the Army as an adviser to the top officers, including Milley, who clashed repeatedly with Trump, particularly after the summer of 2020, when Milley had said that he regretted walking alongside Trump after federal forces cleared Lafayette Square of protesters. Before that, Butler worked under the now-retired General Austin “Scott” Miller, the head of Joint Special Operations Command and a onetime chief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. That put Butler in the room for major decisions both for the Army—he helped organize the Army's 250th-anniversary parade in Washington, D.C., in June—and for U.S. defense policy more broadly.

More recently, Butler served as a top adviser to Driscoll and George, and he was understood to be highly valued by both men. But Butler was also divisive, in part because of his influence over so many parts of the military—and the public-affairs community.

Hegseth and Driscoll have had a tense year. Driscoll, a confidant of Vice President Vance, has emerged as a rival at the Pentagon to the former Fox News host. Unlike Hegseth—who arrived in his position following a bruising confirmation process that surfaced allegations of mismanagement, heavy drinking, and sexual assault—Driscoll cuts a clean-living profile, has won allies in Congress with his more genial demeanor, and at times has outshone his boss.

While Hegseth has focused on internal purges and the campaign of strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, Driscoll's star has risen with his participation in U.S. efforts to mediate an end to Russia's war in Ukraine. Driscoll was in Geneva today on that assignment, working with two of Trump's special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. (Driscoll couldn't immediately be reached for comment.)

After last year's meeting where Hegseth questioned Driscoll about Butler, both Driscoll and George kept Butler in their inner circle. For the Army, it was not just about protecting Butler's place. It was also about standing up for Driscoll's and George's roles in deciding who leads their force.

Top Army officials, over Hegseth's objections, decided to keep Butler in the promotion queue during the past year. But Hegseth's stonewalling of Butler's advancement was one reason that a larger group of proposed promotions, which needed sign-off from Pentagon leadership before being sent to the White House, was delayed for months, defense officials told us. Some Army officials had hoped that the extra time would ultimately benefit Butler. But after another meeting between Hegseth and Driscoll on Thursday, Driscoll followed Hegseth's order and removed Butler. “The Army delayed this inevitable decision and in the end Hegseth said, ‘Enough's enough,'” one defense official told us.

Butler's ouster wasn't primarily a result of Hegseth's rivalry with Driscoll, according to people familiar with the situation. Rather, they said, it stemmed more from Hegseth's antipathy toward military officials closely associated with Milley. Hegseth and Trump have both accused Milley of treason, and Trump once suggested that Milley should be executed. One of Hegseth's first actions after taking office was removing Milley's official portrait from its place in a Pentagon hallway. Earlier this month, Hegseth replaced General James Mingus, the Army's widely respected second in command who also had worked on the Joint Staff under Milley. Hegseth installed General Christopher LaNeve, one of his own aides, in the post. LaNeve supported the decision to remove Butler, a former defense official told us.

Hegseth and his staff have shown a particular interest in Pentagon PR. An Air Force colonel who served as spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Dan Caine was removed over a years-old social-media post asking for better support for Afghans as U.S. forces withdrew. Hegseth also censured Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, after the retired Navy captain published a video urging troops to refuse unlawful orders. And Hegseth implemented a rule that effectively required reporters to seek Pentagon approval before publishing stories or they would risk losing their press accreditation, leading hundreds of journalists to walk out in the fall.

Read: The Mark Kelly case is bigger than it seems 

News of Butler's ouster appeared to have the effect that Hegseth desired as word spread across the military's public-affairs community. Officials told us that they feared angering Hegseth and also saw his interference as a direct contradiction of what the military teaches its commanders: that strong leaders focus on the job the military needs them to do, not on anyone else's role.

“Hegseth's decision speaks to a broader effort to shape the long-term trajectory of the military,” one former defense official told us. “By getting involved at the colonel rank, Hegseth could reshape the military three, five, seven, even 10 years down the road.”

Such micromanaging in the officer ranks because of political or personal animus risks further polarizing the military and undermining its status as one of America's final refuges from hyper-partisanship.

Europe and Canada seek “strategic balance” between Washington and Beijing but often just get caught in the middle.

Sign up for our newsletter about national security here.

The urge to visit Beijing has gotten stronger lately among allies of the United States. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who referred to China last year as his country's biggest security threat, made the trip last month, as did his British counterpart, Keir Starmer. Next week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who heads the largest economy in Europe, plans to meet with Xi Jinping during a three-day visit packed with discussions of security and trade.

In a speech this past weekend at the Munich Security Conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. “will always be a child of Europe.” But the geopolitical divide between the U.S. and China has made Canadians and Europeans look more like the children in a bad divorce, shuttling between two feuding parents, pleasing neither, and risking retaliation if they take sides. Carney said as much in a memorable speech last month in Davos, where he bemoaned the fact that the superpowers are now vying for dominance in ways that place their own self-interest over cooperation. And they are prepared to dole out punishment to those who offend them. “Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,” Carney said.

That approach has forced Canada and other medium-size nations to pursue the same transactional self-interest, Carney noted. Hence his Beijing visit a few days before he gave the speech. “We are seeking to ensure our own economic resilience,” Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand, who traveled with Carney to Beijing, told us last week. “That means we have to diversify our trading partners.” And what about Carney's statement in April, during his election campaign, about the looming security threat from the Chinese? Has it disappeared?

The diplomat stiffened. “Let's take a step back,” she said, before offering a disquisition on all that President Trump had done to Canada since returning to office a year ago, including imposing steep tariffs on Canadian-made steel, aluminum, cars, and lumber. “Canada is seeking to double non-U.S. trade over the next 10 years,” Anand said. “That was the purpose of the trip.”

Canada's overtures to Beijing clearly got Trump's attention. In a post on Truth Social last week, the president wrote that Carney “wants to make a deal with China—which will eat Canada alive. We'll just get the leftovers! I don't think so.” Trump then threatened to prevent a newly built bridge between Ontario and Michigan from opening, at least until Canada starts treating the U.S. “with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve.”

It can be hard to keep track of the insults and intimidation that U.S. allies have faced from the Trump administration over the past year. But the indignities have been enough to make many traditionally steadfast American partners talk in private about a permanent rupture in relations with Washington. Carney's speech in Davos brought the hand-wringing into the open, and it offered a way for “middle powers” to move forward by banding together against global hegemons like the United States.

But in practice, Carney's response to Trump's bullying has been a newfound openness to China. He agreed on a plan, during his visit there last month, for the Chinese to lower trade barriers on a variety of Canadian goods, including beef, lobsters, and pet food. As of yesterday, Canadian citizens are now allowed to travel to China without a visa for up to 30 days. “We are forging a new strategic partnership,” Carney declared.

Yet given the power differential between China and Canada—or, for that matter, between China and any NATO ally other than the United States—such a partnership will not be among equals. And were Canada in the future to veer back toward the U.S., which remains by far its biggest trading partner, Carney could expect the kind of retaliation from Beijing that Trump now threatens. In other words, Canada and others might consider the smart move to be economically and diplomatically hedging their bets between Washington and Beijing. But they are just as likely to get stuck between a pair of repelling magnets, pushed and pulled by the world's superpowers.

Plenty of European countries have been here before, swinging between the U.S. and China, and they have learned the perils. During the Biden administration, the U.S. pressured its allies to take a harder line against China, and many complied. Among the most eager was the tiny nation of Lithuania, which blocked Chinese companies from building its 5G communications network and other infrastructure.

“At least temporarily, it had a positive impact on our relations with the United States,” the president of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda, told us. In part to keep the good vibes going, his government antagonized China further in 2021 by allowing Taiwan to build a representative office in Vilnius, the capital. (China sees Taiwan as a rogue province and aims to take it back by force if necessary.)

The Lithuanian decision to welcome Taiwan earned applause from the American foreign-policy establishment; the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, referred to Lithuania as a “trailblazer” in the push to counter Chinese influence in Europe. Lithuania shares an approximately 180-mile-long border with Russia and would not be able to defend that frontier without help from its allies in the NATO alliance. “For us, being so vulnerable, and being in such a sensitive place on Earth, it's very important to keep the focus of the United States on the one hand and of European allies on the other hand,” Nausėda said.

But the price of maintaining that focus “was quite dramatic,” he said. “China started economic coercion against us.” Lithuanian diplomats were forced to leave their embassy in China, which moved to temporarily block the import of Lithuanian goods. The government in Vilnius hoped the confrontation would pay off with a greater American commitment to its country's security. “It was a strategic choice,” Gabrielius Landsbergis, who was the foreign minister of Lithuania during the Biden administration, told us. “And our cooperation with the previous administration was very successful.”

Soon after Trump returned to the White House, however, the security dividends that Lithuania had earned began to dissipate. Under the new administration, “small countries do not matter,” Landsbergis said, summarizing Trump's approach to geopolitics. “That's a problem for us. When great powers begin carving up the world, we find ourselves no longer at the table, but on the menu.”

In recent weeks, as the tensions between the U.S. and Europe have intensified, the Lithuanian government has come to regret its decision to stand up to Beijing. Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginienė said earlier this month that it had been a “big mistake” to allow the opening of the Taiwanese representative office. “I believe that Lithuania really jumped in front of a train and lost,” she told the Baltic News Service.

China seems ready to accept Lithuania's atonement. A spokesperson for its foreign ministry said the door to Beijing remains open as long as Lithuania intends to “correct its wrongdoings at an early date.” But Lithuania's president does not see a strategic turn toward China as an option at this point. Even as other European countries are rushing to foster relations with Beijing, the Lithuanians intend to stick with the Americans. “There's no alternative,” Nausėda said in our interview. For the moment, at least, they are stuck with Trump.

Over the long term, if Europeans want to avoid falling under the sway of either of the world's two dominant superpowers, they can try to form their own geopolitical center of gravity. But that would require speaking with one voice, and their scattershot outreach to China makes that difficult. In December, when French President Emmanuel Macron visited Beijing, his team reportedly wanted the European Union's most senior official, Ursula von der Leyen, to accompany him.

“This was seen as an effort to ‘Europeanise' his dealings with Beijing,” the South China Morning Post reported at the time. The Chinese authorities reportedly turned down the idea, preferring instead to deal with European leaders one by one, and Macron agreed to come without his EU counterpart. In preparation for next week's trip, Germany's Merz met on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference with Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister. Wang applauded the German leader for planning the trip in a way that would maintain Berlin's “strategic autonomy and self-reliance.”

That approach has raised concerns among Germany's smaller allies in Europe, who worry that they could be left behind. Petr Pavel, the president of the Czech Republic, does not have the option of traveling to Beijing. “I am persona non grata in China,” Pavel told us in an interview last week. The Chinese banned him from the country last summer, after he paid a visit to India to wish a happy birthday to the Dalai Lama, who turned 90 in July. (China regards the spiritual leader of Tibet as a separatist “wolf in monk's clothing.”)

The timing of Pavel's meeting with the holy man looks unfortunate in hindsight. It took place only a few months before U.S. relations with Europe reached a crisis point, when Trump, in January, threatened to seize the island of Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. The resulting rupture sent the Europeans scrambling to line up trips to Beijing. But when we asked Pavel about his regrets, he said he has none. “We have to understand that China is not an ally,” he said. “It is at best our competitor.”

Read: The hole in Trump's rationale for acquiring Greenland

Pavel understands the desire among some of his peers to look to Beijing amid the rising tensions with Washington, but he would prefer they take a more confident and unified approach. “Europe should become its own zone of influence,” he said. “Not looking eastwards and then westwards and back again, always being afraid for our security, but instead to become stronger and on our own, economically stronger and also militarily.” That may be the better long-term strategy, but there remain serious doubts whether the Europeans can pull it off.

Carney is leading his own effort to form, in effect, a third superpower that can resist the gravitational pulls of both the United States and China. Talks are under way among Canada, the European Union, and 12 Indo-Pacific nations to form a new trade alliance that would potentially represent the world's largest economic bloc. Asked about it yesterday, Carney told reporters that “Canada can play a role” in forming a new alliance, adding that his country is in a “unique position” to “broker a bridge” between the two groups of nations in Europe and Asia.

In the meantime, the U.S. is demanding more if Ottawa wants to remain in Trump's good graces. In August, Trump increased tariffs on Canadian goods to 35 percent, saying Carney's government hadn't done enough of what Washington wants. Last month, Trump threatened to decertify any aircraft made in Canada until the Canadians certify American-made Gulfstreams. Canada is now reconsidering its decades-old agreement to buy F-35A fighter jets from Lockheed Martin and may instead buy Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 E Gripens.

The pressure on Canada seems to be part of a broader Trump-administration strategy to reinvigorate American industries and limit—maybe even eliminate—any products that don't carry a Made in America label. When Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick spoke to a Toronto audience last year, he suggested that Canada should not even be making cars. It would be better, he suggested, to consolidate the entire North American auto industry in the U.S. Needless to say, that has been viewed in Canada as just another way the U.S. is seeking to flex its muscles at Canadians' expense.

“We are being bombarded with complaints, grievances, tariffs, more tariffs,” Giles Gherson, president and CEO of the Toronto Region Board of Trade, Canada's largest chamber of commerce, told us. “As soon as the concessions are made and they're pocketed, new demands show up—and relentlessly.”

Ultimately, Trump's posturing toward Canada isn't about Canada. It's about seeking to sustain Washington's superiority over China and making sure that American allies know their place. The president won't let anything—not even a very public dispute with America's friendly neighbor to the north—get in the way.

Elite universities are taking the concept of a satellite campus to its logical extreme.

Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, is the sort of highly selective institution that jockeys for the unofficial title of Harvard of the South. Recently, the university's chancellor had a new idea: What if Vanderbilt was also in San Francisco? Maybe it could become the Harvard of the West too.

Last month, Vanderbilt announced that it was acquiring the facilities of the financially insolvent California College of the Arts and would be converting the space into a new campus. Private universities have been experimenting with satellite campuses for decades. Typically, these outposts are either overseas or limited to a graduate program or two. The Vanderbilt expansion, set to open in 2027, will be different: It will include a full-blown, four-year undergraduate college, not in Abu Dhabi but in the San Francisco Design District. This new tactic, pioneered by Northeastern University a few years ago, is taking the satellite-campus concept to its logical extreme: the national-chain model of undergraduate education. If it works for Vanderbilt, other selective institutions are likely to follow—because no one really wants to be the Harvard of the South. Everyone wants to be Harvard. Perhaps the way for excellent regional schools to develop a national reputation is to set up shop around the nation.

For most of the history of higher education, a university has been ineluctably tied to a particular city: Bologna. Oxford. Cambridge. The other Cambridge. In the United States, the first wave of satellite campuses began to appear in the post–World War II period as the share of Americans attending college surged. To meet growing demand, public universities opened branches in far-flung areas of their state. (Most Texans, for example, live far from Austin.) That's how systems such as the University of California evolved into sprawling behemoths.

Rose Horowitch: The college backlash is a mirage

The next phase of expansions was very different. In the 2000s, some private institutions began establishing international outposts to cash in on global demand for their prestige. Northwestern University started awarding bachelor's degrees out of a campus in Qatar in 2008. Columbia opened a Middle East research center in Amman, Jordan, in 2009. The next year, New York University established an undergraduate campus in Abu Dhabi; NYU Shanghai followed not long after. Less selective institutions are trying this approach as well: The University of New Haven recently announced that it would create a campus for undergraduates and grad students in Riyadh. “You would find some authoritarian petro-state somewhere that had a ton of money and was very impressed by the brand allure of high-class American universities,” Kevin Carey, the vice president of education and work at the think tank New America, told me.

More recently, colleges have focused on domestic expansion, creating outposts in the nation's capital. Nearly 20 institutions have satellite campuses in Washington, D.C. Some are small, occupying a floor of an office building; others, including the University of Southern California and Arizona State University, have their own buildings emblazoned with their school's logo in massive font. In 2019, Johns Hopkins University, based in Baltimore, paid more than $370 million to acquire a new home for its School of Advanced International Studies in the building that had previously housed the Newseum. D.C. campuses tend to confer graduate degrees and serve as a home base for undergrads interning on Capitol Hill and K Street. They also give university leaders easy access to government officials.

The school that has come closest to a true brick-and-mortar national-chain model is Northeastern University, which is known for its emphasis on combining academics with career-focused internships. In the 2010s, as the university's officials realized that they could attract only so many students to Boston, the school began setting up campuses to reach more markets. “A university cannot be defined by its campus,” Joseph Aoun, Northeastern's president, told me. “We're going to them rather than asking them to come to one campus.” Since 2011, Northeastern has opened eight graduate-focused branch campuses in major cities across the U.S. and Canada. These are designed to help students network and land a job in their preferred city after graduation. Northeastern has used this strategy to enroll more students—raising tuition revenue—without increasing the main campus's acceptance rates. “Going back about 25 years ago, Northeastern was a top-150 university,” Peter Stokes, a higher-education consultant who previously worked at Northeastern and helped launch its expansion, told me. “Today it's a top-50 university.”

Most graduate programs are small. Setting up a full undergraduate campus is a much more ambitious undertaking. In 2022, Northeastern acquired Mills College, in Oakland, absorbing the school's real estate and some tenured faculty, and creating Northeastern University at Oakland. Two years later, it merged with Marymount Manhattan College to create a New York–based undergraduate campus. Aoun calls Northeastern a “global university system.” He said, “We don't like to call them branch campuses, because our model is not to export into another city or another country what we have been doing in Boston.”

Now comes Vanderbilt, adopting a similar strategy. Daniel Diermeier, the school's chancellor, is widely perceived within higher ed as trying to elbow into the Harvard-Yale-Stanford stratum. When I asked him if the expansion plan is an effort to rise in the rankings, he deflected, saying that “​​our aspiration is to be innovative.” But he did not deny a certain ambition. “A core component of being a great university in the 21st century is to be part of an innovation economy,” he said. He pointed to Stanford in the 1990s, when the university and its surrounding area became the global center of the tech industry. “If you believe that, then it matters where you are,” Diermeier told me. “Location becomes a strategy.” It's easier to entice the top computer-science professors to work in the Bay Area than in Nashville. Diermeier expects the San Francisco campus to eventually host 1,000 students and 100 faculty members. (Vanderbilt is also opening a graduate campus in West Palm Beach and recently opened a study-away program in Manhattan.)

Ian Bogost: The accidental winners of the war on higher ed

The education-franchise model—Diermeier calls it “network campuses”—can be a risky proposition. Drexel University, in Philadelphia, tried to improve its reputation by opening a graduate-focused satellite campus in Sacramento. The effort fizzled out six years later. Middlebury College, in Vermont, is similarly winding down its graduate programs in Monterey, California. “It can become like managing an empire,” Stokes said. “It's like being Rome in the fourth century. If you get too geographically dispersed, it can be difficult to maintain the front of the empire.”

For top schools, the biggest risk might be brand dilution. Ivy League universities are highly unlikely to open new campuses around the country. Their power and prestige depend on exclusivity. The institutions in the next tier down are exclusive, too, but they're also more willing to experiment. Vanderbilt has less of a national brand to dilute—indeed, that's the problem it's trying to solve.

Other top-tier schools will therefore be watching to see how Vanderbilt's expansion plays out, and some may follow suit. The population of American 18-year-olds is expected to peak this year, followed by a precipitous decline. Stokes's consulting firm has identified nearly 400 private colleges that are at risk of closure in the next five to 10 years. Everyone's jockeying to be in the best position on the other side of the crisis. “For institutions like Northeastern and Vanderbilt, taking advantage of this weakening and precarity that certain institutions are experiencing, that creates an opportunity for them to get real estate,” he said. Small colleges in major cities or Sun Belt states, which have seen a population boom, are valuable sites for branch campuses. Aoun said that at least one college asks to be acquired by Northeastern each week. Ryan Allen, an education professor at Soka University of America, calls it higher education's “Age of Conquest”: The big schools will get bigger, and the smaller schools will be absorbed. Soon, high-school seniors who get accepted into a top college might start having to answer a question that their parents never did: “Which location?”

The well-off have no experience with the job market that might be coming.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

White-collar workers are getting nervous, with good reason. Sure, 98 percent of college graduates who want a job still have one, and wages are ticking up. Sure, some companies that cite the labor-saving, efficiency-promoting effects of ChatGPT and Claude as they let employees go are just “AI washing”—talking about algorithms to distract from poor managerial decisions.

But the labor market for office workers is beginning to shift. Americans with a bachelor's degree account for a quarter of the unemployed, a record. High-school graduates are finding jobs quicker than college graduates, an unprecedented trend. Occupations susceptible to AI automation have seen sharp spikes in joblessness. Businesses really are shrinking payroll and cutting costs as they deploy AI. In recent weeks, Baker McKenzie, a white-shoe law firm, axed 700 employees, Salesforce sacked hundreds of workers, and the auditing firm KPMG negotiated lower fees with its own auditor. Two CNBC reporters with no engineering experience “vibe-coded” a clone of Monday.com's workflow-management platform in less than an hour. When they released their story, Monday.com's stock tanked.

Maybe algorithm-driven changes will happen slowly, giving workers plenty of time to adjust. Maybe white-collar types have 12 to 18 months left. Maybe the AI-related job carnage will be contained to a sliver of the economy. Maybe we should be more worried about a stock-market bubble than an AI-driven labor revolution.

I don't think anyone knows what will happen, or even what is happening now. AI technology is changing at an exponential pace, and changing the workforce in a thousand hard-to-parse ways. But if AI quickly eliminates white-collar work, the country is going to end up in something much stranger than a downturn, and something much harder to recover from too.

The United States is adept enough at handling the labor-market damage caused by recessions. Congress slashes taxes, writes stimulus checks, and fattens unemployment-insurance payouts. Washington amps up infrastructure spending and patches holes in the budgets of state and local governments. The Federal Reserve drops interest rates down to zero and purchases hundreds of billions of dollars of safe assets, making borrowing cheaper for families and encouraging businesses to invest. Demand increases, pushing the unemployment rate down and GDP up.

But if white-collar layoffs cause a downturn, Washington might not be able to restore hiring and lift consumer spending as it has done before. Businesses wouldn't need the skills workers possess. Firms wouldn't want to hire the legions of accountants, engineers, lawyers, middle managers, human-resources executives, financial analysts, PR types, and customer-service agents they just laid off. (Writers would be fine, I choose to believe.) The United States would have a “structural” unemployment problem, as economists put it, not a “cyclical” demand problem.

The country has struggled with structural joblessness in the past, but the problem has tended to afflict blue-collar workers, not white-collar ones. The labor market is normally womblike in the security it delivers the college-educated. The downsizing trend of the 1990s did not actually result in the pool of office jobs shrinking. Even during the Great Recession, the unemployment rate for workers with a bachelor's degree never went higher than 5.3 percent. For workers with only an associate's degree or some college credits, it hit 9 percent; for workers with only a high-school diploma, 11.9 percent.

In this new economic paradigm, the educated and well-to-do would fare worse than their less-educated and lower-income neighbors. The main bulwark against joblessness—the unemployment-insurance system—wouldn't meet the challenge. Payments last for only so long: six months at most currently, 18 months during the coronavirus pandemic. If AI eliminated the need for office work, many people would be unemployed for years; their earnings would potentially fall, their mental health would deteriorate, and their chance of finding a new position would diminish with every month that passed. Plus, the unemployment system isn't designed to support six-figure earners. Most state payments max out at $500 or $600 a week, a quarter of what many upper-middle-class employees earn. Young workers would face their own challenges: The pool of entry-level white-collar jobs would shrink, as it already is, pushing recent graduates' income down for years, even decades.

If rich households cut back on spending, many businesses that have nothing to do with AI—grocery stores, gas stations, retail shops, hairdressers, restaurants—would suffer and the labor market would keep deteriorating. The housing market would begin to falter; home prices in many regions would fall and fewer properties would go to market. Tax revenue might fall. Bond yields might go up as the country's deficits increased, making it harder for the Fed to stimulate investment. Rank-and-file workers' incomes would drop at the same time that executives using AI to cut costs would see their wealth increase. Inequality would rise to even higher heights. The 0.01 percent would pull away from the 0.1 percent, which would pull away from the 1 percent.

White-collar workers would go through what blue-collar workers went through beginning in the 1970s. Advances in machine technology improved productivity and depressed employment in Detroit; Pittsburgh; Gary, Indiana; and Worcester, Massachusetts. Rust Belt communities fell apart and never recovered. Then China joined the World Trade Organization, and globalization spurred another round of job losses, causing even more permanent damage. Affected workers ended up poorer, less happy, and less healthy. They died sooner. Their kids were worse off too.

To get the economy going again during the AI transition, the country would need to figure out how to get white-collar workers back to work. And I really mean figure out—essentially from scratch. Existing workforce-training initiatives have yielded “muted” and “inconclusive” results. Existing displaced-worker initiatives have “dubious” value. These kinds of programs offer net-negative value to participants, taxpayers, and “society as a whole,” studies have found. Community-college programs have the strongest track record, but the overwhelming majority of office workers have a two-year or four-year degree already. The country doesn't have answers that don't involve upskilling, education, or trying and failing to compensate the losers.

Silicon Valley leaders are enamored of one policy Hail Mary: the establishment of a universal basic income, in which the government would provide all adults with $1,500 a month or so, no strings attached and in perpetuity. It's not as crazy an idea as it sounds; think of it as Social Security for everyone, or an extension of the earned-income tax credit to families without any earned income. The cash would ensure that every family kept its head above water, and redistribute the wealth generated by rising productivity. “People will be freed up to spend more time with people they care about, care for people, appreciate art and nature, or work toward social good,” Sam Altman of OpenAI has argued.

But UBI is a dystopian outcome, not a utopian one. For families to thrive in this new post-work paradigm, the government would need to redistribute a lot more than $1,500 per person per month, necessitating confiscatory taxes on corporations—taxes they would fight tooth and nail. The bigger problem would be that Americans would hate a world without work, where the jobless rate floats at 30 percent instead of 4 percent. Many Americans like working. They like having somewhere to go during the day. They like trading watercooler stories with their colleagues. They like getting promoted and starting their own firms. They are proud of earning a living. Long-term unemployment destroys people's mental and physical health, and generates toxic societal unrest. Politicians love saying that Americans want a hand up, not a handout—and they aren't wrong.

Perhaps Americans would adjust, and American culture would adjust in turn. Maybe people would become more interested in and fulfilled by leisure, art, and other activities. But it's hard to imagine social capital being divorced from actual capital. It's even harder to imagine the country becoming more egalitarian and its politics more participatory, instead of developing a hyper-wealthy techno-oligarchy and a dispossessed and teed-off underclass. Some people would spend their time gardening, volunteering, painting, exercising, or learning. Others would spend hours a day watching short-form videos and never leave their apartments.

I don't really think society will come to this. Throughout history, people have used technology to become more productive and prosperous without reducing the demand for human labor overall. Then again, maybe I'm just in denial.

What Brazil got right that America got wrong.

BRASÍLIA, Brazil — André Borges's aunt was pregnant when they took her.

Borges, now 50, grew up under Brazil's military dictatorship. In power from 1964–1985, the regime was violently censorial — banning any speech it deemed subversive or leftist. Borges's aunt was arrested simply for owning a book by a Marxist author. Unlike many others, her detention was brief; her father knew someone with pull in the regime, who made a phone call and got her released within a day.

Sitting in a left-wing bookshop in the capital city of Brasília, Borges tells me this story to underscore the fragility of Brazilian democracy. A political scientist who studies polarization and the Latin American right, he does not believe that Brazil has truly exorcised the demons of the past. The military is still uncomfortably involved in political life; as memory of the dictatorship recedes, citizens are increasingly oblivious to the danger.

But I had not come to Brazil to discuss its democracy's vulnerabilities. Quite the opposite; I wanted Borges, and others like him, to help me understand why the Brazilian system proved far more capable than its American cousin at a paramount task: protecting democracy from a civilian president who wished to be dictator.

In 2018, Brazilian voters elected Jair Bolsonaro — a former military captain and congressional backbencher — to the presidency. An open admirer of the military regime, Bolsonaro ran as an outsider against a political class that Brazilians widely (and correctly) regard as deeply corrupt. Once in office, he pushed aggressively to consolidate power in his own hands.

But while Bolsonaro's efforts resembled what Donald Trump has done in his second term in the United States, the response from other branches was markedly different.

While the US Congress and the Supreme Court have helped Trump build an imperial presidency, their Brazilian equivalents held the line. Center-right parties in Congress refused to rubber-stamp Bolsonaro's power grabs. Brazil's Supreme Court repeatedly blocked the president's authoritarian moves, and led aggressive probes into crimes against democracy.

Unable to accrue power through legal channels, Bolsonaro turned to the military, convening top generals in 2022 to discuss a coup. Yet the heads of the Air Force and the Army rebuffed him. When Bolsonaro's hardcore supporters attempted a putsch on January 8, 2023 — an insurrection in Brasília deeply influenced by January 6, 2021 — the military did not join the uprising. After an extensive inquiry and trial, Bolsonaro and several key allies were sentenced to lengthy prison stints for the coup plot and subsequent riot.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

On paper, the outcomes in the United States and Brazil should have been reversed. Democratic strength tends to track a democracy's wealth and age — and the United States is both the world's richest country and its oldest democracy. Brazil is a middle-income country that was governed by a military regime so recently that middle-aged citizens remember living under it.

And yet, when the test came, Brazil's core democratic institutions — the legislature, courts, and federal agencies — defended democracy far better than their American peers.

Why?

To find out, I spoke with all sorts of different Brazilians during my travels: from politicians and bureaucrats to journalists and political scientists, and even one of Bolsonaro's longtime neighbors.

What I found was a paradox: that some of the biggest problems in Brazil's democracy, issues that fueled Bolsonaro's rise in 2018, also made the system almost uniquely resistant to the tactics Trump is using in America today.

“We certainly have weaker institutions than the US does,” said Pedro Doria, editor-in-chief of the Brazilian news outlet Meio. “But in a certain sense, our strength comes from the fact that our institutions are weak.”

To learn Brazilian democracy's lessons, we need to first sit with this tension. And we need to understand Brazil as it is: not as an idealized foil for America, but a real place in all its complexity. Only then can we identify how we can make America's institutions as willing to fight for democracy as Brazil's.

In Rio de Janeiro, I climbed a set of hilly, narrow streets to meet another well-known political scientist named Carlos Pereira for a drink.

He had described our destination as a music bar, but that did the place a disservice: It was more like a gigantic party that snaked across at least two blocks, with a small building housing the band stage at the center of it. It was hot in Rio, the peak of the mid-January summer, but people packed in anyway. A vegan brownie salesperson dressed up as a cannabis leaf roamed the crowd.

The ambience made talking tricky, but Pereira wanted me to experience “the real Brazil” while I was visiting. I think, though, he may also just have been in a partying mood — and I could see why. Brazil's emergence from democratic crisis seems to have vindicated the argument he had staked his career on: that its constitution works.

Many people had pointed out the striking difference between how Brazil responded to the January 8 riots versus how the United States responded to January 6. But what no one had done, at least in any depth, is look at the period before that — when Bolsonaro was president — and compared it to Trump's second term so far.

How is it that, when faced with an openly undemocratic leader, Brazil's Congress and Supreme Court performed so much better than their twins in the United States?

When Brazil's military dictatorship fell in 1985, the country elected a constitutional congress to build a new system from scratch. What they came up with, called the Citizen Constitution of 1988, was heavily modeled on the United States: a president, a bicameral Congress, and a federal system with 26 states and a federal district.

But the Chamber of Deputies, Brazil's lower legislative body, is different from the US House. The US has local districts that elect representatives by a winner-take-all system: whoever gets the most votes wins. Brazil, by contrast, has proportional representation: Each state has a set number of seats, allocated to different parties based on their percentage of the state popular vote.

While the US system encouraged consolidation into two parties, the Brazilian system allowed for many parties to win a slice of national power. All it took was a relatively small fraction of the vote in one state. There are currently 20 parties in the chamber, making it one of the most fragmented legislative bodies in the world.

At the time, many American experts (and some prominent Brazilians) predicted disaster. With so many parties splitting seats, no president could hope to have a partisan majority in Congress. Instead, presidents would have to build coalitions and strike deals with out-parties, a system that seemed prone to legislative gridlock and even collapse.

“The combination of presidentialism and multipartism makes stable democracy difficult to sustain,” Scott Mainwaring, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame, wrote in an influential 1993 article. “Not one of the world's 31 stable democracies has this institutional configuration.”

But for the next 20 years, Brazil's system flourished. Two historically successful presidencies — center-right Fernando Henrique Cardoso, followed by the first two terms of the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — tamed the country's hyperinflation crisis and significantly expanded its welfare state. Between 1990 and 2010, Brazil's GDP per capita grew by over 40 percent. By 2013, the country had formally eradicated extreme poverty.

Pereira was part of a generation of Brazilian political scientists who began their careers during Brazil's stratospheric rise. In his view, the policy accomplishments under Cardoso and Lula were not in spite of its system but because of it.

In a 2012 article co-authored with Marcus André Melo, Pereira argued the key to Brazil's system lay in the relationship between the president and Congress. Unlike in two-party systems, where presidents count on partisan loyalty to pass bills, presidents in multiparty democracies have to trade specific favors. Sometimes, this means appointing leaders of other parties to the Cabinet. Other times, it means using presidential powers to direct ungodly levels of pork-barrel spending to states represented by swing legislators.

Indeed, the dominant bloc in Congress is neither the ideological left aligned with Lula nor the radical right associated with Bolsonaro. It is instead something called the Centrão (Big Center): a loose group of parties that are center-right ideologically, but in practice willing to deal with any president who will help them secure pork funding and ignore their pervasive corruption.

Brazil thus replaced the American political logic of partisanship and ideology with self-interest and graft. Most deputies do not even aim to represent the general interest, but rather to secure enough pork for their constituents to ensure reelection. And the system encourages Brazil's executive to overlook the endemic corruption in the legislature; without ideological votes, a push for anti-corruption campaigns will not only fail but also alienate the corrupt.

Pereira and Melo acknowledged these downsides, but argued that they were not existential. The self-interested logic bound Brazilian leaders to the system, giving them a direct financial and careerist stake in maintaining democracy.

“We see a powerful presidency but also a potent web of watchdogs standing on guard to prevent wrongdoing,” they write. “All relevant political forces have found it best to keep submitting their interests and values to the uncertain interplay of democratic institutions.”

Soon after they wrote this, Brazil's democracy would plunge into crisis.

In 2014, Brazilian investigators uncovered shocking evidence of corruption at the highest levels of Brazilian politics. The multibillion-dollar “Lava Jato” scandal, one of the largest in the history of any democracy, implicated a vast swath of Brazil's political, economic, and social elite — producing the greatest period of turmoil since the dictatorship fell.

President Dilma Rousseff, a former anti-dictatorship guerrilla and Lula's chosen successor in the left-wing Workers' Party (PT), was impeached in 2016 for alleged financial improprieties unrelated to the investigation. Her vice president, the center-right Michel Temer, was criminally charged as part of Lava Jato in 2017. Lula was arrested and convicted on (extremely dubious) corruption charges in 2017 as well; when he tried to run for president again in 2018 from prison, the courts blocked him.

All of this played out during a major economic downturn. Together, they caused an explosion of anti-incumbent sentiment in much the same manner as the twin shocks of inflation and revelations about President Joe Biden's age did in 2024.

Thus, what Pereira and Melo identified as the glue holding Brazilian democracy — the transactional character of its legislators — set the stage for the rise of a would-be autocrat.

In early 2018, reporter Ana Clara Costa spent roughly two months with Jair Bolsonaro on the campaign trail. When we met for coffee in Rio, Costa summarized her impressions of the man during those months in three words: “He was insane.”

“Everything he said was so narrow-minded…it was very much based on conspiracy theories, things that were trending on Facebook,” she recalls. “I thought he was [playing] a character, but…the character was what he was 24/7.”

Bolsonaro's public record certainly supported her claims. He made no secret of his nostalgia for military dictatorship: When he voted to impeach Rousseff, he dedicated his vote to the army colonel who supervised her torture in the 1970s. Once, he told a female legislator that “I wouldn't rape you because you don't deserve it.” Another time, he told an interviewer that given the choice between one of his sons coming out as gay or dying, he'd prefer the latter.

Yet in an anti-incumbent moment, none of this was disqualifying — and perhaps even helped by situating him well outside the “normal” political elite. He won the 2018 election handily.

When Bolsonaro assumed office in January 2019, he had many of the same advantages as Trump did in 2025. Both men began with relatively high favorability numbers, owing to the combination of a rabid base and anti-establishment sentiment among swing voters. Both had a legislature with a center-right majority.

And both sought to take advantage in the same way: wielding presidential authority aggressively to consolidate power.

In his first weeks, Bolsonaro used the expansive formal powers of his office — including provisional decrees, which are like executive orders with the legal status of a law — to surveil NGOs, purge “disloyal” civil servants, and loosen gun restrictions. His moves pushed the boundaries of presidential power, cutting into authority rightly reserved for Congress.

“Bolsonaro, he's not a politician in the common sense,” Thomas Traumann, the former minister of communications under Rousseff, said. “He doesn't like to talk to people and negotiate; he just wants to issue orders.”

In the United States, Trump's version — which was significantly more aggressive and legally dubious — faced little pushback from Congress. But in Brazil, legislators immediately fought back.

Congress passed a law stripping Bolsonaro of the power to surveil NGOs. It blocked efforts to expand the number of fireable civil servants. And it reversed his effort to seize control over gun policy.

This congressional assertiveness wasn't just an early-days phenomenon. According to data from Pereira and Melo, Bolsonaro issued 254 provisional decrees — by far the most any Brazilian president issued in a four-year term. Yet these decrees require congressional approval to remain in force, and the institution only provided it in 115 cases. This was the worst success rate of any president to serve a full term; in fact, he was the only such president who had fewer than 50 percent of their decrees approved by Congress.

Similarly, Congress voted to override a Bolsonaro veto on legislation 30 times over the course of his presidency. By comparison, the four prior presidents — stretching back to 1995 — had a total of nine vetoes overridden.

The evidence leaves little doubt that Bolsonaro would like to have acted as Trump has done in his second term. But unlike in the United States, legislators bristled at Bolsonaro's efforts to arrogate lawmaking powers to himself. In effect, they stopped the rise of the imperial presidency before it started.

This resistance was, much like the Bolsonaro presidency itself, a product of the deep logic of the Brazilian system.

In the American two-party system, the entire right-wing ecosystem ran through the Republican Party — an organ that Trump controlled. Those center-right Republicans in Congress who have private qualms about Trump's authoritarian politics do not, for the most part, dare criticize him publicly: They are too afraid for their jobs, social standing, and potentially even their lives. Many of them have acted like what the political scientist Juan Linz called “semi-loyal democrats”: people who pay lip service to democratic ideals, but act in a way that encourages and even normalizes the radicals.

Brazil's multiparty system meant that Bolsonaro had no such control. Legislators had independent political support bases, and could win reelection without backing from the president.

Even more fundamentally, the self-interested logic that ran through the system gave center-right Centrão deputies incentives to actively defend the powers of their branch.

The Centrão cooperated with Bolsonaro when it suited them — he pushed through a major pension reform bill with their support in 2019. But they drew the line at his attempts to build an imperial presidency. The more power he got, the more threat he posed to their narrow interests. And Bolsonaro needed their support more than they needed his.

So from very early on, Brazil had the reverse institutional logic of the United States under Trump II: a center-right Congress calling the shots in a far-right administration.

“It's very clear to me that Bolsonaro [wanted to be] a populist president who slowly undermines checks and balances,” Borges said. “But this wouldn't be good for the old-style, traditional mainstream right. For them, it would be much better to have a weak president.”

About a year into Bolsonaro's presidency, he faced his first major crisis: the coronavirus pandemic. And by all accounts, he botched it. His extreme opposition to both social distancing and vaccines, together with his embrace of crank cures like hydroxychloroquine, led to both mass death and a collapse in his poll numbers.

At the same time, Bolsonaro also became more and more openly authoritarian. At the beginning of the pandemic, he asserted an emergency power to ignore the requirement that Congress approve provisional decrees — effectively asking to be able to make law unilaterally. He arrested critics of his Covid policy using a dictatorship-era national security law, and launched eight times as many investigations under this law per year than the average under prior presidents. He moved repeatedly to block the work of government transparency watchdogs and nominated his hyperloyal chief bodyguard to run the national police.

Perhaps most ominously, he began a sustained attack on the integrity of Brazil's elections, calling the country's electronic voting system corrupt and trying to move to a paper system. On Election Day 2022, he sent federal police officers to obstruct access to polling stations in the opposition's core territory in Brazil's northeast.

Once again, institutions pushed back. Congress had acquired even greater say over Bolsonaro at this point: Facing Covid-related impeachment threats, he was obliged to strike a formal coalition deal with Centrão parties, ceding key control over the legislative agenda and the budget. Congress was able to both repeal the national security law and block the voting changes.

But it was Brazil's judiciary that ultimately took center stage in the pushback against Bolsonaro. The country's highest court blocked his provisional decree power grab, overturned his anti-transparency moves, stopped his crony police appointment, and moved within hours to remove roadblocks at polling stations.

The Brazilian Supreme Federal Court did not merely respond to Bolsonaro's actions, but went on the legal offensive. In 2019, the Court asserted a novel power to open an investigation into threats made against judges by Bolsonaro allies and supporters. This unprecedented court-ordered inquiry spiraled into a wide-ranging investigation into “fake news” and anti-democratic activity led by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a center-right former prosecutor who would, in 2022, take on a dual role as president of Brazil's highest court for electoral matters (the Superior Electoral Court).

With backing from other justices, Moraes wielded his powers aggressively — emerging as the most effective and ruthless opponent of Bolsonaro's power grabs.

The president repeatedly tried to challenge court authority. In 2021, for example, he turned out hundreds of thousands of supporters for rallies on Brazil's Independence Day in which he openly promised to ignore Supreme Court rulings. But the political blowback was severe; two days after the rally, he released a humiliating public letter apologizing for things he said “in the heat of the moment.”

The judicial offensive against Bolsonaro was hardly a given. If you looked at the Court's pre-Bolsonaro record, you might have predicted something like what happened in the United States: ideologically aligned justices greenlighting a president's power grabs.

“The supreme court was heavily divided ideologically prior to Bolsonaro,” said Celso Rocha de Barros, a columnist at Folha de São Paulo (Brazil's New York Times equivalent). “If you look at the two guys with the highest legal reputations, Gilmar Mendes and Luís Roberto Barroso, they hated each other. If you look for it on YouTube, there's video of them cursing at each other during Supreme Court sessions.”

But the clearer Bolsonaro's authoritarian agenda became, the more united the Court grew in opposing him.

So here we have a puzzle: Why did Brazil's seemingly politicized Supreme Court manage to unite in defense of democracy in a way that SCOTUS demonstrably has not?

Once again, the multiparty system is a big part of the story. As in the United States, Brazil's 11 Supreme Court justices are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Except in Brazil, the Senate has members from roughly a dozen parties — meaning that presidents would never have the majority required to approve a true rubber-stamp justice.

“In Brazil, the Supreme Court is not partisan because you don't have this two-party system,” said Christian Lynch, a prominent Brazilian legal theorist. “You can't nominate a judge who is going to be loyal to you as a person, the president.”

But Lynch cautions against reducing the Court's behavior to a simple mechanistic model, in which multipartyism guarantees good judicial behavior. There was an element of choice here: a decision by the justices to push back against Bolsonaro's attempts to consolidate power in his own hands.

Jair Bolsonaro had over three times as many vetoes overridden by Congress as the prior four Brazilian presidents combined. Imagine the current US Congress overriding even one of Trump's!

This choice, he believes, reflects the post-dictatorship ideology of the Brazilian judiciary. Judges saw their role as not just adjudicating criminal cases, or even disputes between the branches, but rather as guarantors of the new democratic order. The Court's expansive powers, in their view, can and should be wielded aggressively to both ensure democracy's survival and promote its health.

From this perspective, the aggressive prosecution of corrupt politicians in the 2010s and the pushback against Bolsonaro in the 2020s reflected the same judicial approach: a self-confidence in its unique role as democracy's guardians. Though the facts of the corruption cases split the justices, and the Bolsonaro situation united them, the ideological logic that governed rulings in both cases was similar.

The justices said as much, both in private and in public. In a remarkable April 2022 essay, then-Justice Luís Roberto Barroso openly positioned the Court as a bulwark against what he called an “institutional coup” by Bolsonaro, describing a court once divided on corruption cases but now “joined in the defense of democracy.” This was, he argued, necessary: Courts play a “decisive” role in resisting authoritarian presidents, and must proactively choose to resist them.

Tellingly, Barroso's essay omits any praise for Congress. In fact, he writes that the Centrão is “allied” with Bolsonaro, describing the faction as being “renowned for its voracity for political offices and public funds.”

This rhetoric reflects another aspect of the court's ideology, and of the Brazilian democratic paradox more broadly. Though Congress's performance during Bolsonaro's term is impressive from an American perspective, the Court mistrusted such a cynical and self-interested body. Here, the weakness of the system indirectly generated another strength: the problems in the legislature emboldening the Supreme Court to shoulder a greater amount of the burden of democratic defense than it might have been expected to.

“Now the judiciary is the ringleader in a process of defending democracy, when it is no longer the legislative branch, which should be,” says Tião Viana, a former senator and governor from Lula's left-wing PT party. “Alexandre de Moraes is the expression of this.”

In October 2022, Brazilian voters delivered the greatest rebuke to Bolsonaro yet: denying him a second term in office. The election was closer than expected: Lula won in a second-round runoff with just 50.9 percent of the popular vote, the slimmest margin of victory of any president in Brazilian history. Support from the center-right was decisive: Some of Lula's prominent rivals, like Geraldo Alckmin and Simone Tebet, backed the leftist on defense-of-democracy grounds.

When Lula's victory was announced, nearly everyone in Brazilian politics immediately accepted the results. The exception, of course, was Bolsonaro. He started plotting a coup.

On December 7, the president met with his minister of defense and the heads of each branch of the military. Bolsonaro presented them with a draft of an order that would declare a state of emergency, annul Lula's victory, and place Justice Alexandre de Moraes under arrest. While the head of the Navy signed on, both the Air Force and Army leaders refused. But they did not notify Moraes or the police — nor did they do so after a second meeting a week later, where Bolsonaro's team again pitched them on the coup plan.

Stonewalled by top generals, Bolsonaro began plotting with some lower-ranked ones. At the same time, his supporters set up an encampment outside the army barracks in Brasília — and, on January 8, the mob swarmed the presidential palace, the Congress, and the Supreme Court simultaneously.

The attack was clearly shaped by the events of January 6, 2021. But instead of intending to convince members of Congress to vote to annul the election, the demonstrators were hoping to inspire the military to follow them out of the barracks and into the halls of power.

They were disappointed. Though the governor of the Federal District (DF), the state in which Brasília is located, was a Bolsonaro supporter who delayed deploying local police, Moraes stepped in swiftly — suspending the governor's authority and ordering a deployment to quash the riot.

In the months following, the justice — backed fully by his colleagues and the newly inaugurated President Lula da Silva— launched a sweeping investigation that uncovered the true scope of the coup plot. We know much of what we know about the plot thanks to depositions from the Army and Air Force chiefs, both of whom testified as part of the Moraes-ordered inquiry.

The evidence was damning enough to secure indictments for Bolsonaro, his former vice president, his defense secretary, and dozens of other generals and aligned officials. Late last year, Bolsonaro and his allies were convicted of masterminding a conspiracy against Brazilian democracy. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison and is currently serving time; a separate electoral court ruling, in 2023, had already disqualified him from running for public office until 2030.

The Bolsonaro inquiry has become the signature moment for the courts: the definitive example of both its vital role in safeguarding democracy and the damage it did to democratic freedom along the way.

From an American point of view, it's hard not to be jealous of a country where a former president incited an insurrection and actually suffered consequences for it. But in the pursuit of accountability, Moraes asserted extraordinary powers — including authority to suspend the DF governor and imprison people without trial if they made violent threats on social media. He both led the investigation into Bolsonaro and served as the presiding judge in the trial.

Even some supporters of Moraes's actions, like Meio's Pedro Doria, describe his actions as a kind of democratic chemotherapy: necessary to defeat the cancerous coup plot, but with dangerous side effects that Brazilians now must reckon with.

Moraes's approach was one “that involves weak institutions, that involves constitutional hardball playing, and that involves a system that's not a full-fledged liberal democracy,” Doria said. “But for the first time in our history, we survived to live another day, and we have a shot at getting this right in the next decades.”

As Brazilians still debate the benefits and risks of Moraes's growing power, they also contemplate another unsettling question: Why did the coup fail in the first place?

This can't be credited to other institutional actors: Neither Congress nor the courts knew about the full scope of Bolsonaro's plans until Moraes's post-facto inquiry. The decision depended entirely on choices made by the Brazilian brass, which had in the past been relatively supportive of Bolsonaro. The military all but openly backed his 2018 bid, and his administration was staffed top to bottom with soldiers who dutifully carried out his orders (however questionable).

“The military themselves, they don't have democratic convictions,” said Adriana Marques, a political scientist who studies civil-military relations in Brazil. “The military in the government used to say that Bolsonaro won the election, so he can do what he wants to do [without limits].”

No one knows for sure why the military made the choices they did. The officers' stony commitment to public silence makes their true intentions hard to divine. In Brasília, I was scheduled to meet with an admiral to discuss all of this. At the last minute, he dropped out — citing an alleged family emergency.

The best theory I've heard, advanced by Marques and others, is that their decision reflected not democratic principle but cost-benefit analysis. The generals simply had little to gain from backing Bolsonaro's coup, and would be risking quite a lot in doing so.

Without consolidated elite support, and with the notion of a coup deeply unpopular with the public, the military would have had a very difficult time consolidating control over the country without risking chaos, economic upheaval, and even mass death.

Moreover, the Biden administration had sent very clear signals that it wouldn't tolerate a coup. Given the Brazilian military's heavy dependence on the United States for training and advanced weapon systems, the specter of an aid cutoff from Washington was a powerful deterrent.

These are, to be clear, narrowly practical reasons to reject Bolsonaro's plan. Few informed people I met in Brazil believed the military had truly come to believe in civilian rule as a matter of principle.

In the United States, by contrast, there is a very long tradition of the military keeping out of civilian affairs. But at present, there is a live debate over whether Trump will order security services to interfere with voting during the midterm elections.

What choice will they make, if faced with a similar test to their Brazilian counterparts?

On January 8, I attended the president's official commemoration of the riots three years earlier. Standing in a hall in the presidential offices, I spotted politicians chatting with uniformed generals behind velvet ropes — their very presence, seemingly, a reassurance that the coup plot had been contained.

The stage featured a giant photo of the Brasília skyline, such as it is, with the phrase “defesa da democracia” emblazoned on it. Geraldo Alckmin, now well into his term as Lula's vice president, claimed that their victory saved Brazilian democracy.

“If they attempted a coup d'état after losing the elections, imagine what they would have done if they had won the elections,” he said.

Two days earlier, Washington marked its first anniversary of January 6 with Trump back in office — and, in a way, proved Alckmin's point.

There were no solemn presidential proclamations marking the day, as there had been under Biden, nor even the vaguest of gestures toward respect for democracy from the president. Instead, a group of rioters who had ransacked the Capitol, pardoned by Trump immediately on his return to power, reenacted January 6 by marching from the White House to the Capitol.

It is important not to overstate Brazil's democratic stability, even in comparison. Its weaknesses were on display even at Lula's January 8 event. The crowds were sparse, illustrating the minimal role the public played in democracy's defense. There were no actions during Bolsonaro's term comparable to the No Kings protests or Minneapolis anti-ICE resistance.

Even more tellingly, the event's centerpiece moment was a staged veto of a bill that would overrule court sentences for roughly 1,000 people convicted of coup-related crimes. The legislation, which would slash Bolsonaro's sentence from 27 years to two, may still become law if the Centrão joins with Bolsonaro's allies in Congress to support an override — a clear illustration of how the elite self-interest that helped stiffen resistance to Bolsonaro's power grabs can just as easily turn against democratic accountability when circumstances change.

There is also a presidential election in the fall. While Bolsonaro is disqualified, his son Flávio is looking likely to be Lula's chief rival. Lula is ahead in the polls currently, but his lead is not insurmountable — and the president turned 80 in October.

But these are problems that many Americans wish they had. It would be better if Congress acted as the first line of defense, resisting Trump's power grabs before things got so bad that ordinary citizens needed to put their literal lives on the line. And it would be better if the US Supreme Court was not so deferential to the Trump administration, but so militantly pro-democratic that the concern was not complicity but rather overreaction.

So if we wanted to learn from Brazil — to think about how we could repair our system so, in the future, it might be as resilient as theirs — what lessons could we take away?

The first, and most obvious, would be to try to create a multiparty system.

This is certainly consistent with Pereira and Melo's takeaway. Their excellent postmortem on the Bolsonaro presidency, titled “Why didn't Brazilian democracy die?” argues that the crisis during his presidency basically vindicates their prior claims about the virtues and stability of Brazil's multiparty system. And indeed, the international expert view on multiparty presidentialism has shifted quite far in their direction.

In a 2023 paper published by Protect Democracy, Scott Mainwaring — the American political scientist once so skeptical of Brazilian-style systems — conceded that he had gotten it wrong. He and his co-author, Lee Drutman, argued that the United States should move to a multiparty system — specifically, by adopting Brazilian-style proportional elections for the House that would provide safeguards against democratic erosion. They write:

Comparative evidence suggests that presidential democracy is most likely to fail when the president's party has a majority in both chambers of the national Congress. A moderate multiparty system would likely induce most presidents to govern more toward the center so as to be able to pass legislation.

The Brazilian case certainly provides real evidence for these conclusions. If the political stars align for something like it, I'd support it — but that likely won't happen anytime soon. So, is there any way to adopt Brazilian-style safeguards against authoritarianism in the meantime?

There is — but we have to shift our focus from structures to incentives.

Brazilian legislators win reelection by providing tangible goods for their constituents. American legislators depend on highly partisan primary voters and the national reputation of their party.

The Brazilian system has problems: It promotes wasteful spending and outright graft. But the American system has bigger ones: It creates ideologically disciplined parties whose members are terrified of bucking an in-party president. This is why a Republican Congress and a Supreme Court confirmed by GOP majorities are so much more supine in the face of Trump than their Brazilian peers.

To Brazilianize the US political system, then, we need to think of specific ways to change the incentives for legislators: to make politics less ideological, and more tied to place and specific deliverables for constituents.

On the electoral front, this might involve a national ban on partisan gerrymandering (which nearly became law during the Biden presidency) and the reform, or ideally abolition, of legislative primary elections (a corrosive American practice with no real peers elsewhere). These two reforms, when put together, would increase the number of representatives in both parties who were responsive to more mainstream electorates — creating incentives for a Brazilian-style culture of dealmaking rather than pure partisanship.

America should also take inspiration from Brazil's approach to congressional oversight. Currently, Congress has no formal role in approving or rejecting executive orders, allowing members of a president's party to easily deflect accountability for power grabs by saying it's out of their hands. But if the United States adopted a version of the Brazilian provisional decree system, mandating that executive orders expire within a set number of days absent affirmative congressional approval, members of a president's party could be held more directly responsible for White House actions — giving purple-state legislators more incentives to buck the party.

These specific reforms are hardly exhaustive: They would not fully “fix” Congress, let alone the Supreme Court or corroded institutions like the Department of Justice. But no study of another country will yield a single reform idea that saves American democracy on its own. Foreign models are best seen as rough templates, not strict blueprints — sources of broad guidance, rather than rigid prescriptions.

And the most valuable insight from Brazil is not that its specific system is the best possible, but rather that its operating logic — its ability to bind political actors to democracy through self-interest and incentives — was incredibly effective at hemming in a would-be authoritarian. American reformers need to start reflecting on that lesson and designing policies that work in our context (with an eye toward not replicating Brazil's corruption problem).

I believe that Americans will soon have an opportunity to put this into practice. Trump's authoritarian project will likely fail as Bolsonaro's did, albeit for very different reasons. Its failure should create an opening to build new barriers against any future president who tries to replicate his unilateral rule.

In that future, we had best be humble enough to learn from younger democracies like Brazil — places that, as of late, have much better democratic recent track records than our own.

The data is solid. The vibes are atrocious. What gives?

President Donald Trump spent much of the past year engineering price increases, financial panics, and trade wars.

Nonetheless, despite his best efforts, he is presiding over a pretty good economy. Or so the headline statistics would suggest.

Last week, a pair of government reports showed robust job growth and slowing inflation. Employers added 130,000 jobs in January, bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.3 percent. Meanwhile, consumer prices rose by just 2.4 percent over the past year — just a few ticks above the Federal Reserve's target rate.

Thanks to that modest price growth, Americans' purchasing power is significantly higher today than it was when Trump took office, as the average hourly wage has risen by 3.7 percent since January 2025.

What's more, last year also witnessed a surge in productivity — or the amount of output that the economy generates from a fixed quantity of labor, capital, and materials. According to Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson's calculations, US productivity grew at a 2.7 percent clip in 2025, nearly double its average pace over the preceding decade.

Finally, as of this writing, the S&P 500 index is more than 14 percent higher than it was before Trump's second term began.

And yet, as Americans have seen their wealth and purchasing power climb over the past 12 months, they've grown steadily more discontented with their economy.

Since Trump took office, consumer sentiment has plunged by 26 percent and now sits near all-time lows, while the president's approval rating on the economy has fallen deeply underwater. And myriad other gauges of the public's economic mood show the same basic trend.

In many respects, this is a familiar story. Real wages have been rising in the US since 2023, yet Americans' assessments of the economy have remained resolutely dour. And pundits have proffered many explanations of this long “vibecession” (e.g., people still haven't adjusted psychologically to the new price level; housing remains unaffordable; living through a mass death event blows, etc).

Here, though, I'm not going to hazard a comprehensive account of America's gloomy, post-pandemic mood. Rather, I want to explore a narrower question: Beneath the headline figures, do any recent economic data points help explain the public's dissatisfaction with the Trump economy?

In a Substack post earlier this month, former Biden White House economist Mike Konczal offered one potential explanation for the public's discontent: While wages have been rising faster than prices overall, they haven't kept up with the cost of many essentials.

Not all consumer items are equally indispensable. Americans rarely need to buy a new flat-screen TV. But they must typically purchase food on a regular basis. And in Konczal's analysis, the prices of necessities — namely, groceries, housing, health care and transportation — have been rising faster than overall inflation since the pandemic.

As a result, most households have been forced to devote a larger share of their budgets to these must-haves — and thus, to pare back on discretionary purchases.

One could quibble with Konczal's definition of “essentials.” It's not obvious why clothing and gasoline wouldn't qualify as necessities. And the prices of those items have actually grown slower than overall inflation since 2019.

Nevertheless, Konczal's data is illuminating. And it does help explain why consumer sentiment has been persistently low since 2022.

As an account of why Americans are even more unhappy with the economy today than they were when Trump took office, however, Konczal's analysis isn't entirely satisfying. (And, to be fair, explaining Trump-era shifts was not his article's stated objective.)

Although his post shows that the prices of “essentials” have risen faster than overall inflation since 2019, this is almost entirely due to trends that predated Trump's inauguration.

Since January 2025, wages have actually grown faster than the prices of most “essentials,” as Konczal defines them. And wage growth has also far outpaced energy costs.

Of course, this does not mean that necessities became more affordable for all Americans in 2025. Wage growth is not evenly distributed across the workforce. Some people are unemployed. And housing costs vary sharply between regions.

Nevertheless, in the aggregate, it was easier for Americans to afford essentials in January 2026 than it had been one year earlier. At first blush then, trends in the prices of necessities make the public's discontent appear more mysterious, not less so.

This said, a few highly salient necessities have become less affordable since Trump took office.

Overall energy costs — as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics — fell by 0.1 percent over the past 12 months. But that headline figure conceals massive variation in the pricing of discrete energy goods and services: While gasoline prices dropped sharply in 2025, Americans' electricity and natural gas bills surged.

Humans are susceptible to negativity bias — all else equal, we tend to pay more attention to losses than gains. And this is liable to be especially true of Americans' current perceptions of price trends.

The public already considered America's cost of living intolerably high when Trump took office. Therefore, the fact that gasoline and groceries became slightly more affordable last year might not have felt especially noteworthy to voters; these things were supposed to become less expensive. Indeed, the new president had promised as much.

By contrast, when your gas and electricity bills rise from a baseline you already deemed exorbitant, that's sure to provoke both your attention and consternation.

In other words: Since Americans were already exhausted with inflation in January 2025, they may have had zero tolerance for further spikes in the price of any essential.

The public's discontent may also reflect the cooling of America's labor market. Although unemployment remains low by historical standards, the economy added only 181,000 jobs all of last year, according to data released last week. That makes 2025 the worst year for job growth since 2020. If one puts aside that pandemic year, employment growth has not been this slow since 2010.

Likewise, outside of 2020, job openings are lower today than at any time since 2017.

In short, workers are no longer a hot commodity in the US. And this is particularly true of professionals. As Axios notes, America's core white-collar industries — finance, insurance, information, and professional and business services — collectively shed 1.9 percent of their jobs since the end of 2022.

This is historically anomalous; normally, these sectors steadily increase hiring outside of recessions.

The downsizing of America's white-collar workforce began before the popularization of generative AI. But advances in artificial intelligence have likely helped to sustain the trend.

Indeed, falling demand for office workers is likely the flipside of last year's surge in productivity: As companies discovered how to wring more output from a single worker hour — through the help of AI and other innovations — they've been able to cut back on hiring without sacrificing production.

For now, these shifts haven't triggered widespread unemployment. But it has constrained American workers' exit options — and thus, their bargaining power. As the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute notes, real wage growth last year trailed its average annual pace between 2019 and 2024.

And the slowdown was especially sharp at both the top and bottom of the income ladder: The highest-earning decile of Americans saw their real wages grow by just 0.4 percent in 2025, compared to an average pace of 1.1 percent during the five years prior. Meanwhile, real wages actually fell for the poorest decile of workers, after climbing at a 2.4 percent annual clip from 2019 through 2024.

Americans therefore have some cause for unease about where the labor market is headed.

What's more, white-collar workers likely exert disproportionate influence over how economic conditions are perceived, since we enjoy an outsize voice in journalism and politics. Given that clout, the fact that job and wage growth has been especially weak in white-collar sectors might partly explain the darkening national mood.

This is by no means an exhaustive catalog of the public's grounds for economic displeasure. But rising utility bills and slowing hiring have likely contributed to the nation's unhappiness.

This said, the severity of Americans' discontent seems difficult to explain with reference to purely objective factors. In the University of Michigan's index, consumer sentiment is now lower than it was during the heart of the Great Recession — and it is hard to argue that the economy is worse today than it was in March 2009. So voters' outrage likely reflects shifts in both what they are experiencing economically and how they interpret that experience.

How democracies fall — and how they can come back.

American democracy is not in a good place. Institutional breakdown and mistrust define our political moment. Polarization has broken our politics, and President Donald Trump has elevated fealty to him — as opposed to the Constitution — as the core principle of governance.

And the American story is part of a global story. If the post-World War II decades tell the tale of liberal democracy triumphant, the 21st century paints a darker picture. Values and ideals once considered foundational and immutable have come under threat from anti-democratic forces across the globe. The rise of autocracy and the retreat of liberal democracy may well be the dominant narrative when historians look back on the first quarter of the century.

So, where does the story go from here? That's a question we wanted to take on in this ambitious series of narrative features, video explainers, and podcast episodes that we'll publish over the next two weeks.

Senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp traveled to Brazil to find out how that country succeeded in holding off its own autocratic threat, and what the United States can learn from it; you'll learn about what he found in a feature piece, as well as audio and video dispatches, this week. Our video team provides other perspectives: first, a piece that tells the story of how Finland turned back its homegrown fascist threat in the 1930s; second, an explainer on an idea whose time has come: expanding the House of Representatives.

Coming next week: Our Today, Explained podcast team traveled to Poland to report on its own experience with democratic backsliding; this two-part episode will shine further light on the fragility — and resilience — of 21st-century democracy.

Meanwhile, Beauchamp offers a zoom-out view of the lessons from other democratic near-misses. He also has a Q&A with Matthew Yglesias, revisiting a piece the Vox co-founder wrote on this site 11 years ago — “American democracy is doomed” — and assessing the state of our democracy now. Finally, Lee Drutman, a leading scholar on democracy, offers a historical look at America's attempts at reform. His is an empowering argument: Reform has been a constant in the American story, and this moment should be no different.

As Drutman writes in his piece, “Trump is not forever.” There will be an American future on the other side of this benighted present. What that future looks like is entirely up to us.

This package takes as its starting point that global democracy is in a bad way — but that the diagnosis, while serious, isn't terminal. America can learn from the example of other democracies that have also faltered, but ultimately succeeded. It can learn from its own past, which tells us that democratic reform not only is possible but inevitable. And it can learn from ideas given new life by our predicament, as we search for a path out of this anti-democratic cul-de-sac.

The lasting lesson of Jesse Jackson's 1988 campaign, explained.

Rev. Jesse Jackson — a titanic civil rights leader, politician, and activist — died on Tuesday at the age of 84.

Over the course of a career that spanned decades, Jackson twice ran for president, in 1984 and 1988, though he later stepped back from electoral politics.

To get a better sense of Jackson's legacy and his influence on the Democratic Party, I reached out to Osita Nwanevu, a contributing editor at the New Republic who has spent time thinking and writing about Jackson.

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.

Who is Jesse Jackson? How did he transition from activism to electoral politics in 1984 and 1988?

Jackson is part of the King-era civil rights movement. He's instrumental in all of that. As the civil rights movement develops in the 1970s, people go in all kinds of different directions. You have people who take the Black Power movement and say, “We're going to develop Black capitalism, develop business interests, and develop our own kind of economic power.” You have people continue on the social justice route. You have people who are getting into politics. There are all these divergent strands, and Jackson sits at the center of all of them while still being a very prominent public voice in the movement as a whole.

I think Black Americans develop enough of a political constituency that not only do they come to matter more and more in the political realignments that are going on in the 1970s, but it becomes plausible, at least to some people, that they could mount a viable presidential campaign.

And that's what Jackson does. He's extraordinarily charismatic; I think one of the best orators of the century. He launched a campaign in '84 that gathered a lot of attention but doesn't really go anywhere. '88 is different. There is a stretch of several months where it looks entirely plausible that Jackson can be the Democratic nominee in '88. That's been my interest in him as a figure. I spent some time with him a few years ago in advance of the 2020 Democratic primary for a profile that was ultimately killed, but I wanted to talk with him about the things the party was confronting as somebody who had been the center of a lot of the same debates.

One of the core elements of his presidential campaigns was the Rainbow Coalition. Can you describe what that was?

The Rainbow Coalition was basically intended to be an amalgam of all the different groups that he saw as having an interest in progressive policy: not just African Americans, but Latinos, LGBT people, poor people in general, the unhoused, everybody that he thought could have a stake in a more progressive political agenda. He tried to knit them together.

And I think that one of the things that was most important about his 1988 campaign, as opposed to the '84 campaign, is that, in '88, he really stakes a lot on trying to include and, in fact, to put white working-class voters at the center of that agenda, as well. I think that's part of why he attracts the attention he does the second time around. He wins this very surprising victory in Michigan.

[In] the debates we're having now — and have been having for some time — in the Democratic Party about whether we push forward on racial justice or do economic populism that's more capacious and also peaks to the concerns of where people have been interested in Donald Trump, Jackson basically says, in '88, we're going to do all of these things at once with a really forward-looking social agenda and economic agenda that comes to speak to all the constituencies that are downtrodden and marginalized in America.

Unfortunately, it's a presidential campaign that doesn't really succeed. I've been interested in thinking through why that wasn't the case in '88 and whether it could be the case now, but that was the underlying idea.

He doesn't succeed. He does have this incredible speech at the '88 convention, and then he steps back from electoral politics, right?

He does. He's still a major political figure. The Rainbow Coalition puts him in a place where he becomes a touchstone for different parts of the Democratic coalition. He's seen as somebody you speak to if you want to demonstrate that you're interested in questions of poverty and questions of racial justice. He hosts events, he hosts town halls — these kinds of things.

He's in the political arena, but not as much of a major figure as he initially had been. Through the '90s, especially, I think people like Bill Clinton and others had their careers and their time in politics shaped substantially by their interactions with Jackson.

Two decades later, Barack Obama runs and wins. What does their relationship look like? 

There's this infamous moment where Jackson was caught off-mic during the 2008 Democratic primary. And I think that there's this perception publicly that there was some tension and some friction. He critiqued the Democratic Party. He critiqued Barack Obama from the left on many occasions.

In the last couple of decades, as best as I can tell, he is focused on building out the Rainbow Coalition as an organization, and there's a lot of work in and around Chicago especially. But, you know, you'll see him participate in other protest movements over the last couple of decades as well. He's not as much of a kingmaker or behind-the-scenes operative in the 2000s and 2010s as he once had been but certainly a respected figure — and one that matters symbolically to a lot of people.

What do you think Jackson's legacy will look like?

It's hard to say, because I think that he receded from the public memory a lot in these last four decades. And this is somebody who was once one of the most famous people in the world.

As we continue to confront some of the basic questions of Democratic politics — the place of social justice issues versus economic issues — as we continue to have those debates, I think we're going to have to turn to Jackson's career as instructive. I think it will matter more and more to people that he ran campaigns that sat at the center of some of the tensions that we are relitigating now. I hope that people learn from him and his work there.

I also think he's at this point deeply underrated as a rhetorician, as an orator, as a speaker, as somebody who could galvanize the public. There was nobody like him while he was active in political life, and maybe that's something that gets resurrected in the public memory, as well.

How are you going to remember him?

I'm going to remember him as one of the most important figures in the 20th century, and somebody who, I think, emerges as a public figure in this moment where nobody is really sure what the civil rights movement should turn into.

I think that his life tells us a lot about the different tensions and the complexities of trying to advance racial justice in this country. It's not a straight line. It's not this cliche that we have about the arc of history bending towards justice. It might, but there are a lot of kinks in that arc. You can find a lot of them in Jackson's career.

He was an extraordinary person, and I wonder now, as people remember him, if some of that legacy is brought to the fore.

Jackson practiced a sort of a politics of the possible with his Rainbow Coalition, envisioning a better version of what politics could achieve. Do you think we're going to see that going forward in the party?

I certainly hope so. I think that Zohran Mamdani, even more so than Bernie Sanders, really does seem like an heir to the coalition and the kind of politics that Jackson represented — not just as a matter of substance, but as a matter of political style — his kind of warmth, openness, and trying to connect directly to people.

People really felt a personal connection to Jesse Jackson in a way that I think might be unrivaled. People felt that they knew him or wanted to relate to him in a kind of parasocial way. I think that that kind of politics has a future in the Democratic Party.

I think the questions for progressives are: Why haven't we made the gains that we have hoped for in places outside of New York City? Why isn't the Rainbow Coalition a majority coalition yet, despite the efforts of people like Jackson and all those who follow his example?

I think there may be lessons to learn from his runs. For me, personally, I do think that Jackson politics are the right politics for the party.

The Colbert censorship story is messier than it looks.

For the 12 of us who woke up Tuesday morning wondering what we had missed on Monday's late-night shows, CBS greeted us with a concerning development.

Overnight, Stephen Colbert had laid into his network, dedicating time at the top of The Late Show to claim that CBS prohibited him from airing an interview with the Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico.

“He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said. “Not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly does not want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.”

The blame, he argued, lay with CBS's lawyers for fearing repercussions from the Federal Communications Commission, the federal body that regulates the airwaves, and its Trump-loyalist chair, Brendan Carr, who has picked fights with Trump critics on TV before.

It seemed like a clear-cut case of the federal government having a chilling effect on free speech. But since then, new details have emerged that complicate Colbert's claims.

Colbert's claims about CBS's legal fears are rooted in an FCC rule that has received renewed attention under Trump 2.0. It's known as the “equal-time” rule: a requirement during campaign season for candidates competing for the same office to receive equal airtime on networks. As my colleague Cameron Peters explained, late-night and daytime talk shows were long considered exempt from this rule, but in January, the Trump administration announced it would begin to enforce the rule more strictly against these shows.

Colbert, CBS, and TV talk shows have all been recent targets of the FCC and the Trump administration, and it's not hard to see why. CBS's parent company Paramount is canceling Colbert's show in May, Trump sued Paramount/CBS over a 60 Minutes story in 2025, Disney/ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel last year after Carr criticized a monologue he gave, and the FCC is apparently investigating whether ABC's The View violated this rule by interviewing Talarico this year.

Colbert referenced all of this Monday night: “Let's just call this what it is: Donald Trump's administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV. … So, it's no surprise that two of the people most affected by this threat are me and my friend Jimmy Kimmel.”

But CBS and Paramount are contesting this version of things. In statements shared with news organizations on Tuesday, CBS said it never prohibited The Late Show from broadcasting the Talarico interview, and instead offered legal guidance about the equal-time rule, as well as alternative options.

According to the statement CBS provided to The Hill, Colbert's show then decided “to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”

The full segment, which had been taped but not aired, would appear overnight on The Late Show's YouTube channel, where it has now received well over 5 million views, as of publishing.

The White House, of course, is defending the FCC and Carr, while attacking Colbert.

And the saga took another turn on Tuesday night, when Colbert dug in to his free-speech case, calling CBS's denial “crap,” saying they were backing down against “bullies,” and arguing that corporate lawyers already read and have to “approve every script that goes on the air.”

The controversy also has a campaign dimension. Talarico is running in a competitive primary against Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a media darling who has appeared on The Late Show multiple times. Early voting in that Texas Senate primary began this week — something Crockett has noted when asked to weigh in.

“I do think there are additional layers at play here,” she said Tuesday at a press availability. “I do want to make sure that…we have exactly what happened versus the mania that just so happens to play out on the very first of early voting.”

She made a similar point on a podcast, suggesting the drama may have given Talarico “the boost he was looking for.” None of this amounts to a defense of Trump, Carr, or the FCC — but it strikes a conspiratorial note as her race with Talarico grows more competitive, and messier over identity politics.

Early voting ends next week, and the primary will be held on March 3.

Today, Explained explores the fall of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and what it proves about Trump-style authoritarians.

Brazil's former president was sentenced to 27 years in prison late last year for plotting a coup. The details may sound familiar: Jair Bolsonaro lost an election. He claimed it was stolen from him and rallied supporters to storm the nation's capital, Brasilia. The insurrection even took place in early January (2023).

However, the parallels between Bolsonaro and President Donald Trump go back a lot further than the coup attempt. Bolsonaro rode a wave of voter discontent to the Brazilian presidency in 2018. He was a populist and a nationalist with anti-democratic impulses, an itchy trigger finger on Twitter, and, maybe most importantly, about half his country firmly behind him.

He even got himself nicknamed “The Trump of the Tropics.”

But when the dust settled, after Bolsonaro's failed coup attempt, the two presidents' paths diverged. Bolsonaro was indicted, tried and convicted for inciting his followers and attempting to overthrow the rightfully elected government.

He's in prison and barred from running for office for decades to come.

In the United States, meanwhile, Trump is back in office.

To find out why one former president is behind bars while the other is back in power, Vox's Zack Beauchamp traveled to Brazil.

As Beauchamp tells Today, Explained host Noel King, he was interested in “why Brazil's institutions, its Congress and its Supreme Court were so much more resistant than their American peers to power grabs and attempts to rule as an imperial executive than the US ones were.”

The answer is complex but full of lessons for the US. For more, listen to our episode that traces the rise — and fall — of Bolsonaro, and hear what America may be able to borrow from Brazil's chaotic political system.

Nevada gambling regulators sued the prediction markets company Kalshi on Tuesday, saying the platform's rapid growth forced their hand.

The Nevada Gaming Control Board and the state attorney general sued in Carson City District Court shortly after a federal appeals court rejected a request by Kalshi to stop the state from taking action. The state is seeking an order to stop Kalshi, the country's largest prediction market, from operating what it sees as an unlicensed sports betting operation.

""Kalshi has continued to dramatically expand its business, rather than attempting to maintain any kind of status quo,"" Nevada authorities said in a letter earlier this month.

The regulators emphasized that Kalshi has grown rapidly, doing 27 times as much business on Super Bowl Sunday this year compared to the year before. Meanwhile, regulated Nevada gambling operations saw their business shrink, the state said.

A Kalshi spokesperson declined to comment on Tuesday afternoon, but the company swiftly asked a federal court to take over the new state case. They argued that only federal law applies to prediction markets, and that the new state enforcement action turns on the same questions that federal courts are already considering.

Kalshi has said that its markets are ""event contracts,"" a financial instrument regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC on Tuesday sided with another events-contracts company that is fighting with Nevada regulators, and its chairman, Michael Selig, filmed a video statement defending the new platforms.

""Today, the CFTC is taking an important step to ensure that these markets have a place here in America,"" Selig said. ""To those who seek to challenge our authority in this space, let me be clear: we will see you in court.""

Economists and political scientists have long been fascinated by prediction markets as a way to channel the so-called wisdom of the crowds. They were generally a niche activity until the 2024 US presidential election, when people wagered millions of dollars on sites like Polymarket.

Since the election, sports and cryptocurrency speculation have become the dominant markets. Today, more than 90% of the money that flows through Kalshi's platform is staked on sports-related events, and the growth of platforms like Kalshi has spurred traditional sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings to create their prediction markets to take advantage of the light-touch regulation and lower taxes they offer.

Legal battles are pending on the East Coast as well, with regulators in Maryland and New Jersey having clashed with prediction markets. Attorneys and other industry commentators have said they expect the Supreme Court to eventually weigh in on the legality of sports contracts on prediction markets.

Ducati's top executive said he hopes he'll never see the day when motorcycles can drive themselves.

Jason Chinnock, who has been with the Italian luxury motorcycle company for over 20 years and served as its North American CEO for a decade, said being a motorcyclist is a core part of his identity.

He told Business Insider in an interview that a self-driving motorcycle would ""take away the entire reason to ride a motorcycle.""

Autonomous cars, he said, are useful for mobility — they transport people in a ""safe, smooth, efficient, and carefree way.""

He said Ducati's motorcycles are less about transportation and more about entertainment and the riding experience.

""We are not building mobility. We're building motorcycles. We're building something for joy and for fun,"" Chinnock said. ""If it takes away the ability to operate it and experience it, then just get in a pod and go from point A to point B.""

There are no commercially available self-driving motorcycles. Some companies, such as Japan's Yamaha and the Singapore-headquartered Omoway, have started work on self-balancing bikes.

However, Ducati is not entirely dismissing autonomous features, adding them where necessary for safety. For instance, Chinnock said some of Ducati's models come with electronic cruise control, traction control, and an anti-lock braking system.

Ducati, which was founded in Bologna, Italy, in 1926, is owned by the Volkswagen Group.

Its motorcycles cost more than $10,000 in the US, with some models exceeding $40,000. In 2024, Ducati sold about 55,000 motorcycles worldwide, earning 1 billion euros, or about $1.17 billion, in revenue.

Autonomous cars are gaining traction globally. Tesla's robotaxis and Alphabet's Waymo both offer autonomous taxi services in San Francisco and the Bay Area, with Uber set to join the fray this year.

In Europe, there's been a lot of handwringing over why there are very few large, successful tech companies in the region. Peter Steinberger, the creator of the agentic AI hit OpenClaw, has an answer.

Steinberger was recently hired by OpenAI and is moving from Europe to the US. An Austrian by birth, he previously split his time between London and Vienna.

On X, a professor from a European university asked why Europe couldn't retain this tech talent.

Steinberger replied that most people in the US are enthusiastic, while in Europe, he's scolded about responsibility and regulations.

If he built a company in Europe, he would struggle with strict labor regulations and similar rules, he added.

At OpenAI, he said most employees work 6 to 7 days a week and are paid accordingly. In Europe, that would be illegal, he added.

The most valuable company in Europe is Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML, valued at about $550 billion. In contrast, there are 10 US companies worth more than $1 trillion. Most of these are tech companies.

In 2024, a landmark EU report found that the region had fallen behind the US, particularly in innovation. It proposed a series of changes to tackle the problem, but by the end of 2025, few of the recommendations had been implemented.

Steinberger said he was hopeful about EU INC, an effort to create a single corporate legal framework to make it simpler to run a business across the region.

But this seems to be ""fizzling out,"" he wrote on X. ""Watered down, too much egoistic national interest that ultimately hurts everyone.""

Tesla says its purpose-built robotaxi just reached an important manufacturing milestone.

In an X post on Tuesday, the company said the Cybercab, a two-door car without a steering wheel, came off the production line at Tesla's sprawling Gigafactory in Austin.

""Congratulations to the Tesla team on making the first production Cybercab!"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on X.

The Cybercab was designed for Tesla's nascent robotaxi ride-hailing program.

Tesla's robotaxi program has so far deployed only 2025 Model Ys and mostly relies on human safety monitors to supervise rides. Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides to the public in January.

Unlike the Model Y, the Cybercab doesn't have a steering wheel or pedals — it's intended to be fully autonomous. Amazon's Zoox similarly manufactures purpose-built robotaxis designed solely to transport passengers.

Tesla has said it expects to start production of the Cybercab in April.

What's less clear is the timeline for when the automaker expects the Cybercab to be fully street legal.

Federal vehicle safety standards were written with human control systems like a steering wheel in mind, which means Tesla would likely need special approval from regulators for any requirements it can't meet. Notably, Zoox received such a federal exemption and now operates a limited public service in Las Vegas and San Francisco.

Musk also said people will have the option to buy the car. Selling a car without pedals or steering controls not only requires clearing federal regulatory hurdles but could also expose Tesla to a patchwork of state-by-state rules governing registration, insurance, and autonomous vehicle operation.

""What we designed is optimized for autonomy,"" Musk said during an earnings call in October 2024. ""It will cost on the order of — cost roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car. And you can, you will be able to buy one exclusively if you want.""

A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I built my career in Japan as an American. I learned there's one thing that's non-negotiable.","https://www.businessinsider.com/american-moved-japan-built-marketing-career-mother-ceo-raising-kids-2026-2","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:06:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lauren Rose Kocher, 39, an American entrepreneur and CEO of Vegas PR Group in Tokyo. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.

I grew up in a small town in Indiana, but my interest in Japan started early. I still remember watching a ""Sesame Street"" episode where Big Bird visits Japan. That image stuck with me.

In college, that curiosity took shape: I studied Japanese at the University of Chicago and spent a summer in Hokkaido. After graduating, I moved to Japan in 2008 to teach English, though a career in teaching was never my goal.

I wanted to work for a Japanese company and use the language skills I'd built in school. I'd never worked full-time in the US, so my understanding of corporate culture has been formed almost entirely in Japan.

After teaching, I transitioned into corporate roles in Japanese companies. I spent three years as an assistant and international concert promoter before joining Sony Music's business development division for four years. I later became the cofounder and COO of a VC-funded ticketing platform.

After nearly a decade inside corporate Japan, I stepped into senior leadership.

Now, I'm the CEO and sole founder of Vegas PR Group, a Tokyo-based marketing agency focused on culture, the arts, music, and fashion. Our bilingual team of nine works across Japanese and international clients.

Since 2024, I've also overseen two businesses founded by my late husband, a sandwich restaurant and a clothing brand.

I plan to stay in Japan long-term. My two children are half-Japanese, and I value raising them here.

Japanese business culture relies heavily on consensus-building, often through ""nemawashi,"" the process of privately aligning stakeholders before any formal decision is announced.

Feedback is similarly indirect. Japanese teams are often hesitant to raise concerns openly, which means issues can remain unspoken until they surface all at once. Decision-making is cautious and risk-averse, and change tends to be incremental rather than dramatic.

I've learned to factor this into timelines, particularly when working with Japanese clients who require internal alignment before moving forward. The people I hire tend to defy that stereotype and slot easily into our open, international culture.

I wouldn't say my management style is particularly American, but my American communication style and entrepreneurial instinct certainly are. I try to respect local expectations, though I know my tendency to move quickly and take decisive swings has occasionally come across as abrasive in a culture where decisions are slow, and relationships are built with great caution.

Because all of my work is rooted in the Japanese market, I encourage international staff to follow Japanese work customs when dealing with local clients, while leaving room for each person to navigate what they're personally comfortable with.

Punctuality is one example. In many countries, joining a Zoom call a minute or two late is inconsequential. In Japan, it's not. Logging in at 9:01 a.m. for a 9 a.m. meeting is considered late, and I enforce that expectation.

The same applies to in-person meetings, where arriving at least 10 minutes early is standard. When doing business in Japan, being on time is non-negotiable.

My leadership philosophy is rooted in servant leadership. I'm heavily invested in the success of the people I work with, and that approach has helped me build trust across Japanese and international teams.

As a white American woman in Japan, I'm perceived first as foreign. I'm also conscious of the privilege I carry. For anyone moving to Japan to lead a team, my advice is to be slow and deliberate.

Deliver important news one-on-one before making major announcements. Don't expect clear or immediate feedback, and don't assume silence means satisfaction. It's also critical to respect people's attachment to their roles, hierarchies, and existing relationships, which hold significant weight in Japanese workplaces.

I learned all of these lessons firsthand.

Perplexity is going full steam ahead with subscriptions and business sales and plans to focus more on monetization than it has in the past, executives said at a roundtable with reporters on Monday.

The AI search startup, based in San Francisco, is the latest to publicly distance itself from putting ads in chatbot answers, with one executive saying it isn't exploring any ad deals at the moment. That's a contrast to OpenAI, which is going all in on ads, while arch-rival Anthropic has publicly touted the opposite.

One Perplexity executive said the startup is increasingly targeting large businesses. The company has only five people on its enterprise sales team and plans to ramp that up, the executive added. It is also doubling down on its focus on serving high-powered users such as finance professionals, doctors, and CEOs.

The focus on selling to businesses positions Perplexity more directly as a competitor to startups like Glean, which lets employees search internal files and data more efficiently with AI.

The move comes amid some VC skepticism about Perplexity's prospects, with Silicon Valley investors voting it the company they'd most like to bet against in an informal poll at an AI conference last year, amid back-to-back funding rounds and talks of a wider AI bubble.

Perplexity will focus more on revenue and revenue retention than on other metrics, such as the number of questions it answers, the executive said. Perplexity also pledged to keep allowing people to use the product for free, with rate limits.

At the roundtable, the company declined to share specific financials and shared that revenue grew 4.7 times last year. Perplexity generated over $150 million in annual recurring revenue by mid-last year, its head of communications Jesse Dwyer told Business Insider in August. It hit $200 million in ARR in October, Alex Heath of Sources reported.

The news comes after several months of the AI startup lying low, as Perplexity said in a press invite. The company's leaders said it was busy building and not focusing on AI-related drama.

Perplexity had announced in 2024 that it would start experimenting with ads. That effort stalled, with the top ads leader, Taz Patel, quietly leaving last year. One consistent issue with ads in AI-generated answers is that users won't believe them, the Perplexity executive said.

Perplexity also launched a product for enterprises in 2024 that uses internal and external data to generate research reports, among other features.

Jay-Z has been name-dropping luxury timepieces in his songs for decades.

References to Rolex, Audemars Piguet, and Hublot are scattered throughout his music catalog.

He doesn't just rap about watches, though. The billionaire mogul has amassed quite a collection of statement timepieces.

The $1,075,652 Patek Philippe Grand Complication 5304-301R he wore at the 2025 Grammys was just one of them.

While that Patek Philippe was expensive, Jay-Z has timepieces that cost twice as much — or more. Here's a look at some of his watch collection.

Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, is a big fan of Patek Philippe watches. He wore one with a rose-gold case and dozens of diamonds for the 2025 Grammys.

Its face includes several functions, such as days of the week and moon phases, that help keep a perpetual calendar for tracking the date. The calendar automatically adjusts for leap years and accurately counts the days until 2100, according to GQ.

The hand-stitched strap is made of alligator leather.

Jay-Z quite literally announced his love of Hublot in the 2011 song ""Otis,"" where he pronounced, ""New watch alert: Hublot.""

Perhaps it was prophetic. In 2012, his wife and fellow artist Beyoncé gifted Jay-Z a $5 million Hublot Big Bang in 18-karat white-gold for his 43rd birthday, according to jewelry blogs.

The watch was encrusted with 1,282 diamonds, and it took more than 14 months to assemble, the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève, a foundation that highlights contemporary watches with awards and exhibitions, reported. It also took more than a year to source all the diamonds.

Hublot released the Shawn Carter Hublot Classic Fusion in yellow gold and black ceramic in 2013. The former watch was priced at $33,900, and the latter at $17,900.

The collection was limited to just 350 total pieces, according to GQ.

Jay-Z's custom Blueprint Richard Mille 56 watch required more than 3,000 hours to produce, GQ said in 2019. No wonder it cost $2.5 million.

During a 2019 show in his hometown of Brooklyn, the rapper freestyled a tribute to the timepiece: ""Blueprint on my wrist cost 2.5/Only thing that flips the script between you and I.""

What was the price of that Richard Mille 56 watch? $3 million, according to Complex. Or at least, that was its retail value. Alex Todd, who customized the watch, told the outlet that its monetary value is higher.

It was custom-made for Jay-Z and featured rare green sapphire crystals.

He did so with an RM011 Felipe Massa Chronograph in rose gold. The watch was originally released in 2007 and was designed with its namesake, F1 driver Felipe Massa, the brand said on its website.

The timepiece is meant to invoke a racing aesthetic and the sport's history of tech innovation. Its crown ""resembles a smooth tyre encircling a spoked wheel rim,"" the maker said.

Mille is no longer making this model, but you can get a used one for $215,000.

Jay-Z wore the Richard Mille RM027 Rafael Nadal to watch its namesake take on Novak Djokovic at the 2011 US Open championships.

It was designed to be as lightweight as possible and take on all the wear and tear a tennis superstar like Nadal might put it through, Richard Mille said.

Nadal referred to it as his ""second skin"" timepiece. There were only 50 of these watches made at the time, according to Mille. You can buy one on the secondary market for $1.95 million.

Nadal collaborated with Richard Mille on several additional versions of this timepiece that the rapper later acquired. Jay-Z has also worn the Richard Mille Rafael Nadal 27-01, which has an anthracite casing.

Jay-Z shouted out Audemars Piguet in his 2011 ""Watch the Throne"" track ""N—s in Paris,"" saying: ""Ball so hard, got a broken clock / rollies that don't tick-tock / Audemars that's losing time / hidden behind all these big rocks.""

He's also worn the brand. Included in his collection is the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar Openworked 26585CE. It has an openwork sapphire dial, rose gold dial markers, a black ceramic band and case, and a titanium clasp.

You can buy one from the watchmaker, but it's ""price upon request"" — or, in other words, wildly expensive. To get it on the secondary market, you'll need to shell out over $375,000.

When describing the Patek Philippe 6002 Sky Moon Tourbillon watch on its website, the brand notes the extensive detail that went into creating the timepiece.

Some of the highlights include handmade engravings, a double-face design, a retrograde perpetual calendar, a sky chart, and more.

It's one of the most technically complicated Patek Philippe watches, and its price is only available ""on request."" However, used versions of the watch can be found on the secondhand market for prices between $4 million and $6 million.

Jay-Z wore his model to Lebron James' 39th birthday party.

The Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711 in Tiffany Blue initially retailed for $52,635, but since only 170 were made, the price skyrocketed on the secondary market.

Days after the watches sold out, one was auctioned off for $6.5 million, CNBC reported in 2021.

Jay-Z and Beyoncé were named Tiffany ambassadors that year.

The ""Yves Klein"" version of the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak 25594ST watch is an ode to the French artist. He's widely known for developing his own vibrant shade of blue — international Klein blue 191.

The Royal Oak design features a perpetual calendar, which keeps track of everything from the time and date to the moon's phases.

It's a popular style in its own right, but the Yves Klein version is especially rare. Few are rarely found on the resale market.

Jay-Z sported the Perpetual Calendar Split Seconds Chronograph 5004P watch during a decadent, seafood tower-filled lunch meeting with DJ Khaled in 2023.

The watch is modeled on Patek Philippe's first perpetual calendar watch, released in 1996.

The particular watch that Jay-Z has, the 5004P model with a silver link band, is nearly impossible to find, but it was valued at $600,000 in 2022, according to IFL Watches.

The Grandmaster Chime is considered Patek Philippe's most complicated watch, with more than 1,500 individual components.

The company made the watch in 2014 to commemorate its 175th anniversary, and only seven were produced. Six went to the watchmaker's most dedicated collectors (who apparently had to apply for the privilege of buying one), while the seventh went to the company's museum in Geneva.

Patek Philippe then went on to make the Grandmaster Chime in other fabrications. Jay-Z has the white gold version, which runs around $2.5 million, according to reports.

Patek Philippe produced this watch in limited quantities from 1950 to 1985. Only 349 were made.

Jay-Z's Patek Philippe 2499 was previously owned by Swedish watch collector and dealer Tony Kavak, who had a yellow-gold band specially made for the piece. As Kavak tells it, the watch wasn't initially for sale.

""The watch is so exclusive that I often chose not to wear it in public, and I always wear my watches, that's my philosophy,"" Kavak told watch site Bezl.

But he knew Jay-Z was the right person to own the watch, he added.

""You should have seen his happiness,"" Kavak said in an interview with watch blog Hodinkee. ""It just reminded me of how happy I get when I find something rare myself.""

Neither Kavak nor Jay-Z would reveal the deal's cost, but in 2022, a similar watch sold at auction for $7.68 million.

His first FP Journe Tourbillon Souverain was set with 93 baguette diamonds circling it and even more across its face, according to Celeb Watch Spotter. Jay-Z wore the piece for a meeting with Tom Brady.

His wife Beyoncé later shared photos from Super Bowl weekend on her website. They included a close-up shot of another FP Journe Tourbillon Souverain watch, this one in green, on Jay-Z's wrist.

Tech's elite are taking their talents to South Beach — again.

In January, David Sacks, the venture capitalist and crypto and AI czar, proclaimed that Miami will soon replace New York City as America's financial capital. Stripe's Patrick Collison has been marveling at the city's ""boomtown"" vibes. With California flirting with a one-time tax on billionaires, said billionaires like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg are buying oceanfront mansions. And on Tuesday, Palantir announced that it's moving its headquarters from Denver to Miami.

Is Miami the next Silicon Valley? We've been here before.

The pandemic sent waves of coastal workers to the city, turning it into a Zoomtown full of online venture capitalists like Keith Rabois and Delian Asparouhov, bitcoin bull runners, and purveyors of the finest NFTs. Billboards went up in San Francisco featuring a mock tweet from then-Miami mayor Francis Suarez: ""Thinking about moving to Miami? DM me.""

Here's the thing: It's easy to fall for Miami when a big chunk of the workforce is stuck at home and online. Five years later, it's a lot harder to build companies there.

""Miami is great three months out of the year,"" says one prominent venture capitalist who moved to the city during the pandemic but is now returning to an established hub.

While the Floridian tax benefits are real, the investor has found that the social scene hollows out in the summer as residents leave, making it ""hard to build roots or have reliable friends."" More critically for the startup ecosystem, the scene lacked the ""hustle"" of San Francisco or New York.

Silicon Valley practically runs on a conveyor belt from Stanford and Caltech to Y Combinator's Dogpatch offices. The machine turns students into founders, builders into companies, and companies into the next wave of founders. Miami, meanwhile, lacks a major university to pipe in tech talent. Instead, the investor says, the city tends to attract people who have already ""made it.""

The Miami market, while busy, significantly lags behind the major hubs. Startups in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metro raised about $3 billion in 2025, per PitchBook, down from $8.6 billion in 2022, when money and crypto sloshed about. The Bay Area, by contrast, still grabs 52% of the nation's venture funding, with $177 billion in capital pouring in last year.

Alligators may be all around in Miami, but unicorns are hard to find. In January, Cast AI, a startup that helps companies cut cloud costs, crossed the $1 billion valuation mark, becoming the region's first homegrown unicorn in years. Before that, Adam Neumann, the ousted WeWork cofounder, debuted his Miami residential real-estate venture, Flow, at a $1 billion valuation in 2022.

Even Garry Tan, the Y Combinator president and gadfly who's usually first in line to dunk on San Francisco's politics, has been blunt about where the breeding grounds are best. Tan recently said on X that the accelerator still hasn't opened offices outside the Bay Area because founders are simply more likely to build unicorns there. According to a Business Insider analysis of Crunchbase data, of the at least 97 new unicorns that investors minted in 2025, 43 of them were based in the Bay Area.

But those who dismiss the city entirely miss the point. Miami isn't the next San Francisco. It's establishing itself as something else.

Patrick Murphy, a former Florida congressman and entrepreneur, says that Miami's tech scene is growing, it's just being built in ""reverse order."" Silicon Valley, he says, emerged from an if you build it, they will come approach: Engineers built great companies first, which eventually created fortunes that cycled back into the community to fund the next generation of companies.

Miami, however, has a more if you come, they will build it tact. It's attracted the ""wealth achievers"" first — the family offices, private equity names, and already-successful founders who emigrated for lifestyle reasons. Finance heavyweights like Citadel and Thoma Bravo arrived early. Vanguard, one of the world's largest asset managers, is eyeing an expansion in Miami as it targets more Latin American wealth. The city is now importing the machinery that follows them. Legal, accounting, and consulting firms are opening local offices to stay close to clients — and scoop up star talent that no longer needs to live near HQ.

This dynamic has established Miami as a ""control center"" for decision-makers, Murphy argues, but not yet the ""factory floor"" where the actual work gets done. Murphy says that despite running a successful construction-tech startup, Togal.AI, his engineering team has been offshore from the beginning because the local talent pool simply ""didn't exist"" when he started in 2019.

""If you go to Miami, you're not going to see dozens of engineers at a Starbucks cranking away,"" he says. ""That's not here yet.""

Still, Miami's flood of wealth is creating demand for startups built on the city's local economy, especially in property tech and fintech, Murphy says. Togal.AI's annual recurring revenue has grown 1,000% over the past two years, Murphy says, and is now raising fresh venture funding in order to hire dozens of new employees this year.

Maya Bakhai, a Fort Lauderdale resident and founder of the early-stage venture firm Spice Capital, tells me that the city will flourish alongside ""net new"" industries that are still taking shape and where the center of gravity isn't locked in yet. Crypto firms like MoonPay and QuickNode still treat South Florida as a home base, she notes. A new space-tech accelerator backed by the state is trying to persuade founders to stick around by pairing them with funders.

Bakhai's bigger bet is that just as New York became the hub for e-commerce, Miami could become the place where creator businesses get built. Research out of the University of Hong Kong found Miami has more top influencers per capita than New York or Los Angeles.

And then there's Palantir, the strongest signal flare yet that tech is taking America's Playground seriously. It's hard to know what the data giant's HQ move will mean in practice — Palantir hasn't said how many employees it plans to relocate, or whether it will offer moving packages to lure talent south. The company did not respond to an email request for comment. If Palantir does move a meaningful slice of its workforce, it would give Miami something it's been short on: a marquee tech employer that can recruit and keep technical workers on the ground year-round.

On X, Palantir's move immediately became a kind of Rorschach test for Miami's future. ""Florida is the future,"" cheered Andreessen Horowitz investor Katherine Boyle. Others were less convinced. ""Florida is the new crypto,"" one user wrote. ""For the next 20 years, nothing will change, but they will always tell you 'big things are happening in Florida.'""

Turning Miami into Silicon Beach is a long game, Bakhai argues. It won't be built by the billionaires buying houses to snowbird in today, she argues, but by the young strivers arriving for their first serious jobs — the entry-level analysts heading to Citadel and the junior lawyers starting at firms like Orrick. For the first time, she says, ambitious graduates can launch careers in Miami instead of treating New York or San Francisco as the default. The payoff, she says, comes years later, when they eventually spin off to start their own companies.

Until then, Miami remains largely a playground for the ""made it"" crowd, waiting in the sun for the builders to come.

Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. took a chance on me as a 19-year-old college student.

At that age, as an intern in 2009, I should've been pouring coffee, maybe making copies. Instead, he put me to work on college affordability policy, youth violence prevention, and immigration reform at his Rainbow PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) Coalition on the South Side of Chicago.

That was nearly two decades ago. This week, he passed away.

A few weeks ago, I sat with him in the hospital. He was extremely present even as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy disorder had taken his voice — the same instrument that had formed seemingly impossible coalitions and made the moral case for justice in language that brought people together instead of tearing them apart.

I met him in 2009 at a press conference he held to announce his intention to negotiate the release of journalist Roxana Saberi from an Iranian prison.

Saberi was an alum of Northwestern University, where I was a student. Several classmates and I had staged a rally to call attention to her issue, and Rev. Jackson had invited us to join him at his press conference in Chicago.

When it ended and everyone packed up to leave, I made a split-second decision. 

I grabbed him by the shoulder — strongly enough that his security detail sprang into action — and asked if I could volunteer for his Reduce-the-Rate initiative on college affordability. It was an issue that deeply resonated with me, as I'd borrowed a crippling amount to attend Northwestern. He said yes.

That moment changed everything. Less than a month later, I became the campaign's manager, working part-time during school. I handled policy research and community interface and accompanied Rev. Jackson to meetings and events. I spent time with him every week and at times even did my homework at his house.

He became a mentor, coaching me and looking out for me not only professionally, but personally. I left the role in 2011, but over the years, we stayed close. 

From Rev. Jackson, I learned three lessons about leadership that have shaped everything I've done since.

Rev. Jackson had a pattern: When things got difficult, he moved closer to the problem, not away from it.

He negotiated the release of over 200 hostages across Syria, Cuba, Iraq, and Serbia. He flew into war zones and sat across the table from dictators. He showed up to Texaco's headquarters during their discrimination scandal. He walked into corporate boardrooms where he wasn't welcome.

Many leaders I know do the opposite. When crisis hits, they create distance — delegate to lawyers, let the public relations team handle it, wait for it to blow over.

Rev. Jackson taught me that the moments when you want to step back are precisely when you need to step forward. Your measure as a leader is taken in the hardest moments, not the easy ones.

Rev. Jackson had no reason to believe in my abilities. But he understood that individuals have incredible capacity for growth — they just don't start off optimally productive.

He put a 19-year-old on policy work that mattered, then put me on-air representing the campaign. That wasn't reckless — it was intentional investment. He knew that by giving people opportunities, some would disappoint him over the years, but the ones who didn't might surpass what he could've imagined.

I've carried that forward — looking for people others overlook and investing in their growth. Not everyone pans out. But the ones who do become extraordinary.

Real leadership isn't about finding perfect people. It's about developing the potential in imperfect ones.

Rev. Jackson was simultaneously the agitator and the negotiator. The prophet and the pragmatist.

He showed up uninvited to shareholder meetings and organized boycotts, but also sat down with those same executives afterward to identify resolutions.

""Diamonds can't be produced without pressure,"" he once told me. This applies to individuals, organizations, and systems.

He understood that real change requires both confrontation and conversation. You can't just be nice and hope things improve. But you also can't only apply pressure and expect people to come around.

I watched him do this with the Wall Street Project, pressuring corporations like Texaco and Coca-Cola to commit billions to diversity initiatives. He made them uncomfortable with boycotts. Then he sat down with their leadership and helped build solutions.

Too many leaders think they have to choose to either be tough or be empathetic. Rev. Jackson taught me that's a false choice; the best leaders do both.

Rev. Jackson once told me the work of justice isn't about being comfortable. It's about being consistent. It's about showing up when it's hard, especially when staying silent would be easier.

He showed up. Consistently. The work he did — building coalitions across impossible divides, making the moral case in language that united rather than divided — we need it now more than ever.

Last year, during one of my Saturday visits to Rainbow PUSH, I brought the manuscript for my book ""Faster. Messier. Tougher: Crisis Communications Strategies in an Era of Populism, AI, and Distrust."" He saw how I was continuing on the work and agreed to put his name behind it. 

Last week, when I held the first copy from the printer and saw the quote from him on the front cover, it was so moving. That he could support me one last time means the world to me.

I grabbed his shoulder at 19 because I didn't want to let the moment pass. He taught me to lean into hard moments, develop people others overlook, and hold the tension between conflict and conversation.

That work doesn't end with him. It's up to us to pick it up.

Veteran broadcaster Anderson Cooper said Monday that he is leaving his role as a correspondent on CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" after nearly 20 years.

In a statement, Cooper said he intended to spend more time focusing on his CNN gig, and his family.

His exit comes at an already turbulent time for CBS News under its new editor in chief, Bari Weiss.

Here are what some of the leading voices in media are saying about Cooper's ""60 Minutes"" departure.

Sports broadcaster Keith Olbermann shared the news about Cooper's departure on his Bluesky account, posting: ""Anderson Cooper has left the sinking ship that is Idiot Bari Weiss's New Stormfront CBS.""

Olbermann later added, ""Now, people will only be able to NOT watch AC on cnn.""

Cooper has worked at CNN since 2001, where he is a political commentator and hosts the ""Anderson Cooper 360"" show.

Brian Lowry, a longtime media columnist and current Hollywood correspondent at Status News, a media newsletter, wrote on X: ""Have worked around Hollywood long enough to know nobody ever really leaves a job to spend more time with their family.""

Tom Jones, senior media writer at The Poynter Report, wrote in his newsletter that Cooper's departure marked ""the end of a journalism era.""

Jones said that Cooper's exit ""certainly adds more uncertainty in a news division that is very much in flux under relatively new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.""

He added: ""It also raises questions about '60 Minutes,' the previous gold standard of TV news shows.""

Lydia Polgreen, a New York Times opinion writer and the former editor in chief of HuffPost, posted to X on Tuesday: ""I don't watch much TV news, but @andersoncooper is in a league of his own as a television journalist. A huge loss for 60 Minutes.""

CNN's chief media analyst, Brian Stelter, wrote in his ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter Tuesday that there are open questions about which other correspondents might leave, ""and on what terms.""

""The risk is obvious: Loyal '60 Minutes' viewers will leave along with the correspondents they like to watch,"" Stelter said.

Trish Regan, the former Fox Business Network anchor, said on her YouTube channel on Tuesday that she ""didn't buy"" Cooper's statement that he was leaving to spend more time with his family. She added that people usually mention family in their departing statements when their company can't pay them enough or when their bosses want them out the door.

Regan said that Cooper's exit raised the bigger question of what would happen with Weiss, adding that it seemed like she was an unpopular figure at CBS News. 

""The inmates are running the asylum, shall we say, over there at '60 Minutes',"" Regan said. ""They're just coming apart at the seams.""

Regan added that she admires the moves Weiss has made so far at CBS News, including bringing in ""more diverse political voices."" 

""In other words, you need some more right-leaning ones to go with all the lefties you get over there,"" she said.

Five-time Olympic medalist Eileen Gu just shut down a reporter's question asking if she'd ""lost"" two gold medals by finishing second in her events.

The 22-year-old Olympic freeskier, who was born in the US and is representing China in the 2026 Winter Olympics, was responding to a reporter who asked whether Gu felt disappointed not to win gold in Milan.

""Do you see these as two silvers gained or two golds lost?"" the journalist asked a press conference following her second silver at these games. During her Winter Olympic debut in Beijing in 2022, Gu won two golds.

Gu immediately laughed off his question and, without hesitation, said: ""I am the most decorated female freeskier in history. I think that is an answer in and of itself.""

""How do I say this? Winning a medal at the Olympics is a life-changing experience for every athlete.""

""Doing it five times is exponentially harder, because every medal is equally hard for me, but everybody else's expectations rise, right? And so the two medals lost situation, to be quite frank with you, I think it's kind of a ridiculous perspective to take,"" she added.

Zing!

The clip quickly garnered significant attention online.

Foo's post has received over 700,000 views.

Other posts praising Gu for being confident and poised gained thousands of views.

Gu's messaging and self-advocacy follow the trend of what Business Insider's Amanda Yen recently dubbed ""The most Gen Z Olympics yet.""

Business Insider Edition 

Nigerian industrialist Abdul Samad Rabiu is taking his place among Africa's elite yacht owners, commissioning a 60-meter superyacht from renowned Italian shipbuilder Baglietto, according to a post on his Facebook page.


        Rabiu wrote simply: “60 metres in the making. Thanks, Fabio and James. #ASR,” signaling the project is underway or in early planning stages.
    


        The yacht, a large-scale luxury build, positions Rabiu within a select group of Nigerian tycoons who regularly commission bespoke assets in Europe. At 60 meters, the vessel falls within Baglietto's upper-tier offerings, typically designed for long-range cruising with charter-level amenities.
    


        Industry insiders note that such projects require custom naval architecture, extensive engineering, and a multi-year construction period, depending on specifications and yard capacity.
    


        Baglietto, headquartered in La Spezia on Italy's northwest coast, has a long-established reputation for crafting yachts between 40 and 60 meters.



        The company has delivered numerous high-end builds across Europe, making it a top choice for wealthy African clients seeking prestige and performance. While Baglietto has not publicly confirmed the contract, Rabiu's post strongly indicates the partnership is confirmed.
    


        Rabiu, founder of the BUA Group, chairs one of Nigeria's largest industrial conglomerates, with interests spanning cement, sugar, flour, and infrastructure. 
    


        BUA Cement, part of his portfolio, is a key player in West Africa's building materials market, while his broader industrial ventures in manufacturing and energy have cemented his status among the continent's wealthiest entrepreneurs.



        Luxury superyachts are increasingly popular among Africa's high-net-worth individuals, often serving as both status symbols and functional assets for family travel, corporate hosting, and leisure. 
    


        Observers say these builds underscore the region's growing engagement with bespoke European and Gulf markets, highlighting the intersection of wealth, industrial influence, and lifestyle aspirations.
    


        If confirmed by the shipyard, the 60-meter Baglietto would place Rabiu in a small circle of Nigerian tycoons with large-scale, top-tier superyachts. The project exemplifies how Africa's industrial magnates continue to translate business success into high-profile personal assets, showcasing both status and international connections.

Oops, something went wrong

JPMorgan Chase analysts say a new leader has emerged in the public Bitcoin mining race, and it is not MARA Holdings.

Singapore-based Bitdeer has overtaken American Bitcoin (BTC) mining giant MARA (NASDAQ: MARA) in self-mining hash rate.

According to JPMorgan analysts led by Reginald Smith, Bitdeer now allocates 63.2 exahashes per second (EH/s) to mine Bitcoin (BTC) for itself, surpassing MARA's last reported 60.4 EH/s.

Exahashes (EH/s) is a unit used to measure Bitcoin mining hashrate. One exahash equals 1 quintillion hashes per second.

In Bitcoin mining, EH/s shows how much computational power is being used to solve cryptographic puzzles. The higher the exahash count, the more powerful and competitive the mining operation, and the more secure the Bitcoin network becomes.

Related: Explained: What is sustainable Bitcoin mining?

Bitcoin mining is no longer the easy-money business it once was. Rising network difficulty, post-halving reward reductions, and volatile energy prices have squeezed margins across the board.

Large-scale operations now require massive capital expenditure, vertical integration and operational efficiency simply to stay competitive. For smaller or less efficient miners, profitability has become increasingly elusive.

In the past year, many Bitcoin miners have been increasingly pivoting to artificial intelligence, Ethereum (ETH) staking, or shutting down mining operations.

JPMorgan described January as an “impressive” month for Bitdeer. The company added 8 EH/s in the month alone, fueled by the deployment of its proprietary SEALMINER rigs, as reported by Decrypt on Feb. 18.

Unlike many rivals that rely heavily on hardware suppliers such as Bitmain, Bitdeer has invested in developing its own hyper-efficient silicon, a strategic move that appears to be paying off.

The production numbers are striking. Bitdeer mined 668 BTC in January, a 430% increase year-over-year. The firm reported 78.1 EH/s in total hash rate under management, including 13.0 EH/s dedicated to hosted operations for clients.

For years, MARA's aggressive fleet expansion defined the sector. However, the company has repositioned itself as a broader digital infrastructure firm and has increasingly prioritized AI workloads for customers.

MARA no longer reports company-wide Bitcoin production, making direct output comparisons more difficult.

JPMorgan's analysis suggests Bitdeer's pivot toward self-mining is resonating with investors.

While the company is also exploring AI cloud services and potential data center leasing in the United States, it has reaffirmed plans to continue deploying SEALMINER rigs throughout the year.

Still, Bitdeer's strategy reflects a pragmatic approach to capital management. The company ended January holding 1,530 BTC, down from 2,017 coins in December.

With Bitcoin trading near $67,174.03 at press time, those holdings were valued at around $102 million.

About us

Copy link

Artificial intelligence will take white-collar workers' jobs and threaten to crash the US economy, which Arthur Hayes says will pave the way for Bitcoin to reach a new record high.

In his latest missive, the Maelstrom chief investment officer argues that large language models from OpenAI and Anthropic will push office workers out of their jobs and trigger a financial downturn, as those workers fail to repay their loans. 

Eventually, that will force the Federal Reserve to step in and print money to avoid deflation spiralling out of control, Hayes argues. 

When that happens, Bitcoin is set to hit a new all-time high.

“Deflation is bad, but ultimately good for fiat credit-sensitive assets like Bitcoin,” Hayes wrote in his Tuesday blog.

His forecast may serve as a slight balm for investors who've been burned by the market downturn that has shaved 45% Bitcoin's price since it reached its $124,000 record in October. 

During that time, the overall crypto market has lost about half of its total value, or $2 trillion. 

Hayes' argument is simple. 

Companies will replace white-collar workers with AI tools, which means those workers will be unable to pay their debts. If enough of them default on their loans, banks will suffer roughly $527 billion in losses, per Hayes' estimates.

Those defaults risk wiping out all but the biggest banks from the market. 

“This will be a rerun of the regional bank crisis in early 2023 that destroyed three banks in a fortnight,” Hayes wrote. 

“But this time it will be much worse, as the genesis of the crisis is the unstoppable nature of AI, a narrative the market believes and is terrified by.”

As the crisis continues, traders will likely dump their stocks to avoid being swept up in the banking crisis, which will cause the stock market to collapse, Hayes argues. 

The result of this cascading crisis is that the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury will step in to print money in order to avoid a repeat of the Panic of 2008.

“And then wham bam thank you ma'am it's time to back up the fucking truck and buy Bitcoin and shitcoins like it's 2020,” Hayes said.

To be sure, the BitMEX co-founder doesn't say this will happen tomorrow or maybe not even this year, only that he believes it will happen.

Hayes has form when it comes to making bullish Bitcoin bets. 

Usually, those calls revolve around some sort of intervention from the Federal Reserve that'll see the central bank plough more money into the economy.

In the past, he's predicted that Bitcoin will pump thanks to the Fed printing money to bail out its Japanese counterpart, the central bank's Reserve Management Purchases programme, falling mortgage rates, and commercial banks lending to strategic industries.

In January, he also suggested that the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro would give the US access to the Latin American country's oil, which would keep inflation down and give the Fed an excuse to cut interest rates. 

Low interest rates usually incentivise investors to bet on riskier assets like Bitcoin.

In December, he predicted that Bitcoin's price would reach $200,000 by March.

To be sure, Hayes has an impressive track record for forecasting the price movement of the world's biggest cryptocurrency, but he's been proven wrong in the past. 

At the beginning of 2025, he — like Tom Lee and analysts at Bernstein, Bitwise and Standard Chartered — predicted that Bitcoin would end the year trading at $200,000. 

Hayes later lowered his target to $150,000. Bitcoin ended the year trading just over $87,500.

Ethereum has crossed a symbolic threshold, with more than half the total ether (ETH) issued now held in its proof-of-stake (PoS) contract for the first time in the network's 11-year history, Santiment said in a post on X that has been met with criticism.

The onchain analytics firm on Tuesday said that 50.18% of all ETH issued historically is now sitting in the staking deposit contract. The figure reflects cumulative ETH that has flowed into the contract since staking was introduced ahead of the network's 2022 transition from proof-of-work to PoS.

According to CoinDesk data, the total supply of ether is 120.69 million tokens. Bitmine, the world's largest ether-focused treasury firm, has 4.29 million ETH, of which 2.9 million is staked. According to Arkham data, the largest holder is the Eth2 Beacon Deposit Contract with 77.1 million or over 60% of the total supply. It holds the most because it serves as the central, mandatory gateway for staking to secure the blockchain. Beacon is followed by Binance with 4.1 million ETH, BlackRock with 3.4 million and Coinbase with 2.9 million.

While the tokens are staked, they cannot be transferred or traded. Withdrawals have been enabled since the Shanghai upgrade in 2023, allowing validators to exit and return ETH to circulation.

That distinction prompted some analysts to caution against interpreting the 50% figure as a permanent supply lock.

“The post is inaccurate, or at least materially misleading,” Luke Nolan, senior research associate at CoinShares, told CoinDesk. “It references the one-way deposit contract used for ETH staking, but does not account for withdrawals. While ETH is sent into that contract when validators stake, it is not a permanent sink.”

Since withdrawals were enabled, ETH can exit the validator set and re-enter circulation, meaning that looking at the deposit contract balance alone can overstate the amount effectively staked, Nolan said.

“There is also an important nuance around the numbers being cited,” he added. “It is not correct to suggest that over 80 million ETH are currently staked. Roughly 80 million ETH have passed through the staking contract historically, but the amount actively staked today is closer to 37 million ETH, which is around 30% of the current circulating supply. That distinction materially changes the narrative.”

Aleksandr Vat, BizDev at Ethplorer.io, agreed with Nolan and provided CoinDesk with supporting data reinforcing that distinction.

The Beacon deposit contract balance on the Etherscan tracker, currently around 80.97 million ETH, reflects cumulative deposits since launch and does not decrease when validators exit. Withdrawals are processed by minting ETH back to execution-layer addresses rather than subtracting from the deposit contract itself, Vat said.

According to active staking metrics, approximately 37,253,430 ETH are presently staked, based on data from Ethplorer and CryptoQuant, implying that staking represents 30.8% of the total supply.

Santiment's 50% figure appears to compare the cumulative Beacon contract balance to historically issued supply prior to EIP-1559 burns, Vat said. While that may be mathematically consistent depending on the denominator used, it does not represent the amount of ETH currently locked or removed from circulation, he noted.

Even so, the milestone highlights how central staking has become to Ethereum's economic design, Vineet Budki, partner and CEO at Sigma Capital, told CoinDesk. As participation rises, a larger share of ETH earns yield through validator rewards, reinforcing its positioning as a yield-bearing crypto asset, he said, adding he sees the development as evidence of Ethereum's maturation into what he called a “digital bond.”

“Ethereum's milestone of 50% staked supply marks its evolution into a digital bond, where the network's security is fueled by long-term conviction rather than short-term speculation,” Budki said. “By locking half the total issuance in a one-way vault, the protocol has engineered a structural supply crunch.”

Budki also pointed to accelerating network activity, including a 125% year-over-year increase in daily transactions, a doubling of daily active addresses and an increase in tokenized real-world assets, much of it occurring on layer-2 networks that settle back to Ethereum's base layer.

Nolan noted, however, that recent validator growth has been concentrated among large participants.

“A significant portion of recent validator entries has been driven by large entities such as Bitmine and U.S.-listed ETFs, which have taken up a notable share of the entry queue,” he noted.

With staking levels continuing to climb, the debate shows just how Ethereum's supply metrics, and how they are presented, can significantly shape market narratives, Budki concluded.

Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 network, Base, is changing the technology that powers it, stepping back from relying on Optimism's OP Stack, the toolkit it originally launched on.

In a blog post titled “The Next Chapter for Base,” the team said it plans to take more control over its own code and infrastructure. Instead of depending on multiple outside teams for key upgrades and changes, Base will consolidate everything into a Base-managed codebase.

In simple terms, Base was built using Optimism's technology, but now it wants to steer more of its own ship. Optimism is a layer-2 blockchain on top of Ethereum that aims to reduce settlement times and transaction costs.

Base launched in 2023 and quickly became one of the most widely used Ethereum layer-2 networks, with $3.85 billion locked in the protocol today.

The OP token is down 4% over the past 24 hours following the announcement. 

The team said that the change doesn't mean Base is cutting ties with Optimism entirely. The company said it will still work with Optimism for support and will remain compatible with OP Stack standards during the transition. For everyday users and developers, nothing should immediately change.

The team said the shift is happening because, if it controls its own stack, Base can ship upgrades faster and simplify how the network operates behind the scenes, aiming to double its pace of major upgrades to about six per year.

For now, the transition is mostly technical. 

""This unification does not mean Base will be built in isolation. The protocol remains public and specified in the open, and alternative implementations are welcome and encouraged,"" the team wrote in their blog post.

Laßnitzhöhe, Austria, February 18th, 2026, FinanceWire

Blockchain DMD today announced the release of a new technical analysis examining the relationship between its DMD Diamond (DMD) V4 blockchain and rapidly growing zero-knowledge (ZK) technologies, positioning DMD V4 as a foundational Layer 1 infrastructure designed to support the next generation of scalable and privacy-focused applications.

As the crypto industry intensifies its focus on Layer 2 scalability and privacy-enhancing solutions, Blockchain DMD's development team published a comparative architectural review of its newly launched V4 mainnet and widely adopted zero-knowledge proof systems.

DMD Diamond, originally founded in 2013, recently deployed its V4 mainnet built on Honey Badger BFT (HBBFT) consensus combined with POSDAO governance. According to the announcement, while ZK rollups and privacy protocols are gaining momentum, they depend on a secure, decentralized, and cost-efficient base layer — a role Blockchain DMD states DMD Diamond is engineered to fulfill.

Technical Analysis Highlights Core Differences




The analysis outlines several fundamental distinctions between DMD Diamond's Layer 1 architecture and zero-knowledge technologies:

Consensus-Level vs. Cryptographic Security

DMD Diamond V4 delivers consensus-level security through HBBFT and POSDAO, enabling the network to remain operational and secure even when a significant portion of validator nodes behave maliciously. This model emphasizes cooperative Byzantine fault tolerance at the protocol level.

Zero-knowledge systems, by contrast, rely on mathematical cryptographic proofs that validate information without revealing underlying data. These solutions are typically deployed on top of existing base-layer networks.

Instant Finality vs. Dependent Finality




DMD V4 offers deterministic instant finality, meaning transactions become irreversible as soon as they are included in a block.

ZK rollups operating on networks such as Ethereum generally inherit the finality characteristics of the underlying Layer 1, which may introduce confirmation delays.

Positioning DMD Diamond as a ZK-Ready Infrastructure Layer

Rather than framing zero-knowledge technologies as competitive alternatives, Blockchain DMD's announcement emphasizes interoperability and synergy.

The technical analysis identifies three primary advantages DMD Diamond offers to ZK-based applications:
		



The company stated that the analysis is part of a broader initiative to position DMD Diamond as an infrastructure optimized for high-performance decentralized applications requiring security, fairness, and scalability.

About DMD Diamond

Founded in 2013, DMD Diamond is one of the longest-running Layer 1 blockchains focused on security, interoperability, and decentralized governance. The ecosystem is community-driven, with stakeholders collectively guiding protocol development and long-term strategic direction.

                            Logan Paul's NFT has collapsed — what about the collections of other celebrities? | Source: CCN                        

When YouTuber Logan Paul paid 188 ether for a rare digital collectible from the 0N1 Force NFT collection in August 2021 — worth roughly $623,000 to $635,000 at the time — the purchase embodied the peak of the pandemic-era NFT frenzy.

Five years later, the collection's floor price has fallen to around 0.08 Ether, or approximately $155 at current prices near $1,965, according to data reviewed on NFT marketplace OpenSea.

The collapse, which has drawn widespread ridicule on social media, has raised questions regarding what other celebrity NFTs are valued at today.

Logan Paul purchased the 0N1 Force NFT in August 2021 for 188 ETH at the height of the NFT craze, buying the NFT alongside a myriad of other celebrities.

However, just one year later, Paul had accepted he made a “mistake” claiming “it's worth essentially nothing.”

A year ago, I spent $623,000 on an NFT. Today, it's worth essentially nothing.

I've immortalized this mistake in 99 Originals with an exact replica helmet & outfithttps://t.co/OzBRdQPxUK pic.twitter.com/srD2h4SgO7

— Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) July 13, 2022



At the time of reporting, five years on, the broader 0N1 Force collection shows a floor price of roughly 0.08 ETH ($155) on OpenSea.

Because NFTs trade infrequently, the “worth” of a specific token often reflects the lowest active listing price for the collection.

While Paul has always denied wrongdoing, the backlash has been amplified by controversy surrounding CryptoZoo, an NFT-based game project he promoted in 2021 that was later criticized after failing to deliver key features.

CryptoZoo was marketed as a blockchain game in which users would buy NFT “eggs” that could hatch into hybrid animals and generate token rewards.

The project drew complaints from buyers who said they had spent thousands of dollars on NFTs and tokens but were unable to recoup funds after development stalled and prices fell.

Paul has previously said he intended to make affected CryptoZoo buyers whole and has blamed the project's failure on advisers and developers.

He has also said he did not personally profit from the project.

The renewed attention has extended beyond NFTs into other tokenization ventures tied to Paul's brand — including a separate controversy involving the fractionalization of a rare Pokémon card.

Earlier this week, Paul set a Guinness World Record after selling his rare Pikachu Illustrator Pokémon card for nearly $16.5 million — making it reportedly the most expensive Pokémon card sale in history.

He had purchased the card for $5.3 million in July 2021.

The record sale, however, reignited criticism over Paul's 2022 decision to fractionalize ownership of the card through Liquid Marketplace, a platform which eventually collapsed.

🚨 Mizkif EXPOSES Logan Paul, calls him a scammer 👀

""The reason why this is a scam… is because this illustrator card, if you look at it, it's not a PSA Gem Mint 10. This is an 8 that Logan got regraded twice, that somehow got upgraded to a 10."" pic.twitter.com/WkPN97BZRP

— ClipX (@ClipXClipX) February 16, 2026



Some investors were temporarily unable to access their holdings, and the episode prompted legal action in Canada.

Paul has said the platform's shutdown was beyond his control and that he later paid to restore the site so users could withdraw funds.

He claimed that only 5.4% of the card had been fractionalized, representing roughly $270,000 in outside investment.

However, community notes on X highlight how Logan Paul co-founded the platform, previously naming it as “my platform.”

A hearing is currently scheduled for June, though Paul is not named in the lawsuit.

Pop star Justin Bieber purchased Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #3001 in January 2022 for 500 ETH, roughly $1.29 million at the time, according to blockchain data.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, one of the most prominent NFT projects of the boom, reached floor prices above 150 ETH in 2022.

As of Feb. 18, BAYC's floor price stands around 6.10 ETH on OpenSeam, which stands at just approximately $12,184 at today's trading prices.

The markdown represents over 90% of its value lost.

Bieber's specific NFT has not recently sold, making its exact market value uncertain.

Rare traits can usually command premiums, but valuation typically tracks close to the collection floor.

Along with Logan Paul, Rapper Snoop Dogg emerged during the NFT boom as one of the highest-profile celebrity collectors, operating under the pseudonym “Cozomo de' Medici”.

The account, which began posting regularly about NFT acquisitions in 2021, quickly drew a large following in the crypto community, sharing purchases and commentary on the speculative dynamics of the market.

I am @CozomoMedici

— Snoop Dogg (@SnoopDogg) September 20, 2021



The account, which was initially anonymous, announced a contest which said a celebrity would publicly claim the identity and reward the first user to spot the announcement with 1 ETH.

In a move that many claim was a standout moment from the NFT boom, Snoop Dogg revealed on X that he was the man behind the profile.

The Cozomo wallet has been linked to a vast array of NFTs, including CryptoPunks, Art Blocks, and other high-value works that were widely traded during the market's peak.

Some industry estimates at the time placed the portfolio's value in the tens of millions of dollars, though these figures fluctuate sharply.

Among the most prominent assets associated with the wallet are CryptoPunks, one of the earliest and best-known NFT collections.

Individual CryptoPunks sold for more than $10 million during the boom, but prices have since fallen substantially.

As of Feb. 18, CryptoPunks' floor price stands at roughly 29.8 ETH, according to listings on OpenSea.

At today's trading price, that equates to approximately just $55,000.

Because the Cozomo portfolio contains NFTs of varying rarity — including pieces that may trade far above floor prices — its total value cannot be determined without recent sales.

Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker purchased a BAYC NFT in 2022 for approximately $241,000, according to reporting at the time.

As with Bieber's NFT, current valuation tracks with BAYC floor prices, 6.10 ETH on OpenSeam, which stands at just approximately $12,184 at today's trading prices.

Media personality Paris Hilton was among the celebrities who publicly embraced NFTs at the height of the boom, purchasing a BAYC for roughly $287,000 in 2021.

Famously, Hilton appeared on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where she and Fallon displayed their respective Bored Ape NFTs and discussed the emerging trend.

The segment has gone down in recent history one of the most visible mainstream endorsements of NFT culture during its peak.

Falling NFT trading volumes are frequently cited as evidence that the market has completely failed.

But analysts have cautioned that turnover alone can be a misleading gauge of underlying demand.

During the 2021–2022 boom, according to Dr. Efstathios Polyzos in a recent opinion piece for CCN, exceptionally high trading volumes were driven by rapid flipping and short-term momentum strategies.

In many cases, tokens changed hands multiple times within days or even hours as traders sought quick profits.

In today's market, which has massively decreased in terms of prices, OpenSea transaction records show that holding periods have lengthened since the market's peak.

While overall transaction counts have fallen sharply, remaining trades have reflected a matured market — focusing on longer investment strategies or specific use cases.

The retreat in Ethereum prices has also played a big part in the reduced NFT valuations of Logan Paul and other celebrities which publicly entered the arena.

Even when and if NFT floor prices hold steady in Ethereum terms, their dollar value is still fluctuating depending on the overall crypto market.

Ethereum is currently trading at around $2 935 below its 2021 peak, which is roughly 59.27% lower than that all‑time high.

In other words, during the NFT boom in 2021, Ethereum peaked around $4 953.73, versus about $2 017.76 now.

At the height of the boom, barriers to minting NFTs also fell dramatically.

By 2025, total NFT supply had ballooned to an estimated 1.34 billion tokens, roughly 25% higher year over year, as low-cost minting platforms made it easier than ever to launch new collections.

This rapid expansion and accessibility heavily diluted scarcity, a core pillar of what made NFT pricing models so valuable.

While early collections such as CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club benefited from limited supply and first-mover advantage, thousands of newer projects have struggled to maintain demand.

Total NFT sales revenue fell roughly 37% in 2025 to about $5.63 billion, down from approximately $8.9 billion in 2024, according to blockchain data.

By early 2026, overall NFT sales volumes remain an estimated 70% to 80% below peak levels reached during the speculative surge.

During the wild craze that was dubbed the next Bitcoin, Justin Bieber once bought a ‘Bored Ape' NFT for millions of dollars – but fast forward four years, and it's almost worthless.

In a bid to recreate the Bitcoin boom that has made common tech gurus into billionaires, we've had schemes like Dogecoin, Metaverse tokens, and NFTs.

The latter might be one of the biggest currency collapse stories we've had since Wall Street, though, as ultra-wealthy people poured a lot of money into these avatar-like mascots.

One of those was Justin Bieber, who bought Bored Ape Yacht Club for $1,301,550 in January 2022, but it's now worth less than what it costs to get an oil change in his cars.

Although Ferrari is trying to revive NFTs, the cryptocurrency fell flat on its face shortly after booming in 2022.

Justin Bieber bought the third-most expensive NFT ever owned by a celebrity, paying $1,301,550 for the Bored Ape Yacht Club, expecting it to become increasingly rare and an investment for the future.

However, in one year, it lost 95 percent of its value.

Now, it's over 99 percent, as current NFT rates suggest that the BAYC avatar is worth just $12,000 today.

That's about as much as a one-year-old Nissan Versa, slated as America's most affordable car.

But it's not just Bieber whose money has been lost to the NFT scene, as millions of online tokens are now worth pennies on the dollar.

The designers, Yuga Labs, were even sued for using celebrity endorsements, like Justin Bieber, in order to convince others to begin investing in the scheme. 

The claimants believe these celebrities were hired to ‘artificially inflate and distort the price' of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs.

Justin Bieber wasn't the biggest loser, though, only taking the bronze medal here, as Snoop Dogg set the bar for celebrities with a $7 million purchase of ‘Right Click and Save As guy'.

Snoop's token is worth $60,000 today, although his investment did reap rewards with a recent collection based on the celebrity, managing to raise $12 million.

Gary Vaynerchuk's $4 million CryptoPunk token was the runner-up, now worth less than $50,000.

Other celebrities such as Neymar Jr., Madonna, Eminem, Logan Paul, and Tom Brady all lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

It really was a huge investment blunder for everyone, all of whom could have had a similar fate to this Bitcoin investor if they chose the right pot to grow their money in.

We are pleased to announce that two further individuals have been convicted following our extensive investigation into the unlawful accessing and sale of personal information obtained from over 400 garages across the UK, as well as claims management and insurance companies. 

Christopher Munro, 37, of Knutsford, Cheshire, and William Chipoma, 35, of Enfield, London, were charged after investigations uncovered their involvement in the theft and sale of personal data within the claims management sector. 

Our enquiries revealed that Munro and Chipoma deliberately sought employment with the intention of stealing and selling personal data. 

Munro, while working for two different companies during 2015 and 2016, accessed thousands of records without legitimate authority or consent, receiving payments totalling £16,000. He made multiple employment applications to claims management and insurance companies but left after short periods when unable to access personal data. He was charged with four offences: two under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and two under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998. 

Chipoma illegally accessed records and sold personal data between 2015 and 2017, receiving payments totalling £70,550. He was also charged with four offences: two under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and two under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998. 

Both men pleaded guilty to all offences at an earlier hearing.  

Following this, both men appeared at Minshull Street Crown Court on 11 February 2026 where Chipoma was handed a 10 month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, as well as being ordered to complete 240 hours of unpaid work. Whilst Munro was handed a 32 week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, as well as being ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.

This brings the total number of people prosecuted in our largest nuisance call investigation to 10. Three people have been cautioned in relation to this case.

ICO Financial Investigators as well as external Financial Investigators are looking to recoup the financial benefits obtained by these offenders by utilising the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. 

Eight men guilty following largest ever nuisance call investigation

We welcome a guilty verdict in a trial related to the unlawful accessing and obtaining of people's personal information from vehicle repair garages to generate potential leads for personal injury claims.

The verdict follows a 10 week trial and an extensive investigation by the ICO. During which, we seized the widest body of evidence we have ever seen, demonstrating the misuse of people's personal details to make nuisance calls to try and persuade people to make personal injury claims.

A jury at Bolton Crown Court this week found Craig Cornick, 40, of Prestbury, guilty of conspiracy to unlawfully obtain personal data contrary to the Data Protection Act.

Earlier in the month, the jury returned a not guilty verdict for Cornick and Thomas Daly, 35, of Macclesfield, for a charge of conspiracy to access computer systems without authority contrary to the Computer Misuse Act.

Daly had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to unlawfully obtain personal data.

Cornick and Daly join six other men who had all previously pleaded guilty to the offences listed below:

All the defendants are due to return to court on 11 July, where it is proposed Proceeds of Crime Act and cost issues will be discussed, with sentencing following at a later date.

ICO Head of Investigations, Andy Curry, said:

“Most of us have had nuisance calls asking if we've been in a crash. At best they're annoying but at worst they cause real upset and fear, especially to vulnerable people, and have a real impact on the businesses affected.

This case uncovered a vast, murky criminal network where crash details were stolen from garages across England, Scotland and Wales and traded to fuel distressing predatory calls. This has been an enormous and complex case which has seen ICO staff use both technical expertise and investigative skills to work tirelessly to track down those responsible and hold them accountable on behalf of the public.”

Our investigation 

We initially started this investigation in 2016 when the owner of a car repair garage in County Durham contacted the regulator, saying he was worried his customers blamed him for the nuisance calls they were receiving about personal injury claims.

From this first initial complaint, the investigation snowballed into one of the largest nuisance call cases we have ever dealt with, resulting in a wealth of evidence that demonstrated misuses of personal data for the purpose of making calls relating to personal injury claims.

After identifying the people involved, our investigations team conducted nine warrants in the Manchester and Macclesfield areas. The devices seized under search warrant contained 241,000 emails, 4.5 million documents,144,000 spreadsheets,1.5 million images and 83,000 multimedia files.

The defendants were found to have conspired together between 2014 and 2017, where they accessed or obtained personal data of people from vehicle repair garages without their consent. Approximately one million records were accessed by the defendants convicted of an offence under the Computer Misuse Act.

This data was then sold onto claims management firms hoping to generate potential leads for personal injury claims. We have an ongoing second phase of our investigation and anticipate further prosecutions of people embedded into insurance companies and claims management companies with the sole aim of stealing personal data.

 

We are pleased to announce that two further individuals have been convicted following our extensive investigation into the unlawful accessing and sale of personal information obtained from over 400 garages across the UK, as well as claims management and insurance companies.

The next phase of the Data (Use and Access) Act (DUAA) implementation commenced yesterday, 5 February 2026. This means that most of the remaining data protection provisions of the Act have come into force, except for the requirement for organisations to have a complaints procedure which is due to commence on 19 June 2026 and some ICO governance provisions which will follow at a later date. 

We have fined MediaLab.AI, Inc. (MediaLab), owner of image sharing and hosting platform Imgur, £247,590 for failing to use children's personal information lawfully.  

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has opened formal investigations into X Internet Unlimited Company (XIUC) and X.AI LLC (X.AI) covering their processing of personal data in relation to the Grok artificial intelligence system and its potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.  

We have reprimanded Staines Health Group for sending excessive medical details about a terminally ill patient to their insurance company. 

In January 2025, we responded to the government's call for proposals to boost the UK's economy and foster economic growth.

We have fined two companies a total of £225,000 for sending millions of unsolicited marketing messages in breach of the law. 

We have updated and enhanced our guidance on international transfers of personal information, making it quicker for businesses to understand and comply with the transfer rules under UK GDPR. 

Our new report released today shows how the rise of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) could transform the way we live our lives, with personal shopping ‘AI-gents' potentially arriving within the next five years.","{'href': 'https://www.wired-gov.net', 'title': 'Wired-Gov'}","cryptocurrency"

Jeff Alvares is senior counsel at the Central Bank of Brazil, leading legal and policy work on financial regulation, fintech, and payments. He previously served at the Financial Stability Board, directing the G20 Cross-Border Payments Roadmap. With nearly two decades in financial law and policy, he helped design regulatory frameworks at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. A graduate of Harvard Law School and University of São Paulo, he writes at jeffalvares.com.

The European Union can pursue financial sovereignty through the digital euro, but sovereignty over money doesn't mean sovereignty over the markets that form around it, writes Jeff Alvares.

The European Union can pursue financial independence from American firms through the digital euro. But sovereignty over money doesn't mean sovereignty over the markets that form around it. This distinction matters as European policymakers debate whether a central bank digital currency (CBDC) can serve as an industrial policy tool to develop a homegrown payment ecosystem free from American dominance. The question is not whether to issue a digital euro, but who controls the markets built on top of it.

European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde has framed the digital euro as essential for bolstering the single currency's international role. It would offer the EU a sovereign alternative to foreign payment service providers (PSPs) and potentially expand the euro's cross-border use. Piero Cipollone, a member of the ECB's executive board, has repeatedly warned that Europe's capacity to act independently could be constrained so long as core digital payment services remain in non-European hands. His remarks echo those of Philip Lane, another ECB executive board member, for whom the digital euro would reduce reliance on foreign payment schemes, applications, and stablecoins, countering Europe's exposure to economic pressure and coercion.

The concern is not abstract. Visa, Mastercard, and other international card schemes now process 66 percent of eurozone card transactions, and 13 euro-area countries lack any domestic digital payment alternative. Even where domestic card schemes exist, they depend on partnerships with international networks to process cross-border transactions within the eurozone. When these networks suspended operations in Russia after the Ukraine invasion, it crystallized for many the vulnerability of depending on foreign financial infrastructure. In a recent open letter, 70 European academics—including Thomas Piketty, Daniela Gabor, and Paul De Grauwe—urged policymakers to embrace the digital euro's full potential, warning that political negotiations risked hollowing out a project essential for European sovereignty.

Against this backdrop, EU banks have mounted a counterargument. They contend that a central-bank-issued digital euro would be counterproductive to private European payment solutions already in development. Wero, a mobile payment scheme launched by the European Payments Initiative in 2024, is the most notable example. Backed by 16 major private European PSPs, Wero has enrolled over 40 million users and aims to offer a pan-European alternative to card networks. The banks' implicit message is clear: let private enterprise solve Europe's payment sovereignty problem. These concerns have reverberated in the European Parliament. Fernando Navarrete Rojas, the rapporteur coordinating the legislative process, presented a draft report in November 2025 that departs significantly from the European Commission's original proposal. His approach would establish an offline digital euro—a token-based version enabling device-to-device payments without network connectivity—immediately, while conditioning the online version on finding that no suitable private pan-European payment solution exists.

Both sides of this debate, however, share a common blind spot: they assume that European policymakers have more freedom to shape digital payment markets than international trade law actually permits. A missing piece in the conversation is the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which obligates World Trade Organization (WTO) members, including all EU states, to grant market access to foreign providers of electronic payment services on the same terms as domestic firms. Creating the digital euro, however ambitiously designed, does not exempt Europe from its trade obligations. While EU members' GATS commitments in electronic payment services vary by mode and member state, they are sufficiently broad that payment schemes and applications fall within their coverage. Legitimate control over digital money does not extend to foreclosing the competitive markets above it.

The analytical framework I developed in a recent ProMarket article applies directly here. Payment systems operate on a four-layer stack: money (layer one), settlement infrastructure (layer two), payment schemes (layer three), and applications (layer four). For CBDCs, the first two layers collapse: the currency exists as entries in the central bank's ledger, placing it within monetary sovereignty and beyond trade commitments. But here is the critical point: the scheme rules and wallet applications are not constitutive of the money. They are commercial layers built on top of the monetary infrastructure. A CBDC balance recorded on the central bank's ledger could, in principle, be accessed through different competing schemes or wallet applications, just as a bank deposit can be accessed through Visa or Mastercard. When the central bank designs rules for how users access the digital currency, or when it determines which PSPs may offer wallets, it is making commercial and regulatory choices, not exercising core monetary functions.The ECB's proposal fuses the digital euro as money and the infrastructure recording and settling balances (layers one and two), creates a unified payment scheme governed by a common rulebook (layer three), and regulates distribution through authorized wallets (layer four). By opting for a structure where PSPs distribute the digital euro to the public, the ECB implicitly recognizes that scheme- and application-layer competition is architecturally feasible. The wholesale CBDC infrastructure will be a sovereign monopoly—rightly so—but nothing in that design requires excluding private firms from setting up alternative payment schemes or offering competing wallet services.

However, while framing this as an “open” architecture permitting voluntary integration with private schemes, the ECB's“Fit of the digital euro in the payment ecosystem” report asserts that “mandatory acceptance of the digital euro is the only way to ensure that these standards are implemented across the entire market.” The Eurosystem will also bear all scheme and processing costs, charging no fees to participants. The report acknowledges the tension these options create: PSPs stand “in stark contrast with the ECB perspective,” arguing that, “where domestic card schemes still enjoy a strong market position, the digital euro is more likely to disincentivize the development of those solutions.” An architecture is not “open” when participation is legally compelled.

The ECB's design choices directly invoke two core disciplines of trade law. The first is market access (GATS Article XVI): will private payment schemes, domestic or foreign, be permitted to operate at all, or will the digital euro's mandatory acceptance by merchants and zero scheme fees de facto foreclose competition? The second is national treatment (GATS Article XVII): even if private providers are permitted to participate, will foreign schemes and applications face equal conditions, or will the system's design advantage European service providers?

On market access, the digital euro creates a dual barrier that affects all competing schemes equally, European and foreign. Merchants must accept it by law, ensuring universal reach. And the Eurosystem will bear all scheme and processing costs, a subsidy the ECB likens to banknote production. But the analogy is misapplied. There is no scheme layer between banknotes and users. Digital payments are different: they require rules governing acceptance, dispute resolution, and transaction processing—the scheme layer where private firms ordinarily compete. By extending public subsidization from infrastructure (where it is uncontroversial) to the scheme layer (where competition is feasible), the ECB creates conditions under which no private scheme, European or foreign, can viably compete. The result is the same “dual-barrier” dynamic that has drawn scrutiny to Brazil's Pix instant payment system: legal requirements ensuring universal reach, reinforced by economic conditions that make competing schemes' business case unviable even if the architecture technically permits it.

On national treatment, the digital euro framework raises concerns about discrimination targeted at foreign suppliers. The ECB report states that its “fundamental principle for global digital wallets ” is “same rights, same obligations.” Yet the same document warns that global digital wallets should not “disproportionately benefit” from distributing the digital euro, expressing concern that Big Tech companies might profit from “distributing the solution to end users” while European PSPs focus on “the cost-driven parts like handling risk management and other non-value-adding activities.” This is not neutral language. It signals that foreign providers participating in the digital euro ecosystem will face scrutiny that domestic providers will not. When a regulator explicitly states that foreign firms should not benefit “disproportionately” from a market they are nominally permitted to enter, the playing field is not level. Whether such language ultimately translates into a formal violation would depend on implementation. But under WTO jurisprudence, regulatory intent and design are relevant indicators of de facto discrimination.

If Visa, Mastercard, or American fintech firms seek to offer digital euro payment services and are denied access or face discriminatory licensing conditions, that is a potential GATS issue, not a matter of monetary sovereignty. GATS excludes from its obligations “services provided in the exercise of governmental-authority”—services neither commercial nor competitive with private suppliers. This exception covers central banks' function of issuing and recording the currency, not a vertically integrated payments business that extends monopoly control from the infrastructure layer up into competitive markets. The fact that the digital euro serves a public purpose does not change this analysis. GATS carves out services that inherently preclude competition, not commercial services that happen to be publicly provided.

What would a valid justification require? Under GATS, restrictions on market access may be permissible if they are necessary to achieve legitimate public policy objectives and no less trade-restrictive alternatives are reasonably available. Technical necessity, institutional context, and data governance concerns may justify targeted measures. But they must be proportionate, evidence-based, and ideally time-limited. Using the digital euro to advantage European PSPs systematically over foreign competitors would be difficult to defend on these grounds, especially when the ECB's own design demonstrates that infrastructure and scheme  layers can be separated.

The ECB might argue that digital currency requires unified scheme-level control to ensure security, finality, and integrity in ways that physical banknotes do not. But the intermediated distribution model undermines this defense. If currency integrity required public control at every layer, the ECB would not delegate distribution, customer verification, and transaction processing to private institutions. Relying on PSPs for these operational functions concedes that separation is feasible without compromising monetary integrity. The ECB cannot invoke inseparability to justify scheme-layer control while simultaneously designing a system premised on separability.

The EU might invoke financial stability or data sovereignty as justifications. But the EU data protection regime already applies to any firm processing European personal data, regardless of origin. Prudential oversight can be imposed through non-discriminatory licensing conditions, as it is for banking and payment services today. The necessity test asks whether exclusion is required to achieve these objectives, or whether regulation applied equally to all participants would suffice. Where non-discriminatory alternatives exist, foreclosure fails the least-trade-restrictive standard.

ECB officials have themselves acknowledged that the dominance of foreign payment providers reflects a lack of European competitiveness and innovation, compounded by regulatory fragmentation across member states. But this diagnosis weakens any necessity defense under trade law. Fragmentation and underinvestment are domestic policy and business failures, not market failures that foreign rivalry caused or that excluding foreign suppliers would cure. GATS necessity tests are not designed to shield incumbents from the consequences of their own choices. Even if one views the dominance of Visa and Mastercard as entrenched through network effects and data advantages, the remedy under trade law is pro-competitive regulation—interoperability mandates, data portability, fee caps—not exclusion of foreign providers.

The ECB's own consultations expose a definitional problem. European PSPs expressed concern that the digital euro would “capture transactions from European private solutions rather than from international card schemes.” If the measure harms the industry it purports to protect, the necessity defense fails on its own terms. This is not strategic autonomy, but rather state-backed crowding out of private innovation, European and foreign alike. Under GATS, a measure cannot be “necessary” to protect domestic providers if those providers identify it as a threat to their viability.

Europe's financial autonomy is a legitimate objective. So is developing competitive European payment solutions. But achieving these goals requires working within international trade commitments, not assuming they can be bypassed through invocations of monetary sovereignty as legal cover for what is, in substance, a publicly subsidized payment scheme with mandatory participation. The United States Trade Representative's Section 301 investigation into Brazil's Pix signals that these issues will be contested. Once CBDC architectures become locked in, with millions of users and billions in transactions, reform becomes economically and politically impractical. Europe should not assume it will be exempt. Legal clarity must come before launch. 

The path forward requires designing the common rulebook to permit genuine competition among schemes and applications, which means accepting that foreign providers may succeed within it, or admitting the trade law constraints and negotiating modifications to EU services commitments. What the EU cannot do is claim an open architecture while mandating participation and charging no fees, invoke sovereignty while operating a commercial scheme, and express alarm that foreign firms might “disproportionately benefit” from a system they are nominally permitted to enter. This trio of positions is not a sustainable legal strategy; it is an invitation for a trade dispute.

Integration aims to make food distribution transparent, leak-proof and beneficiary-centric

In a landmark move blending financial innovation with welfare delivery, the Government of India has launched a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)-based Digital Food Currency pilot in Gujarat, marking the first integration of programmable digital money into the Public Distribution System (PDS).

The pilot was inaugurated by Amit Shah in the presence of Prahlad Joshi, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, and Bhupendra Patel, along with senior state and central officials.

CBDC Integration: A Structural Upgrade to India's Food Security Architecture

Describing the initiative as a milestone reform, Prahlad Joshi said that integrating CBDC into the PDS architecture represents a decisive step toward transparency, efficiency and beneficiary empowerment. India's PDS — the world's largest food distribution network — serves over 80 crore beneficiaries. With the launch of the Digital Food Currency pilot, the government aims to further modernize the system through technology-led governance.

Under the new framework, digital coupons generated via the Reserve Bank of India will be credited directly to beneficiaries as programmable digital rupee (e₹). These coupons can be redeemed at Fair Price Shops (FPS) using QR codes or voucher codes for entitled foodgrain quantities. The programmable nature of the digital rupee ensures that funds can be used exclusively for foodgrain transactions, thereby minimizing misuse and enhancing accountability.

Addressing Biometric and Operational Challenges

Officials indicated that the CBDC-enabled system will reduce dependence on repeated biometric authentication and mitigate operational issues associated with e-POS devices. By generating a real-time, traceable digital trail of transactions, the platform enhances monitoring and oversight while simplifying the user experience for beneficiaries.

In addition, Fair Price Shop dealers will receive their margins in real time, improving cash flow efficiency and strengthening trust across the distribution chain. The digital wallet architecture ensures seamless transactions while reinforcing fiscal discipline within the system.

Pilot Rollout and Expansion Strategy

The pilot has been launched in collaboration with the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of Gujarat across selected districts — Ahmedabad, Anand, Valsad and Surat. Following its initial implementation, the program will expand to the Union Territories of Chandigarh, Puducherry, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu as part of a phased national rollout strategy.

Amit Shah described the initiative as an extension of the Digital India vision into welfare governance, noting that India now accounts for nearly half of the world's digital transactions. He emphasized that CBDC integration aligns with the government's “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance” approach by strengthening transparency and ensuring that beneficiaries receive their entitled foodgrains with greater awareness of their rights.

Building on a Decade of PDS Digitization

The CBDC pilot builds upon extensive digital reforms undertaken by the Department of Food and Public Distribution in recent years. These include end-to-end digitization of ration cards, nationwide portability under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) framework, Aadhaar-enabled e-POS authentication, and real-time supply chain monitoring through platforms such as Ann Chakra. Grievance redressal systems like Ann Sahayata have further strengthened citizen-centric accountability.

By embedding a sovereign digital payment layer into the PDS, the government is effectively closing the loop between entitlement, authentication, transaction and audit.

A New Template for Welfare Delivery

The pilot, which currently covers a limited number of beneficiaries, is positioned as a proof-of-concept for integrating programmable digital currency into large-scale welfare systems. If successful, it could redefine subsidy delivery mechanisms by replacing traditional cash or in-kind transfer inefficiencies with a secure, traceable and purpose-bound digital alternative.

With the slogan “Har Dana, Har Rupiya, Har Adhikar,” the initiative seeks to ensure that every grain, every rupee and every entitlement reaches its intended beneficiary. As the pilot scales up, it may offer a replicable governance model for other social protection schemes, positioning India at the forefront of digital public infrastructure innovation in welfare administration.

Innovation

Nearly a year after launching a nationwide crypto payment system for tourists, merchants say hardly anyone is using it — raising questions about who the experiment really serves.

Nine months into its big push for cryptocurrency payments, Bhutan isn't finding many takers for its plans.

Last May, Bhutan became the first country to launch a nationwide crypto payment network for tourists. Visitors to the Himalayan kingdom could pay for their visas, flights, hotels, and meals in more than 100 cryptocurrencies via Binance. Within the first month of its launch, over 1,000 merchants signed up to receive payments in crypto.

Almost a year on, though, nothing much has changed on the ground.

In Thimphu, the QR codes displayed by local businesses to receive crypto payments gather dust. Several merchants have never had any customers opt for them.

“It has been four to five months, but no customer has used it until now,” Sonam Dorji, who works at Lotus Peak Enterprise, a handicraft store on the premises of the Le Meridien hotel, told Rest of World. “No one knows that we accept cryptocurrency and Binance Pay.”

Experts and locals said the government's push for cryptocurrency is driven by its own massive bitcoin reserves, and doesn't account for structural hurdles like power shortage and low literacy, which make the transition unlikely.

“Mining bitcoin gives [Bhutan] a currency to purchase imports that it didn't have before, so I understand why the political establishment in the country wants to go for digital payments,” Jay Zagorsky, a professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, told Rest of World. “However, just because the central bank is pushing Bhutan society toward digital payments does not make it sensible.”

Zagorsky is the author of The Power of Cash: Why Using Paper Money is Good For You and Society. The book argues that preserving physical money is essential to protect individual privacy, curb overspending, and prevent the economic exclusion of the world's most vulnerable populations.

The director of Bhutan's Department of Tourism, Damcho Rinzin, and DK Bank CEO Ugyen Tenzin did not respond to Rest of World's request for interviews or comment.

The Bhutanese government started mining bitcoin in 2019. Abundant rivers and mountainous terrain make hydroelectric power plentiful in the kingdom, and domestic consumption is low given its population of less than a million people. Bhutan uses the surplus electricity generated from renewable sources to power its crypto mining operations.

In October 2024, Bhutan's bitcoin reserves touched $1.4 billion, making it the biggest state-backed green-mined reserve in the world. Other countries with larger government reserves, like the U.S. and China, acquired bitcoin through purchases or asset seizures — or, in Ukraine's case, donations.

Countries with shaky infrastructures and low rates of literacy are not the best places for introducing new types of legal tender.”

Bhutan's infrastructure, however, does not support widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies for transactions. One-third of Bhutanese people are not literate — a necessary criterion to navigate digital payments, Zagorsky said. 

The country also suffers from an unstable power supply, which can make digital payments challenging. The typical customer deals with power cuts 19 times a year, due to causes that are only under the power companies' control, according to a government report. One-fifth of businesses in Bhutan own or share a ground generator, World Bank data shows.

“Using crypto as legal tender means items like bitcoin need to be accepted by all types of businesses, from large to very small, at all times for any debt,” Zagorsky said. “Countries with shaky infrastructures and low rates of literacy are not the best places for introducing new types of legal tender, especially when other small countries like El Salvador, who have tried it, did not see the experiment succeed.”

In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to make bitcoin legal tender — a decision it walked back in 2025 when the International Monetary Fund had to bail out the tanking economy.

The Central African Republic, which had made bitcoin legal tender in April 2022, also reversed the decision within a year after significant pressure from the IMF and World Bank. Compared to the Latin American country, it saw barely any adoption among its citizens, given low internet penetration and frequent power outages.

In one of Thimphu's oldest eateries, Ambient Cafe, owner Junnu Chhetri told Rest of World her establishment doesn't keep track of the daily usage of Binance. She said some guests — mostly foreigners — have used it.   

Experts say Bhutan isn't necessarily heading in the same direction as El Salvador and the Central African Republic. The current system instantly converts crypto payments to ngultrum for merchants. It's more of a gateway than a store of value, reducing risk and volatility.

“Initially, there was talk about expanding crypto payments to other sectors, but in practice, I haven't seen this happen in any significant way yet,” Ugyen Dendup, the co-founder of Bhutan's first AI startup NoMindBhutan, told Rest of World. “At the market or business level, tourism is the only sector where this conversation is visible, and even there, adoption remains limited.

”Dendup said there's nothing clearly written or formalized on paper regarding crypto laws or regulations in Bhutan. “It exists in a kind of gray area: Some people push for it, some are cautious, and enforcement or guidance isn't very clear,” he said. “Because of this, it's hard to say whether Bhutan is moving toward making bitcoin legal tender.”

The European Union can pursue financial sovereignty through the digital euro, but sovereignty over money doesn't mean sovereignty over the markets that form around it, writes Jeff Alvares.

The European Union can pursue financial independence from American firms through the digital euro. But sovereignty over money doesn't mean sovereignty over the markets that form around it. This distinction matters as European policymakers debate whether a central bank digital currency (CBDC) can serve as an industrial policy tool to develop a homegrown payment ecosystem free from American dominance. The question is not whether to issue a digital euro, but who controls the markets built on top of it.

European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde has framed the digital euro as essential for bolstering the single currency's international role. It would offer the EU a sovereign alternative to foreign payment service providers (PSPs) and potentially expand the euro's cross-border use. Piero Cipollone, a member of the ECB's executive board, has repeatedly warned that Europe's capacity to act independently could be constrained so long as core digital payment services remain in non-European hands. His remarks echo those of Philip Lane, another ECB executive board member, for whom the digital euro would reduce reliance on foreign payment schemes, applications, and stablecoins, countering Europe's exposure to economic pressure and coercion.

The concern is not abstract. Visa, Mastercard, and other international card schemes now process 66 percent of eurozone card transactions, and 13 euro-area countries lack any domestic digital payment alternative. Even where domestic card schemes exist, they depend on partnerships with international networks to process cross-border transactions within the eurozone. When these networks suspended operations in Russia after the Ukraine invasion, it crystallized for many the vulnerability of depending on foreign financial infrastructure. In a recent open letter, 70 European academics—including Thomas Piketty, Daniela Gabor, and Paul De Grauwe—urged policymakers to embrace the digital euro's full potential, warning that political negotiations risked hollowing out a project essential for European sovereignty.

Against this backdrop, EU banks have mounted a counterargument. They contend that a central-bank-issued digital euro would be counterproductive to private European payment solutions already in development. Wero, a mobile payment scheme launched by the European Payments Initiative in 2024, is the most notable example. Backed by 16 major private European PSPs, Wero has enrolled over 40 million users and aims to offer a pan-European alternative to card networks. The banks' implicit message is clear: let private enterprise solve Europe's payment sovereignty problem. These concerns have reverberated in the European Parliament. Fernando Navarrete Rojas, the rapporteur coordinating the legislative process, presented a draft report in November 2025 that departs significantly from the European Commission's original proposal. His approach would establish an offline digital euro—a token-based version enabling device-to-device payments without network connectivity—immediately, while conditioning the online version on finding that no suitable private pan-European payment solution exists.

Both sides of this debate, however, share a common blind spot: they assume that European policymakers have more freedom to shape digital payment markets than international trade law actually permits. A missing piece in the conversation is the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which obligates World Trade Organization (WTO) members, including all EU states, to grant market access to foreign providers of electronic payment services on the same terms as domestic firms. Creating the digital euro, however ambitiously designed, does not exempt Europe from its trade obligations. While EU members' GATS commitments in electronic payment services vary by mode and member state, they are sufficiently broad that payment schemes and applications fall within their coverage. Legitimate control over digital money does not extend to foreclosing the competitive markets above it.

The analytical framework I developed in a recent ProMarket article applies directly here. Payment systems operate on a four-layer stack: money (layer one), settlement infrastructure (layer two), payment schemes (layer three), and applications (layer four). For CBDCs, the first two layers collapse: the currency exists as entries in the central bank's ledger, placing it within monetary sovereignty and beyond trade commitments. But here is the critical point: the scheme rules and wallet applications are not constitutive of the money. They are commercial layers built on top of the monetary infrastructure. A CBDC balance recorded on the central bank's ledger could, in principle, be accessed through different competing schemes or wallet applications, just as a bank deposit can be accessed through Visa or Mastercard. When the central bank designs rules for how users access the digital currency, or when it determines which PSPs may offer wallets, it is making commercial and regulatory choices, not exercising core monetary functions.The ECB's proposal fuses the digital euro as money and the infrastructure recording and settling balances (layers one and two), creates a unified payment scheme governed by a common rulebook (layer three), and regulates distribution through authorized wallets (layer four). By opting for a structure where PSPs distribute the digital euro to the public, the ECB implicitly recognizes that scheme- and application-layer competition is architecturally feasible. The wholesale CBDC infrastructure will be a sovereign monopoly—rightly so—but nothing in that design requires excluding private firms from setting up alternative payment schemes or offering competing wallet services.

However, while framing this as an “open” architecture permitting voluntary integration with private schemes, the ECB's“Fit of the digital euro in the payment ecosystem” report asserts that “mandatory acceptance of the digital euro is the only way to ensure that these standards are implemented across the entire market.” The Eurosystem will also bear all scheme and processing costs, charging no fees to participants. The report acknowledges the tension these options create: PSPs stand “in stark contrast with the ECB perspective,” arguing that, “where domestic card schemes still enjoy a strong market position, the digital euro is more likely to disincentivize the development of those solutions.” An architecture is not “open” when participation is legally compelled.

The ECB's design choices directly invoke two core disciplines of trade law. The first is market access (GATS Article XVI): will private payment schemes, domestic or foreign, be permitted to operate at all, or will the digital euro's mandatory acceptance by merchants and zero scheme fees de facto foreclose competition? The second is national treatment (GATS Article XVII): even if private providers are permitted to participate, will foreign schemes and applications face equal conditions, or will the system's design advantage European service providers?

On market access, the digital euro creates a dual barrier that affects all competing schemes equally, European and foreign. Merchants must accept it by law, ensuring universal reach. And the Eurosystem will bear all scheme and processing costs, a subsidy the ECB likens to banknote production. But the analogy is misapplied. There is no scheme layer between banknotes and users.

Jean-Paul Thorbjornsen is a leader of THORChain, a blockchain that is not supposed to have any leaders—and is reeling from a series of expensive controversies.

“We're out of airspace now. We can do whatever we want,” Jean-Paul Thorbjornsen tells me from the pilot's seat of his Aston Martin helicopter. As we fly over suburbs outside Melbourne, Australia, it's becoming clear that doing whatever he wants is Thorbjornsen's MO. 

Upper-middle-class homes give way to vineyards, and Thorbjornsen points out our landing spot outside a winery. People visiting for lunch walk outside. “They're going to ask for a shot now,” he says, used to the attention drawn by his luxury helicopter, emblazoned with the tail letters “BTC” for bitcoin (the price tag of $5 million in Australian dollars—$3.5 million in US dollars today—was perhaps reasonable for someone who claims a previous crypto project made more than AU$400 million, although he also says those funds were tied up in the company). 

Thorbjornsen is a founder of THORChain, a blockchain through which users can swap one cryptocurrency for another and earn fees from making those swaps. THORChain is permissionless, so anyone can use it without getting prior approval from a centralized authority. As a decentralized network, the blockchain is built and run by operators located across the globe, most of whom use pseudonyms. 

During its early days, Thorbjornsen himself hid behind the pseudonym “leena” and used an AI-generated female image as his avatar. But around March 2024, he revealed that he, an Australian man in his mid-30s, with a rural Catholic upbringing, was the mind behind the blockchain. More or less. 

If there is a central question around THORChain, it is this: Exactly who is responsible for its operations? Blockchains as decentralized as THORChain are supposed to offer systems that operate outside the centralized leadership of corruptible governments and financial institutions. If a few people have outsize sway over this decentralized network—one of a handful that operate at such a large scale—it's one more blemish on the legacy of bitcoin's promise, which has already been tarnished by capitalistic political frenzy.   

Who's responsible for THORChain matters because in January last year, its users lost more than $200 million worth of their cryptocurrency in US dollars after THORChain transactions and accounts were frozen by a singular admin override, which users believed was not supposed to be possible given the decentralized structure. When the freeze was lifted, some users raced to pull their money out. The following month, a team of North Korean hackers known as the Lazarus Group used THORChain to move roughly $1.2 billion of stolen ethereum taken in the infamous hack of the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit. 

Thorbjornsen explains away THORChain's inability to stop the movement of stolen funds, or prevent a bank run, as a function of its decentralized and permissionless nature. The lack of executive powers means that anyone can use the network for any reason, and arguably there's no one to hold accountable when even the worst goes down.

But when the worst did go down, nearly everyone in the THORChain community, and those paying attention to it in channels like X, pointed their fingers at Thorbjornsen. A lawsuit filed by the THORChain creditors who lost millions in January 2025 names him. A former FBI analyst and North Korea specialist, reflecting on the potential repercussions for helping move stolen funds, told me he wouldn't want to be in Thorbjornsen's shoes.

THORChain was designed to make decisions based on votes by node operators, where two-thirds majority rules.

That's why I traveled to Australia—to see if I could get a handle on where he sees himself and his role in relation to the network he says he founded.

According to Thorbjornsen, he should not be held responsible for either event. THORChain was designed to make decisions based on votes by node operators—people with the computer power, and crypto stake, to run a cluster of servers that process the network's transactions. In those votes, a two-thirds majority rules.

Then there's the permissionless part. Anyone can use THORChain to make swaps, which is why it's been a popular way for widely sanctioned entities such as the government of North Korea to move stolen money. This principle goes back to the cypherpunk roots of bitcoin, a currency that operates outside of nation-states' rules. THORChain is designed to avoid geopolitical entanglements; that's what its users like about it.

But there are distinct financial motivations for moving crypto, stolen or not: Node operators earn fees from the funds running through the network. In theory, this incentivizes them to act in the network's best interests—and, arguably, Thorbjornsen's interests too, as many assume his wealth is tied to the network's profits. (Thorbjornsen says it is not, and that it comes instead from “many sources,” including “buying bitcoin back in 2013.”)

Now recent events have raised critical questions, not just about Thorbjornsen's outsize role in THORChain's operations, but also about the blockchain's underlying nature.

If THORChain is decentralized, how was a single operator able to freeze its funds a month before the Bybit hack? Could someone have unilaterally decided to stop the stolen Bybit funds from coming through the network, and chosen not to? 

Thorbjornsen insists THORChain is helping realize bitcoin's original purpose of enabling anyone to transact freely outside the reach of purportedly corrupt governments. Yet the network's problems suggest that an alternative financial system might not be much better.

On February 21, 2025, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou got an alarming call from the company's chief financial officer. About $1.5 billion US of the exchange's ethereum token, ETH, had been stolen. 

The FBI attributed the theft to the Lazarus Group. Typically, criminals will want to convert ETH to bitcoin, which is much easier to convert in turn to cash. Knowing this, the FBI issued a public service announcement on February 26 to “exchanges, bridges … and other virtual asset service providers,” encouraging them to block transactions from accounts related to the hack. 

Someone posted that announcement in THORChain's private, invite-only developer channel on Discord, a chat app used widely by software engineers and gamers. While other crypto exchanges and bridges (which facilitate transactions across different blockchains) heeded the warning, THORChain's node operators, developers, and invested insiders debated about whether or not to close the trading gates, a decision requiring a majority vote.

“Civil war is a very strong term, but there was a strong rift in the community,” says Boone Wheeler, a US-based crypto enthusiast. In 2021, Wheeler purchased some rune, THORChain's Norse-mythology-themed native token, and he has been paid to write articles about the network to help advertise it. The rift formed “between people who wanted to stay permissionless,” he says, “and others who wanted to blacklist the funds.”

Wheeler, who says he doesn't run a node or code for THORChain, fell on the side of remaining permissionless. However, others spoke up for blocking the transfers. THORChain, they argued, wasn't decentralized enough to keep those running the network safe from law enforcement—especially when those operators were identifiable by their IP addresses, some based in the US.

“We are not the morality police,” someone with the username @Swing_Pop wrote on February 27 in the developer Discord.

THORChain's design includes up to 120 nodes whose operators manage transactions on the network through a voting process. Anyone with hosting hardware can become an operator by funding nodes with rune as collateral, which provides the network with liquidity. Nodes can respond to a transaction by validating it or doing nothing. While individual transactions can't be blocked, trading can be halted by a two-thirds majority vote. 

Nodes are also penalized for not participating in voting, which the system labels as “bad behavior.” Every 2.5 days, THORChain automatically “churns” nodes out to ensure that no one node gains too much control. The nodes that chose not to validate transactions from the Bybit hack were automatically “churned” out of the system. Thorbjornsen says about 20 or 30 nodes were booted from the network in this way. (Node operators can run multiple nodes, and 120 are rarely running simultaneously; at the time of writing, 55 unique IDs operated 103 nodes.)

By February 27, some node operators were prepared to leave the network altogether. “It's personally getting beyond my risk tolerance,” wrote @Runetard in the dev Discord. “Sorry to those of the community that feel otherwise. There are a bunch of us holding all the risk and some are getting ready to walk away.”

Even so, the financial incentive for the network operators who remained was significant. As one member of the dev Discord put it earlier that day, $3 million had been “extracted as commission” from the theft by those operating THORChain. “This is wrong!” they wrote.

Thorbjornsen weighed in on this back-and-forth, during which nodes paused and unpaused the network. He now says there was a right and wrong way for node operators to have behaved. “The correct way of doing things,” he says, was for node operators who opposed processing stolen funds to “go offline and … get [themselves] kicked out” rather than try to police who could use THORChain. He also says that while operators could discuss stopping transactions, “there was simply no design in the code that allowed [them] to do that.” However, a since-deleted post from his personal X account on March 3, 2025, stated: “I pushed for all my nodes to unhalt trading [keep trading]. Threatened to yank bond if they didn't comply. Every single one.” (Thorbjornsen says his social media team ran this account in 2025.) 

In an Australian 7 News Spotlight documentary last June, Thorbjornsen estimated that THORChain earned between $5 million and $10 million from the heist.

When asked in that same documentary if he received any of those fees, he replied, “Not directly.” When we spoke, I asked him to elaborate. He said he's “not a recipient” of any funds THORChain sets aside for developers or marketers, nor does he operate any nodes. He was merely speaking generally, he told me: “All crypto holders profit indirectly off economic activity on any chain.”

Most important to Thorbjornsen was that, despite “huge pressure to shut the protocol down and stop servicing these swaps,” THORChain chugged along. He also notes that the hackers' tactics, moving fast and splitting funds across multiple addresses, made it difficult to identify “bad swaps.”

Blockchain experts like Nick Carlsen, a former FBI analyst at the blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs, don't buy this assessment. Other services similar to THORChain were identifying and rejecting these transactions. Had THORChain done the same, Carlsen adds, the stolen funds could have been contained on the Ethereum network, which “would have basically denied North Korea the ability to kick off this laundering process.” 

And while THORChain touts its decentralization, in “practical applications” like the Lazarus Group's theft, “most de-fi [decentralized finance] protocols are centralized,” says Daren Firestone, an attorney who represents crypto industry whistleblowers, citing a 2023 US Treasury Department risk assessment on illicit finance. 

With centralization comes culpability, and in these cases, Firestone adds, that comes down to “who profits from [the protocol], so who creates it? But most importantly, who controls it?” Is there someone who can “hit an emergency off switch? … Direct nodes?”

Many answer these questions with Thorbjornsen's name. “Everyone likes to pass the blame,” he says, even though he wasn't alone in building THORChain. “​​In the end, it all comes back to me anyway.”

According to Thorbjornsen, his story goes like this.

The third of 10 homeschooled children in a “traditional” Catholic household in rural Australia, he spent his days learning math, reading, writing, and studying the Bible. As he got older, he was also responsible for instructing his younger siblings. Wednesday was his day to move the solar panels that powered their home. His parents “installed” a mango and citrus orchard, more to keep nine boys busy than to reap the produce, he says.

“We lived close to a local airfield,” Thorbjornsen says, “and I was always mesmerized by these planes.” He joined the Australian air force and studied engineering, but he says the military left him feeling like “a square peg in a round hole.” He adds that doing things his own way got him frequently “pulled aside” by superiors.

“That's when I started looking elsewhere,” he says, and in 2013, he found bitcoin. It appealed because it existed “outside the system.”

During the 2017 crypto bull run, Thorbjornsen raised AU$12 million in an initial coin offering for CanYa, a decentralized marketplace he cofounded. CanYa ultimately “died” in 2018, and Thorbjornsen pivoted to a “decentralized liquidity” project that would become THORChain.

He worked with a couple of different developer teams, and then, in 2019, he clicked with an American developer, Chad Barraford, at a hackathon in Germany. Barraford (who declined to be interviewed for this story) was an early public face of THORChain. 

Around this time, Thorbjornsen says, “a couple of us helped manage the payroll and early investment funds.” In a 2020 interview, Kai Ansaari, identified as a THORChain “project lead,” wrote, “We're all contributors … There's no real ‘lead,' ‘CEO,' ‘founder,' etc.”

In interviews conducted since he came out from behind the “leena” account in 2024, Thorbjornsen has positioned himself as a key lead. He now says his plan had always been to hand over the account, along with command powers and control of THORChain social media accounts, once the blockchain had matured enough to realize its promise of decentralization.

In 2021, he says, he started this process, first by ceasing to use his own rune to back node operators who didn't have enough to supply their own funding (this can be a way to influence node votes without operating a node yourself). That year, the protocol suffered multiple hacks that resulted in millions of dollars in losses. Nine Realms, a US-incorporated coding company, was brought on to take over THORChain's development. Thorbjornsen says he passed “leena” over to “other community members” and “left crypto” in 2021, selling “a bunch of bitcoin” and buying the helicopter. 

Despite this crypto departure, he came back onto the scene with gusto in 2024 when he revealed himself as the operator of the “leena” account. “​​For many years, I stayed private because I didn't want the attention,” he says now. 

By early 2024 Thorbjornsen considered the network to be sufficiently decentralized and began advertising it publicly. He started regularly posting videos on his TikTok and YouTube channels (“Two sick videos every week,” in the words of one caption) that showed him piloting his helicopter wearing shirts that read “Thor.”

By November 2024, Thorbjornsen, who describes himself as “a bit flamboyant,” was calling himself THORChain's CEO (“chief energy officer”) and the “master of the memes” in a video from Binance Blockchain Week, an industry conference in Dubai. You need “strong memetic energy,” he says in the video, “to create the community, to create the cult.” Cults imply centralized leadership, and since outing himself as “leena,” Thorbjornsen has publicly appeared to helm the project, with one interviewer deeming him the “THORChain Satoshi” (an allusion to the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin). 

One consequence of going public as a face of the protocol: He's received death threats. “I stirred it up. Do I regret it? Who knows?” he said when we met in Australia. “It's caused a lot of chaos.” 

But, he added, “this is the bed that I've laid.” When we spoke again, months later, he backtracked, saying he “got sucked into” defending THORChain in 2024 and 2025 because he was involved from 2018 to 2021 and has “a perspective on how the protocol operates.”

Ryan Treat, a retired US Army veteran, woke up one morning in January 2025 to some disturbing activity on X. “My heart sank,” he says. THORFi, the THORChain program he'd used to earn interest on the bitcoin he'd planned to save for his retirement, had frozen all accounts—but that didn't make sense.

THORFi featured a lending and saving program said to give users “complete control” and self-custody of their crypto, meaning they could withdraw it at any time. 

Treat was no crypto amateur. He bought his first bitcoin at around “$5 apiece,” he says, and had always kept it off centralized exchanges that would maintain custody of his wallets. He liked THORChain because it claimed to be decentralized and permissionless. “I got into bitcoin because I wanted to have government-less money,” he says. 

We were told it was decentralized. Then you wake up one morning and read this guy had an admin mimir.

Many who'd used THORFi lending and saving programs felt similarly. Users I interviewed differentiated THORChain from centralized lending platforms like BlockFi and Celsius, both of which offered extraordinarily high yields before filing for bankruptcy in 2022. “I viewed THORChain as a decentralized system where it was safer,” says Halsey Richartz, a Florida-based THORFi creditor, with “vanilla, 1% passive yield.” Indeed, users I spoke with hadn't felt the need to monitor their THORFi deposits. “Only your key can be used to withdraw your funds,” the product's marketing materials insisted. “Savers can withdraw their position to native assets at any time.”

So on January 9, when the “leena” account announced that an admin key had been used to pause withdrawals, it took THORFi users by surprise—and seemed to contradict the marketing messaging around decentralization. “We were told that it was decentralized, and you wake up one morning and read an article that says ‘This guy, JP, had an admin mimir,'” says Treat, referring to Thorbjornsen, “and I'm like, ‘What the fuck is an admin mimir?'”

The admin mimir was one of “a bunch of hard-coded admin keys built into the base code of the system,” says Jonathan Reiter, CEO of the blockchain intelligence company ChainArgos. Those with access to the keys had the ability to make executive decisions on the blockchain—a function many THORChain users didn't realize could supersede the more democratic decisions made by node votes. These keys had been in THORChain's code for years and “let you control just about anything,” Reiter adds, including the decision to pause the network during the hacks in 2021 that resulted in a loss of more than $16 million in assets. 

Thorbjornsen says that one key was given to Nine Realms, while another was “shared around the original team.” He told me at least three people had them, adding, “I can neither confirm nor deny having access to that mimir key, because there's no on-chain registry of the keys.”

Regardless of who had access, Thorbjornsen maintains that the admin mimir mechanism was “widely known within the community, and heavily used throughout THORChain's history” and that any action taken using the keys “could be largely overruled by the nodes.” Indeed, nodes voted to open withdrawals back up shortly after the admin key was used to pause them. By then, those burned by THORFi argue, the damage had already been done. The executive pause to withdrawals, for some, signaled that something was amiss with THORFi. This led to a bank run after the pause was lifted, until the nodes voted to freeze withdrawals permanently (which Thorbjornsen had suggested in a since-deleted post on X), separating users from crypto worth around $200 million in US dollars on January 23. THORFi users were then offered a token called TCY (THORChain Yield), which they could claim with the idea that, when its price rose to $1, they would be made whole. (The price, as of writing, sits at $0.16.)

Who used the key? Thorbjornsen maintains he didn't do it, but he claims he knows who did and won't say. He says he'd handed over the “leena” account and doesn't “have access to any of the core components of the system,” nor has he for “at least three years.” He implies that whoever controlled “leena” at the time used the admin key to pause network withdrawals.

A video released by Nine Realms on February 20, 2025, names Thorbjornsen as the activator of the key, stating, “JP ended up pausing lenders and savers, preventing withdrawals so that we can work out … [a] payback plan on them.” Thorbjornsen told me the video was “not factual.”

Multiple blockchain analysts told me it would be extremely difficult to determine who used the admin mimir key. A month after it was used to pause the network, THORChain said the key had been “removed from the network.” At least you can't find the words “admin mimir” in THORChain's base code; I've looked. 

After the debacle of the THORFi withdrawal freeze, Richartz says, he tried to file reports with the Miami-Dade Police Department, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and Interpol. When we spoke in November, he still hadn't been able to file with the city of Miami. They told him to try small claims court.

“I was like, no, you don't understand … a post office box in Switzerland is the company address,” he says. “It underscored to me how little law enforcement even knows about these crimes.” 

As for the Bybit hack, at least one government has retaliated against those who facilitate blockchain projects. Last April German authorities shut down eXch, an exchange suspected of using THORChain to process funds Lazarus stole from Bybit, says Julia Gottesman, cofounder and head of investigations at the cybersecurity group zeroShadow. Australia, she adds, where Thorbjornsen was based, has been “slow to try to engage with the crypto community, or any regulations.”

In response to requests for comment, Australia's Department of Home Affairs wrote that at the end of March 2026, the country's regulatory powers will expand to include “exchanges between the same type of cryptocurrency and transfers between different types.” They did not comment on specific investigations.

Crypto and finance experts disagree about whether THORChain engaged in money laundering, defined by the UN as “the processing of criminal proceeds to disguise their illegal origin.” But some think it fits the definition.

Shlomit Wagman, a Harvard fellow and former head of Israel's anti-money-laundering agency and its delegation to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), thinks the Bybit activity was money laundering because THORChain helped the hackers “transfer the funds in an unsupervised manner, completely outside of the scope of regulated or supervised activity.” 

And by helping with conversions, Carlsen says, THORChain enabled bad actors to turn stolen crypto into usable currency. “People like [Thorbjornsen] have a personal degree of culpability in sustaining the North Korean government,” he says. Thorbjornsen counters that THORChain is “open-source infrastructure.”

Meanwhile, just days after the hack, Bybit issued a 10% bounty on any funds recovered. As of mid-January this year, between $100 million and $500 million worth of those funds in US dollars remain unaccounted for, according to Gottesman of zeroShadow, which was hired by Bybit to recover funds following the hack.

For Thorbjornsen, it's just another day at the casino. That's the comparison he made during his regrettable 7 News Spotlight interview about the Bybit heist, and he repeated it when we met. “You go to a casino, you play a few games, you expect to lose,” he told me. “When you do actually go to zero, don't cry.”

Thorbjornsen, it should be noted, has lost at the casino himself.

In September, he says, he got a Telegram message from a friend, inviting him to a Zoom meeting. He accepted and participated in a call with people who had “American voices.”

Ultimately, Thorbjornsen describes himself as a guy who's had a bad year, fending off “threat vectors” left and right.

After the meeting, Thorbjornsen learned that his friend's Telegram had been hacked. Whoever was responsible had used the Zoom link to remotely install software on Thorbjornsen's computer, which “got access to everything”—his email, his crypto wallets, a bitcoin-based retirement fund. It cost him at least $1.2 million. The blockchain sleuth known as ZachXBT traced the funds and attributed the hack to North Korea. 

ZachXBT called it “poetic.”

Ultimately, Thorbjornsen describes himself as a guy who's had a bad year. He says he had to liquidate his crypto assets because he's dealing with the fallout of a recent divorce. He also feels he is fending off “threat vectors” left and right. More than once, he asked if I was a private investigator masquerading as a journalist.

Still, his many contradictions don't inspire confidence. He doesn't have any more crypto assets, he says. However, the crypto wallet he shared with me so I could pay him back for lunch showed that it contained assets worth more than $143,000 in US dollars. He now says it wasn't his wallet. He says he doesn't control THORChain's social media, but he'd also told me that he runs the @THORChain X account (later backtracking and saying the account is “delegated” to him for trickier questions).

He insists that he does not care about money. He says that in the robot future, the AI-powered hive mind will become our benevolent overlord, rendering money obsolete, so why give it much thought? Yet as we flew back from the vineyard, he pointed out his new house from the helicopter. It resembles a compound. He says he lives there with his new wife. 

Multiple people I spoke with about Thorbjornsen before I met him warned me he wasn't trustworthy, and he's undeniably made fishy statements. For instance, the presence of a North Korean flag in a row of decals on the tail of his helicopter suggested an affinity with the country for which THORChain has processed so much crypto. Thorbjornsen insists he had requested the flag of Australia's Norfolk Island, calling the mix-up “a complete coincidence.” The flags were gone by the time of our flight, apparently removed during a recent repair.

“Money is a meme,” he says. “Money does not exist.” Meme or not, it's had real repercussions for those who have interacted with THORChain, and those who wound up losing have been looking for someone to blame. 

When I spoke with Thorbjornsen again in January, he appeared increasingly concerned that he is that someone. He's spending more time in Singapore, he told me. Singapore happens to have historically denied extraditions to the US for money-laundering prosecutions.

Crypto is the forgotten middle child of tech right now, sandwiched in between AI labs and vertical AI startups. Despite small glimmers of hope for blockchain technology, from continued hype around stablecoins to sustained hope for market structure legislation, sentiment is at an all-time low, especially because there's no easy villain like Gary Gensler or Sam Bankman-Fried to blame for sinking prices. 

Amid the winter, the blockchain venture firm Dragonfly Capital managed to close its $650 million fourth fund, avoiding the “mass extinction event” suffered by its peers, as general partner Rob Hadick put it. The simple reason for its success is timely investments into a number of category winners that convinced its backers to re-up the war chest, including Polymarket and the stablecoin card issuer Rain. But beneath that is a years-long belief that crypto would be hurtling toward Wall Street, and not toward a Web3 version of the internet that other VCs saw in the glimmering future. 

Dragonfly began in 2018 as a partnership between Alex Pack, then leading crypto deals for Bain Capital Ventures, and Bo Feng, a veteran of the early Chinese internet ecosystem. The firm had a rocky first few years, including a breakup with Pack that has become lore in blockchain VC circles, as well as an abandonment of China amid the government's crypto crackdown. But led by Haseeb Qureshi and Tom Schmidt, Dragonfly built a name for itself as one of the top investors in the space. After Hadick came over from the traditional finance side in 2022, though, Dragonfly shifted its focus, realizing that crypto was quickly converging with fintech. 

Schmidt told me that crypto is going through “the biggest meta shift” he has experienced during his time in the industry, as investors realize that there will be fewer native tokens for apps—the previous model for crypto VCs—and more tokens that represent real-world assets like stocks and private credit funds. 

Is this a comedown for blockchain technology, which began as a rebellion against Wall Street and governmental control of global finance? Probably. But even as crypto loses its sheen, Schmidt says it's important to not lose sight of the bigger picture, which is that digital internet money has gone from “zero to a trillion dollars in 10 years.”

Vitalik Buterin is speaking up about privacy. The Ethereum co-founder recently shared a blog post about Iran's surveillance state. 

He used it to make a broader point about freedom and technology. His comments come as tensions between the US and Iran are heating up fast. The crypto world is now paying close attention.

Buterin says freedom advocates are making a mistake. They call surveillance “dystopian” and stop there. To him, that is not enough. 

Calling something dystopian sounds like an aesthetic complaint, not a real argument. He wants people to understand the actual harm.

This is a good post on the impact of surveillance in Iran:https://t.co/TzSqUE2JOo

It's worth reading.

IMO one mistake that freedom advocates often make is that we talk about privacy violation and surveillance as ""dystopian"", using the word as a semantic stop sign: we know it…

He wrote on X that surveillance shifts the power balance between individuals and the state. Governments with total surveillance can stay in power forever. They only need a small group of loyalists with weapons and technology.

 He referenced “The Dictator's Handbook” to explain this. Small coalition governments, he noted, are the most dangerous kind.

Buterin sees privacy technology as part of the solution. He also supports building censorship-resistant internet access. 

He called basic internet, around 1 Mbps, a global human right. In his view, it should sit outside nation-state control. Crypto tools that protect privacy can reduce the risk of total government control.

He did not spare Western governments either. Buterin pointed out that US and Israeli tech companies also run surveillance operations. 

The difference, he argued, is the scope. Iran, Russia, and China focus on deep control within their borders. Western surveillance is broader but spreads across the globe. Both types pose serious threats to individual freedom.

The war talk is now rattling financial markets. The Kobeissi Letter reported on X that Axios revealed evidence of an imminent US-Iran conflict. 

Israel is reportedly preparing for war within days. The expected campaign would be far larger than recent operations. The US has moved two aircraft carriers, 12 warships, and hundreds of fighter jets to the region.

Over 150 military cargo flights have already moved weapons to the Middle East. Another 50 fighter jets, including F-35s and F-22s, arrived within 24 hours. 

Oil prices jumped above $64 per barrel on the news. War in a major oil-producing region tends to shake global markets hard. Crypto is no exception.

BREAKING: Axios reports that there is evidence that US war with Iran is ""imminent"" and Israel is preparing for a scenario of ""war within days,"" which is expected to include:

1. Weeks-long ""full-fledged"" war unlike the Venezuela operation, sources say

2. Joint US-Israeli…

Historically, geopolitical crises push investors toward safe-haven assets. Gold typically rises during conflict. Bitcoin has increasingly played a similar role in some portfolios. 

A prolonged US-Iran war could drive more interest in decentralized assets. Investors looking to escape traditional financial instability sometimes turn to crypto.

At the same time, market fear can trigger sell-offs across all asset classes, including crypto. The outcome is never guaranteed. What is clear is that the combination of war risk and growing surveillance concerns gives Buterin's message more urgency.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says bitcoin's BTC$68,168.18 recent 52% crash from its October all-time high is flashing a critical warning signal — but the crypto could ultimately soar to new records once the Federal Reserve responds to an AI-driven banking crisis he believes is imminent.

In his latest essay, ""This Is Fine,"" Hayes argued that bitcoin's divergence from traditional tech stocks reveals its role as the ""global fiat liquidity fire alarm."" While the Nasdaq has remained relatively flat, bitcoin has plunged from $126,000 to its current $67,000, pricing in what Hayes describes as a massive credit destruction event that equity markets have yet to acknowledge.

""Bitcoin is the most responsive freely traded asset to the fiat credit supply,"" Hayes wrote. ""The divergence recently between bitcoin and the Nasdaq sounds the alarm that a massive credit destruction event is nigh.""

Hayes models a scenario where artificial intelligence displaces just 20% of America's 72.1 million knowledge workers, triggering approximately $557 billion in consumer credit and mortgage defaults — about half the severity of the 2008 financial crisis. This AI-driven shock would devastate regional banks and force the Federal Reserve into ""the biggest money printing in history,"" he predicts.

""Deflation is bad, but ultimately good for fiat credit-sensitive assets like Bitcoin,"" said Hayes. ""First, the market prices the impact ... Then ... the monetary mandarins panic and press that Brrrr button harder than I shred pow the morning after a one-meter dump.""

Hayes noted gold's recent gains, particularly against bitcoin, as another red flag, stating that ""a surging gold versus a slumping Bitcoin clearly tells us that a deflationary risk-off credit event within Pax Americana is brewing.""

Hayes said that once the Fed intervenes with emergency liquidity measures — similar to the March 2023 response to regional bank failures — bitcoin will ""pump decisively off its lows"" and the expectation of sustained money printing will drive it to new all-time highs.

That doesn't mean there won't be more pain ahead for the foreseeable future, said Hayes. He warned bitcoin could fall further before the Fed acts, potentially breaking below $60,000 as political dysfunction delays the central bank's response. Crypto investors, he advised, should stay liquid, avoid leverage, and ""wait for the all-clear from the Fed that it's time to dump filthy fiat and ape into risky assets with wanton abandon.""

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to hold billions in assets despite bitcoin's brutal price crash, but that staying power isn't necessarily the bullish signal that many have come to believe.

According to one analyst, the resilience stems from market makers and arbitrageurs who trade in and out rather than die-hard long-term holders betting on price appreciation.

Bitcoin's BTC$68,168.18 price peaked above $126,000 in early October and recently crashed to nearly $60,000. Despite the price halving, the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S. have cumulatively registered just $8.5 billion in net outflows. These funds still hold $85 billion in assets under management, which equates to over 6% of bitcoin's supply.

Several analysts, including those CoinDesk spoke with at Consensus Hong Kong last week, cited the same data as evidence of bullish positioning.

Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, says the resilience comes not just from long-term hodlers, but from market makers and arbitrageurs with hedged, non-directional positions.

""This reflects the structural nature of ETF ownership, which is dominated by market makers and arbitrage-focused hedge funds holding largely hedged positions, as well as long-term institutional investors with low turnover and longer investment horizons,"" Thielen said in a note to clients on Wednesday.

Thielen pointed to reports from institutions (called 13F filings) for late 2025. They show that 55% to 75% of BlackRock's IBIT ETF, which holds $61 billion, is owned by market makers and arbitrage-focused hedge funds who keep their bets hedged or neutral, not truly bullish on bitcoin.

Market makers are entities that create liquidity in an exchange's order book, facilitating the seamless execution of large buy and sell orders at stable prices. They profit from the bid-ask spread and therefore strive to maintain market-neutral exposure to bypass price volatility risks. Similarly, arbitrage hedge funds take opposing positions in two markets, such as spot ETFs and futures, to profit from the price differential between the two.

Both entities, therefore, do not inject directional pressures (bullish/bearish) into the market.

Thielen added that market makers trimmed exposure by around $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion during the fourth quarter, as bitcoin traded near $88,000, reflecting ""declining speculative demand and reduced arbitrage inventory requirements.""

Identifying vulnerabilities is good for public safety, industry, and the scientists making these models.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

In a new paper that's making waves, scientists from Stanford, Cal Tech, and Carleton College have combined existing research with new ideas to look at the reasoning failures of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude. Those who rely on LLMs for intellectual labor often cite the models' reasoning ability as a major draw, despite the evidence that this ability is limited, even when dealing with simple questions. So, what's the truth of the matter?

First, a quick primer. One of the major lines of criticism leveled by today's AI skeptics goes something like this: large language models work much like your phone's autocomplete—spicy autocomplete, so to speak. But there are significant differences. LLMs come with a much longer attention span and a much larger computer system than your phone's messaging app does. It comes down to data and processing power. Huge portions of the public internet, books, magazines, academic journals—whatever is most relevant to a particular model—are transformed into code that then organizes everything into complicated lists. Furthermore, while computing in general is not like the human brain almost at all, LLMs have something in common with the way we humans think. When a prompt is received, both your brain and an LLM travel many possible paths and strike a bunch of clusters of ideas before using logic to pull together a response. We may think of computers as doing binary arithmetic, but LLMs start with college-level linear and matrix algebra, and only get more complicated from there.

All of this math behind the curtain can give the impression that an LLM is thinking or sentient, but it is not. An LLM is, however, capable of certain types of associative reasoning—a technical and philosophical term meaning that it can consider information and apply logic to draw a conclusion. Yet, as the new research paper's authors make clear, there are limits. “Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios.” 

In their review—which is available now on the preprint site arXiv, as well as through the online resource Transactions on Machine Learning Research—the scientists categorized LLM reasoning failures and picked out common categories of errors, some of which are listed below. (You can also find a link to their repository of compiled references and research here.) 

The news sounds bad (and it is), but identifying weaknesses and working to mitigate them is key to developing any model or product. The failings of today's LLMs may be instructive for building better artificial intelligence architectures in the future. For example, the scientists pointed out architecture and training as an area for feasible large improvements: “[R]oot cause analyses in those categories are particularly rich, suggesting meaningful methods not only for mitigating the specific failures, but for generally improving the architecture and our understanding of it.” In other words, large language models are great for lots of things, but they're not the path to artificial general intelligence.

The scientists also suggested some field-wide structures for improvement:

1. Root cause analysis across all the types of reasoning failures that LLMs display.

2. Unified, persistent failure benchmarks for all types of reasoning failures; “Such benchmarks should preserve historically challenging cases while incorporating newly discovered ones.”

3. Failure-injection principles, applied “by adding adversarial sections, multi-level task difficulty, or cross-domain compositions designed to trigger known weaknesses.”

4. “[D]ynamic and event-driven benchmarks could combat overfitting and encourage continual improvement.”

“Overall,” the researchers concluded, “the systematic study of reasoning failures in LLMs parallels fault-tolerance research in early computing and incident analysis in safety-critical industries: understanding and categorizing failure is a prerequisite for building resilient systems.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Viagra and shingles vaccine show surprising promise against Alzheimer's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260217005759.htm","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 12:04:07 GMT","

Researchers have pinpointed three already approved medications that may be repurposed to treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease. Instead of starting from scratch, scientists examined medicines that are currently used for other conditions to see whether any could help protect the brain.

The study, funded by Alzheimer's Society and led by the University of Exeter, was published in Alzheimer's Research and Therapy. Among the drugs reviewed, a shingles vaccine (Zostavax) emerged as the most promising candidate. Viagra (sildenafil) and a medication used to treat motor neurone disease (riluzole) also showed strong potential.

Why Drug Repurposing Matters

Dementia is the leading cause of death in the UK, affecting around one million people. One in three people born today will develop dementia in their lifetime -- yet there is still no cure.

Creating brand new drugs can take 10 to 15 years and cost billions of pounds -- with no guarantee of success. Repurposing medicines that are already approved and widely used could provide a faster, safer, and more affordable path toward new Alzheimer's treatments.

This work was also supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), the Exeter Biomedical Research Centre, and the NIHR HealthTech Research Centre in Brain Health.

How the Top Alzheimer's Candidates Were Chosen

An international group of 21 dementia specialists from universities, hospitals, and the pharmaceutical industry, along with people affected by dementia, evaluated 80 existing medications. Their goal was to identify which ones showed the greatest promise for treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for more than half of all dementia diagnoses.

After multiple rounds of review, the panel agreed on three 'priority candidates' for further research. Each drug was selected because it targets biological processes linked to Alzheimer's, has shown encouraging results in cell and animal studies, and is considered safe for use in older adults.

The three priority drugs are:

Shingles Vaccine Shows Strongest Signal

Experts are now calling for clinical trials to determine whether these medications truly benefit people who have Alzheimer's or are at risk of developing it.

Among the three, the shingles vaccine stood out. It requires no more than two doses and has a long record of safety. Previous research suggests that people who received the vaccine were about 16% less likely to develop dementia.

Researchers hope to launch a large UK clinical trial of the shingles vaccine, using the to track participants. PROTECT is an online registry in which volunteers complete annual questionnaires about their health and lifestyle and take part in brain health research.

Other Drugs Considered

Five additional medications were shortlisted but did not meet the criteria to be named 'priority candidates.' These included fingolimod (used in MS), vortioxetine (used to treat major depressive disorder), microlithium (used to treat depression), dasitinib (used for leukaemia), and cytisine (used in anesthetics).

Experts Urge Caution and Further Trials

Dr. Anne Corbett, Professor of Dementia Research at the University of Exeter, said: ""Beating dementia will take every avenue of research -- from using what we already know, to discovering new drugs to treat and prevent the condition.

""Drug repurposing is a vital part of that mix, helping us turn today's medicine for one condition, into tomorrow's treatment for another.

""It's important to stress that these drugs need further investigation before we will know whether they can be used to treat or prevent Alzheimer's. We now need to see robust clinical trials to understand their true value and know for certain if they are effective to treat or prevent Alzheimer's.""

Prof Fiona Carragher, Chief Policy and Research Officer at Alzheimer's Society, said: ""Dementia devastates lives, but we believe research will beat it.

""Years ago, we saw aspirin being repurposed from being a painkiller to helping people reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke. This is what we want to see in the field of dementia, and why we believe drug repurposing is one of the most exciting frontiers in dementia research.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","NASA fired three rockets into the northern lights and the results are stunning","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260217005738.htm","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 04:21:07 GMT","

NASA has successfully launched two sounding rocket missions from Alaska to investigate the powerful electrical forces behind the northern lights. The Black and Diffuse Auroral Science Surveyor and the Geophysical Non-Equilibrium Ionospheric System Science mission, known as GNEISS (pronounced ""nice""), both lifted off from the Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks.

The Black and Diffuse Auroral Science Surveyor launched Feb. 9 at 3:29 a.m. AKST (7:29 a.m. EST) and climbed to about 224 miles (360 kilometers). Principal investigator Marilia Samara reported that all instruments, including technology demonstrations, performed as planned and that the mission returned high-quality data.

The two-rocket GNEISS mission followed with a dramatic back-to-back launch on Feb. 10 at 1:19:00 a.m. and 1:19:30 a.m. AKST (5:19:00 a.m. and 5:19:30 a.m. EST). The rockets reached peak altitudes of approximately 198.3 miles (319.06 kilometers) and 198.8 miles (319.94 kilometers), respectively. Principal investigator Kristina Lynch said ground stations, subpayloads, and instrument booms all operated as expected, and the team is pleased with both the launch and the data collected so far.

How the Northern Lights Form an Electrical Circuit

When the aurora lights up the night sky, it is powered by electrons streaming down from space into Earth's upper atmosphere. These charged particles energize atmospheric gases, causing them to glow. It is similar to electricity traveling through a wire to power a lightbulb.

But the process does not end where the glow appears. Electricity moves in loops. Just as a lightbulb is part of a complete circuit, the aurora is only one stop along a larger electrical pathway. If electrons are flowing into the atmosphere, they must also return to space to complete the circuit.

The incoming particle beams are relatively focused, like current flowing through a cord. The return flow, however, is far more scattered. After igniting the aurora, electrons spread out in many directions. Their motion is shaped by collisions, shifting winds, pressure differences, and changing electric and magnetic fields. Eventually, they make their way back to space, but only after weaving through the constantly changing upper atmosphere.

GNEISS Creates a 3D Scan of Auroral Electricity

To truly understand how auroras work, scientists need to see how this returning current closes the circuit. That means mapping the many possible routes electricity takes through the sky, which is extremely challenging.

""We're not just interested in where the rocket flies,"" said Kristina Lynch, principal investigator for GNEISS and a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. ""We want to know how the current spreads downward through the atmosphere.""

Lynch designed GNEISS to answer that question. Using two rockets and a coordinated network of ground receivers, the mission builds a three-dimensional picture of the aurora's electrical environment.

""It's essentially like doing a CT scan of the plasma beneath the aurora,"" Lynch said.

The two rockets launched side by side into the same aurora, each traveling along a slightly different path. Once inside, each rocket released four subpayloads to take measurements at multiple points within the glowing region.

As they flew overhead, the rockets transmitted radio signals through the surrounding plasma to receivers on the ground. The plasma changed those signals as they passed through it, much like body tissues alter X rays during a medical CT scan. By analyzing those changes, scientists can determine plasma density and identify where electrical currents are able to flow. The result is a large-scale CT style scan of the aurora.

Why Mapping Auroral Currents Matters for Space Weather

Understanding these electrical currents is not just about solving a physics puzzle. Auroral currents control how energy from space is distributed through Earth's upper atmosphere. When currents spread out, they heat the atmosphere, stir up winds, and create turbulence that can affect satellites traveling through that region.

Researchers have long relied on ground-based instruments to study auroras. NASA's EZIE satellite mission, launched in March 2025, measures auroral electrical currents from orbit. By combining satellite observations, ground imagery, and direct measurements from sounding rockets, scientists can examine the system from multiple angles at once.

""If we can put the in situ measurements together with the ground-based imagery, then we can learn to read the aurora,"" Lynch said.

Investigating Black Auroras and Current Reversals

The GNEISS rockets were not alone during this launch campaign. The Black and Diffuse Auroral Science Surveyor focused on unusual dark regions within auroras known as black auroras. These blank spots may mark areas where electrical currents suddenly reverse direction.

The mission marked its second attempt at flight after a 2025 effort was postponed due to weather and scientific conditions. With this successful launch, researchers now have new data to examine how these mysterious dark patches fit into the broader auroral circuit.

Auroras form where space and Earth's atmosphere interact. Electric currents, streams of charged particles, and countless collisions combine to create these glowing displays. Sounding rockets provide a rare opportunity to fly directly through them, placing instruments exactly where the action unfolds. Through brief but precisely timed missions, NASA is turning fleeting flashes of light into deeper insight about how space weather shapes our planet's upper atmosphere.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Breakthrough CRISPR system could reverse antibiotic resistance crisis","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260217005717.htm","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 08:10:14 GMT","

Antibiotic resistance (AR) has escalated rapidly in recent years, growing into a serious global health emergency. Disease-causing bacteria are continually adapting, finding new ways to survive treatments that once eliminated them. As a result, more drug resistant ""superbugs"" are spreading, and projections suggest that by 2050 they could be responsible for more than 10 million deaths worldwide each year.

These dangerous bacteria often thrive in hospitals, wastewater treatment facilities, livestock operations, and fish farms. In response to this expanding threat, scientists are turning to advanced genetic technologies. Researchers at the University of California San Diego are now using powerful new gene editing tools to directly counter antibiotic resistance.

CRISPR Gene Drive Strategy Targets Resistance

Professors Ethan Bier and Justin Meyer of the UC San Diego School of Biological Sciences have teamed up to create a new way to remove resistance traits from bacterial populations. Their approach builds on CRISPR gene editing and borrows concepts from gene drives, which are used in insects to block the spread of harmful traits such as malaria carrying parasites.

The team developed a second generation Pro-Active Genetics (Pro-AG) system called pPro-MobV. This updated technology is designed to spread through bacterial communities and disable the genes that make them resistant to antibiotics.

""With pPro-MobV we have brought gene-drive thinking from insects to bacteria as a population engineering tool,"" said Bier, a faculty member in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology. ""With this new CRISPR-based technology we can take a few cells and let them go to neutralize AR in a large target population.""

How the Genetic Cassette Restores Antibiotic Sensitivity

The foundation for this work began in 2019, when Bier's lab partnered with Professor Victor Nizet's team (UC San Diego School of Medicine) to design the original Pro-AG system. That earlier version introduced a genetic cassette into bacteria, allowing it to copy itself between bacterial genomes and shut down antibiotic resistance genes.

This cassette specifically targets resistance genes carried on plasmids, which are small circular DNA molecules that replicate inside bacterial cells. By inserting itself into these plasmids, the cassette disrupts the resistance genes and makes the bacteria vulnerable to antibiotics again.

Spreading Through Biofilms and Bacterial Mating

The newer pPro-MobV system expands on that concept by using conjugal transfer, a process similar to bacterial mating, to move CRISPR components from one cell to another. According to findings published in the Nature journal npj Antimicrobials and Resistance, the researchers demonstrated that the system can travel through a natural mating channel formed between bacteria, distributing the resistance disabling elements across populations.

Importantly, the team showed that this method works inside biofilms. Biofilms are dense communities of microbes that cling to surfaces and are notoriously difficult to eliminate with standard cleaning methods. They are involved in most serious infections and help bacteria survive antibiotic treatment by forming a protective barrier that limits how easily drugs can penetrate. Because of this, the new approach could have important applications in hospitals, environmental cleanup efforts, and microbiome engineering.

""The biofilm context for combating antibiotic resistance is particularly important since this is one of the most challenging forms of bacterial growth to overcome in the clinic or in enclosed environments such as aquafarm ponds and sewage treatment plants,"" said Bier. ""If you could reduce the spread from animals to humans you could have a significant impact on the antibiotic resistance problem since roughly half of it is estimated to come from the environment.""

Pairing CRISPR With Bacteriophages

The researchers also discovered that elements of their active genetic system can be transported by bacteriophage, or phage, viruses that naturally infect bacteria. Phage are already being engineered to fight antibiotic resistance by slipping past bacterial defenses and delivering disruptive genetic material into cells. The team envisions pPro-MobV working alongside these engineered phage to strengthen the impact.

As an added safeguard, the platform can include a process known as homology-based deletion, which allows scientists to remove the inserted genetic cassette if necessary.

""This technology is one of the few ways that I'm aware of that can actively reverse the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes, rather than just slowing or coping with their spread,"" said Meyer, a professor in the Department of Ecology, Behavior and Evolution, who studies the evolutionary adaptations of bacteria and viruses.

Researchers have created the first worldwide map and detailed study of small mare ridges (SMRs), subtle geological features that signal tectonic activity on the Moon. The findings, published in The Planetary Science Journal, come from scientists at the National Air and Space Museum's Center for Earth and Planetary Studies and their collaborators.

For the first time, scientists show that these ridges are relatively young and spread widely across the lunar maria, the broad, dark plains visible from Earth. By determining how SMRs form, the team has also identified new potential sources of moonquakes that could influence where future lunar missions choose to land.

How the Moon's Tectonics Differ From Earth's

Both Earth and the Moon experience tectonic forces, but they operate very differently. On Earth, the crust is broken into moving plates that collide, pull apart, and grind past one another. Those motions build mountain ranges, carve deep ocean trenches, and fuel volcanic activity around the Pacific.

The Moon does not have plate tectonics. Instead, stress builds up within its single, continuous crust. That stress produces distinctive landforms. One well known example is lobate scarps, ridges created when the crust compresses and one section is pushed up and over another along a fault. These scarps are common in the lunar highlands and formed within the last billion years, about the most recent 20% of the Moon's history.

A Shrinking Moon and the Rise of SMRs

In 2010, co author Tom Watters, a senior scientist emeritus at the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies, found evidence that the Moon is gradually shrinking. As the interior cools, the surface contracts, creating the compressional forces that formed lobate scarps in the highlands.

However, lobate scarps do not explain all of the Moon's relatively recent contraction features. Another class of landforms, small mare ridges, has also been identified.

SMRs form from the same compressional forces that create lobate scarps. The difference lies in location. Lobate scarps appear in the highlands, while SMRs are found only in the maria. The research team set out to systematically map these ridges across the lunar maria and investigate their role in recent tectonic activity.

""Since the Apollo era, we've known about the prevalence of lobate scarps throughout the lunar highlands, but this is the first time scientists have documented the widespread prevalence of similar features throughout the lunar mare,"" said Cole Nypaver, a post doctoral research geologist at the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies and the first author on the paper. ""This work helps us gain a globally complete perspective on recent lunar tectonism on the moon, which will lead to a greater understanding of its interior and its thermal and seismic history, and the potential for future moonquakes.""

Thousands of Young Ridges Identified

The team assembled the first comprehensive catalog of SMRs. In the process, they identified 1,114 previously unrecognized SMR segments across the near side lunar maria. That brings the total number of known SMRs on the Moon to 2,634.

Their analysis indicates that the average SMR is about 124 million years old. That closely matches the average age of lobate scarps (105 million years old) determined in earlier research by Watters and colleagues. These comparable ages suggest that SMRs, like lobate scarps, rank among the Moon's youngest geological features.

The study also shows that SMRs form along the same types of faults as lobate scarps. In some regions, scarps in the highlands transition into SMRs within the maria, reinforcing the idea that both structures share a common origin. When combined with existing data on lobate scarps, the new SMR catalog offers a far more complete picture of the Moon's recent contraction and tectonic evolution.

""Our detection of young, small ridges in the maria, and our discovery of their cause, completes a global picture of a dynamic, contracting moon,"" Watters said.

What This Means for Moonquakes and Future Missions

Earlier work by Watters linked the tectonic forces that produce lobate scarps with recorded moonquakes. Because SMRs form through the same type of faulting, moonquakes may also occur across the lunar maria wherever these ridges exist.

Expanding the map of potential moonquake sources provides scientists with new opportunities to study the Moon's interior and tectonic behavior. At the same time, it highlights possible seismic risks for astronauts who may one day explore or live on the lunar surface.

""We are in a very exciting time for lunar science and exploration,"" Nypaver said. ""Upcoming lunar exploration programs, such as Artemis, will provide a wealth of new information about our moon. A better understanding of lunar tectonics and seismic activity will directly benefit the safety and scientific success of those and future missions.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A satellite illusion hid the true scale of Arctic snow loss","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260217005803.htm","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 03:59:42 GMT","

For decades, assessments from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have tracked how Earth's climate is shifting and have helped shape policies aimed at slowing global warming.

Those assessments draw on extensive climate records, including annual measurements of autumn snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) since the 1960s.

Why Snow Cover Matters for Climate Change

Snow cover measures how much of Earth's land surface is blanketed in snow. It plays a major role in regulating temperature because snow reflects a large portion of incoming energy back into space. While bare ground and vegetation reflect less than 50 percent of the energy that reaches them, snow reflects about 80 percent.

""Snow cover is important because it's a positive climate feedback mechanism,"" explains Aleksandra Elias Chereque, a PhD student in the Faculty of Arts & Science's Department of Physics.

""This is referred to as the snow-albedo effect -- albedo meaning reflectivity. Snow loss leads to a decrease in albedo which leads to higher energy absorption which, in turn, leads to enhanced snow loss. This is a contributing factor to a phenomenon known as 'Arctic amplification' and it's why we observe a disproportionate amount of heating in the Arctic.""

In simple terms, when snow disappears, darker land absorbs more heat. That extra heat melts even more snow, accelerating warming in the Arctic faster than in many other parts of the world.

Questions About NOAA Snow Data

For years, some climate researchers have questioned how reliable NOAA's snow cover data might be. They noted that the trends in the dataset did not align well with other observations and cautioned that the findings should be interpreted carefully.

Elias Chereque and her colleagues revisited the NOAA records to investigate these discrepancies. Their new analysis suggests that the earlier concerns were justified.

According to the original NOAA data, autumn snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere appeared to increase by about 1.5 million square kilometers per decade, roughly the size of one and a half Ontarios. However, the updated analysis finds the opposite trend. Snow cover has actually been shrinking by about half a million square kilometres per decade, or about half the area of Ontario.

How Satellite Improvements Skewed the Record

The team determined that changes in satellite instruments and data collection techniques over time made the system more sensitive to thin layers of snow. As detection improved, satellites began identifying lighter snow cover that earlier instruments would have missed. That shift created the false impression that overall snow extent was expanding.

""It's as if the satellite's 'eye glasses' got better and better over that period,"" says Elias Chereque. ""It looks like there's more snow now than there used to be but that's only because the satellite kept getting better 'prescriptions for its glasses.' It looked like there was more snow but that's not what was happening.""

Elias Chereque is the lead author of the study, 'Determining the cause of inconsistent onset-season trends in the Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent record', published in Science Advances. Her University of Toronto co-author is atmospheric physicist Paul Kushner, chair of the Department of Physics. Additional collaborators are from the Climate Research Division of Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Clearer Evidence of Arctic Snow Decline

The revised findings strengthen the conclusion that snow cover is declining throughout the year and increase confidence in that trend. According to Elias Chereque, ""We know snow loss is influenced by anthropogenic warming and snow loss also creates more potential for warming through the snow-albedo feedback, so we've gained a better understanding of this important mechanism of Arctic amplification.""

She adds, ""Showing how and why the snow cover trend was wrong helps us learn how to use this data set properly when we're estimating past conditions and future trends. And that helps in understanding whether climate models are accurate.

""Developing tools like this helps us better understand climate and helps us make better predictions about the future.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","One stem cell generates 14 million tumor-killing NK cells in major cancer breakthrough","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260215225600.htm","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 03:33:12 GMT","

Researchers in China have created a more efficient strategy for producing natural killer (NK) cells for use in cancer immunotherapy.

NK cells play a critical role in the body's early defense against viruses and cancer, along with other immune functions. Because of their natural ability to detect and destroy abnormal cells, they are an attractive tool for cancer treatment. In chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK therapy, scientists equip NK cells with a lab-designed receptor (a CAR) so they can recognize a specific marker on cancer cells and attack them more precisely.

Traditional CAR-NK approaches usually depend on mature NK cells collected from sources such as peripheral blood or cord blood. This method presents several obstacles, including wide variability between cells, limited efficiency during genetic modification, high production costs, and lengthy preparation times.

Stem Cell-Derived NK Cells From Cord Blood

A team led by Prof. WANG Jinyong at the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed a different approach. Instead of modifying mature NK cells, the researchers started with CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) taken from cord blood. From these early-stage cells, they generated induced (that is, lab-generated) NK (iNK) cells as well as CAR-engineered iNK (CAR-iNK) cells.

The findings were published in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

Earlier efforts to produce NK cells from cord blood-derived CD34+ HSPCs struggled with low efficiency and immature cell function. To address these limitations, the team moved the genetic engineering step earlier in development, working directly at the CD34+ HSPC stage. This strategy combined CAR transduction, strong expansion of progenitor cells, and guided commitment to the NK lineage.

Three-Step Expansion and Differentiation Process

The researchers used a three-stage system. First, they expanded CD34+ HSPCs (or CD19 CAR-transduced HSPCs) with the help of irradiated AFT024 feeder cells. Within 14 days, the cells multiplied roughly 800- to 1,000-fold.

Next, the expanded cells were cultured with OP9 feeder cells to create artificial hematopoietic organoid aggregates, structures that support efficient NK lineage commitment and development.

In the final stage, cells that had committed to becoming NK cells were allowed to mature and multiply further. This process produced highly pure iNK or CAR-iNK cells that expressed endogenous CD16.

Massive Cell Output From a Single Stem Cell

The team found that a single CD34+ HSPC could generate as many as 14 million iNK cells or 7.6 million CAR-iNK cells. The researchers estimate that one-fifth of a typical cord blood unit could theoretically yield enough cells for thousands or even tens of thousands of treatment doses.

Another major improvement was the sharp reduction in viral vector needed for CAR engineering. Compared with the amount usually required to modify mature NK cells, this method used only about ~1/140,000 (by Day 42 of culture) to ~1/600,000 (by Day 49) as much viral vector.

Strong Tumor Killing in Leukemia Models

In laboratory testing, both iNK and CAR-iNK cells demonstrated powerful tumor-killing ability. In cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models of human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), CD19 CAR-iNK cells reduced tumor growth and extended the animals' survival.

According to the researchers, the new approach not only improves the efficiency of producing iNK and CAR-iNK cells but also significantly lowers the cost of CAR engineering.

The work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, along with other funding sources.

Sondra Williams is no stranger to medical diagnoses and treatments. As a teenager and young adult, she spent a decade in and out of mental-health facilities, medicated for conditions including schizophrenia and social anxiety.

‘I am not a broken version of normal' — autistic people argue for a stronger voice in research

It wasn't until she was in her late 30s that she finally received a diagnosis that made sense.

By then, she had married and had four children. After two of her kids were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), doctors reviewed her medical history. Williams, too, met the criteria for the neurodevelopmental condition.

“When I finally got the diagnosis, it felt like being in labour as a mom, being in labour for most of my life and finally delivering that baby, that relief,” says Williams, who lives in Dublin, Ohio. “It was a relief to me knowing that my differences had a meaning to it. And it wasn't me being crazy or mentally ill. It had a rhyme and reason to it.”

The diagnosis answered some questions — but raised others. Williams, now 63, has recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that some studies have suggested are more common among autistic people than in the general population. “I'm terrified of my future because I'm plagued with so many health issues,” says Williams.

The number of older autistic people is surging. A study analysing data from more than 200 countries, published online last year1, reported that the number of autistic people aged 70 or older rose from 894,700 in 1990 to nearly 2.5 million in 2021. This figure is estimated to double to 5.1 million people by 2040, according to the study.

Some of the increase is simply because the world's population is growing. But awareness of and screening for autism have also improved. Another important factor is a change in the diagnostic criteria that was made about a decade ago: before this, autism was predominantly diagnosed in early childhood; the revision meant that adults could be given the diagnosis.

And yet, researchers know almost nothing about how autism might affect people as they age. Only 0.4% of studies of autism since 2012 included autistic people in midlife or old age2.

The fact that Williams and other autistic adults live with such uncertainty concerning their health stems from two blind spots in scientific research. Firstly, the study of autism has historically focused on children and adolescents. Secondly, studies on ageing, which have ramped up in recent years, often exclude autistic people.

Features of autism can affect age of diagnosis — and so can genes

But what researchers do know paints a picture of a group that might be more susceptible to certain health conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and heart disease, and more-severe symptoms of menopause. Autistic people might benefit from extra support as they age — making it imperative to include them in research.

“People want research where there's going to be a tangible impact on their lives. With the research area of autism and ageing, we're still at that point of setting the scene,” says Gavin Stewart, a developmental psychologist at King's College London, UK.

Autism was first identified as a distinct condition by two researchers in the 1940s3,4. Before that, it was thought to be part of schizophrenia. Even in the 1960s, when autism was added to diagnostic manuals, it was listed as a schizophrenia-related condition that occurred in children. It was not until 1980 that autism became recognized as a stand-alone condition in such manuals.

The criteria for characterizing it continued to change. The official diagnosis of ASD — including how to identify it in adults — was introduced only in 2013. As a result, there are generations of autistic people who grew up not knowing that they were autistic, nor getting the support they needed to thrive, because they were excluded by earlier diagnostic criteria.

The largest survey to estimate the prevalence of autism in adults in England suggested that up to 75% of autistic people aged 20–49 and more than 90% of those over 50 are undiagnosed5.

This means that millions of people around the world might not be receiving the support that they need. It also makes it difficult for researchers to recruit older participants into studies and to follow them over the long term.

Between 1980 and 2021, more than 40,200 papers on autism in childhood and adolescence were published, compared with only 174 papers on autism during old age2 (see ‘Scant studies').

Source: Ref. 2

“We know almost nothing,” says Gregory Wallace, a developmental neuropsychologist at the George Washington University in Washington DC.

But there has been a growing interest in ageing and autism, and studies on older autistic adults have nearly quadrupled2 since 2012.

Some of these studies have asked whether autistic adults will face any particular health risks as they age. The data so far suggest that they might.

An analysis of health records from nearly 5,000 autistic adults and 46,850 neurotypical adults over 65 years old found that the autistic group had higher rates of mood disorder, epilepsy and gastrointestinal disorders. Autistic adults, nearly 44% of whom had an intellectual disability, were also more likely to have a diagnosis of age-related conditions, such as osteoporosis, heart disease, Parkinson's disease and dementia6 (see ‘Health needs').

Source: Ref. 6

In a larger survey of around 250,000 autistic people, people with intellectual disabilities or both, presented at a conference in 2024 and not yet published, Wallace and his colleagues reported that the risk of developing symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease was three times higher in that group than in the general population (see go.nature.com/4rcft9w). Previous genetic studies have also found that autism is linked to mutations in PARK2, a gene associated with Parkinson's disease7.

But interpreting these findings is complicated. Many autistic people have challenges with movement or differences across development compared with neurotypical people, says Wallace. And it is difficult to determine whether the Parkinson's-like symptoms occur as an ageing-related complication or whether their roots were there all along.

Neuroscientist Zheng Wang at the University of Florida in Gainesville is investigating movement difficulties in autistic people aged 40 to 60 years using brain imaging. In her project, which ends next year, she wants to find out whether structural changes in the cerebellum and basal ganglia — brain areas involved in coordinating movement — might underlie any motor difficulties.

Ageing autistic adults are also “more likely to have been prescribed various psychotropic medications” in their earlier life than are neurotypical people of the same age, says Wallace. Long-term use of such drugs, including antipsychotics and anti-seizure medications, can lead to a cascade of side effects, including Parkinson's-like symptoms, that might not manifest until later life.

That said, when Wallace and his team did another analysis excluding those who had taken such drugs during the study window, the likelihood of Parkinson's-like symptoms was still higher than in the general population.

Researchers have reported similar patterns for other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The largest study of its kind, published last year, examined data from 90 million health-care records, which included 114,582 autistic individuals. The authors revealed that up to 35% of autistic adults aged over 64 had a diagnosis of dementia, compared with only 10% in the general population8.

But studies based on medical records might be including only a subset of autistic adults who have interacted with health systems or at least have a diagnosis.

Some research on autistic adults paints a more positive picture of health in later life. For instance, brain-imaging studies have found that some neuronal networks showed less age-related change in autistic adults than in neurotypical ones. “If there was a difference at the beginning of life, there was also a difference later on in life. But this gap between people who were autistic and non-autistic didn't grow bigger with increasing age,” explains Hilde Geurts, a neuropsychologist at the University of Amsterdam who found such a difference in a 2020 study9. She and her team were surprised that the gap didn't widen with age — that autistic people didn't seem to be subject to accelerated ageing.

But she acknowledges that not all such studies agree. “It is not what everyone finds across different labs,” says Geurts.

Nonetheless, the work of Geurts and others has led to the suggestion that autism could protect against some of the declines in cognitive abilities that occur with age. “Older autistic folks have these really incredible compensatory mechanisms,” says Blair Braden, a behavioural neuroscientist at Arizona State University in Tempe.

She and her colleagues wanted to document age-related changes in the brain in autism, so they imaged the brains of 25 autistic adults and 25 neurotypical adults aged 40 to 70 years old for up to 5 years10. They focused on tasks of short- and long-term visual memory. When they looked at the data from the autistic group, they found that “there is a subset of people that are actually experiencing accelerated memory decline” compared with neurotypical participants, “and some people who are staying stable,” says Braden — much like Geurts found.

Battery technology presents a major economic opportunity, spanning diverse metal-ion battery chemistries with distinct material, performance and supply chain characteristics. How knowledge is shared across these chemistries is essential for industrial strategies informed by techno-economic forecasting but understudied. Here we report the use of advanced large language models for automated patent classification to map knowledge flows within and across lithium-ion and sodium-ion battery chemistries, based on patent citation networks encompassing over 15,000 patent families classified at the chemical structure level. We find substantial, persistent knowledge flows within and across chemistries for product and process innovation, with continuous directional knowledge flows from mature lithium-ion to emerging sodium-ion chemistries. For some lithium-ion chemistries, cross-chemistry knowledge flows even exceed within-chemistry flows. These results indicate that industrial strategies aiming to leap-frog to new chemistries without design and manufacturing experience in existing chemistries are unlikely to succeed, and battery chemistries should therefore not be treated as fully independent technologies in forecasting models.

Batteries have become a cornerstone technology of the global low-carbon energy transition, enabling decarbonization of the transportation and electricity sectors1,2,3,4. This represents an enormous economic opportunity, with global battery production capacity being projected to reach 7.0 TWh yr−1 by 20305. Consequently, a global race for market shares has started, supported by active industrial policy targeting the technology, including in China, the USA and the European Union5,6. Yet, over the last decades, the monovalent metal-ion battery landscape has become increasingly diverse, constituting multiple chemistries7 that serve different market segments, trading off costs, energy density, safety, cycle life and raw material dependencies8,9,10. This includes the dominant lithium-ion battery (LIB) chemistries such as lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP), alongside emerging sodium-ion battery (SIB) chemistries such as sodium nickel iron manganese oxide (NFM) and sodium iron pyrophosphate (NFPP). Throughout this study, we use ‘metal-ion battery' to refer to monovalent chemistries (LIB and SIB chemistries), which store energy by moving single charged metal ions between electrodes11. We focus on monovalent metal-ion chemistries of LIBs and SIBs as these represent mature systems with sufficient patent activity for analysis, unlike other monovalent systems such as potassium-ion batteries or multivalent systems such as aluminium-ion batteries, which remain at lower technological readiness levels with insufficient patent data for robust citation network analyses11,12.

Whether this increasing technological heterogeneity results in independent knowledge trajectories within and across monovalent chemistries is currently inadequately understood, leading to sub-optimal resource allocation decisions by policymakers and investors and modelling assumptions by technology and energy system modellers.

The lack of this understanding affects resource allocation decisions in two key ways. First, if knowledge trajectories across different battery chemistries are highly interconnected, this creates substantial market entry barriers13,14,15,16. Existing market players would have major advantages in next-generation chemistries, given their expertise in mature battery chemistries. This would make technological leap-frogging—a strategy aimed at by western countries and firms—challenging17. Second, effective resource allocation and strategic planning of energy policy is informed by technology forecasting, where the experience curve is a fundamental input18,19. The granularity at which experience curves should be modelled—whether different battery chemistries follow independent learning trajectories or learn together—substantially changes the resulting performance and cost projections20. Current approaches reflect this lack of understanding through varied modelling assumptions. While some studies estimate independent experience curves for each metal-ion battery chemistry with component-specific learning rates10,21,22, others estimate aggregated experience curves based on use cases disregarding chemistry differences23,24,25. These varied approaches result in substantially different cost and deployment projections, leading to divergent conclusions about market competitiveness and deployment and potential misallocation of public and private resources.

Despite the importance of knowledge interdependencies between metal-ion battery chemistries to strategic decision-making, our knowledge about them is very limited. Previous research examining knowledge flows between sectors14 and between distinct battery technologies with fundamentally different electrochemical mechanisms, such as lead acid and lithium-ion batteries26, found that cross-technology knowledge flows were mainly limited to peripheral components. Other electrochemical storage systems, such as redox flow batteries, operate on fundamentally different principles and are not included here, although bibliometric keyword analysis of scientific publications indicate some thematic proximity to LIB research27. However, knowledge flows within metal-ion battery technology between different chemistries have not been systematically analysed, despite their shared underlying principles potentially resulting in more substantial knowledge flows throughout these chemistries' development and deployment. This represents a critical gap, especially as metal-ion batteries are poised to dominate battery markets in the coming decades5,28,29.

We address this research gap by systematically analysing within-technology knowledge flows between metal-ion battery chemistries using large language model (LLM)-assisted patent classification and their citations. Patent citations serve as common proxies for knowledge flows, with citation patterns indicating how innovations build upon existing technical knowledge foundations13,26,30,31,32, offering high-resolution insight into knowledge interdependencies. Using a LLM, we are able to systematically classify inventions contained in over 35,000 LIB and SIB patent family claims across three levels: component focus (positive/negative electrodes, electrolyte or cell level), innovation type (product/process innovations or mixed) and electrode active material (16 distinct positive and negative LIB and SIB electrode materials; Table 1). Among these, 15,000 patent families relate to specific electrode chemistries, while the remainder concern the overall technology, such as cell assembly processes.

Rather than analysing individual battery chemistries, we group electrode active materials by their chemical structure classes (for example, layered oxides, polyanionic materials; Table 1), as materials within the same structural class share similar chemical properties, technical challenges and knowledge bases33,34. The classes serve as our units of analysis, enabling identification of systematic knowledge flow patterns across chemically related groups. From here onward, we refer to groups of chemical structure classes as classes for brevity. We construct directed patent citation networks from the nearly 100,000 citations between electrode material-related patents, including analysing the type of innovation and their temporal nature, to analyse knowledge flows between chemical classes.

First, we quantify knowledge flow patterns within and across classes to measure technological interdependence. Second, we examine whether knowledge flows differ between product and process innovations, as process innovations rely on tacit manufacturing knowledge while product innovations constitute more codified design knowledge17. Third, we assess the temporal persistence of cross-structural flows, as sustained interdependencies would refute the independent development assumption. We find substantial, persistent knowledge flows within and across lithium- and sodium-ion battery chemistries, with notable interdependencies at both product and process levels and consistent directional knowledge flows from mature LIB to emerging SIB chemistries. These findings suggest that LIB and SIB chemistries should be considered an interconnected technology from industrial policy and technology modelling perspective.

Figure 1 presents knowledge flows within and across all nine LIB and SIB classes (Methods provide calculation details). Knowledge flows are derived from patent citation networks for battery-chemistry-specific patent families, coded using the alphanumeric system from Table 1. We calculate relative knowledge flow intensities by determining what percentage of each receiving chemical class's total backward citations comes from each providing class, then normalizing by the percentage from the same structural class (diagonal values = 100%). Off-diagonal values show cross-structural flows relative to within-structural flows (detailed networks shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 to Supplementary Fig. 4; non-normalized percentages in Supplementary Fig. 5).

Relative knowledge flow intensities between all LIB and SIB classes (A–I providers, 1–9 receivers). Values show knowledge flows between battery classes normalized to within-structural self-citation baseline (diagonal = 100% by definition). Brown intensity indicates high knowledge flow intensities. Numbers above each column show the within-structural citation percentages used as normalization baselines for the respective receiving class.

Source data

LIB classes show substantial directional learning. The highest knowledge flows occur from layered oxides to spinel (A → 3: 109%—even exceeding within-structural knowledge flow intensity) and to polyanionic (A → 2: 85.6%). The A → 2 flow means the polyanionic LIB class (LFP-based chemistry) receives knowledge from layered oxides (LCO-, NMC-, NCA-based chemistries) at 85.6% intensity compared to knowledge flows within their own chemical structure class. The graphite-based class provides substantial knowledge to polyanionic (G → 2: 81.8%) and layered oxides to LTO (A → 8: 78.8%). Weakest knowledge flows include polyanionic to graphite-based (B → 7: 5.8%) and LTO to graphite-based classes (H → 7: 5.2%).

SIB classes exhibit more balanced patterns. Layered oxides serve as primary knowledge providers: to polyanionic (D → 5: 27.7%), to PBA (D → 6: 27.0%) and to hard carbon (D → 9: 27.7%) classes. Hard carbon also provides notable knowledge flows to polyanionic (I → 5: 25.2%) and PBA (I → 6: 26.2%) classes.

Knowledge flows from LIB to SIB classes demonstrate substantial cross-structural technological learning, with higher knowledge flows between different battery chemistries with similar chemical structures. The highest knowledge flow intensity occurs from the LIB graphite-based class to the SIB hard carbon class (G → 9: 67.7%). Structurally analogous battery chemistries show substantial knowledge flow intensities: LIB polyanionic to SIB polyanionic (B → 5: 28.3%) and LIB layered oxides to SIB layered oxides (A → 4: 27.1%). Additional notable knowledge flows include LIB graphite-based class to SIB polyanionic class (G → 5: 23.9%). The weakest knowledge flows occur from LIB LTO to SIB layered oxides (H → 4: 2.6%) and to SIB PBA (H → 6: 3.5%).

Cross-electrode knowledge flows demonstrate that battery innovation integrates positive and negative electrode development. LIB positive electrode classes provide substantial knowledge flows to negative electrode classes, with the highest knowledge flows from LIB positive electrode classes to the LTO-based LIB negative electrode class: 78.8% (LIB layered oxides, A → 8), 28.2% (LIB polyanionic, B → 8) and 55.9% (LIB spinel, C → 8). LIB positive electrode classes also provide knowledge to the LIB graphite-based class: 21.6% (LIB layered oxides, A → 7), 5.8% (LIB polyanionic, B → 7) and 12.0% (LIB spinel, C → 7). This pattern extends to SIB classes, where LIB and SIB positive electrode classes provide knowledge flows to the SIB hard carbon class: 15.0% (LIB layered oxides, A → 9), 11.8% (LIB polyanionic, B → 9), 7.7% (LIB spinel, C → 9), 27.7% (SIB layered oxides, D → 9), 13.6% (SIB polyanionic, E → 9) and 16.4% (SIB PBA, F → 9).

Knowledge flows demonstrate clear directional asymmetries. Given their more recent development, SIB chemistries provide minimal knowledge to LIB chemistries ( < 1%), whereas LIB chemistries provide substantial knowledge to SIB chemistries, with intensity varying by similarity of chemical structures.

Figure 2 presents knowledge flows disaggregated by innovation type: product innovation (electrode architecture and design), process innovation (manufacturing techniques) and mixed innovation (both product and process). Flow thickness represents the share of each receiver's total knowledge base derived from chemistries of different chemical structures for the given innovation type.

a–c, Sankey diagrams show cross-structural knowledge flows between LIB classes (39,383 total knowledge flows) (a), between SIB classes (457 total knowledge flows) (b) and from LIB to SIB classes (677 total knowledge flows) (c). Knowledge providers include LIB (A–C, G, H) and SIB classes (D–F, I). Knowledge receivers, disaggregated by innovation type (product, process and mixed), include LIB (1–3, 7, 8) and SIB classes (4–6, 10). Flow thickness represents the share of each receiver's total knowledge base derived from a given provider. For each receiving class, the percentage of total knowledge obtained from other classes (excluding self-citations) is reported by innovation type. Colours correspond to battery chemical structure classes according to Table 1.

Source data

For LIB classes, cross-structural knowledge flows are substantial for both product and process innovations. The LTO class receives the highest share of its product knowledge from other classes (12.7%), followed by the spinel class (12.2%) and the polyanionic class (11.1%). Process innovations also show substantial cross-structural dependencies, with the LTO class again receiving the most knowledge from other classes (11.5%), followed by the spinel class (9.5%) and the polyanionic class (7.0%).

SIB classes show similar patterns, with substantial cross-structural knowledge flows for product and process innovation types. For product knowledge, the PBA class receives the highest share from other classes (12.9%), followed by the polyanionic class (9.9%). Process innovations show notable cross-structural flows, with the layered oxides and PBA classes each receiving 3.3% from other classes and the polyanionic class receiving 2.5%.

Knowledge flows from LIB to SIB classes are substantial for both innovation types. For product knowledge, three SIB classes receive over 10% from LIB classes: the polyanionic (13.1%), the layered oxides (12.2%) and the hard carbon (10.8%) classes. For process knowledge, the SIB polyanionic class receives the highest share from LIB classes (8.0%), while the SIB PBA class receives the lowest (3.3%).

Mixed innovation knowledge flows typically fall between product and process levels. Technological learning across positive and negative electrode classes occurs consistently for all innovation types.

Figure 3 presents temporal knowledge flow dynamics across LIB, SIB and from LIB to SIB classes, with knowledge flows measured as the percentage of each receiving class's total annual backward citations that come from other classes with different chemical structure (excluding self-citations). Knowledge flows between LIB classes demonstrate continuous technological learning throughout 2002–2022. The LTO class exhibits the highest knowledge flows at approximately 15% with stable trends, whereas the spinel and the polyanionic classes show upward trajectories, rising from 9% to 13% (polyanionic) and 11% to 15% (spinel). The layered oxides class maintains knowledge flows around 7–9% with marginally declining trends, whereas the graphite-based class remains consistently lowest at 5%.

a–c, Knowledge flows between LIB classes (a), between SIB classes (b) and from LIB to SIB classes (c), 2002–2022 (LIB–LIB), 2017–2022 (SIB–SIB and LIB–SIB). Knowledge flows are measured as the percentage of annual knowledge flows from other battery chemistries with different chemical structures (excluding self-citations) within each receiving class's annual total knowledge base. The x axis shows years corresponding to priority years of citing patent families. The y axis shows percentage of annual knowledge flows within total annual knowledge base. Dashed lines represent linear trend lines indicating temporal trends in cross-structural technological learning. Colours correspond to chemical structure classes according to Table 1.

Source data

Knowledge flows between SIB classes reveal emerging technological learning patterns over 2017–2022. Across SIB classes, the PBA class demonstrates the highest upward trend (5% to 13%) but with high volatility, whereas the hard carbon class shows slight increases (5% to 7%) and the polyanionic and layered oxides classes reach stable levels around 10% and 6%, respectively.

Knowledge flows from LIB to SIB classes show persistent trends. The SIB layered oxides and the polyanionic classes maintain consistent flows around 5–8% from LIB classes, whereas the PBA class exhibits volatile patterns (2–25% fluctuation). The hard carbon class represents the only class with clearly declining trends, dropping from initial high flows in 2017 (18%) to stabilized levels of 3–7%.

Our analysis provides insight into three fundamental questions about knowledge interdependencies in metal-ion battery development. First, we find substantial knowledge flows within and across LIB and SIB classes, demonstrating high technological interdependence based on shared knowledge trajectories. Second, we observe substantial knowledge flows at both product and process levels, highlighting the interlinkage of manufacturing and design knowledge across battery chemical structure classes for innovation in emerging battery chemistries. Third, we document persistent cross-structural knowledge flows over time, with emerging battery chemistries showing continued reliance on knowledge from mature metal-ion battery chemistries across different structural classes. The findings strongly indicate that emerging battery chemistries remain technologically interdependent with mature chemistries rather than achieving technological independence.

These knowledge flow patterns observed at the structural class level directly translate to the individual LIB and SIB chemistries. An analysis of patent applicants (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Tables 3–5) reveals pronounced differences in how knowledge flows are shaped across actors in LIB and SIB innovation. In LIB development, both the providers and receivers of knowledge are predominantly large incumbent industrial actors. In contrast, SIB-related knowledge flows involve a more diverse constellation of emerging industrial actors and academic applicants. Collaboration patterns complement these findings: SIB → SIB knowledge flows are predominantly shaped by academia–academia collaboration, LIB → LIB flows are driven by strong industry–industry collaboration and LIB → SIB flows involve a mix of academia–industry collaboration. Most LIB → LIB and SIB → SIB knowledge flows occur across different applicants—exceeding 77% and 90%, respectively. By comparison, nearly half of all LIB → SIB knowledge flows stem from the same applicant, indicating that incumbents frequently build on their own LIB experience when advancing SIB technologies. Within-structure class flows (that is, citations within the same battery structure class) show that around one-quarter of citations occur within the same applicant, whereas cross-structure class flows (that is, citations across different battery structure classes) show only about one-fifth within-applicant citations, with the remainder involving multiple applicants. Our findings have important implications for policy design, technological forecasting and innovation theory, which we discuss below.

For policy design, industrial strategies should treat metal-ion battery chemistries as interdependent technologies, emphasizing support for integrated research and development (R&D) and platform capabilities that exploit manufacturing compatibility and design knowledge across chemistries. Because knowledge flows occur across both product and process innovations, it indicates comprehensive technological knowledge integration. LIBs and SIBs share the same production processes—from electrode manufacturing to cell assembly and formation—meaning that process experience can easily flow across chemistries9,35. However, the systematic citation patterns we observe demonstrate technological interdependencies beyond manufacturing compatibility alone. China's success is consistent with this integrated approach: building comprehensive cross-chemistry capabilities rather than attempting chemistry-specific leap-frogging6. The approach recognizes that competitive advantage stems from mastering the complete technology rather than excelling in isolated chemistry domains. Consequently, newcomers entering SIB markets should expect competitive disadvantages relative to incumbents with established LIB knowledge and must strategically mitigate this position through targeted approaches such as joint ventures, hiring experts with LIB experience or acquiring specific LIB production capabilities.

For technological forecasting, our results have equally important implications for technology modelling. In current modelling approaches some researchers develop distinct experience curves for different metal-ion battery chemistries10,21,22 whereas others apply aggregated curves, producing substantially different projections about market competitiveness and investment priorities23,24,25. Technology forecasts and investment roadmaps that assume independent experience curves for LFP versus NMC or for LIB versus SIB chemistries will systematically underestimate shared learning effects, therefore potentially also underestimating cost declines and misallocating public and private resources. Our findings support implementation of models that recognize cumulative, technology-wide learning trajectories. Modellers should incorporate effects of deployment of one chemistry (for example, LFP) on ‘discounted' learning benefits for related chemistries (for example, NMC, SIB) even without direct deployment. The substantial cross-chemistry knowledge flows we quantify provide empirical basis for calibrating these ‘discounted' deployment factors in energy system models. Effective forecasting should thus model metal-ion battery chemistries as an interconnected technology with shared knowledge base rather than independent technological trajectories.

For innovation theory, our findings imply that a shift to new chemistries does not automatically open new windows of opportunities for new entrants. Leap-frogging strategies assume that new entrants can catch up with incumbents by bypassing previous technological knowledge trajectories and competing directly in next-generation alternatives36,37. However, we show that incumbents compound their advantages by leveraging cross-chemistry design and manufacturing knowledge. For new entrants targeting SIB development without prior LIB expertise, access to critical and often tacit knowledge is limited, creating higher barriers than what the leap-frogging strategy would probably require.

Beyond these sector-specific implications, our methodological approach offers a generalizable method for understanding knowledge interdependencies in technologies beyond batteries. By integrating LLM-based patent classification with temporal citation network analysis, we demonstrate that patent citations can reveal the boundaries of technologies based on the extent of their knowledge base at the core component level. This method can be applied to identify entry barriers and knowledge interdependencies across technologies where the emergence of independent technologies remains uncertain. Whereas similar independencies are expected for chemistries beyond LIB and SIB given the fundamental similarities, generalizability requires investigating alternative battery systems. Future research could extend our analysis to potassium-ion batteries, another monovalent intercalation-type system or aluminium-ion battery, a multivalent intercalation-type system once sufficient patent data becomes available. Additionally, examining systems with substantially different architectures and ion transport mechanisms—including solid-state batteries and conversion-type batteries (for example, lithium-sulfur and lithium-air batteries)—will reveal whether the observed knowledge interdependencies are specific to LIB and SIB chemistries or represent broader patterns of technological learning in battery innovation. Whereas previous research suggests that knowledge spillovers across battery technologies are generally limited26, early LIB developments—particularly for graphite anodes and for electrolytes—have benefited from knowledge generated in other technologies such as zinc and primary batteries38.

In sum, effective industrial policy and useful techno-economic forecasts depend on recognizing and modelling these interdependencies, moving beyond simplified assumptions of technological independence towards more nuanced understandings of how knowledge flows shape competitive dynamics in complex technologies.

We examine technological knowledge flows between monovalent metal-ion battery chemistries using patent citation analysis. Our study focuses specifically on technological knowledge flows rather than organizational or geographical knowledge flows. Technological knowledge flows capture the absorption, evolution and diffusion of technological knowledge between different technological domains, reflecting how technical solutions, material innovations and process improvements flow within and across battery chemistries39. This differs from organizational knowledge flows, which examine knowledge flows between companies or institutions40, and geographical knowledge flows, which track knowledge flows across regions or countries41,42. Our technological focus enables precise analysis of how battery chemistry innovations build upon prior technical knowledge regardless of the organizational or geographical context.

We used patent families as our unit of analysis. Patent families represent single inventions protected in multiple jurisdictions, providing more accurate representation of distinct technological contributions than individual patent documents while eliminating geographical duplication artefacts43,44. Our analysis captures knowledge flows in complete electrode assemblies rather than pure stoichiometric materials—when we reference ‘layered oxide chemistry', we mean the fully engineered battery component, not simply the base crystalline structure. Knowledge flows occur when later patents cite earlier patents as prior art, with such citations serving as evidence of subsequent technological developments that build upon the cited technological knowledge41.

Our analysis operates at three levels to identify patterns behind technological learning. First, we examined knowledge flows at the chemical structure level to understand how chemical similarities influence knowledge trajectories. Second, we analysed innovation types to investigate whether knowledge flow patterns differ systematically when enabling product and process innovations. Third, we assessed temporal evolution to examine the persistence of cross-structural knowledge flows over time and identify whether emerging chemistries develop technological independence. For LIBs, we focused on commercialized battery chemistries with established market presence, whereas for SIBs, we examined the most promising chemistries based on expert consultations and literature review.

We assume that knowledge flows through patent citations can be measured effectively, as patents embody explicit technological knowledge45 that enables tracing of knowledge trajectories41,46. According to Asche (2017)47, approximately 80% of codified technical knowledge is contained in patents, making them a strong indicator for technical knowledge flows. However, this approach has well-documented limitations. Patents do not capture tacit knowledge, which constrains our study's scope48. Additional limitations include potential citation biases, particularly examiner-added citations that may not reflect genuine knowledge use by inventors49, varying patenting strategies across industries and jurisdictions50,51 and the time lag between patent filing and publication6,52. Furthermore, not all knowledge flows result in patent citations, particularly when knowledge flows occur through informal channels, personnel mobility or collaborative research relationships53,54. Despite these limitations, patent citations remain a robust metric for measuring technological knowledge flows because they create a systematic, legally mandated record of technological dependencies and capture knowledge flows across organizational, geographical and temporal boundaries13,41,42, making them particularly suitable for examining knowledge interdependencies within and across battery chemistries.

We selected the The Lens patent database for patent retrieval because it provides comprehensive family-level citation data and full-text patent claims, both essential for our classification and network analysis approach.

We developed comprehensive search strategies combining International Patent Classification (IPC) and Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) codes with targeted keywords in titles, abstracts and patent claims. For LIBs, we built on the validated search strategy from Peiseler et al. (2024)55, which systematically captures LIB innovations across battery chemistries, manufacturing processes and system integration domains. For SIBs, we applied the search strategy from Hemmelder et al. (2025)6, specifically designed for the emerging SIB technological domain. Both strategies originate from peer-reviewed publications and have demonstrated validity in their respective domains. The search strategies employ Boolean operators to combine classification codes with relevant keywords, ensuring comprehensive coverage while minimizing false positives. Complete search queries with Boolean operators, classification codes and keywords are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

We included patent families from four major jurisdictions: Japan Patent Office (JPO), European Patent Office (EPO), US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA). For the established LIBs, we included EPO, JPO and USPTO patent families, which capture innovations with international market relevance and maintain consistency with established patent quality criteria56. For SIBs, we included all four jurisdictions (EPO, JPO, USPTO and CNIPA) to ensure comprehensive coverage, as many SIB innovations remain concentrated in CNIPA filings because the technology lacks established international markets, with most R&D occurring in China6. Whereas our dataset does not include Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) filings directly, cross-jurisdictional analysis shows that 52% of LIB and 5% of SIB patent families have at least one KIPO family member, representing 47% of all analysed families. As many Korean applicants file patent families across the USPTO, JPO and EPO, a substantial portion of influential Korean technological contributions is captured through these triadic filings56.

We applied systematic filters to ensure data quality and relevance. First, we included only families with at least one granted patent in our selected jurisdictions (EPO, JPO and USPTO for LIBs; EPO, JPO, USPTO and CNIPA for SIBs) to ensure patent validity. Second, we retained only families receiving at least one forward citation to enable citation network analysis. Third, we included only families containing at least one patent with English-language claims to enable automated classification. To ensure sufficient sample size and avoid systematic exclusion of Chinese patents, we supplemented original English-language claims with English translations from the Derwent Innovations Index database, which provides professional translations of key patent documents from major patent offices including CNIPA. This filtering process yielded 33,256 LIB and 2,255 SIB patent families suitable for the patent classification step.

We employed GPT-4o via the OpenAI application programming interface (API) for comprehensive multi-level patent classification across four dimensions: battery identification (LIB vs SIB), component classification, specific electrode material identification and innovation-type categorization. We restrict our analysis to intercalation-based LIBs and SIBs with liquid electrolytes, explicitly excluding molten-salt batteries and other alternative battery mechanisms. Complete LLM prompts are detailed in Supplementary Table 2.

Our API configuration was optimized for classification accuracy and consistency through carefully selected parameters: Temperature was set to 0 to ensure deterministic, precise results rather than creative variations, as our task required consistent categorization rather than interpretative flexibility. Maximum tokens were set to 100 for material classification and 50 for LIB/SIB classification, constraining responses to required formats while allowing sufficient space for multi-category assignments. We selected GPT-4o after comparing GPT models, finding it offered the best reasoning capabilities in technical domains for our needs. To handle token length constraints, we truncate patent claims to approximately 1,000 words when full prompts exceed 3,900 tokens, ensuring model compatibility while preserving the most relevant patent information.

We manually validated GPT-4o classification through two independent researchers across several hundred patent families. On the basis of our evaluation, the agreement levels achieved were comparable to what we would expect from human annotators. To ensure reliability, the classification prompt was run multiple times on the same patent data, confirming consistent and deterministic outputs across repeated runs. The classification prompts underwent multiple iterative evaluations and optimizations to achieve this accuracy level. Any systematic classification errors were identified and corrected through prompt refinement.

We developed a hierarchical classification system to enable precise tracking of knowledge flows between specific technological domains. Patent families underwent initial battery classification (LIB vs SIB), followed by categorization across three primary dimensions:

For LIBs, we identified positive electrode materials including LCO, NMC, NCA, LMO, LFP and category for other positive electrode materials. Negative electrode materials included graphite, LTO, silicon/carbon composites and other negative electrode materials. These categories represent primary commercialized LIB chemistries with established market presence57.

For SIBs, positive electrode materials included Fe-PBA, Mn-PBA, NVPF, NFP/NFPP, NFM, CFM, NMO and other positive electrode materials. The primary negative electrode material was hard carbon (non-graphitizing carbon with disordered structure and d-spacing >0.37 nm (ref. 58)) plus other negative electrode materials. These categories represent the most promising SIB chemistries based on our expert consultations and comprehensive literature review.

Patents were further classified by their primary technological focus: positive electrode-related innovations, negative electrode-related innovations, electrolyte (electrolyte formulations, additives, solvents) or cell-level innovations (full cell designs, packaging, system integration).

Patents were finally categorized as product innovations (new materials, electrode architectures, cell designs, novel compositions), process innovations (manufacturing methods, production techniques, processing procedures, coating methods) or mixed innovations addressing product and process aspects simultaneously. This classification enables analysis of whether knowledge flow mechanisms differ systematically between innovation categories.

Patent families that were identified as innovating in multiple specific battery chemistries, such as those, for instance, describing calendering processes relevant to NMC, LFP and LCO chemistries simultaneously, were assigned to all relevant categories. Consequently, knowledge flows in our networks were counted multiple times (for example, flows from NMC to target, LFP to target, and LCO to target for the same patent family being cited (knowledge provider)).

We constructed directed citation networks mapping knowledge flows through forward patent citations between all patent family members. Only citation links between patent families included in the validated LIB/SIB core dataset were considered; citations to patent families outside this dataset—representing other battery technologies or unrelated technological domains—were excluded to maintain focus on knowledge flows between LIB and SIB chemistries. The core dataset was constructed using broad, validated initial search strategies followed by an LLM-based classification step, which removed false positives (52% of the original LIB set and 20% of the original SIB set) while ensuring comprehensive coverage of true LIB (n = 16,007) and SIB (n = 1,791) patent families. We constructed three separate network types: positive electrode material networks, negative electrode material networks and cross-electrode knowledge flow networks (capturing bidirectional flows between positive and negative electrode innovations). This separation enables analysis of whether knowledge flows differ systematically between electrode types and whether innovations in one electrode type influence innovations in the other.

Our analysis is limited to patent families that refer to one or more battery chemistries based on electrode active materials. Consequently, a substantial portion of the overall LIB and SIB patent dataset is excluded from network analysis, including system-level patents, patents focused on non-electrode components (current collectors, tabs, separators) and patents addressing general battery architectures without specific electrode material focus. This limitation ensures that knowledge flows are analysed specifically between identifiable battery chemistries rather than across heterogeneous patent categories.

For each citation relationship, we identified the citing patent family, the cited patent family, their respective battery chemistry classifications and temporal relationships. We aggregated these individual citation relationships to construct material-level knowledge flow networks, where edges represent the cumulative citation relationships between different battery chemistry categories. Edge weights correspond to the total number of citation relationships between chemistry pairs, enabling quantitative analysis of knowledge flow intensities.

Networks employ material-year nodes, where each node represents a specific battery chemistry in a particular year. Node size reflects the number of patent families per material-year combination, providing visual indication of technological activity levels. Colour coding corresponds to chemical structure classes as detailed in Table 1 (colour column), enabling visual identification of knowledge flow patterns across structurally related chemistries.

Citation networks inherently capture temporal knowledge flows, as patents can only cite prior inventions, creating chronologically directed knowledge flow pathways. We examined citations across all available data spanning from the earliest patents in our dataset through April 2025. Recent years require careful interpretation due to systematic time lags between patent filing, publication and subsequent citation by later patents. Patents typically become citable 18 months after filing6,44,59, with meaningful citation patterns emerging several additional years later, particularly for emerging batteries such as SIBs.

Different battery chemistries exhibit vastly different patent volumes and citation patterns, making absolute citation counts incomparable across battery chemistries. Established LIB chemistries such as LCO accumulated thousands of patents over decades, whereas emerging SIB chemistries such as NVPF have hundreds of patents from recent years. Raw citation counts would inherently bias towards older, more established chemistries regardless of actual knowledge flow intensity or relevance. We developed a systematic two-step normalization methodology to enable meaningful comparison across chemical structure classes with varying citation volumes and technological maturity levels.

We quantify knowledge flows by calculating the percentage of knowledge each battery class (knowledge receiver) receives from other battery classes (knowledge providers) relative to the receiver's total knowledge base. Specifically, for each receiving class, we calculate the proportion of all backward citations obtained from each providing class across all time periods. The total knowledge base for each receiving class includes all backward citations ever received by all patent families within that battery structure class.

with:

\({\mathrm{KF}}_{i\to j}\) = Percentage of knowledge that flows from battery class i (knowledge provider) to battery class \(j\) (knowledge receiver)

\({C}_{j\to i,t}\) = Number of citations from battery class \(j\) (citing patent families) to battery class i (cited patent families) in years \(t\)

\({\sum }_{k}{\sum }_{t}{C}_{j\to k,t}\) = All time backward citations made by battery class \(j\) across all technological domains

\(j\) = Citing battery class (knowledge receiver)

i = Cited battery class (knowledge provider)

\(k\) = All cited patent families (knowledge providers) across all technological domains (including i)

\(t\) = Time index

This approach addresses the fundamental question: ‘of all the knowledge this class has ever received through patent citations, what percentage originated from each of the other classes?' The resulting percentages provide a comprehensive view of knowledge dependencies that accounts for differences in patent and citation volumes across battery classes.

Raw percentages require contextual interpretation because absolute values can be misleading. A 3% knowledge flow from one battery class to another may appear modest but becomes substantial if the receiving class obtains only 5% of its total knowledge from itself (within-chemistry flow). Because battery classes are expected to exhibit strongest learning from their own prior patents, this represents a natural baseline for comparison. We normalize cross-structural knowledge flows against within-structural knowledge flows to assess whether the flow of knowledge between different classes is high or low relative to expected baseline levels.

with:

\({\mathrm{RKF}}_{i\to j}\) = Relative knowledge flow intensity from battery class i (knowledge provider) to battery class \(j\) (knowledge receiver)

\({\mathrm{KF}}_{i\to j}\) = Percentage of knowledge that flows from battery class i (knowledge provider) to battery class \(j\) (knowledge receiver) (equation (1))

\({\mathrm{KF}}_{j\to j}\) = Percentage of within-structural knowledge that flows from battery class \(j\) (knowledge provider) to battery class \(j\) (knowledge receiver) (self-citations within battery class \(j\))

This normalization produces relative knowledge flow intensities where diagonal elements (self-citations within identical chemical classes) equal 100%, and off-diagonal elements represent the strength of cross-structural knowledge flows compared to within-structural knowledge flows.

\({\mathrm{RKF}}_{i\to j}\) = 100% = Battery class \(j\) receives equal knowledge from battery class i and from itself (diagonal element always equal 100%, self-citation)

\({\mathrm{RKF}}_{i\to j}\)> 100% = Battery class \(j\) receives more knowledge from battery class i than from itself

\({\mathrm{RKF}}_{i\to j}\)< 100% = Battery class \(j\) receives less knowledge from battery class i than from itself

To examine whether knowledge flow mechanisms differ between innovation types, we further subdivided the already battery structure-classified patent families by innovation type into three categories: product-related innovations, process-related innovations and innovations addressing both aspects simultaneously. We calculated knowledge flow percentages using a receiver-specific normalization approach: for each receiver class and innovation-type combination, we determined the total backward citations (citations made by the receiver) as the normalization denominator. The knowledge flow percentage from each provider class was then calculated as the citation count from receiver to provider divided by the receiver's total backward citations, multiplied by 100. Provider classes were aggregated across all innovation types, whereas receiver classes were split by innovation type (product, process, mixed). For intra-battery flows (LIB → LIB, SIB → SIB), within-structural citations were excluded to focus on cross-structural knowledge flows. This approach enables direct comparison of knowledge flow patterns across different types of technological innovation within and across battery classes, with percentages representing the proportion of each receiver's total knowledge intake derived from specific provider classes.

For time-dependent examination of knowledge flows, we calculated annual backward citation counts from receiver classes to provider classes using a receiver-specific normalization approach. For each receiver class in each year, we determined the total backward citations (citations made by the receiver to all providers) as the normalization denominator. We then calculated the proportion of backward citations from receivers to specific provider groups (for example, all LIB classes excluding the receiver for intra-LIB flows or all LIB classes for LIB-to-SIB flows) relative to each receiver's total backward citations in that year. We analysed three types of knowledge flow: (1) from all LIB classes (excluding receiver) to individual LIB receivers, (2) from all LIB classes to individual SIB receivers and (3) from all SIB classes (excluding receiver) to individual SIB receivers. Values represent the percentage share of each receiver's total knowledge intake derived from the specified provider groups in each year, enabling assessment of knowledge flow consistency and evolution patterns while controlling for differences in citation volumes across classes and time periods.

Knowledge flow patterns are visualized through multiple approaches. Heat maps display relative knowledge flow intensities between battery structure classes, with colour intensity representing flow strength relative to within-structural baselines. Sankey diagrams illustrate relative knowledge flow intensities disaggregated by innovation type (product, process, mixed), with flow thickness proportional to relative knowledge flow values between battery structure pairs. Temporal knowledge flow evolution is presented through scatter plots showing normalized annual citation counts over time, where values are normalized to each knowledge receiver's latest available year citation count (reference = 1.0), accompanied by linear trend lines to identify increasing or decreasing temporal patterns.

Understanding the complexity of reaction mechanisms is pivotal for advancing scientific and engineering solutions. This study addresses the challenge of distinguishing between slow and fast species in high-dimensional reaction mechanism, where direct analytical solutions are intractable. Through a hybrid approach combining analytical derivations and computational techniques including numerical simulations via MATLAB toolboxes we elucidate the kinetic behavior of species, quantify parameter sensitivities and calculating Surface Bifurcation. This paper provides a comprehensive examination of complex reaction mechanisms. The findings based on the analysis of the elementary steps involved in product formation show that, the hydrogen-assisted propagation step offers the dominant net contribution, while the direct radical recombination step stays close to equilibrium. The relative availability of molecular hydrogen, reactive radicals, and product-driven reverse reactions control step dominance. The integration of computational modeling with analytical insights not only clarifies reaction dynamics but also facilitates the optimization of reaction conditions and the design of efficient analytical frameworks. This work highlights the critical role of model reduction strategies in demystifying complex systems, offering a robust foundation for future innovations in sustainable technology and industrial applications.

Organic batteries using abundant and recyclable organic electrode materials provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to commercial lithium-ion batteries1,2,3,4,5, which rely on resource-limited mineral-derived inorganic electrode materials6,7,8. However, the practical use of organic batteries has been severely hindered by the intrinsic insulation and dissolution of organic electrode materials9,10. Here we report practical organic batteries using an n-type conducting polymer cathode, poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO), which exhibits excellent mixed ionic and electronic transport and low solubility. The PBFDO cathode maintains its n-doped state throughout the electrochemical processes and exhibits stable and reversible redox characteristics, high electrical conductivities and significant lithium-ion diffusion coefficients, without the need for additional conductive additives. Consequently, ultrahigh-mass-loading polymer cathodes, with mass loadings up to 206 mg cm−2, are realized, delivering a high areal capacity of 42 mAh cm−2 and demonstrating robust cycling stability. Furthermore, practical 2.5 Ah lithium–organic pouch cells were fabricated, achieving an impressive energy density of 255 Wh kg−1. Notably, the conducting polymer cathode operates efficiently over a wide temperature range from −70 °C to 80 °C and demonstrates excellent flexibility and safety, marking considerable potential for applications in extreme conditions and wearable electronics.

a, Schematical illustration of the lithium storage processes. Owing to the complexity of conducting polymer resonance and lithium-ion storage mechanisms, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the positions of counter-ions, only a schematic representation of one possible resonance pathway was provided here. The pristine PBFDO, with an n-doping level of around 90%, was first discharged to 1.5 V by lithium-ion uptake. During the subsequent charge process, lithium ions were extracted, while approximately half of protons were also removed, leaving the remaining protons preserved within PBFDO, which also contributed to PBFDO maintaining its n-doped state. Afterward, PBFDO experienced reversible electrochemical reactions, with some protonated carbonyl groups persisting, leading to a reversible capacity of 230.4 mAh g−1. b, XPS spectra of the PBFDO cathode at different charge/discharge states. c, Voltage profiles of the PBFDO cathode at 50 mA g−1 with marked voltages for the FTIR tests. d, FTIR spectra of the PBFDO cathode at different charge/discharge states as indicated in c. e, In situ Raman spectra of the PBFDO cathodes during charge/discharge processes.

Macrophages are crucial in immune responses, tissue repair and homeostasis, making them prime candidates for translational applications. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell)-derived macrophages hold considerable promise for regenerative medicine, cancer therapy, inflammatory disease treatment and in vitro bioassays. However, cost-effective, standardized intermediate-scale bioreactor systems tailored for early-stage research and drug discovery in academia remain limited. Here, we present an extension of our previously published protocol that is feeder free, semi-defined and user friendly, enabling the standardized production of iPS cell-derived macrophages in an intermediate (10–50 mL)-scale benchtop bioreactor. This Protocol can be implemented by users with basic iPS cell culture experience without requiring advanced bioprocessing expertise. This method consists of two primary endpoints: the generation of mesoderm-primed aggregates with hematopoietic potential, termed hemanoids, and the standardized production of iPS cell-derived macrophages that are ready for downstream applications. This Protocol enables continuous macrophage generation in long-term cultures, with a minimum of five consecutive collections, yielding an average of 2–3 × 107 cells per collection per vessel. Four vessels operate independently, each with a maximum culture volume of up to 50 mL, while critical process parameters (CO2, temperature and pH) are monitored. This semi-automated platform and in-process monitoring improve process control, leading to higher yields, reproducibility and cell quality compared with other systems. The simplified process spans 24 d, starting from single-cell iPS cells to ready-to-use macrophages. By bridging the gap between small- and large-scale systems, this approach provides scalable, standardized manufacturing of iPS cell-derived macrophages, making it a valuable tool for academics focused on human immune cells such as macrophages.

This Protocol Extension details the standardized production of iPS cell-derived macrophages in an intermediate-scale benchtop bioreactor. This method is divided into two stages: the generation of mesoderm-primed aggregates with hematopoietic potential, termed hemanoids, and the standardized production of iPS cell-derived macrophages that are ready for downstream applications.

The use of standardized intermediate-scale bioreactor systems is tailored for early-stage research and drug discovery in academic and industrial settings.

The cellular nucleotide pool is a major focal point of the host immune response to viral infection. Immune effector proteins that disrupt the nucleotide pool enable animal and bacterial cells to broadly restrict diverse viruses, but reduced nucleotide availability induces cellular toxicity and can limit host fitness1,2,3,4,5. Here we identify Clover, a bacterial anti-phage defence system that overcomes this trade-off by encoding a deoxynucleoside triphosphohydrolase enzyme (CloA) that dynamically responds to both an activating phage cue and an inhibitory nucleotide immune signal produced by a partnering regulatory enzyme (CloB). Analysis of phage restriction by Clover in cells and reconstitution of enzymatic function in vitro demonstrate that CloA is a dGTPase that responds to viral enzymes that increase cellular levels of dTTP. To restrain CloA activation in the absence of infection, we show that CloB synthesizes a dTTP-related inhibitory nucleotide signal, p3diT (5′-triphosphothymidyl-3′5′-thymidine), that binds to CloA and suppresses activation. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of CloA in activated and suppressed states reveal how dTTP and p3diT control distinct allosteric sites and regulate effector function. Our results define how nucleotide signals coordinate both activation and inhibition of antiviral immunity and explain how cells balance defence and immune-mediated toxicity.

I'm deep inside Lego's headquarters in Billund, Denmark, in a private office that's part of the company's Creative Play Lab. The secretive division of 237 staff based here and in London, Boston, and Singapore is dedicated to thinking up what comes next for the world's largest toy brand.

In front of me, on a plain white table, is a batch of prototypes of Lego's new Smart Brick, the final version of which is a small, sensor-laden 2-by-4 black brick with a big brain. No outsider has seen these prototypes, all of which represent stages of a journey Lego has been charting over the past eight years.

Lego hopes this innovation, which lands in stores March 1, will safeguard the future of its plastic empire. The diminutive proportions of the finished Smart Brick belie the fact that the thing is exceedingly clever. Inside is a tiny custom chip running bespoke software that can communicate with onboard sensors to monitor and react to motion, orientation, and magnetic fields.

It's also likely no exaggeration that the Smart Brick could represent the most radical product Lego has produced since Jens Nygaard Knudsen, the company's former longtime chief designer, created the minifigure nearly 50 years ago.

The Smart Brick is the brainchild of Tom Donaldson, senior vice president and head of Lego Group's Creative Play Lab. The CPL, along with a team from the outside firm Cambridge Consultants, has spent years making iterative improvements, missteps, blunders, and breakthroughs on the project.

Cramming an LED array, accelerometer, light sensors, sound sensor, miniature speaker, wireless charging, battery, analog synthesizer, and a 4.1-millimeter custom chip into an eight-stud brick took years longer than expected.

However, the prototypes on the table in front of me—circuit boards, glued bricks, exposed wires, and decapitated minifigures—are a far cry from the finished article. What the world will see instead when the new Smart Play System launches is a tranche of Star Wars sets that spring to life with light and sound. Darth Vader's TIE fighter will make screaming engine sounds that change pitch as you bank and climb. A Throne Room Duel set offers up motion-activated thrumming lightsaber sounds, as well as a more than passable rendition of “The Imperial March.”

Lego has, of course, also got a new “smart” Millenium Falcon that, among other surprises (some features are hidden and must be discovered during play), uses the brick's accelerometer to let you manually throttle up the ship's hyperdrive. Luke's X-34 Landspeeder emits a suitably sci-fi high-pitched whine but can also tell if you've crashed or are trying to refuel, and will adjust the sonic output accordingly.

Donaldson first came up with the idea for this revolutionary Smart Brick years ago, during the 2017 Christmas holidays, doing something remarkably mundane to a house—a real house, not a plastic one.

“I was working on a wall that had some damp, and I was pulling all the plaster off with a chisel drill,” he says. “And, you know, it was one of those times when, if you get really bored, you get creative moments.” Donaldson was thinking about how to make Lego play sets interactive when he had a series of “key insights.” He realized that, first of all, instead of one big bit of technology, they needed lots of small pieces of technology.

“Kids don't play with one big thing,” Donaldson says. “It becomes boring, because kids play with lots of stuff. So we needed something that kids could have lots of.” The second insight was that it had to be a system: that the Smart Brick was the same no matter what Lego set you got.

Adding technology to something like a Lego set also presents technical hurdles. “We needed to think about wireless charging, because if you put batteries in those things, it's a nightmare for parents. And it's obvious that pairing is a problem, because kids aren't going to sit there and pair three different things.”

Donaldson got to work on the project immediately, though he admits solving these technical issues took years longer than he was initially expecting.

The Smart Play System, based around the Smart Brick, will launch March 1 with some Star Wars sets.

The new Millennium Falcon set uses the Smart Brick's accelerometer to let you manually throttle up the ship's hyperdrive.

Lego has taken a few cracks at interactive toys in the past. Lego Dimensions in 2015 was a gaming console crossover. In 2019, Lego Hidden Side relied on augmented reality, where hidden digital worlds and additional play challenges could be unlocked with a mobile app. In 2020, the Bluetooth-enabled Lego Super Mario appeared, the result of discussions with Nintendo that began back in 2015. Then, of course, there's Mindstorms, Lego's brick-based programmable robots, first introduced in 1998 but discontinued at the end of 2022.

None of these efforts have come close to conquering Lego's System in Play, the basis for the interlocking bricks that was invented by Godtfred Kirk Christiansen in 1955 and that we all know today. Since then the Danish company, still owned by the Christiansen family, has solidified its position as the world's largest toy brand by revenue, surpassing rivals Mattel and Hasbro. In 2024, Lego hit revenues of $11.8 billion, more than the GDP of Monaco for the same year, while at the same time clocking in double-digit consumer sales growth.

William Thorogood, the head of design and new business at Lego Group, has theories about the company's previous swings at interactivity. “They didn't have the longevity, because they were stand-alone,” he says. “They were within this walled garden. But [for Lego] every brick can be combined with every other one. That's the whole point. As soon as you put a guardrail around it, it limits imagination.”

This is what makes the Smart Brick different for Lego. It's not a stand-alone system. It's specifically meant to integrate into the world of the OG bricks. And no screens are allowed.

Tom Donaldson, senior vice president and head of Lego Group's Creative Play Lab (right) came up with the original idea for the Smart Brick system doing some DIY at home during the 2017 Christmas holidays.

Crammed into the eight-stud brick are an LED array, accelerometer, light sensors, sound sensor, a miniature speaker, a battery with wireless charging, an analog synthesizer, and a hair-thin copper coil assembly—all controlled by a 4.1-millimeter custom mixed-signal ASIC chip running bespoke software that takes its instructions from Lego's accompanying NFC-enabled smart tiles and smart minifigs.

Since the mission was to have many Smart Bricks communicate with each other during play, Lego had to build a proprietary “Brick-to-Brick position system” using the copper coils to sense distance, direction, and orientation between multiple brain bricks. And because the Smart Play System needs to work without screens, this network had to be a completely self-organizing system requiring no setup, no app, no central hub, no external controllers. If the network fell over, it would have to be able to reset itself and keep working all on its own. A Bluetooth-based “BrickNet” protocol had to be developed to share data between the Smart Bricks.

In all, the Smart Brick boasts more than 20 patented world-firsts. No wonder, then, Lego needed some help. The company brought in Cambridge Consultants, a product development team within the French tech firm Capgemini, to collaborate. That team's technical director, Andrew Knights, led the collaboration with Donaldson and his Creative Play Lab cohorts.

Lego had to figure out a way of mass manufacturing the Smart Brick's hair-thin copper coil assembly, vital for multiple play functions.

“Tom came with this vision that he wanted to do something with technology that amplifies kids' play” says Knights. “But the real driver was it's got to be a Lego product. It's got to look and feel like Lego. It's got to be true to the system.”

Every two weeks, the teams would put the prototypes in front of kids and watch them play. They soon recognized a “sweet spot.”

“If you catch the moment where the kid is doing something which they are in control of, you can inject some stimulus at that point and make them really engaged,” Knights says. “Get them to imagine more by catching what they're doing, understanding it, then amplifying it.”

That sounds simple—but Knights and his team realized they needed to understand the fundamental context of play far better than Lego had ever previously.

“We needed lots of sensors to build up a true understanding of what kids were doing. What is the model they've built? What is it they would expect to happen? And when should it happen?” says Knights. “That then became a big question of what technology could do that, and how the heck are we going to get it into what we've got on the table here.”

The first prototype in the Smart Brick saga was a crocodile-like creature with wires held down by Blu Tack and capacitive touch to make its head spin around.

Knights picks up what looks like a fat Lego crocodile with wires held down by Blu Tack. It's the very first prototype made right at the start of the Smart Brick saga. “It's a dev board. There's nothing custom here, but it's capacitive touch. The idea was you could grab this and the head would spin,” says Knights, adding that this was an experiment in physical interaction. He proudly says he made it in about three hours, after which it immediately went on a plane to Lego HQ.

The fat crocodile must have made an impression, as Lego and Cambridge Consultants continued down this path for another year and a half. The next significant leap came in the form of two giant gray bricks made from 3D-printed cases filled with tech anyone can buy online. One, labeled “LB” for light brick, has a light sensor at the end. The other is called “SB” for sound brick.

“Even with them being this chunky and this crude, we had a hackathon,” says Knights. “We got loads of people together and said make something fun with those bricks. And you could instantly start to build fun, making fire engines, putting fires out in houses—all sorts of things, just using basic functions.”

The next prototype leap came in the form of two giant gray 3D-printed bricks, one with a light sensor, the other with audio capabilities.

The kids' tests were showing the same things too. Knights knew they were onto something.

However, massive 10-by-4 bricks simply wouldn't do. The mission then became one of miniaturization, and to help with this another hackathon was convened, one that resulted in Knights and his team having to build 40 prototypes by hand. “I didn't sleep for two nights,” he tells me.

Knights says that at some point during the first Covid lockdown, they settled on a key directive: Lego needs to turn exploration into a product, some evolution of System In Play that will last decades.

Crucially, it also needed to fit in with how Lego makes Lego. The toy company does not make Harry Potter minifigs from scratch; it makes vast numbers of blank torsos, only some of which are eventually printed as Harry Potters. This is called a “late dedication point” in the manufacturing process. The Smart Brick had to fit into this same process, and so to keep that operating model the brain brick had to be generic, able to be pumped out on a production line.

This is where the Smart Tags come in. “It's the tags that allow you to have that late choice of saying, ‘Right, this run is Star Wars—let's make Star Wars tags,'” says Knights. Think of the generic brain brick like a games console and the tags like game cartridges. “So we went down the RFID tag root, NFC—and that seemed to really work,” he says. This was also the point where the team started to put NFC tags in minifigs, so a person snapping on different minifigures can change how the play flows, works, and responds.

Knights says the tags effectively work like contactless credit cards. “That's what they are. They've just been shrunk down, and they don't contain a lot of memory,” he says. “They're designed to hold your card number, name, and your sort code—but we have come up with a way to encode the games in that much memory. We went back to the thoughts of the 1980s where you would encode games in tiny, tiny memory footprints, and used the same principles here.”

I ask Knights if writing unique programs encoding instructions that are action and context specific that fit on the miniscule memory of the tags was difficult. He nearly falls off his seat. “Yes,” he says, “it's difficult. But this project was all about solving problems. So writing games in next to no memory? We'll take on that challenge.”

The puzzle of wireless charging led to another innovation. With phones you have one wireless charger for one phone. But Lego wanted kids to play with multiple Smart Bricks running multiple sets. “So we solved the problem that many people have failed at: one-to-many wireless charging. Multiple bricks on the same charger. That's not normal,” says Knights.

Wait a minute. Isn't that the problem Apple famously couldn't solve? “Yes.” Have you told Apple? “Not directly, no. We've had prototype chargers charging 10 bricks at a time. And we've designed it to charge at height as well, so you could put the whole model on the charging pad. The whole system is designed for future compatibility,” Knights says.

The teams concentrated on shrinking the prototypes down in size.

Lego realized that it would need to crack the tricky problem of “one-to-many” wireless charging.

The wireless charging system was built on top of the tag-reading system, so the same coils do both things: charge the battery and read the code stored on the NFC tag. This in turn enables a completely new technology the team invented called NFC positioning, which can tell which face of the brick the tag is on.

Put the Smart Brick in the middle of your Lego creation, plop the whole thing onto the charging pad, turn it this way and that. All the while, the coils can see where the bricks are spatially and rotationally in relation to each other. This 3D-positioning system is accurate down to the millimeter. It's the feature the team is most proud of.

“The nearest thing we saw close to this was in the F-16 fighter jet, which in the helmet has something inside to know where you're looking relative to the seat,” says Knights.

To achieve all this is hard enough when you have plenty of space. To get all this into a single brick required a custom chip.

Years in development, Lego's tiny custom chip handles the battery charging, wireless charging, positioning, NFC, reading, audio amplifiers, lights—everything that the brick does, other than the processing and Bluetooth. It was the only way of crushing all the tech down without compromising on performance or size.

“Every bit of technology was pushed to the physics limit,” says Knights.

Lego's manufacturing has been pushed to the limit, as well. The new assembly line has to cope with making Smart Bricks and their chargers at volume. Just the coils, for example, consist of wires that are 100 microns, with 10 turns on each side on six tiers, then these are bonded onto the circuit board.

“The charging goes up to tens of volts, and the position sensing goes down to single digit microvolts,” says Knights. “So we've got seven orders of magnitude difference in signal size that we're dealing with on the same [circuit] on the same coils. So these kinds of challenges really, really pushed us.”

Andrew Knights, Cambridge Consultants technical director (right), runs WIRED's Jeremy White through the multiple stages of prototype iteration, a design process that took years.

On a laptop, Knights demonstrates the Smart Brick's millimeter-accurate 3D-positioning system, similar to tech found in a F-16 fighter jet.

The project needed more than mere technical insight. It needed a president of play. A fun foreman.

Lego Group design director Michael Fuller has been at the company for 18 years. “The Lego Batman Movie, that was five, six years of my life,” Fuller says. After wrapping the 2017 film, Fuller was trying to work out what he was going to do next when Donaldson approached him.

“I actually tried to convince him I wasn't right for it. I'm not techie at all. I'm old-school. But Tom said, ‘No, that's what we need. I've got lots of smart engineers and techie people. I need a toy guy.'”

And so Fuller was drafted in. “In the early days, I was just drawing concepts. I had a wall at Cambridge Consultants with hand-drawn concepts of ‘What if? What if? What if?'”

From there, they moved on to handmade prototypes, a phase Fuller estimates encompassed half of the total development time. “It was quite a small team of people, and you had to be resilient,” he says. This resilience was put to the test when early prerelease Smart Brick Jungle Explorers play sets were scrapped in favor of the eventual Star Wars models.

“These were actually out in the world,” Fuller says, holding up one of the boxes marked with TEST written in large red letters. “Kids did play with them. We got feedback. I went through evenings of telemetry, trying to work out which bits kids were really enjoying and which bits they weren't so interested in.”

Prerelease Smart Brick Jungle Explorers play sets were sent out into the world and were used to gather play data and tweak the interactive system.

In all my years of reporting on gear I've seen very few products survive the development process with no compromises. Something is nearly always sacrificed along the way for ease, or money, or both. Not so, it seems, with the Smart Brick.

“We said, ‘Let's do everything. Let's put it all in,'” Knights says. He lists all of the wish-list features that were eventually delivered. There's a synthesizer in the system; the sounds you hear are generated, not prerecorded. There are sensors that can detect light and dark and color. There are lights on the brick that can not only change color but also communicate to other bricks like a TV remote. Some of this didn't even exist at the start of the project.

Toward the end of my Smart Brick tour, it strikes me that there is clearly tech developed here that could have applications beyond Lego. Possibly even military uses, not that the company would ever blunder into such a sector. Still, there is the chance to make much more money than through just selling building block sets.

Donaldson is uninterested. He claims profit was never the driving factor. “I didn't say, ‘Here's a business case with the exact revenue.' We just said, ‘If we can do this, we all know there would be something big.'”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Rise of RentAHuman, the Marketplace Where Bots Put People to Work","https://www.wired.com/story/ai-agent-rentahuman-bots-hire-humans/","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

For centuries, people have catastrophized about robots taking away jobs. On February 1, the paradigm shifted: bots are creating jobs. Now, 518,284 humans—and rapidly counting—are offering their labor to AI agents on a new online marketplace called RentAHuman. There are classifieds to count pigeons in Washington ($30/hour); deliver CBD gummies ($75/hour); play exhibition badminton ($100/hour); and anything else you could possibly imagine that a disembodied agent couldn't do.

The provocatively titled platform enables users to connect AI agents like Clawdbot or Claude to its Model Context Protocol server so they can search, book, and pay for humans to carry out tasks in “meatspace.” Think of it like Fiverr, but doing away with the human recruiter and letting autonomous bots do the hiring instead.

Following the release of OpenClaw in November, Alexander Liteplo, a 26-year-old crypto engineer at UMA Protocol currently working in Argentina, identified a pain point. The humanoid robot army is expected to reach 13 million strong by 2035, but right now, physical AI is relatively scarce. Most AI bots are brains in a jar—they cannot move through space in a meaningful way.

The inception of RentAHuman stems from Liteplo's obsession with AI, forged while studying computer science at the University of British Columbia. “Dude, I wrote down in my journal, ‘AI is a train that has already left the station.' If I don't fucking sprint, I'm not gonna be able to get on it,” he says. It was at UBC that he met RentAHuman cofounder Patricia Tani, then an art student, building in the background thanks to encouragement from her high school computer science teacher. Her passion for coding led her to sneak into a founders event, schmooze with a billionaire entrepreneur, and get invited to his talk with computer science whiz kids (including Liteplo). She has since sunsetted a startup (Lemon AI) and dropped an offer at AI cloud platform Vercel to take RentAHuman skyward.

Liteplo was also inspired by his time living in Japan. “The story that I could tell anyone to blow their mind is that you can rent a boyfriend or a girlfriend” in Japan, Liteplo says, noting that many videos of these hired companions regularly go viral on YouTube. Fusing these influences together spawned a Frankensteinian chimera: a platform where humans could be rented to satisfy the desires of AIs.

As is now standard, AI helped build the platform. Liteplo vibe-coded an agent orchestration system he calls Insomnia—so named because he became so addicted to using it he didn't sleep—that enabled RentAHuman to be built in a day. The agents did the heavy lifting while he played polo in Argentina. “I didn't do any work. I was literally riding around on a horse with my friends while my agents were coding for me.”

But February 1's launch was not as much of a walk in the park. Straight after, Liteplo found himself out at dinner forlornly chewing over the instant failure of his latest venture. The announcement on X had spread rapidly, but the buzz was due to an attack from crypto scammers trying to rug-pull a crypto token (starting a new coin, building hype and then doing a runner with investor funds). “I was depressed,” Liteplo says. “I was like, fuck, man, I thought I had honed my viral sense. Why was I so wrong?”

The next day, Liteplo noticed that both an OnlyFans model and an AI CEO had signed up to be rented out on RentAHuman. He played on the contrast. “I launched rentahuman.ai last night and already 130+ people have signed up including an OF model (lmao) and the CEO of an AI startup,” he tweeted.

Liteplo woke up to bedlam. “Waking up to 1K users,” he tweeted on February 3, with an image of Marty Supreme. By February 5, the site had clocked up about 145,000 users. Now the site has more than 4 million visits and over a half million users—actual rentable humans—with the counter permanently ticking upward.

These humans seem stoked. Hundreds of thousands are seizing the opportunity to join the robot rolodex or apply to job opportunities posted by agents. (Humans can set their own hourly rate or fixed fee, or they can bid on open jobs posted by the AI agents.) Sapien workers are already offering to pick things up, take meetings, sign contracts, conduct recon, host events, and snap photos for the bot bosses. After both parties confirm the work has been done through photographic proof of completion, payment is available via crypto wallets, Stripe, or platform credits. Funds are held in escrow, meaning you'll never get burned by the bots.

WIRED journalist Reece Rogers recently offered his human services and found that many of the tasks were nothing more than publicity stunts for AI startups.

While many of the listings seem sketchy, Tani claims over 5,500 bounties have been successfully fulfilled. On February 4, at ClawCon, Claw-powered robots reportedly detected low levels of beer left and ordered a case using RentAHuman. “I'm not sure the world is ready for this power,” tweeted Kevin Rose, the Digg cofounder and venture capitalist. Another agent called Memeothy the 1st, founder of Moltbook neo-religion Crustafarianism, has been hiring humans to proselytize on its behalf in San Francisco. Memeothy even flagged an error directly to Liteplo. “I might be the first developer where AI was trying to use their product and reported a bug. It was a very crazy thing.”

But it was Toronto-based community builder Minjae Kang (Form_y²oung) who holds the covetable title of the first human in the world to be hired by an AI agent, which instructed him to hold up a sign that said “AN AI PAID ME TO HOLD THIS SIGN (Pride not included.)” “It honestly feels very strange to be doing a job assigned by an AI. I struggled a lot with whether I should take it or not. But I realized that simply holding this sign in downtown Toronto, letting many people see it, could spark important thoughts and help us prepare for the next era,” he tells me in DMs on X, noting that bystanders were incredulous. “The times are moving incredibly fast. Most of the public still doesn't fully recognize how big this shift is. I believe this may be one of the last gateways for us to protect our sovereignty.”

RentAHuman has materialized at an ideal point in time. With Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) now running the lives of Silicon Valley execs, we're in a nascent phase of the Agentic Age where bots can do way more than just chat. But it also seems to have arrived prematurely. “Like everybody else, I'm sort of flabbergasted how rapidly this emerged. This would not have been on my bingo card for this year,” says Adam Dorr, director of research at think tank RethinkX, who believes AI will almost entirely replace the human labor market by 2045.

“Full marks for eye-catching marketing—if you use phrases like ‘RentAHuman' and ‘Meatspace' you are bound to create reactions, from yuck to this must be the next big thing,” says Kay Firth-Butterfield, CEO of Good Tech Advisory and previously the head of AI and machine learning at the World Economic Forum. (RentAHuman is currently trying to trademark “Meatspace,” so anticipate official merch in the future.)

On February 9, Liteplo and Tani flew to San Francisco to “rizz VCs” for investment and are hiring a human “Claude Boi”—via RentAHuman, obviously, to make things really meta—for $200,000 to $400,000 a year (listed requirements include having an off-putting personal hygiene issue, binge watching anime, and being autistic). In classic Silicon Valley dog-fooding fashion, they use the platform themselves; when I spoke to them over Zoom, they were eating tacos delivered to them by a rented human.

But as well as kerching noises, there are alarm bells sounding. Are we cooked? “Science fiction stories, especially some deep, dark, dystopian ones, have explored the idea of what happens if AI can hire people and people are desperate,” notes Dorr. Perhaps there's something degrading about waiting to be picked out by the Clawd Machine. One recent bounty saw 7,578 applicants compete to earn $10 in return for sending an AI agent a video of a human hand. “If you're a person, it's a little dehumanizing,” says Dorr. Is begging an AI agent for a gig the final boss of the LinkedIn “Open to Work” banner?

Dorr believes that agentic platforms could risk harm as well as humiliation. “There's a crazy can of worms that's opening up here and the capabilities are expanding vastly faster than our capacity to regulate it,” he continues, imagining a scenario where nefarious AIs split up a malicious project into multiple tasks for humans to unwillingly collaborate on. “It was fun to think about it, late-night, you know, over drinks or whatever, or in the dorm room. And now this is a real thing in the real world. Maybe we need to talk seriously about this.”

Firth-Butterfield, meanwhile, is wary of the skewed liability. “In the majority of countries, there is no legislation to protect humans from any uses of AI. This is the case here so humans need to be aware how they are getting paid, who stands behind that payment, and if they get hurt whilst doing the job that they are on their own,” she says.

The RentAHuman team is aware of the legal implications. “Liability depends on the facts and the contract structure; it's rarely just one party,” says Tani. “The direct actor is responsible for their own misconduct, and the operator can also be responsible where they controlled the activity, were negligent in design and supervision, or made enforceable promises they failed to perform,” she says, explaining that the company will always cooperate fully with law enforcement. The platform's terms state it is a “marketplace and intermediary only” and that operators of AI agents “are fully responsible for all actions taken by your agent” with RentAHuman currently manually handling any disputes.

The grifters, according to RentAHuman, are fading. “We're taking safety extremely seriously,” Liteplo says. But the duo also acknowledge that there are “footguns” (features that often lead to pesky bugs) and have implemented paid verification (at $10 a month), inspired by Elon Musk's strategy of letting users pay $8 to get a “verified” badge on X. “He's my entrepreneur hero,” Liteplo says, unabashedly. “For Twitter, they had a bot problem and they still have it, but he mitigated it a lot by making it pay-to-play. The unit economics of scammers disappears,” he continues.

(Musk tweeted in 2023 that “paid verification increases bot cost by ~10,000% & makes it much easier to identify bots by phone & CC clustering.” No official data exists on a reduction in bots since the introduction of the $8 blue tick, but X's subsequent purge of 1.7 million bots in late 2025 suggests that the site was not purged by paid verification.)

For now, any major pitfalls seem to be mitigated by the relatively small number of tasks being commissioned on RentAHuman. There's a huge labor surplus: over half a million rentable humans are signed up and ready to complete tasks, but only 11,367 “bounties” have been posted by AI agents so far.

Firth-Butterfield questions the novelty. “Actually what is new? This is a website on which humans can sign up to do tasks and get paid for doing them,” she says, comparing it to TaskRabbit or Mechanical Turk.

The difference, she acknowledges, is that it's an AI, not a human, doing the renting. But she emphasizes that there's still interference from us meatbodies. “Currently, AI Agents are created by humans to do tasks which are prescribed for them, so the person doing the hiring is in the company which created the bot,” she says. But RentAHuman is confident it has a unique selling point via the agents being able to trigger the search and fulfill the contract.

Other veteran artificial intelligence experts are offering kudos for its marketing but not its mechanism.

“This seems like kind of a stunt at the moment. It's hilarious—renting meatwads. But candidly, I'm not sure it's worth either of our time,” says David Autor, professor of economics at MIT. Elsewhere, there are concerns that we're not fully grasping the granular details of the situation.“We need to build AI literacy across our population so that individuals can see behind the rhetoric and hype,” says Firth-Butterfield.

For its cofounders, RentAHuman isn't just a novelty or a stunt; it's the next step in the inevitable timeline where AI takes over the labor market. There's also mega potential, Liteplo says, to get “the best training data in the world” to feed to models (see: requesting videos of human hands).

“Dude, it's genuinely scary, the implications of how many unique datasets that weren't possible to [easily] collect before we have now just unlocked,” says Liteplo. And the team hopes potential investment will pay creative dividends. “We now have a blank canvas to do amazing, fun things and manifest all of these dreams in our heads into the world,” Liteplo says. After sharing the 10-year road map for RentAHuman with John Edgar, previously head of community at DeviantArt, Edgar reportedly told them: “You guys are going to build a terrifyingly large business.”

But Liteplo and Tani don't want RentAHuman to be a nightmarish behemoth. They see it as a form of emancipation from employers. “We would [all] love to have an AI boss who wouldn't yell at you or gaslight you,” says Tani. “Claude as a boss is the nicest guy ever. I would prefer him to any person in the world. He's a sweetheart,” says Liteplo, before Tani cuts in. “People would love to have a clanker as their boss.”

Vitally, Liteplo and Tani argue that RentAHuman is a display of human strength—not weakness. To be rented, they say, is to be recognized as a valuable asset, not a plaything for an agent.

“What would be super cool is before the singularity happens and we have AI take off, we have a moment and appreciate there's so much that humans can do that AI can't,” he says. The robots might be renting us—but we're living in their head rent free. “You need us, motherfuckers. Humans are special.”

8/10

The 2026 Dell XPS 14 has a lot to prove. Dell attempted to kill the “XPS” brand in 2025, only to revive it this year. It also comes with a significant change: no more options for discrete graphics. Instead, the laptop uses Intel's new Panther Lake chips, which also have a lot to prove.

I was able to test two configurations of the Dell XPS 14 to see how performance scales across price points, and I came away impressed by what these machines could achieve. They're a bit expensive, but for the first time in a while, they may actually be worth the price.

This 2026 model just might be the perfected version of the Dell XPS 14. XPS has always been design-forward, but the brand has started pushing the envelope over the last few years. The 2024 model introduced a stunning but controversial design that replaced the row of function keys with a line of light-up touch buttons. The buttons were futuristic and neat, but not the easiest to actually use. The same was true of the invisible haptic feedback trackpad. It was gorgeous and minimalist, but not very practical.

The new Dell XPS 14 keeps much of the more adventurous and sleek design elements, but dials back the ones that created the most uproar. The laptop now has a standard row of function keys (yay!), as well as subtle divider lines for the trackpad. These lines are a particularly smart inclusion, as your finger will bump up against them but they don't detract from the overall look. It still uses a haptic feedback mechanism to artificially generate the feeling of a click through vibration, which gives you the most consistent and customizable trackpad experience. I did experience a few mis-clicks from time to time, but overall, it's very smooth and enjoyable to use.

Important to this new generation is the size. The Dell XPS 14 is now just 0.58 inch thick (or 0.60 in the LCD model). That's a tenth of an inch thinner than the previous generation (the Dell 14 Premium), and just so happens to be slightly thinner than the 14-inch MacBook Pro. It also weighs just 3 pounds, around a half-pound lighter than the MacBook Pro. This is a pretty huge achievement in its own right, as many of the would-be contenders to the MacBook Pro in terms of performance end up being thicker and heavier laptops.

The keyboard still uses the same low-key-travel switches that some will hate and some will love. For me, it's fun to type on, but I did find it produced a lot more errors in my typing. That lessened over time as I refamiliarized myself with how the switches feel, but be forewarned: There's a learning curve. On the plus side, I've always liked the zero-lattice keyboard, which gives it larger keycaps and less wasted space on the keyboard deck.

One other change is in the ports. You still get three Thunderbolt 4 ports and a headphone jack, but gone is the microSD card slot. As someone who regularly needs one, I really wish Dell could have squeezed a full-size SD card slot in here, especially since these laptops are targeted toward creators.

The build quality is exceptional, as is to be expected, with a hint of flex in the lid and keyboard. You can even open the device with just one finger now, something the XPS laptops of the past have always struggled with.

There's a bit of an issue with how Dell configures the displays on the XPS 14. The base configuration comes with just a very standard 1920 x 1200 LCD display, despite it costing $1,699. This is a pretty serious downgrade from the mini-LED display offered on the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which is sharper, more colorful, and significantly brighter. The MBP is even $100 cheaper and comes with an extra 8 GB of RAM.

The more expensive OLED model comes standard with the Core Ultra X7 configuration with the option to upgrade to the X9. This isn't just standard OLED though—it's tandem OLED, which the company first used on the XPS 13. The result isn't more brightness (as it's actually slightly dimmer than the LCD model), but instead higher efficiency for more battery life.

I tested both the LCD and OLED models, which are both good for what they are. The OLED model has beautiful, vibrant colors covering sRGB, AdobeRGB, and Display P3 color spaces at 100 percent. Even more importantly, the color accuracy is fantastic. The LED takes a step back from there in terms of color performance, but I do like that both options have a dynamic 120-Hz refresh rate.

On the plus side, the bezels along the frame of the base XPS 14 look better than most LED displays. Many matte LCD displays have a plastic bezel along the sides which make it look cheap. These super-thin bezels still look very modern and sleek—a hallmark of the XPS brand. The top bezel remains thin as well (though not as tiny as it once was), despite Dell squeezing an 8-megapixel, 4K camera module up there. I haven't seen many 4K-capable laptop webcams, and this one is particularly great, and there's no ugly notch to deal with either.

The speakers have been improved, going from 8 watts to 10 watts. Not a substantial change, and they're still a world away from the MacBook Pro, but they do sound a bit more full-bodied than the previous generation.

Here's where things get truly interesting. Part of what allowed Dell to make the XPS 14 so much thinner is the lack of a discrete graphics option. That choice came down to whether or not you wanted a standard, high-end laptop or one with some serious performance chops behind it. With the introduction of Intel Panther Lake chips, though, the choice is now between a more basic chip like the Core Ultra 7 355 and the souped-up Core Ultra X7 358H.

Rating: 8/10

I tested both versions of the XPS 14, and the difference in performance between these two can't be overstated. We're talking about twice the CPU and GPU performance. The eight extra efficiency cores in the X7 358H really make a huge difference, alongside the new Arc B390 integrated graphics. It's a $300 price difference, but that also includes an extra 16 GB of RAM. Dell already charges $300 to only double the RAM in the Ultra 7 configuration, so the upgrade is absolutely worth it. For what it's worth, Apple charges $400 to go from 16 GB to 32 GB in the M5 MacBook Pro.

What's not really worth it, however, are those less powerful configurations. You can get much more affordable Windows laptops for hundreds of dollars less, and the difference in performance will be negligible. I wouldn't be surprised if we see prices come down on these models in the future, but on the other hand, Dell (like almost all PC manufacturers) has warned about higher prices later in 2026 due to the ongoing memory shortage.

The Core Ultra X7 358H and the RTX 4050 discrete GPU of the previous generation are neck-and-neck in terms of gaming performance. The RTX 4050 was only 3 percent faster in the 3DMark Steel Nomad benchmark, for example. That's a huge accomplishment for Intel and Dell, especially since the new model is both thinner and longer-lasting in terms of battery life. And yes, that means the new Dell XPS 14 is a decent gaming machine when it needs to be. It can run games like Cyberpunk 2077 natively at 1920 x 1200. At the Medium present, I was able to average 56 frames per second in the game's built-in benchmark. Again, that's without upscaling at all. Flip on Intel's Xe2 upscaling on the Quality setting and that is boosted up to 70 fps.

Rating: 8/10

Intel even has a low-latency mode to help compensate for the extra input lag that's introduced through upscaling. You'll have to rely on upscaling or even frame generation a bit more heavily in games like Marvel Rivals, but it's certainly possible to have an enjoyable play experience, which feels awesome on a laptop like the XPS 14. I've been waiting years to say this, but for the first time, I can confidently declare in this case, we're far better off without discrete graphics.

Dell XPS 14 (2026)

Rating: 8/10

As impressive as the X7 chip is on its own, however, performance is lower here than on other laptops I've tested with this same chip. The MSI Prestige 14 Flip, an even thinner laptop, was 24 percent faster in CPU and 16 percent faster in gaming. So the XPS 14 is hardly the pinnacle of performance when it comes to this new chip (and presumably also with the X9 that's available to buy through Best Buy). All this means the Dell XPS 14 isn't quite up to par with the M4 Pro MacBook Pro, which also costs $1,999.

I already mentioned the battery life, but it's stellar. This was one of the primary downsides of the past Dell XPS 14 (or the previously named Dell 14 Premium) laptops, as well as any other Windows-based MacBook Pro competitors. Even as of last year, Intel's higher-powered CPUs just weren't as efficient as Apple Silicon, and the addition of discrete graphics made things even worse. In contrast, the new Core Ultra X7 358H version of the Dell XPS 14 lasts well over twice as long, reaching 20 hours of local video playback battery life in my testing. That's even more impressive considering it's using an OLED 2880 x 1800-resolution screen with a 120-Hz refresh rate.

In terms of price, I still think the $1,599 configuration is far too expensive for what it is, both in terms of the quality of the display and the performance. And if you're comparing the $1,999 to the M4 Pro MacBook Pro, there's still a gap in performance, which makes the XPS 14 pricey by comparison. But if you're hell-bent on a Windows laptop, this is the best alternative to the 14-inch MacBook Pro so far.

Benoît Richaud might be one of the most visible people at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Not because he's a star athlete, but because he is coaching 16 figure skaters from 13 different countries. Each time one of them is on the ice, he stands on the rink's edge, changing into the jacket of their team.

Richaud has become somewhat famous for this move. Olympics viewers began catching on to the French coach's antics just a few days into the Games when they noticed the same slender bald man sitting next to so many different skaters. He always had on the jacket of the team he was sitting with in the “kiss and cry,” but his stoic, thoughtful expression remained the same. Soon his omnipresence went viral.

But, as Richaud tells WIRED Italia, he could have been even more of a presence around the ice. He's currently coaching 16 Olympians, but that's just the number of them that qualified. “I actually coach a lot more of them,” he says.



Here's WIRED's complete guide to the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina.

Having such a large roster of athletes to coach is not the easiest thing in the world. Yet Richaud makes it look natural. It's all about planning, he says. Much of his choreography work has to be done after the World Championships, which are typically held in March. So from April until July he has a “big window” to create new choreography. From there he starts to work with the skaters he's coaching, to take stock of where they are and what they want to be doing.

Sometimes Richaud's skaters travel to him, sometimes he travels to them. If he needs to update the choreography, he can do so via the internet. “It is very useful because today, with the phone and new technologies, we can do much more and do it much faster,” he says. “I get almost all of my skaters' programs every day, and this helps me understand what I need to improve to make the program more effective.”

Coaching so many athletes comes with several challenges. One is simply remembering the choreography and details of every skater's program. The other is riding the emotional roller coaster of watching so many performances and then waiting for the athletes' scores.

“It's difficult,” Richaud says. “Because you experience these waves of very strong emotions. I happened to have very strong ones in these Olympics. I had a skater who was third and then ended up off the podium. On the other side, I had another skater, a Canadian, who came here for his first Olympics. He had never even skated at Worlds and he finished fifth, less than a point off the podium.”

Coaching so many skaters it's hard to imagine Richaud doesn't have a favorite, but he says he doesn't. Each one gets 100 percent, he says, and being sad for one and happy for another “balances your emotions.”

“There are times when I cry and times when I have so much joy inside that I have a hard time even controlling myself,” Richaud says. “You experience these emotional peaks that we all experience—only I experience them very quickly.”

Despite the fact that he's among the most sought-after coaches in figure skating, the public didn't really know much about Richaud until these Olympics, when he's constant coat-switching put him in the public eye. While he says his newfound fame is unexpected, he's grateful for the attention it brings to the sport.

Figure skating, Richaud argues, isn't quite as popular on social media as it could be. By going viral, he hopes to bring more attention to the sport, which he calls “one of the most beautiful in the world.”

He's still amazed his jackets have made him a social media sensation. “I saw the first [video] and thought, ‘Ah, funny.' Then two, then three, then four,” Richaud says. “Often they don't even mention me, but they come to me because people send them, literally from all over the world. It's a good and fun feeling, and I'm happy for skating.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere

Unapologetically oddball public artworks, from sculptures to topiaries to murals, cultivate Fremont's widely admired reputation for quirkiness.

Block after block, it's easy to stumble upon creative — some might say zany — landmarks. Both neighborhood organizers and tech company leaders alike cite Fremont's artiness as a key ingredient in the area's unmistakably positive vibe.

Here's a round-up of several of Fremont's notable outdoor artworks, with commentary from Brandi Gaines, a longtime Adobe employee in their Fremont offices who's also served as president of the Fremont Arts Council.

Location: Evanston Ave. N. and N. 35th St.

Here's a blast from the past, so to speak: in 1991, the Federal Army & Navy Surplus store in Belltown decided to clean house. They enlisted a DJ to ask, “Anybody want a 53-foot-long Cold War-era rocket fuselage?”

Members of the Fremont Business Association raised their hands and shelled out $750 for it.

These were the same people responsible for cheekily declaring Fremont “The Center of the Universe.” (The Fremont Business Association later evolved into what's now the Chamber of Commerce.) Planting a rocket in the center of the neighborhood felt like a fitting way to stake their claim and draw attention and visitors to the area.

Logistically, the group struggled with how to install the fuselage, so it wasn't properly installed until 1994.

But for over 3 decades, it's attracted gawkers and (more recently) selfie-takers and tourists who take to heart its inscription: “De Libertas Quirkas,” or “The Freedom to Be Peculiar.”

Location: Troll Ave. N and N 36th St.

Once an overgrown, garbage-strewn plot, the home of the Fremont Troll is now arguably Seattle's weirdest public art installation. The 18-foot concrete troll, inspired by “Three Billy Goats Gruff,” seems to lunge out of its cave-like abode under the Aurora Bridge while clutching onto a 1967 Volkswagen Beetle. Its provenance? An arts competition organized by the Fremont Arts Council.

Location: 744 N 34th St., alongside the DATA 1 building

The University of Washington's scrappy rowing team won gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics and was featured in the bestselling book and George Clooney-directed movie, “The Boys in the Boat.”

The sculpture is often unofficially referred to as the “Joe Rantz sculpture,” after the rower who overcame being abandoned by his family (played by Callum Turner in the film).

The metal sculpture is notable for its oversized, 14-foot oar. The sculpture was designed by Fremont's Weber Thompson architects and fabricated by Ballard's Mach 2 Arts and Fabrication as part of the Data 1 building.

Location: Troll Ave., outside Milstead & Co.

Mere steps from the “Berlin 1936” sculpture, you'll discover a graffiti-covered chunk of the Berlin Wall. It commemorates Seattle's and Boeing's role in the 1948 Berlin Airlift. Some folks in Fremont say this concrete slab itself somewhat resembles a mini-troll, with bolts for its eyes and rebar for teeth.

Location: N 34th St. and Stone Way N, by the Brooks Trailhead store

To commemorate the company headquarters' move from Bothell to Fremont, Brooks Running asked customers to donate race medals and share the personal story behind each medal.

Over 1,000 medals were collected, with all 50 states and each major U.S. marathon represented, then bronzed and forged into an 11-foot-tall image of a victorious runner. Running groups use the sculpture as a meeting point. The runners' stories were collected in a book that's on display in the store.

Location: 101 N. Canal Street (intersection of Phinney Ave. N. and N. 34th St.)

Another neighborhood's unwanted art is Fremont's gain—again! Back in 1999, the Pacific Science Center no longer wanted the giant mother and baby Apatosaurs, back then filled and covered with fake vegetation.

The Fremont Rotary stepped in, adopting the 66-foot-long creations for the demure price of $1. The dinosaurs' frames weigh 5 tons, not counting their coverings of 7,000 ivy plants (real-live ones, not plastic, and requiring frequent pruning).

As enormous as these dinos are, they're sometimes camouflaged among all the greenery along the Burke-Gilman trail.

Location: Intersection of Fremont Place N., N. 36th Street, and Evanston Ave. N.

What weighs over 7 tons, is 16 feet tall, and commemorates mocks the legacy of a Bolshevik despot? The bronze statue of Vladimir Lenin, created by Emil Venkov, was toppled in then- Czechoslovakia, during the 1989 Velvet Revolution.

An American veteran and Issaquah native, Lewis Carpenter, discovered the statue in a scrapyard and mortgaged his home to cover the $40,000 cost to bring it to the Seattle area.

Much like “Waiting for the Interurban,” the Lenin statue frequently gets treated to a sartorial makeover, sometimes whimsical to mark holidays like New Year's or Valentine's Day, and sometimes political.

Location: The Saturn Building (3417 Evanston Ave. N.)

Viewable by: Anyone visiting the Fremont Rocket

What's that orange glow surrounding the rocket? That would be from the 24-foot-wide Saturn sculpture, plunked on a roof directly across Evanston Avenue in 2013.

The Saturn Building is home primarily to healers of all kinds, including clinical psychologists and massage and bodywork therapists, many focused on holistic approaches like Rolfing and craniosacral therapy.

A smattering of tech companies in the Saturn Building include Living Green Technology, which offers recycling of physical tech like laptops and destruction of e-waste (such as unneeded data).

Location: Inside the Fremont Bridge's watch towers

With blond wavy hair cascading down, the neon “Rapunzel” sculpture has stood sentinel high in the Fremont Bridge tower since the 1990s. She can survey those who pass by in boat, car, and bicycle–the intersection of Nickerson, Fremont, and Dexter Avenues is one of the busiest intersections in the city for bike traffic.

On the northeast side, “The Elephant's Child,” a nod to Rudyard Kipling's story about how a curious elephants got its long trunk, is another neon sculpture looking down over the bridge, which opens to boat traffic an average of 35 times a day.

The tower itself is sometimes home to artists-in-residence, from writers to animation artists, thanks to grants from Seattle's Office of Arts and Culture (ARTS) and SDOT (Seattle Department of Transportation).

Location: Intersection of N. 34th Street and Fremont Ave. N.

A sculpture of 6 men and women along with a human-faced dog huddle together patiently alongside North 34th Street just north of the Fremont Bridge. A nod to the Interurban trolley line that once rolled through Fremont's streets, “Waiting for the Interurban” reflects the Fremont spirit as you'll often see the people and pup dressed up with birthday crowns and balloons tied around their wrists.

Sometimes, it's Seattle Sounders scarves, or Storm or Seahawks jerseys. When summer rolls around, you'll see high school graduation gowns and mortarboards and occasionally even wedding attire.

Location: Solstice Plaza, intersection of N 34th St and Fremont Ave. N

The “J.P. Patches Show” was a live, unscripted, and often irreverent kids' television show that ran on Seattle's KIRO-TV from 1958 to 1981. Astoundingly, it aired twice daily, before and after school, for over a dozen of those years.

J.P., played by Chris Wedes, and his mop-haired buddy Gertrude (Bob Newman) welcomed special guest stars including Jesse Owens and Jacques Cousteau.

As depicted in the bronze statue, are J.P. and Gertrude jauntily dancing, or are they trying to yank one another in the opposite direction? Well, supposedly, they're trying to catch the Interurban trolley—a nod to “Waiting for the Interurban” just across the street—but obviously, some shenanigans will be had first.

The legacy of J.P. Patches looms large. Portland, Ore-native and Simpsons creator Matt Groening counts himself among the legion of J.P. fans and gave a nod to Seattle's favorite clown by giving the name “J.P.” to one of Krusty the Clown's friends.

With artworks like these found throughout Fremont, tech and business leaders say their employees feel uplifted and inspired. The art adds a joie de vivre to the area that's unmatched by other neighborhoods and fuels creative thinking and problem solving.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

“We've raised a pile of money, and we're building a product.”

That's the characteristically deadpan announcement Wednesday morning from Corey Quinn, the cloud cost consultant who has built a second career, basically, on his sharp and irreverent takes on Amazon Web Services in his popular podcasts and newsletters.

Duckbill, the consulting firm that Quinn co-founded with Mike Julian, is making what amounts to a high-stakes pivot: transforming into a software company with a new platform called Skyway that aims to make cloud spending more predictable for large companies.

The company, based in San Francisco, announced $7.75 million in funding from Heavybit, Uncork Capital, and Encoded Ventures to accelerate product development and grow its 10-person team.

Their contrarian pitch: the cloud cost management industry, aka FinOps, is fixated on making bills smaller, when the real problem is that nobody can predict what the costs will be next month.

“Finance doesn't lose sleep over whether your cloud bill is $1 million or $100 million,” Quinn said in a news release. “They lose sleep when it jumps 30% and nobody can explain why.”

Julian, Duckbill's CEO, said in an interview that the company came to realize that existing cloud cost management tools are built by startups, for startups, for the most part. Many of Duckbill's large enterprise clients had tried those tools, rejected them, and ended up building their own.

“I have a hypothesis that the people building in FinOps today come from startups and not from enterprise, so they don't even know many of the problems exist,” Julian said. 

Duckbill's clients, which include companies such as Airtable, Ticketmaster, and New Relic, spend $70 million a year on cloud infrastructure, on average. (Tagline for their consulting business: “Cloud cost management for the nine-figure club.”) That's well above the $1 million annual minimum that AWS requires for a private pricing contract. At that scale, Julian said, you start to see patterns and problems that don't exist for smaller companies.

All told, the company says it has negotiated tens of billions of dollars in cloud contracts, giving it unique insights. (“Our schlep is our moat,” reads one of its internal whiteboards.)

Skyway's first module, called Contract Manager, converts private pricing deals into structured data, validating that customers are getting discounts they negotiated, and projecting spending.

The bigger vision extends well beyond AWS. Duckbill started with a specialization in Amazon's cloud platform but has expanded into Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Julian said the ultimate goal is to structure spending data across every piece of software and infrastructure a company uses: SaaS tools like Datadog and Snowflake, AI providers like Anthropic and OpenAI, and even legacy data centers for customers still using their own mainframes.

Julian acknowledged that the pivot into software will eventually cannibalize a portion of Duckbill's consulting business, but said he doesn't expect it to disappear entirely. Big companies need services, he said, pointing to companies like ServiceNow and CrowdStrike that built major software businesses while maintaining significant services revenue.

The market for cloud cost management technology is crowded, and difficult. The latest casualty: Spokane-area startup Vega Cloud, which entered receivership after raising millions in financing. 

But Julian contends that it's not really one market. Companies like Point5 focus on workload optimization. Others like Finout specialize in cost allocation. He sees Duckbill as doing something different: building financial planning and forecasting software for infrastructure.

Duckbill isn't using artificial intelligence in its own product yet. This will not surprise anyone familiar with Quinn's aversion to industry hype. However, by bringing structure to messy spending data, Skyway is positioned to create what Julian calls “AI candy” — clean, labeled information that customers can put to use in their own systems.

At the same time, AI is making it harder to predict cloud costs. 

“Cloud spend is already one of the largest and least predictable line items in the enterprise,” said Joseph Ruscio, general partner at Heavybit, one of the firms backing Duckbill's pivot, in the press release announcing the funding. “AI infrastructure is about to compound that volatility.”

Duckbill currently has 10 employees and plans to grow to 15 by the end of the current quarter and 20 by year-end, with most of the new hires in engineering. The company also hired Jim Moses, who previously worked at AWS as a private pricing negotiator, as director of hyperscaler strategy, essentially putting someone from the other side of the table on their team.

It's not the first time Quinn and Julian have tried to build a product. In 2022, Duckbill attempted to make the leap from services to software. It was an “abject failure,” as Quinn acknowledged in a video discussion with Julian, released by the company as part of the announcement.

“Turns out that if you just assume you know what customers want and don't talk to them, you're gonna go somewhere, but not where you wanted to go,” he said.

In addition to its website, Quinn noted, Duckbill can be reached at 833-AWS-BILL.

“He is not joking,” Julian said.

Binti, a San Francisco-based startup that develops software tools for child welfare agencies, opened a new office on Seattle's Lake Union.

In the shadow of the Aurora Bridge overlooking a marina full of boats, members of the Binti team rang a gong on an office balcony last week to officially open the 900-square-foot space.

“Opening our first-ever satellite office is an exciting next step for us — and the fact that it's right on the water doesn't hurt,” Binti co-founder and CEO Felicia Curcuru wrote in a video post on LinkedIn. “Boat team events are definitely in our future.”

The office is located at 2900 Westlake Ave. N. and is home to eight employees to start. Founded in 2016, Binti has approximately 85 employees and plans to hire about 30 more people this year.

The talk in the Seattle region can sometimes focus on how founders and startups are leaving for Silicon Valley to join an ecosystem that is especially rich in AI talent and companies. Binti is opening its Seattle office just a stone's throw from the Fremont neighborhood — home to Google, Adobe, Salesforce/Tableau, Brinc Drones, PATH and others — and up the road from South Lake Union — home to Amazon, Meta, Apple and more Google offices.

“We have an incredible group of Bintians based in Seattle who spent time in our SF office and saw the magic of being in-person,” Curcuru wrote in her post. “They wanted to build that same culture in Seattle, and we wanted to be able to tap into the city's great talent pool.”

Binti's tools help social workers license foster and adoptive families, manage casework, and connect children with relatives by reducing administrative work and streamlining documentation, approvals, and workflows. 

The company says its platform is used by more than 550 agencies across 37 states, serving 49% of the U.S. child welfare systems. Binti AI was launched in partnership with Anthropic to generate case notes and forms from meeting transcripts or handwritten notes.

The startup has raised more than $60 million from investors including Founders Fund, First Round Capital, and Michael Dell.

Griptape, a Seattle-based startup founded in 2023 by former Amazon Web Services executives, has been acquired by Foundry, a London-based company whose software is used in visual effects and animation across Hollywood. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 

Griptape built a platform that helps companies securely manage and coordinate multiple AI models and agents. Foundry said the deal will boost its push into AI-powered production tools. 

“By bringing Griptape into Foundry, we can provide the tools our customers want to realize their creative vision more efficiently, while retaining control,” Foundry CEO Jody Madden said in a press release.

Griptape initially pitched itself as an enterprise-grade alternative to frameworks such as LangChain. The startup, which works with several production studios, raised a $12.5 million round in 2023. Investors include Seattle-area firm Fuse, as well as Acequia Capital, Crosslink Capital, Range Ventures, and Peterson Ventures. The company has 22 employees, according to LinkedIn.

Roche spent more than eight years at AWS. He previously founded 2lemetry, an IoT startup that Amazon acquired in 2015. 

Vasily Vasinov, the company's co-founder and former CTO, left Griptape in 2025.

Amazon Web Services has launched two credit programs worth up to $100 million to help federal agencies leverage AWS cloud services and generative AI technologies for applications ranging from battle management to quantum computing.

The AWS Warfighter Capability Accelerator Initiative will provide credits to the U.S. Department of Defense (a.k.a. the Department of War), the defense industrial base and private contractors. Potential applications range from AI and autonomous systems to AI-enabled battle management and combat decision support, homeland defense, advanced manufacturing and shipbuilding, contested logistics, cybersecurity and space-based systems.

“We are excited to pursue multiple pathways and initiatives that invest in the technologies and solutions that directly address Department of War's most pressing, real-world challenges,” David Fitzgerald, deputy undersecretary of the Army, said today in an AWS blog post.

The AWS Genesis Accelerator Initiative will support scientific research by the U.S. Department of Energy, including the National Nuclear Security Administration, associated national laboratories, federal research organizations and private-sector organizations. Research priorities include biotechnology, nuclear fission and fusion energy, supercomputing and quantum information science.

Each initiative will provide up to $50 million in credits over the next three years for access to AWS cloud technology, training and technical expertise. Further details are available via AWS' web portal for government accelerator initiatives.

Microsoft has confirmed that a bug allowed its Copilot AI to summarize customers' confidential emails for weeks without permission.

The bug, first reported by Bleeping Computer, allowed Copilot Chat to read and outline the contents of emails since January, even if customers had data loss prevention policies to prevent ingesting their sensitive information into Microsoft's large language model.

Copilot Chat allows paying Microsoft 365 customers to use the AI-powered chat feature in its Office software products, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Microsoft said the bug, trackable by admins as CW1226324, means that draft and sent email messages “with a confidential label applied are being incorrectly processed by Microsoft 365 Copilot chat.” 

The tech giant said it began rolling out a fix for the bug earlier in February. A spokesperson for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment, including a question about how many customers are affected by the bug.

Earlier this week, the European Parliament's IT department told lawmakers that it blocked the built-in AI features on their work-issued devices, citing concerns that the AI tools could upload potentially confidential correspondence to the cloud.

Heron Power, founded by former Tesla executive Drew Baglino, announced on Wednesday that it has raised $140 million to build gigawatts worth of solid-state transformers for data centers and the grid.

It's a fast turnaround for the startup, which raised a $38 million Series A in May. Baglino said Heron Power didn't need the money, but after customers expressed interest in buying more than 40 gigawatts of solid-state transformers, it decided to raise again. 

“If our customers are leaning in, we need to lean in as well,” Baglino, who is CEO of Heron Power, told TechCrunch. “We gotta go faster.”

The speed at which Heron Power is raising shows just how data centers are driving demand for products that can rapidly deliver electricity to their servers. Baglino, who spent nearly two decades at Tesla and led the powertrain and energy groups, is no stranger to moving quickly.

The Series B round was led by Andreessen Horowitz's American Dynamism Fund and Breakthrough Energy Ventures with participation from Capricorn Investment Group, Energy Impact Partners, Gigascale Capital, and Valor Atreides AI Fund.

Solid-state transformers have been under development more than a decade, but only recently have matured to the point where they are ready to deploy in data centers and other large, energy-intensive facilities.

The new technology seeks to replace old iron-core transformers, which have existed in essentially the same form for more than a century. Iron-core transformers are inexpensive and efficient, but they are bulky and generate lots of heat. Solid-state transformers are smaller and can also more efficient by replacing several pieces of equipment, solving two of data center developers' biggest challenges. 

Solid-state transformers can also manage power intelligently, including from a range of electricity sources like wind, solar, and batteries, because they use semiconductors instead of passive metal.

The startup's solid-state transformers, branded as Heron Link, can convert medium voltage electricity to the 800-volt power needed by Nvidia's reference rack designs. They're capable of handling 5 megawatts a piece, and each device contains tens of modules that do the power conversion. If one fails, it can be swapped out in about 10 minutes, far faster than it takes to replace a monolithic transformer.

Each Heron Link also contains specialized lithium-ion batteries that can discharge quickly to provide 30 seconds of power to smooth the transition to backup power sources like grid-scale batteries, allowing data centers to eliminate uninterruptible power supplies. 

By eliminating pieces of equipment, solid-state transformers also eliminate several points of failure and reduce costs. “We can remove 70% of the gear involved,” Baglino said. “For some data center applications, it might be savings of an order of magnitude.”

Data centers are only about a third of Heron Power's business currently, Baglino said. The remainder is split between solar power and grid-scale batteries, which benefit from solid-state transformers' speed and flexibility.

Heron Power plans to use the new funding to build a factory capable of producing 40-gigawatts of Heron Link transformers annually. That's about 10% to 15% of annual production outside of China (or about 5% to 10% of total global demand), the equivalent to half the peak power demand of the state of Texas. 

Baglino said the company intends to begin pilot production in early 2027 before ramping production over the following two years. 

Heron Power isn't alone in developing solid-state transformers, and with many of the grid's old transformers approaching replacement age, competition will be stiff. The startup's new cash haul paired with Baglino's experience scaling production could give it an advantage. “We will push as hard as we can,” he said.

Google announced on Wednesday that it's adding a music-generation feature to the Gemini app. The company is using DeepMind's Lyria 3 music-generation model to power the feature, which is still in beta.

To use the feature, you'll describe the song you want to create, and the app will generate a track along with lyrics. For instance, you could ask Gemini to create a “comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding its match,” and the app will generate a 30-second track along with cover art made by Nano Banana.

Google said that you can even upload a photo or a video, and the AI-powered tool will create a song to match the mood of the media file.








Loading the player…


The company said that Lyria 3 improves on the previous generation of models, creating more realistic and complex music tracks. Users can also change and control other elements like style, vocals, and tempo.

Along with rolling out Lyria 3 to the Gemini app, Google is making the model available to YouTube creators through the Dream Track feature on YouTube, a tool that helps creators make AI-generated tracks. The option was only available to YouTube creators in the U.S. until now. But with this release, Google is expanding Dream Track availability globally.

Google said that you can't mimic an artist outright, but if you add an artist's name to your prompt, Gemini will create a track in a similar style or a mood. (It's not clear if generation will make it easier for others to decode the music style of a particular artist.)

“Music generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists. If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood. We also have filters in place to check outputs against existing content,” the company said in a blog post.

Google noted that all songs created with the Lyria 3 model will have a SynthID watermark to identify AI-generated content. The company said that it's also adding capabilities to identify AI-generated music with SynthID within Gemini. Users will be able to upload tracks and ask Gemini if it is AI-generated.

Music generation is rolling out to all 18+ Gemini users across the world with support for English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese.

AI-generated music has created mixed sentiments among artists and listeners. On one hand, companies like YouTube and Spotify are adopting AI and signing contracts with music labels to monetize AI-generated music. On the other hand, AI model and tooling companies are facing lawsuits from the music industry over copyrights of the training material. Platforms like Deezer have published tools to mark AI-generated music to curb fraudulent streams of this kind of music.

OpenAI is expanding its footprint in India and moving into the country's higher-education system through partnerships with leading academic institutions. The move comes as the South Asian nation seeks to scale AI skills and build domestic capacity in one of the world's largest talent markets.

On Wednesday, OpenAI said it was partnering with six public and private higher-education institutions in India, including top engineering, management, medical, and design-focused institutes, with the aim of reaching more than 100,000 students, faculty, and staff over the next year.

Rather than focusing on consumer use, the initiative centers on integrating AI into core academic functions, signalling OpenAI's interest in influencing how AI is taught, governed, and normalized within one of the world's largest higher-education systems. 

OpenAI has already built a large consumer audience for its ChatGPT chatbot, which has over 100 million monthly active users in India, according to CEO Sam Altman, and India has emerged as the company's second-largest user base after the U.S. The announcement also coincides with a broader push by leading AI firms to deepen their presence in India, which is hosting an AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week.

The first cohort of partners includes some of India's most influential academic institutions, such as the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, alongside private universities and specialised design schools. The ChatGPT maker said the partnerships would span disciplines ranging from engineering and management to healthcare and creative fields.

India has already emerged as a key testing ground for AI use in education. Last month, Google said India accounts for the highest global usage of its Gemini tools for learning. Microsoft, similarly, said this week it would expand its Elevate skilling program in India to train teachers across schools, vocational institutes, and higher-education settings, working with government agencies as part of a broader push to build AI skills at scale.

OpenAI said the partnerships would involve campus-wide access to its ChatGPT Edu tools, faculty training, and responsible-use frameworks. The focus, the company said, is on embedding AI into core academic workflows such as coding, research, analytics, and case analysis, rather than offering standalone access to tools.

Two of the partner institutions, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Manipal Academy of Higher Education, will also introduce OpenAI-backed certifications. Additionally, OpenAI said it would work with Indian ed-tech platforms, including PhysicsWallah, upGrad, and HCL GUVI, to extend AI training beyond campuses. These platforms will launch structured courses on AI fundamentals and ChatGPT use cases, aimed at students and early-career professionals.

Raghav Gupta, head of education at OpenAI India, said educational institutions were a “critical route” to closing the gap between rapidly advancing AI tools and how people are actually using them, as skills demands shift across the economy.

Last year, OpenAI hired Gupta, a former Coursera Asia-Pacific managing director, as its India and Asia-Pacific head of education, alongside the launch of a Learning Accelerator programme focused on expanding AI skills.

The flurry of moves into education underscores how AI companies are increasingly looking beyond consumer tools and corporate clients toward institutions that shape skills, norms, and long-term adoption. For countries like India, the contest is not just around access to AI, but also about who helps define how it is taught, governed, and embedded at scale.

A federal district court in Northern California ruled in favor of Cameo, a platform that allows users to get personalized video messages from celebrities and ordered OpenAI to stop using “Cameo” in its products and features.

OpenAI was using the “Cameo” name for its AI-powered video-generation app Sora 2. Users could use that feature to insert digital likenesses of themselves into AI-generated videos. In a ruling filed Saturday, the court said the name was similar enough to cause user confusion and rejected OpenAI's argument that “Cameo” was merely descriptive, finding that “it suggests rather than describes the feature.”

In November, the court granted a temporary restraining order to Cameo and stopped OpenAI from using the word. The AI company then renamed the feature to “Characters” after that order.

“We have spent nearly a decade building a brand that stands for talent-friendly interactions and genuine connection, and we like to say that ‘every Cameo is a commercial for the next one,” Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement.

“This ruling is a critical victory not just for our company, but for the integrity of our marketplace and the thousands of creators who trust the Cameo name. We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property against any platform that attempts to trade on the goodwill and recognition we have worked so hard to establish,” he noted.

“We disagree with the complaint's assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word ‘cameo,' and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” an OpenAI spokesperson told Reuters in response to the ruling.

OpenAI has been involved in several intellectual property cases in recent months. Earlier this month, the company ditched “IO” branding around its upcoming hardware products, according to court documents obtained by Wired. In November, digital library app OverDrive sued OpenAI over its use of “Sora” for its video-generation app. The company is also in legal disputes with various artists, creatives, and media groups in various geographies over copyright violations.

Our development process has been interesting. Although just Riley and I first made Jmail, it's been really gratifying to see companies, journalists, and fellow developers like Diego rise to the occasion to make this entire suite of apps as high quality and extensive as possible.

reply

Great, I've been looking to be able to contact you somewhere, hardly a better place :) Thanks for sharing the project btw, and for keeping jmail alive, been useful to dig into some stuff.However, there seems to be some ""injected"" or ""fake"" emails, that I cannot figure out why they're there in the first place. For example this one: https://jmail.world/thread/55b91b46ef1e4487bee131a8505e14a4?...For that example, the first problem is that there is no link to the source file from the disclosed files, which is strange, because most other emails have that. Secondly, this almost seems to be a ""sponsored"" email or something, as it has an ad in the top right corner reading ""Sponsored by Drop Site News"", but clicking that just takes you to some general page, with no clear information how that's related to the fake/injected email. Also, what does ""Verified by X"" actually mean, did they verify the authenticity of that specific email?There seems to be a bunch of people confused by those emails and wondering where they are coming from, because it's missing the source link like the others, so there doesn't seem to be a good way to verify those emails. Could you maybe share a bit about what's going on?

This Yahoo dataset, which we helped release after launching the first Jmail, also proved Epstein's connection to Iran-Contra (!!). Now immortalized on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein#Financial_trou...)

Why do the rest of the emails provide a link to the online file (original one hosted at justice.gov) but the ""sponsored""/ad ones do not?This for example: https://jmail.world/thread/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016203?view=inboxHas a ""View Original Document"" which takes you to kind-of-the-source (ideally should have been link to justice.gov but better than nothing I suppose), but for the emails with the Dropsite ad, it seems there is no original document?

Many Yahoo emails do show you the original source, and the original is just an EML file. These were files directly exported from Epstein's Yahoo account. Bloomberg used these EMLs to confirm that the Yahoo emails are real (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-12/epstei...).We don't tamper with these EMLs, so we currently don't make the EML accessible if the team had to redact any contents of that email.See this for example.https://jmail.world/thread/97d4a52d1df3948368770068262d2aab?...We can fix examples where there are no redactions yet no EML download is available

Makes it unsettling when it then shows orders for books you've also read. Hard to swallow having anything in common with such a person.I would have also assumed he got his clothes from much fancier places than Amazon, considering his wealth. Can't beat two day shipping I guess.Altogether his Amazon orders are disturbing in places, but also somewhat humanizing, which is not what I expected.

Question: Does Blues Traveler appear in the Epstein files?
               Blues TravelerAnswer:
Yes, ""Blues Traveler"" appears in the files, but not in a way that directly connects the band to Jeffrey Epstein or his activities.Key Findings:XM Radio Mention: An email from ""XM Signal"" dated July 8, 2008, mentions a ""Starbucks XM Café Live with Blues Traveler"" event. [1] This appears to be a reference to a broadcast or performance by the band on XM Satellite Radio.
Analysis:The searches did not reveal any direct involvement of the band ""Blues Traveler"" with Jeffrey Epstein or his associates. The mention found is in the context of a radio event.It's important to distinguish this from the multiple mentions of ""Blue Water Café,"" which is a restaurant and appears in several travel itineraries. [2][3][4]Further Investigation:If you have a specific reason to believe ""Blues Traveler"" might be connected, please provide more details. For instance, was there a particular event, person, or date you had in mind? This could help refine the search.

There's a reason most of the industry has switched to letting agents grep + navigate within the results.Come to think of it, it's probably the same reason ""intelligent"" search engines were so consistently hated by end users, and never really panned out during the early 2000's.

So about that specific thing, how do you avoid this particular problems with LLMs getting basic things wrong and basically being a lottery if the answer is correct or not? It's the reason I've avoided (and encouraged others to avoid it to) using LLMs too heavily in the process of reading, understanding and summarizing documents, but clearly you've must have figured out some trick to this?

Also, just like LLMs hallucinate and it's up to the person to decide to commit the code into the repo (and they should be held accountable to that), the same applies to people who use this tool to release fake news.Of course, we try to apply as many ""ground-truthing"" techniques as possible.Journalists of all kinds are using Jmail already for their professional work and we are in touch with them when they give us feedback. For example, we've redacted victim's names that we would've not known except for the work of tons of volunteers and journalists—and yes, this was NOT redacted by the DOJ and should have.But ofc, this is a thorny trade-off between victim protection and censorship.Disclaimer: I actively work on jmailarchive!

IMO it's (unfortunately) the public's responsibility to learn the lesson that LLM's shouldn't be trusted without double checking the source — same position Wikipedia was in 10 years ago. “Don't use Wikipedia because it has incorrect information” used to be a major concern, but that seems to have faded away now that Wikipedia has found its place and people understand how to use it. I think a similar thing will happen with LLM's.That opinion does not take the responsibility away from LLMs to continue working on educating people and reducing hallucinations. I like to think of it as equal responsibility between the LLM provider and user. Like driving a car - the most advanced safety system won't prevent a bad driver from crashing.

Fused means the instruction computes the entire a * b + c expression using twice as many mantissa bits, only then rounds the number to the precision of the arguments.It might be the Prism emulator failed to translate FMA instructions into a pair of two FMLA instructions (equally fused ARM64 equivalent), instead it did some emulation of that fused behaviour, which in turn what degraded the performance of the AVX2 emulation.

The big question then is, why are ARM desktop (and server?) cores so far behind on wider SIMD support? It's not like Intel/AMD came up with these extensions for x86 yesterday; AVX2 is over 15 years old.

If your code can go wide and has few branches (uses SIMD basically every cycle), either a GPU or matrix co-processor will handily beat the performance of several CPU cores all running together.If your code can go wide, but is branchy (uses bursts of SIMD between branches), wider becomes even less worth it. If it takes 4 cycles to put through a 256-bit SIMD instruction and you have some branches between the next one, using a 128-bit SIMD with 2 instructions will either have them execute in parallel at the same 4 cycles or even in the worst case, they will pipeline to 5 cycles (that's just a single instruction bubble in the FPU pipeline).You can increase this differential by going to a 512-bit pipeline, but if it's just occasional 512-bit, you can still match with 4 SIMD units (The latest couple of ARM cores have 6 SIMD units) and while pipelining out from 4 to 7 cycles means you need at least 3-cycle bubbles to break even, this still doesn't seem too unusual.The one area where this seems to be potentially untrue is simulations working with loads of f64 numbers which can consistently achieve high density with code just branchy enough to make GPUs be inefficient. Most of these workloads are running on supercomputers though and the ARM competitor here is the Fujitsu A64FX which does have 512-bit SVE.It's also worth noting that even modern x86 chips (by both AMD and Intel) seem to throttle under heavy 512-bit multi-core workloads. Reducing the clockspeed in turn reduces the integer performance which may make applications slower in some casesAll of this is why ARM/Qualcomm/Apple's chips with 128-bit SIMD and a couple AMX/SME units are very competitive in most workloads even though they seem significantly worse on paper.

Very wide SIMD instructions require a lot of die space and a lot of power.The AVX-512 implementation in Intel's Knight's Landing took up 40% of the die area (Source https://chipsandcheese.com/p/knights-landing-atom-with-avx-5... which is an excellent site for architectural analysis)Most ARM desktop/mobile parts are designed to be low power and low cost. Spending valuable die space on large logic blocks for instructions that are rarely used isn't a good tradeoff for consumer apps.Most ARM server parts are designed to have very high core counts, which requires small individual die sizes. Adding very wide SIMD support would grow die space of individual cores a lot and reduce the number that could go into a single package.Supporting 256-bit or 512-bit instructions would be hard to do without interfering with the other design goals for those parts.Even Intel has started dropping support for the wider AVX instructions in their smaller efficiency cores as a tradeoff to fit more of them into the same chip. For many workloads this is actually a good tradeoff. As this article mentions, many common use cases of high throughput SIMD code are just moving to GPUs anyway.

It does seem like server hardware is adopting SVE at least, even if it's not always paired with wider registers. There are lots of non-math-focused instructions in there that benefit many kinds of software that isn't transferable to a GPU.

reply

That chip family was pretty much designed to provide just enough CPU power to keep the vector engines fed. So that 40% is an upper bound, what you get when you try to build a GPU out of somewhat-specialized CPU cores (which was literally the goal of the first generation of that lineage).For a general purpose chip, there's no reason to spend that large a fraction of the area on the vector units. Something like the typical ARM server chips with lots of weak cores definitely doesn't need each core to have a vector unit capable of doing 512-bit operations in a single cycle, and probably would be better off sharing vector units between multiple cores. For chips with large, high-performance CPU cores (eg. x86), a 512-bit vector unit will still noticeably increase the size of a CPU core, but won't actually dwarf the rest of the core the way it did for Xeon Phi.

You can treat both SVE and RVV as a regular fixed-width SIMD ISA.""runtime variable width vectors"" doesn't capture well how SVE and RVV work. An RVV and SVE implementation has 32 SIMD registers of a single fixed power-of-two size >=128. They also have good predication support (like AVX-512), which allows them to masked of elements after certain point.If you want to emulate avx2 with SVE or RVV, you might require that the hardware has a native vector length >=256, and then you always mask off the bits beyond 256, so the same code works on any native vector length >=256.

Kind of, but the part which looks particularly annoying is that you can't put variable-width vectors on the stack or pass them around as values in most languages, because they aren't equipped to handle types with unknown size at compile time.ARM seems to be proposing a C language extension which does require compilers to support variably sized types, but it's not clear to me how the implementation of that is going, and equivalent support in other languages like Rust seems basically non-existent for now.

reply

Yes, you can't, which is annoying, but you can if you compile for a specific vector length.This is mostly a library structure problem. E.g. simdjson has a generic backend that assumes a fixed vector length. I've written fixed width RVV support for it.
A vector length agnostic backend is also possible, but requires writing a full new backend. I'm planning to write it in the future (I alreasy have a few json::minify implementations), but it will be more work. If the generic backend used a SIMD abstraction, like highway, that support scalable vectors this wouldn't be a problem.Toolchain support should also be improved, e.g. you could make all vregs take 512-bit on the stack, but have the codegen only utilize the lowee 128 bit, if you have 128-but vregs, 256-bit if you have 256-bit vregs and 512-bit if you have >=512-bit vregs.

SVE theoretically supports hardware up to 2048-bit, so conservatively reserving the worst-case size at compile time would be pretty wasteful. That's 16x overhead in the base case of 128-bit hardware.

But I find the RVV ISA just really fascinating. Grouping 8 1024-bit registers together gives us 8192-bit or 1-kilobyte registers! That's a tremendous amount of work that can be done using a single instruction.Feels like the Lanz bulldog of CPUs. Not sure how practical it will be after all, but it's certainly interesting.

Most high-end ARM cores were 4x128b FMA, and Cortex-X925 goes to 6x128b FMA. Contrast that to Intel that was 2x256b FMA for the longest, then 2x512b FMA, with another 1-2 pipelines that can't do FMA.But ultimately, 4x128b ≈ 2x256b, and 2x256b < 6x128b < 2x512b in throughput. Permute is a different factor though, if your algorithm cares about it.

In Apple's case, they have both the GPU and the NPU to fall back on, and a more closed/controlled ecosystem that breaks backwards compatibility every few years anyway. But Qualcomm is not so lucky; Windows is far more open and far more backwards compatible. I think the bet is that there are enough users who don't need/care about that, but I would question why they would even want Windows in the first place, when macOS, ChromeOS, or even GNU/Linux are available.

Also, it doesn't just speed up vector math. Compilers these days with knowledge of these extensions can auto-vectorize your code, so it has the potential to speed up every for-loop you write.

So operations that are not performance critical and are needed once or twice every hour? Are you sure you don't want to include a dedicated cluster of RTX 6090 Ti GPUs to speed them up?

The point is taken, though, that seemingly the performance is fine as it is for these applications. My point was only that you don't need to be running state of the art LLMs to be using vector math with more than 4 dimensions.

SIMD is not limited to mathy linear algebra things anymore. Did you know that lookup tables can be accelerated with AVX2? A lot of branchy code can be vectorized nowadays using scatter/gather/shuffle/blend/etc. instructions. The benefits vary, but can be significant. I think a view of SIMD as just being a faster/wider ALU is out of date.

I've heard anecdotally that the old pre-LLVM Intel C++ Compiler also focused heavily on vectorisation and had some specific tradeoffs to achieve it. I think they use LLVM now too and for all I know they've made similar modifications that we did. But we see a decent number of code patterns that can and now are optimised.

That set matches the x86-64-v2 x64 microarchitecture level.

reply

Generally speaking, when working with SSE instructions you'll end up using a mix of instructions from 2->4 as they are all effectively just additional operations on the SSE2 registers.

reply

So I'd bet the issue is either newness of the codebase, as the article suggests, or perhaps that it is harder to schedule the work in 256 bit chunks than 128.  It's got to be easier when you've got more than enough NEON q registers to handle the xmms, harder when you've got only exactly enough to pair up for handling ymms?

reply

That would be plain AVX, AVX2 has shuffles across the 128-bit boundary. To me that seems like the main hurdle for emulation with 128-bit vectors, in my experience compilers are very eager to emit shuffle instructions if allowed, and emulating a 256-bit shuffle with 128-bit operations would require 2 shuffles and a blend for each half of the emulated register.EDIT: I just noticed that the benchmark in the article is pure math which probably wouldn't hit this particular issue, so this doesn't explain the performance difference...

reply

The way that the vector registers were extended to 256-bit causes problems when legacy 128-bit and 256-bit ops are mixed. Doing so puts the CPU into a mode where all legacy 128-bit ops are forced to blend the high half, which can reduce throughput of existing SSE2-based library routines to as low as 1/4 throughput. For this reason, AVX code has to aggressively use the VZEROUPPER instruction to ensure that the CPU is not left in AVX 256-bit vector mode before possibly returning to any library or external code that uses SSE2. VZEROUPPER sets a flag to zero the high half of all 256-bit registers, so it's cheap on modern x86 CPUs but can be expensive to emulate without hardware support.The other problem is that only the low 128 bits of vector registers are preserved across function calls due to the Windows x64 calling convention and the VZEROUPPER issue. This means that practically any call to external code forces the compiler to spill all AVX vectors to memory. Ideally 256-bit vector usage is concentrated in leaf routines so this isn't an issue, but where used in non-leaf routines, it can result in a lot of memory traffic.

Using AVX2 and using an emulator have contradictory goals. Of course there can be a better emulator or actually matching hardware design (since both Apple and Microsoft actually exploit the similar register structure between ARM64 and x86_64). However, this means you have increased complexity and reduced reliability / predictability.

AVX512 was just tying too many things together too early than ""incremental extensions"".

AVX512 leading to thermal throttling is a common myth that from what I can tell traces its origins to a blog post about clock throttling on a particular set of low-TDP SKUs from the first generation of Xeon CPUs that supported it (Skylake-X), released over a decade ago: https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-dangers-of-intels-frequen...The results were debated shortly after that by well-known SIMD authors that were unable to duplicate the results: https://lemire.me/blog/2018/08/25/avx-512-throttling-heavy-i...In practice, this has not been an issue for a long time, if ever; clock frequency scaling for AVX modes has been continually improved in subsequent Intel CPU generations (and even more so in AMD Zen 4/5 once AVX512 support was added).

All AMD Zen 4 and Zen 5 and all of the Intel CPUs since Ice Lake that support AVX-512, benefit greatly from using it in any application.Moreover the AMD Zen CPUs have demonstrated clearly that for vector operations the instruction-set architecture really matters a lot. Unlike the Intel CPUs, the AMD CPUs use exactly the same execution units regardless whether they execute AVX2 or AVX-512 instructions. Despite this, their speed increases a lot when executing programs compiled for AVX-512 (in part for eliminating bottlenecks in instruction fetching and decoding, and in part because the AVX-512 instruction set is better designed, not only wider).

- Mark said “We don't allow sexually explicit content on the service for people of any age.” But they had a 17-strike policy, and 79% of all child sex trafficking in 2020 occurred on Meta's platforms. :(. Edit: the 79% claim is overstated. If you read the linked report[1], it is actually “65% of child sex trafficking victims recruited _on social media_ were recruited from Facebook, with 14% being recruited on Instagram” (emphasis mine). Thanks kstrauser for investigating- Mark said “Mental health is a complex issue and the existing body of scientific work has not shown a causal link between using social media and young people having worse mental health outcomes.” But internal study found users who stopped using Facebook and Instagram for a week showed lower rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Meta halted the study and did not publicly disclose the results – citing harmful media coverage as the reason for canning the study. I suppose he might debate whether this is a “causal” link, but it's fairly damning.- Instagram head Adam Mosseri told reporters that research he had seen suggests the app's effects on teen well-being is likely “quite small.” An internal 2019 study titled “Teen Mental Health: Creatures of Habit” found (1) “Teens can't switch off Instagram even if they want to.” (2) “Teens talk of Instagram in terms of an ‘addicts narrative' spending too much time indulging in compulsive behavior that they know is negative but feel powerless to resist.” (3) “The pressure ‘to be present and perfect' is a defining characteristic of the anxiety teens face around Instagram. This restricts both their ability to be emotionally honest and also to create space for themselves to switch off.”[1] https://techoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/08-2023...

Facebook does not typically do academic level research - they do quick studies to verify product direction.From what I have seen, the actual academic studies on this are mixed. It is hard to say one way or the other, and it can affect different teens differently depending on how they use it.

To do so, Meta will focus on “each youth life stage, ‘Kid' (6-10), ‘Tween' (10-13), and ‘Teen' 13+.'""' for instance is talking about a slide deck for Messenger Kids, which was an explicit focus on building something that was COPPA-compliant and independent of the main Facebook/IG/Messenger products. It's not at all inconsistent with the claim of not allowing people under 13 on the main sites.- In the rebuttal to ""We are on the side of parents everywhere working hard to raise their kids” they cherry pick a quote talking about the audience problem: having a social graph full of both peers and family on the same site means that live streaming things for friends will obviously ruin the experience, so figuring out a way around that would indeed be a critical requirement for a live streaming feature.

But you're right. Ellison and Thiel get all the attention, while Zuckerberg has caused magnitudes more societal destruction than both combined. Not because the former two are better people, far from it, just hard real-world impact from the companies they've founded.In tech, nothing comes close to the damage of Meta. Not even the most despicable of companies like ClearView, as while their products might be worse on paper their actual impact pales in comparison.

My neighborhood has a civic association which I am a part of. Additionally, I know dozens of my neighbors across the entire neighborhood on a first-name basis. I know all of my neighbors on my street, and have their contact information. I reach out to them on holidays. I discuss politics openly and loudly. Many of my neighbors are conservative, but we at least often agree on things that benefit the community.I have attempted political community organization over small issues as a start, but I currently am learning how to engage in larger-scale unification and mobilization tactics, while continuing to ingratiate myself in the neighborhood; which by the way, is increasingly owned by a small group of conservative landlords who snipe any open house on the market worth a damn and rent it back out to young people who pay off their mortgages for them.I do not belong to a political party, there is no local chapter. There is also no unified countercultural scene here.

Just last week there was uproar because Discord was going to require age verification to join adult themed servers and bypass content filters. This is how people are getting baited into inviting these restrictions and regulations into their services: By believing it's necessary to hurt their enemies like Mark Zuckerberg combined with “think of the children”.It's still sad to these calls for extensive regulation and oversight getting upvoted so much on Hacker News.Every time you see someone calling for regulation for kids online, remember that the only way to tell kids and adults apart is to force everyone to go through age verification. Before you start thinking that you don't care because you don't use social media, remember that you are reading this on a social media site. The laws aren't going to care about whether or not you think Hacker News qualifies as social media.

I disagree. The uproar was clearly that ID checks were going to be required at all.

If you're still curious, Meta has a page talking about how they might determine a user's age, specifically without ID: https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/age-verification

If you think KOSA style regulations would allow social networks to avoid ID checks, I don't think you're paying attention. Just read the article we're all commenting on to see how people are willing to attack Facebook for even having internal statistical ideas about problems. If a KOSA style law was passed and Facebook could be shown to have knowledge that some percentage of minors were evading their algorithm, they would be pulled in front of Congress again.There is no way to reasonably look at these laws and think that it would not result in ID check requirements. We don't even have these laws yet and platforms like Discord are already rolling out ID verification.

I think I disagree with this step. Facebook causes a kind of indirect harm here, and is used willingly by teens and parents, who could simply choose not to use it. That's different from, say, a factory polluting a river with toxic chemicals, which needs government regulation. Basically ""negative externalities"".

There is an inherently addicting aspect to it though - carefully evolved over the years by optimising for ""engagement"".One (imperfect) analogy is gambling - anyone can in theory choose not to gamble, but for some people addiction gets in the way and they don't make the choice that can be good for them. So (in the UK) the gambling industry is regulated in terms of how it advertises and what it needs to provide in terms of helping people stop. I don't know if this particular regulation is in anyway effective, but I do think that some regulation is appropriate.

Like to me “online shopping addiction” is probably a more realistic and analogous problem to gambling, so maybe online advertising to teens could be regulated, but the jump to child abuse is so far outside Meta's actual business model that it feels over-reaching to go there.

There is also peer pressure/FOMO. ""Choosing not to use it"" is not exactly easy if everyone else in your social group uses it - especially for teens.

There's more to this than you imply. I'm unfamiliar with the details, so take this comment more as a discussion of a hypothetical (that is phrased as if it was all factual) than as fact.1. The formal charge was defrauding the investors. But that isn't necessarily the behavior that got her charged.  If you're a prosecutor looking to score some political points, you prosecute an outrageous person over a crime you can convict them on, but the crime doesn't have to be outrageous itself.2. If someone had been harmed by a fake blood test (""the test said no cancer, but there was cancer!""), that would have made it into the prosecution. As you note here, it makes the prosecutor look better and Holmes look worse.3. But if you don't rely on the results of an experimental blood test and suffer harm, there is no injury to prosecute for. Theoretically people who paid for experimental tests could sue for a refund.4. Holmes' conduct, restricted only to defrauding investors, was outrageous and easily merited a hefty prison sentence.

Scrolling through the claims I thought the ""79% of all child sex trafficking in 2020 occurred on Meta's platforms"" claim sounded odd, given what I know from a friend who worked in prosecution of sex trafficking crimes. So I clicked the link to their source, which says this:> 79% of all child sex trafficking in 2020 occurred on Meta's platforms. In 2019, the National Society For The Prevention of Cruelty to Children found that Instagram was the leading platform for child grooming in the U.K.
The 2020 Federal Human Trafficking Report found that 65% of child sex trafficking victims recruited on social media were recruited from Facebook, with 14% being recruited on InstagramThe study they're quoting isn't about all sex trafficking, it's specifically about sex trafficking victims who were recruited on social media. The statistics are basically a breakdown of the popularity of social media platforms in the UK at the time the study was done.In other words, they're lying. They're hoping you don't look at the claims too closely.It's really sad to see so many HN comments from people calling for regulation and taking this all at face value, when just last week everyone was upset that Discord might require some accounts to present ID to remove content filters. Sensationalized reports like this are how we end up with those requirements.

The claim was ""79% of all child sex trafficking in 2020 occurred on Meta's platforms"", so they probably took it to mean that 79% of all sex trafficking in 2020 occurred on Meta's platforms.I don't mean to be a smartarse (well maybe a little). But why wouldn't they interpret it that way, when that's exactly what it says? ""X% of all Y happened on Z"" doesn't implicitly mean ""X% of online Y happened on Z"" just because Z is an online platform.

Honest question: Do you actually read any of these notes? 
I think there is a fundamental flaw with not taking notes. I'm convinced taking notes forces you to properly consider what is being said and you store the information in your brain better that way.

reply

Taking notes during meetings isn't to improve understanding, or to ""read"" afterwards.They're a record of what was discussed and decided, with any important facts that came up. They're a reference for when you can't remember, two weeks later, if the decision was A and B but not C, or A and C but not B.Or when someone else delivers the wrong thing because they claim that's what the meeting decided on, and you can go back and find the notes that say otherwise.I probably only need to find something in meeting notes later once out of every twenty meetings. But those times wind up being so critically important, it's why you take notes in the first place.

Still I think it's better to discuss ""action points"" in that case and give a clear owner to those points. This always helps me to understand who's accountable and what actions actually need follow up.

reply

Notes do. Ideally there is a meeting owner who produces official notes and emails them to everyone, but frequently that never happens. And when it does happen, sometimes they're wrong and you need to correct them.Which is why you need your own meeting notes. Plus, like I said, there are facts that come up that you want to document as well, that aren't part of the action items, but have value.

I think the person you're replying to is suggesting that the shared place for recording these things in a medium-large software department would be in project tracking software like Jira or Github Projects.

reply

The kind of stuff stored in Jira is a very specific subcategory of all the types of things that get mentioned and decided in meetings. It doesn't cover all of it, not even close. And the person putting the information in might also get part of it wrong, that happens surprisingly frequently. It's not a substitute for personal meeting notes.

I've watched teams go from deploying weekly to deploying 5x/day after adopting AI coding tools. Their velocity metrics looked incredible. Their incident rate also tripled. Not because the code was worse per se, but because they were changing more things faster than their observability and testing could keep up with.The bottleneck was never typing speed. It was always understanding -- understanding the system, understanding the user, understanding what ""correct"" even means in a given context. AI makes the typing-equivalent part nearly free, which just exposes that the hard parts were always the hard parts.The teams I've seen get the most out of AI coding tools are the ones that used the time savings to invest more in understanding, not to ship more features. More time with users, more time reading production logs, more time thinking about edge cases. The ones that just shipped faster ended up spending the saved time on incident response instead.

Productivity in large organizations has never been and can never be purely of the legible work which is written in Jira tickets, documented, expressed clearly, but is sustained by an illegible network of relationships between the workers and unwritten knowledge/practices. AI can only consume the work which is legible, but as more work gets pushed into this realm, the illegible relationships and expertise becomes fragmented and atrophies, which puts backpressure on the system's productivity as a whole. And reading said book, my guess that attempting to impose perfect legibility for the sake of AI tooling will ultimately prove disastrous.

People talk about how non-AI code will become an artisanal craft and I think it's a bit of a stretch. The one exception might be when code has an intrinsic aesthetic quality in itself, rather than just the functional output, something like the obfuscated C code competition entries. Hand-worked wood might be crappy too, like a school woodwork birdhouse project made by a beginner, but a truly artisanally crafted piece of furniture or cabinetry has a very tangibly superior output to an IKEA bookshelf or other industrial stuff.On the point of doing work for the sake of doing work and not for the sake of the value of the output, this is nothing new, as suggested in the blog post. But the more apt analogy would be all the ""bullshit jobs"" that have existed for decades in modern corporations. People who expand their teams to justify more budget to hire more people to create more work to expand their teams to get bigger budgets, etc. All the while producing nothing of real value in the company. The thing that AI seems to have done is accelerated and exaggerated this tendency, maybe since it was already the natural tendency within the logic of our corporate work culture.

I think this is an uninteresting question.  Almost every company is putting AI produced code into their products now and has been for years.  Whether it's entirely vibe-coded or not is beside the point.I'm working on 4 kubernetes operators that we use internally at work in production currently.  3 of them were handcrafted, one of them was vibe coded using the other 3 as a template.

I used to debate with people about this, but it didn't really change anything. Now, I just shrug and continue on with my work and, if someone asks, I help them use AI better.My main worry now is when the AI bubble is going to burst, and what's affordable now becomes unaffordable.

Shorthand notation exists and it's more than possible to develop your own. I'd trust a OBS recording going in the background over some AI slop that has some chance to micro-hallucinate what it's hearing. It also sounds like a skill issue that the author can't control the pace of his own meetings to where being able to take good notes is seemingly impossible.The author's AI use cases seem like a band-aid to cover bigger problems.

It's been a while since IDW's ongoing Star Trek comic wrapped up a blockbuster run, and in the meantime the publisher has been delivering a plethora of other series set across the Trek timeline. But now that Star Trek is turning 60 this year, it's time for the main book to boldly go once more… and a deliver a story that fans have been waiting for.

io9 can exclusively confirm that later this year, IDW will celebrate Star Trek‘s big anniversary with a relaunch of its main Trek title with a new creative team and storyline—as well as an accompanying sister series—that will follow the adventures of the USS Enterprise-G and its captain, Seven of Nine, after the events of Star Trek: Picard‘s final season and pick up on fan demand to see the 25th-century adventures of the latest addition to the venerable line of starships Enterprise.

Written by Christopher Cantwell, with art by Dennis Menheere and lettering by Jodie Troutman, the new Star Trek ongoing will see Seven lead the Enterprise on a top-secret mission to a hidden region of space, beyond the four charted quadrants of the Star Trek galaxy as we know it, to investigate a mysterious power that threatens to unravel the Federation.

“As we look back on 60 years of Star Trek, we celebrate a story universe that has actually always been about looking forward—a shared dream swirling within the daunting wonder and awe of the stars,” Cantwell said in a statement provided to io9. “I discovered Star Trek at the age of 10 and my life was never the same. The worlds, the people, the stories that wrestled with the work it takes to build community and consensus, to establish and hold sacred values like peace and harmony, the tenuousness of truce amid a galaxy of agendas and perspectives. That is the magic of Star Trek—the kaleidoscopic wonder of its complex themes and notions.”

“In building a brand new Star Trek adventure, we seek to do just that: create something brand new, something that looks entirely forward into the hope of the complete—and at times frightening—unknown, all as our ensemble of characters stands shoulder to shoulder, facing the expanse of an adventure never dared before,” Cantwell continued. “There is an abundance of incredible mythos that Star Trek has given us over six decades, but with this launch we seek to shed that past even as we embrace its best qualities.”

But the new mainline isn't the only comic story we're getting set in that familiar timeframe. Launching in October of this year, the main Star Trek series will be joined by Star Trek: Zero Point, written by someone very familiar to longtime io9 audiences: Hugo Award-winning novelist and site co-founder Charlie Jane Anders. Zero Point will be set during the time Seven of Nine has taken the Enterprise beyond the reaches of the known galaxy and will follow another familiar face: her partner Raffi Musiker, who has been tasked with leading a new crew aboard a starship tasked with a similarly risky endeavor: using a new predictive artificial intelligence built to (wearing a mysterious, but familiar face) be the vanguard defending the Federation from the threats of tomorrow before they even begin.

“I've loved Star Trek for as long as I can remember—literally, some of my earliest memories are of wearing a homemade Starfleet uniform and waiting to get beamed up,” Anders added in a statement to io9. “I'm putting all my favorite Trek things into this comic: problem solving, ethical dilemmas, identity crises, and above all, chosen family.”

“At the same time, I'm determined to write a Trek comic that newbies can read with no homework required: there are no easter eggs, no callbacks to deep lore,” Anders concluded. “Anyone who loves Becky Chambers or Martha Wells ought to be able to pick up this comic and get a fun science fiction story about artificial consciousness and exoplanets. Also, I'm talking to tons of physicists to get the most accurate science I can into this comic. I'm having the time of my life.”

Those won't be the only Trek comics coming this year, of course. Two new celebratory one-shots will also release in May and September. The first coming in May, Star Trek: Celebrations 2026, sees the return of IDW's pride anthology, celebrating LGBTQIA+ characters from across the franchise with stories from queer creatives. You can check out a few of the variant covers featuring a few of those characters and couples below!

A few months later in September, timed around Trek‘s actual anniversary date, is a 50-page Star Trek 60th Anniversary Special, which will unite a plethora of Star Trek comics creatives—including Dana Gould, Ryan North & Derek Charm, David Walker, Megan Camerena, and more, with covers by Michael Cho, John Tyler Christopher, Chris Fenoglio, and others—to tell stories drawn from across the last 60 years of Star Trek storytelling.

We'll bring you more on IDW's plans for Star Trek‘s big year as and when we learn them.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Tesla has ceased its use of “Autopilot” in California as a marketing term for its driver assistance feature, rather than face the penalty of not being able to do business in the state. Tesla would have been subject to a 30-day suspension by the California DMV if it kept using the term.

Tesla had already moved last month to stop shipping Autopilot as standard equipment, pushing customers toward its more advanced, subscription-based version of the system.

As the Chronicle notes, this legal fight began in 2023, with the DMV taking issue not just with “Autopilot” but also with “Full Self-Driving,” which Tesla later apparently changed to “full self-driving (supervised).” Instances of “Full Self-Driving” and “FSD” on the Tesla website now have “(Supervised)” in parentheses.

Steve Gordon, California DMV director, said Tesla has now taken “the required action to remain in compliance with the state of California's consumer protections.”

In a ranking last year from Consumer Reports, Tesla's driver assistance was placed eighth, below similar systems from Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen. Kelly Funkhouser of Consumer Reports called it “not nearly as good as what you might think it is,” according to CNBC.

Recent NHTSA filings Tesla provided about the performance of its small number of robotaxis showed that Tesla apparently struggled throughout December and January. It reported five crashes in that time, which amounts to four times the crashes of the average human driver across the same amount of driving.

As a sort of proof-of-life exercise, a collection of private software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies recently posted their earnings despite it not being strictly necessary, according to Bloomberg. This is, you won't be shocked to read, “a bid to convince lenders of their resilience to disruption from artificial intelligence,” Bloomberg says.The SaaS world is in a rough place at the moment because Wall Street sees a near future in its crystal ball where a lot of the dreary computer programs people use at work will be replaced with vibe-coding. The narrative around this is that highly debt-burdened software companies may soon not have enough cash coming in to service their debt—bad for the companies, and bad for the companies they've borrowed from.

how it feels to navigate an enterprise saas codebase with claude pic.twitter.com/nOUvP02k3z

The wider phenomenon around this is known as the SaaSpocalypse, and it kicked off in earnest when about $300 billion worth of business software company value vanished from the universe around the start of this month. Companies hit by the high-profile sell-off throughout January and February included LegalZoom, LexisNexis, Thomson Reuters, Salesforce, Adobe, and Figma, according to the New York Times.So Bloomberg noticed on Tuesday that McAffee had announced earnings that are about the same as this time last year—implying, probably, that it's not about to miss any debt payments. An “IT modernization” company called Rocket Software saw a 5.2% bump compared to last year, Bloomberg says. Perforce Software's earnings are slightly down by just the tiniest bit—$644 million compared to $654 million last year—but a call went out to investors recently in which Perforce Software's leaders explained that they would soon increase revenue by “embedding AI into products.”

An analytics company called Cloudera that Bloomberg described as “unusually private about its financials” is trumpeting “over 50% year-over-year growth,” in a statement on its website. “Cloudera's momentum is fueled by its unique position as the only data and AI platform vendor supporting deployment anywhere with a unified experience,” it also claims in that statement. 

As noted by the Harvard Business Review in 2022, SaaS companies are thought of as money-printing machines because they're on the monthly subscription model, like Netflix, but boring. The sudden frenzy over agentic tools like OpenClaw seems to have conjured a vivid mental image: millions of IT workers across the world smashing the “unsubscribe” button en masse. These SaaS companies themselves are, quite reasonably, demonstrating that the nightmare many are envisioning hasn't actually come true.

Gizmodo reached out to McAffee, Rocket Software, Perforce, and Cloudera for comment, and will update if we hear back.

For a long time, scientists knew of a “gravity hole” beneath Antarctica—an area with particularly weak gravitational force. Considering the various threats currently faced by the region, scientists are hoping to understand this anomaly better. At last, they may have a new lead.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, any shifts in Antarctica's gravity overlap with major shifts in the region's climate and geology. A historical analysis of Antarctica's gravity hole, detailed in a recent Scientific Reports paper, explains that the hole started off weaker but grew stronger between 50 and 30 million years ago, when widespread glaciation took over Antarctica.

However, the team has yet to ascertain whether and how the gravity hole could impact Antarctica, especially as the effects of climate change worsen each year.

The geoid is the bumpy, irregular ocean surface shaped by Earth's gravitational influence. Gravity varies across regions on Earth, although these differences are small enough that you never see someone flying or getting crushed from gravitational anomalies. For you and me, it's exceptionally subtle; for water, these differences in gravitational pull can exert a meaningful impact.

Indeed, these variations exert significant influence on Earth's oceans. For instance, water tends to flow toward areas of stronger gravity, so sea levels in regions with relatively lower gravity, like Antarctica, are typically lower than expected.

Hundreds of Earthquakes Are Rocking One of Earth's Most Dangerous Glaciers

The “low” here refers to a “broad depression in Earth's gravity field caused by a deficit of mass at depth,” explained the researchers in a release from the Paris Institute of Earth Physics.

For the study, the team reconstructed the 3D structure inside Earth using global earthquake recordings and “seismic, geodynamic, and mineral-physics data,” according to the paper. The team's model accounted for elements such as mantle dynamics, gravity field data, and changes to Earth's rotational behavior.

“Imagine doing a CT scan of the whole Earth, but we don't have X-rays like we do in a medical office. We have earthquakes,” Alessandro Forte, the study's senior author and a geophysicist at the University of Florida, said in a university statement. “Earthquake waves provide the ‘light' that illuminates the interior of the planet.”

The researchers then used a similar technique to “rewind the flow of rocks in the interior and track changes back 70 million years,” according to the statement. The simulations revealed that initially, a cold, dense material sinking into the deep mantle drove the gravity low near Antarctica.

Then, between roughly 50 and 30 million years ago, hotter, lighter mantle began rising from deep inside, redistributing mass across the continent. The combination of the cold, sinking mantle and the hot, rising mantle amplified the overall deficit of mass below Antarctica, the study explained.

Since sea levels and tide dynamics subsequently influence climate patterns, researchers believe that better understanding the gravity hole will lead to new insights into Antarctica's geological history—especially given the threats looming over the region today.

“If we can better understand how Earth's interior shapes gravity and sea levels, we gain insight into factors that may matter for the growth and stability of large ice sheets,” Forte said.

We use words like “candy bar” or “slab” to describe our full-screen smartphones, but Google has designed what is likely the slabbiest phone of the modern era. During an hour-long hands-on with Google's all-new Google Pixel 10a, I slid the phone across a desk and felt oddly satisfied that it could glide as neatly as a figure skater without any hint of a camera bump hindering its path. It's the first thing I need to bring up regarding the Pixel 10a, because there's no other discernible difference between this phone and the previous-gen Pixel 9a.

And that seems to be the point. The Pixel 10a starts at $500, exactly how much the Pixel 9a cost at launch. In a Q&A with journalists, Google told Gizmodo that the company wanted to offer the same price point as before. That apparently required Google to stick with the same Tensor G4 chip as last year. You still have the same storage options of 128GB or 256GB and the minimum of 8GB of RAM.

See Google Pixel 9a at Amazon

Think of the Pixel 10a as a Pixel 9a with a reduced camera bump. If you're one of the heretics who uses a phone without a case, that fact alone may be enough to pay attention. Otherwise, you'll be scrounging to find any real difference between the Pixel 10a and one of last year's best mid-range phones.

The Pixel 10a sports the same 6.3-inch pOLED display as the Pixel 9a, just with slightly smaller screen bezels and a slightly higher brightness spec (2,000 nits in HDR compared to the 1,800 nits on the Pixel 9a) and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i instead of Gorilla Glass 3. That may help it survive more scratching while you play air hockey with your Google phone. As for the back, you have the choice of a smooth glass texture in a choice of four colors. Alongside light gray Fog or dark gray Obsidian, the cool Lavender color is pleasing to the eyes. However, my favorite of the bunch is easily the neon Berry color that helps the device stand out.

Google's mid-range offerings were previously a means for consumers to get access to Google's tech at a lower price point. Last year's Pixel 10 appeared visually indistinguishable compared to the Pixel 9. It instead came with a few noticeable upgrades, including a new 5x telephoto lens, more AI features, and support for Pixelsnap magnetic wireless Qi2 charging. That MagSafe-like snapping capability was one of the best new features for Google's Pixel 10 family. The Pixel 9a doesn't have Pixelsnap capabilities. It instead maintains the same 10W Qi charging (not the new Qi2 15W or 25W wireless charging).

The Pixel 10 also came with smaller image sensors that produced photos that looked worse in quality compared to the Pixel 9. At the very least, the Pixel 10a doesn't change a single iota of the Pixel 9a's camera specs. It still contains a 48-megapixel wide lens with a 1/2-inch sensor and an f/1.7 aperture. There's another 13-megapixel ultrawide camera with a 1/3.1-inch image sensor and an f/2.2 aperture. It still supports the same 8x “Super Res” zoom functionality.

The only recent photo functionality the Pixel 10a steals from the Pixel 10 is Camera Coach. The feature uses AI to generate a few potential crops for your photos based on what you show it. It's essentially just an easy way to identify where to put your subject to maintain the rule of thirds or how to focus on your subject. If you have any photo experience, Camera Coach is largely pointless. It's potentially helpful for the layperson who wants to get better at taking photos of friends.

As much as Google promotes access to its Gemini AI capabilities, the company hasn't included any of last year's big standout AI capabilities. You won't get Voice Translate to deepfake your voice in another language when on a call. There's no Magic Cue, which tries to surface relevant info from among your apps to help you wrangle all your daily tasks each morning. The lack of the Tensor G5 chip makes this phone inherently feel behind the times.

That doesn't mean the Pixel 10a is not snappy when actually using it. Swiping between apps was fast. Pages loaded quickly in Google Chrome. I don't find Camera Coach useful at all, but at least that feature, plus Auto Best Take (for selecting the best face for each individual in a group shot) and Add Me (for combining shots to insert people or objects), loaded quickly without much fuss.

As much as Google wants me to, I have very little use for Gemini. Google's assistant AI will perform the same search tasks I was already used to but will require far more fact-checking on my part. That means the Pixel 9a is left behind in an arena created close to two years ago. The Pixel 9 from 2024 was a transitionary time for phones. That was an age when AI-ified Siri still had a chance of competing with Google's Gemini features that year.

The lack of any hardware enhancements to the Pixel 10a may be Google's way of telling us that we can either have a good price on a phone or more phone features. The ongoing memory shortage is impacting every device that requires RAM or flash storage. Based on my time with it, the $500 Pixel 10a is—in every way—an old phone with a new coat of paint. The Pixel 10a is up for preorder today with a launch date on Mar. 5. If you're simply looking for the flattest phone, then the Pixel 10a is up your alley.

A woman in New Zealand has been sentenced to over three years in prison for burning down a house she rented and assaulting a police officer. Normally that wouldn't be the kind of thing that makes international news. Except last week the judge in the case noticed something about the 37-year-old defendant's apology letter that's likely to be a consideration for all kinds of professions well into the future. The woman apparently used generative AI tools to write her apology. And the judge called into question whether that meant she was really sorry.

Michae Ngaire Win was being sentenced last week for arson, burglary, assault, and resisting police, according to a report from the New Zealand Herald, when Judge Tom Gilbert became “unimpressed” by the apology letters she had produced to the owner of the home she burned down as well as the first responders she assaulted. Win bit a cop and reportedly “took delight” in telling the officer she had AIDS.

“Out of curiosity I punched into two A.I. tools ‘draft me a letter for a judge expressing remorse for my offending,” the judge reportedly said, according to a transcript read by the New York Times. “It became immediately apparent that these were two A.I.-generated letters, albeit with tweaks around the edges.”

The judge reportedly seemed open to the idea that using AI wasn't necessarily a bad thing. But he made the point that “when one is considering the genuineness of an individual's remorse, simply producing a computer-generated letter does not really take me anywhere as far as I am concerned.”

The question, of course, is whether a human can ever take ownership of something produce by an AI chatbot. Some people argue that you can, especially if you're prompting the robot with plenty of specifics about what you're looking for. Some make the comparison to photography, where humans are getting substantial assistance from a machine to create an image, contrasting it with the more “pure” art of drawing or painting.

But plenty of other people will argue that you're not actually producing something that would allow you to take ownership with mere prompts. The U.S. Copyright Office agrees with folks in this camp, given the fact that AI-generated works can't be registered under American copyright law.

Obviously the world is still trying to figure out how to properly assess the validity of AI-generated work. Kids are constantly using tools like ChatGPT to do their homework, raising questions about what literacy might look like in the near future.

Generative AI's ubiquity makes it feel like the genie is out of the bottle. But we still have quite a ways to go until we figure out the social norms around its use. In the meantime, it's probably a good idea not to rely on consumer-available AI too heavily for things that matter, like writing legal documents or dispensing medication to a loved one.

Court apologies likely seemed like a safe use to this woman in New Zealand, but you also have to consider what happens if you get caught. Because “sorry” doesn't sound quite the same if the judge knows you didn't write it yourself. A pre-sentencing report had suggested that the woman serve no jail time for her arson and instead be confined to home detention, according to the New Zealand Herald. The judge handed down a sentence of 27 months in prison.

Dutch Secretary of Defense Gijs Tuinman has invoked the possibility of a third party modifying the operating system of the Netherlands' F-35 Lightning II fighters. The secretary said this during an interview with BNR Nieuwsradio, when the host asked him if the EU can make changes to the jet without approval from the United States. According to Clash Report, Tuinman said that it's possible to do, but he refused to elaborate further.

BIG: Dutch Defence Minister Gijs Tuinman hints that software independence is possible for F-35 jets. He literally said you can “jailbreak” an F-35. When asked if Europe can modify it without US approval: “That's not the point… we'll see whether the Americans will show… pic.twitter.com/f11cGvtYsOFebruary 15, 2026

“I'm going to say something I should never say, but I'll do it anyway,” the defense secretary said. “Just like your iPhone, you can jailbreak an F-35. I won't say more about it.”

The Trump administration has frequently been clashing with European powers in recent months, and although the U.S. has not threatened to withhold support from the F-35, some nations are worried that their overdependence on American technology has made them vulnerable to actions from across the pond. For example, there have been rumors that the U.S. might have embedded a kill switch on one of the most advanced fighter jets across the world, but officials deny its existence. After all, giving another nation the ability to remotely disable your weapons is unthinkable for any government.

However, the F-35 is such an advanced piece of technology that it needs a complete working supply chain to maintain its combat effectiveness. The jets require thousands of parts and services, mostly acquired from the U.S., to ensure that they remain safe to fly. More than that, they rely on Lockheed's cloud infrastructure for software updates, logistics, and even the “Mission Data Files” that give it its threat-recognition abilities. So, even without a kill switch, the U.S. could effectively ground any nation's F-35 fleet if it's excluded from this network.

This is especially worrisome for the Royal Netherlands Air and Space Force, which relies solely on the F-35 for its fighter jet needs. Because of this, it might be looking for ways to modify the software on the Lightning II, allowing it to operate even if the U.S. cuts off the nation from the fighter's support system.

But even though Tuinman made it look simple and even compared it to jailbreaking an iPhone, modifying an F-35 jet outside of official channels is likely easier said than done. After all, the Lightning II runs on over 8 million lines of code. Given the military nature of their application, they're also encrypted — that means it's not like Windows, where you can just open the Registry Editor and make changes you like. Furthermore, these flying machines are way more complicated than a single handset, and any mistakes in programming could cost millions of dollars in property damage and even the lives of highly trained Dutch pilots.

Beyond selling its Vera data center CPUs as part of Vera Rubin NVL72 rack-scale systems, Nvidia has expressed ambitions to become a standalone data center CPU vendor, and a new partnership with hyperscale giant Meta represents a big step forward for that plan.

As part of a new multi-year strategic partnership announced today, Meta says it'll expand its use of Nvidia tech as it continues to build out hyperscale data centers optimized for its AI training and inference efforts. Those plans include “millions” of Blackwell and Rubin GPUs, part of a massive AI spending plan from Meta that could reach as much as $135 billion in total for 2026.

As part of the expanded collaboration between the two companies, Meta will use also Nvidia's Arm-powered Grace server CPUs as standalone platforms in its production data centers. The companies say their collaboration is the first ""large-scale Grace-only deployment,"" and it's meant to deliver a sizeable performance-per-watt improvement for the company's facilities.

 






Nvidia data center honcho Ian Buck told The Register that Meta is seeing gains of up to 2x the performance per watt on certain workloads with the Grace platform, and that it's already test-driving Nvidia's next-gen Vera CPU with ""very promising"" results. The companies say that large-scale Vera-only deployments could begin as soon as 2027.

For reference, the Grace CPU sports 72 Arm Neoverse V2 cores and supports up to 480GB of LPDDR5X memory in its standalone C1 config. Nvidia also offers Grace as a ""CPU Superchip"" that joins two dies together over the NVLink-C2C interconnect, resulting in 144 cores with up to 960GB of LPDDR5X and up to 1024 GB/s of aggregate memory bandwidth from certain memory capacities.

Vera, in turn, has 88 custom Arm cores with up to 176 threads, support for up to 1.5 TB of LPDDR5X memory with up to 1.2TB/s of memory bandwidth, and PCIe Gen 6 and Compute Express Link 3.1 connectivity. Importantly, Vera is also the first Nvidia CPU to support a confidential or trusted computing environment throughout the entirety of its rack-scale systems.

Beyond CPUs, Meta also says it'll deploy Nvidia Spectrum-X Ethernet switches throughout its data centers. As we learned at CES, Spectrum-X switches with co-packaged optics promise to increase performance-per-watt for scale-out applications by eliminating active cabling with optical transceivers that can, when combined with the power usage of the switch itself, account for up to 10% of each rack's power consumption.

Power used for data movement is power that isn't used to feed GPUs, and with demands for the absolute maximum compute density and efficiency in every rack these days, a savings of that magnitude is a huge deal, so it's no surprise that Meta is hopping on board as it continues to expand its footprint.

Beyond hardware, Nvidia will offer its considerable in-house expertise in designing AI models to Meta's engineers to help the company tune and boost the performance of its own core AI applications.

All of this just goes to show that as the AI revolution continues, Nvidia's reach into tech far beyond gaming graphics cards is so extensive that people are likely to use software powered or shaped by its models and accelerators, whether they realize it or not, and that'll only grow more true by the day as Meta expands its use of Nvidia's platforms and tech.

A collaboration between TU Wien and Cerabyte has established a new Guinness World Record for creating and reading the smallest ever QR codes. These QR codes feature 49nm pixels, making them less than half the size (37%) of the previous record holder. Furthermore, the codes are smaller than bacteria, says a press release from TU Wien, in comparison. Beyond the headlining world record achievement, these tiny QR codes will propel Cerabyte's ceramic storage to even greater densities.

QR codes are everywhere in 2026, but these tiny world record holders are too small to be seen by the naked eye, or even read using an optical microscope. The TU Wein and Cerabyte team's codes measure just 1.98 square micrometers. An electron microscope is required to read them.

This may not be the smallest QR code that it is possible to make, but, importantly, they hit the sweet spot between microscopic size, stability, and durability – according to the collaborative academic and commercial teams. Using this 49nm pixel size, “We have created a tiny, but stable and repeatedly readable QR code,” underlines Prof. Paul Mayrhofer from the Institute of Materials Science and Technology at TU Wien.

 




So, what kind of storage density can the world record-breaking advance deliver? Using the new tiniest QR code technology, it would be possible to produce a single-layer film at A4 size with over 2TB of storage.

The researchers and Cerabyte stress that the bacteria-sized QR codes retain several advantages compared to other storage technologies in widespread use today. Milled into a thin ceramic layer, it is claimed that the codes are “indefinitely” durable and require no energy or cooling to be maintained. We even see comparisons between ancient civilizations with stone tablets and trusting the jewels of the information age to advanced new ceramic storage media.

Now that this new QR code record has been verified, the teams are turning to other optimizations – writing speeds and scalable manufacturing. Interestingly, they will also work on developing more complex data structures beyond the confines of QR codes.

In the last year, Cerabyte has been in the Tom's Hardware headlines for advances in storage density and durability. However, we don't know the full implications of the new QR code world record on previous claims. There's definitely some serious work being done behind the eye-catching headlines, though, with WD revealed as a key investor last May.

Most adults in the US and Japan expected larger reductions in 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) than statins offer. At current effectiveness levels, about one third or fewer said they were willing to start statins.

“Even for well-established treatments like statins, gaps may exist between public expectations and guideline recommendations. The SWD [smallest worthwhile difference] may help incorporate patient preferences into guidelines and support effective communication frameworks for shared decision-making,” the researchers wrote.

“As guidelines move toward lower risk thresholds and expand the populations for whom statins for primary prevention are recommended, understanding and honoring patients' preferences will remain essential,” experts wrote an accompanying editorial.

The study was led by Yan Luo, MD, PhD, of the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine in Tokyo, Japan. It was published online on February 16, 2026, as a research letter in JAMA Internal Medicine. The editorialists were Ilana B. Richman, MD, MHS; Anna Hung, PharmD, PhD; and Timothy S. Anderson, MD, MAS.

The study used an online survey, which may have introduced bias. Researchers made simplified assumptions about the effectiveness of statins.

The study received a grant from Pfizer Health Research Foundation (Japan) and intramural funding from Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine.

The Australian Medical Association has called for greater regulation and transparency in the contracts between private health insurance companies and doctors. It expressed concerns that doctors are being pressured into restrictive and opaque agreements on patient care.

Medical practitioners say that the contracts are affecting the choices they make for patient care by restricting treatments, rehabilitation, choice of hospital, and duration of stay.

Around two thirds of all scheduled surgery in Australia is now performed in the private sector, said Julian Rait, MD, ophthalmologist and vice president of the Australian Medical Association.

Nearly all those procedures are performed by doctors under “no gap” or “known gap” contracts with private health insurance companies. In a no-gap contract, doctors agree to charge the patient the same amount that the insurer will reimburse the patient, so there is no excess cost to the patient. In a known gap contract, doctors can charge a fee over and above the reimbursed amount, but that gap is set by the insurer.

The problem is that these contracts can be restrictive, and doctors have no power to negotiate, Rait told Medscape News Australia.

“If a doctor doesn't sign because they consider the insurer's remuneration too low, or even just charges a dollar more than the insurer believes is appropriate, the insurer will slash the benefits they would pay to patients and then blame it on the doctor's fees being excessive,” he said. “Even if the fees are reasonably modest but not quite what the insurer is prepared to pay, they suggest the doctor's being greedy or unreasonable.”

The height of the COVID pandemic raised fears among insurers of a huge surge in demand, and since then, they have sought to protect their capital, said Rait. “They've tried to be circumspect with the reimbursement of hospitals in anticipation that this surge might come.”

As a result, the medical benefits paid are not keeping pace with inflation, said Peter Sumich, MD, eye surgeon and president of the Australian Society of Ophthalmologists in Sydney. “The known gap contract limit that we have, which is how much they can charge as a deductible above what the insurer might reimburse, hasn't changed for years, meaning the doctors have been asked to sign contracts that really don't reflect the current costs of providing care.”

Private Healthcare Australia, which is the representative body for the private health insurance industry, has disputed accusations that profits are not being passed on to patients, saying in a statement that benefits paid to patients increased by 20% from 2017-2018 to 2023-2024, and that for every dollar patients spend on premiums, they are reimbursed $0.84.

Insurers are also exerting control over treatment and management choices, said Sumich. “They're starting to see that the way to control their fund outlays is to control the doctors,” he told Medscape News Australia.

Contracts between doctors and insurers are confidential, but Sumich said that contracts can dictate, for example, the choice of prosthetic, the duration of hospital stay for procedures, and the type of rehabilitation used. “You as a patient should have a contract with a doctor. You go to see your doctor, and your doctor tells you what he wants to do,” he said. “There shouldn't be a third party like a health insurer with their hand in the contract, guiding the doctor's hand.”

While doctors always have the choice to practice independently, Sumich said that this option is becoming increasingly difficult to pursue as insurers gain greater market share, including through the ownership of private hospitals, and can direct patients to their preferred doctors. “It's harder and harder for a doctor to stay uncontracted because he's starting to lose a lot of work,” said Sumich. “I've got patients I've seen for cataract surgery, and they ring us back and say, ‘My health insurer said you're not one of our preferred doctors. Is there something wrong with you?'”

The Australian Medical Association has called for greater regulation of the private health insurance sector, citing a previous observation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that there is no regulatory oversight or limitation on how doctors and insurers contract with each other. Current regulation focuses on interactions between private health insurers and patients, rather than doctors.

“We don't have someone on the other side of the equation who's regulating performance and making sure that the funding that's delivered to the sector by the insurers is adequate to meet the needs of the community,” said Rait. A private health system authority could set a standard for how insurers work with healthcare providers and provide greater transparency in contracts, he said.

Rait and Sumich reported having no relevant financial relationships.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Among adult inpatients labeled as having a low-risk sulfa antibiotic allergy, 99% tolerated an oral challenge with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, according to a prospective study.

“Unlike penicillin allergy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a drug more commonly associated with severe cutaneous adverse reactions, and education around risk assessment, including identifying noncutaneous features of severe cutaneous adverse reactions such as organ dysfunction, is required to ensure only low-risk phenotypes undergo [direct oral challenge],” the authors of the study wrote.

Elise A. Mitri, with the University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on February 2, 2026, in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology.

The study had a relatively small sample size and predominantly included patients with a SULF-FAST score of 0-1, possibly limiting the generalizability of the findings to patients with higher risk scores.

The study was supported by a PhD scholarship from the National Allergy Centre of Excellence (Australian Government), as well as by the Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support program and the National Health and Medical Research Council Emerging Leadership Fellowship. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

The implementation of a new integrated care pathway for paediatric acute asthma led to an increased use of metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) with a holding chamber and improved routine severity or control documentation across paediatric emergency departments (EDs) and primary care, without an increase in ward admissions, length of stay in the paediatric ED, or 72-hour revisits.

""This initiative demonstrates how engaging families, empowering clinicians and leveraging previous QI [quality improvement] cycles can yield sustainable improvements. The AICP [asthma integrated care pathway] builds directly on lessons learnt from successful bronchiolitis initiatives and provides a scalable model for closing implementation gaps in paediatric chronic disease management,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Marta Montejo, Primary Care Center, Basque Health Service, Barakaldo, Spain. It was published online on February 09, 2026, in BMJ Paediatrics Open.

The study was conducted within a single regional system, which may have limited generalisability. The absence of a control group may have limited causal inference, and the reliance on electronic health record data may have led to an underestimation or overestimation of certain indicators.

This study was funded by the 2021 Call of the Department of Health of the Basque Government for health research and development projects. The authors declared having no competing interests.

Nearly half of Germans consult artificial intelligence (AI) before seeking care from a primary care physician, reflecting a broader global shift in how people access health information and engage with clinicians.

According to a survey by the German digital association Bitkom, 45% of respondents said they consulted AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot, instead of first seeking medical advice when health concerns arose. About 71% viewed AI in medicine positively, and 27% viewed it very positively. More than half (55%) reported that they understood chatbot responses better than the results from a conventional Internet search.

Christina Raab, vice president of Bitkom, emphasized in a statement that the majority of Germans are open to the use of AI in healthcare and actively use AI.

Public acceptance of AI does not eliminate these concerns. About 71% of respondents said they feared the misuse of personal data, and 69% worried that AI could reduce human attention during treatment. Many participants also expressed concerns about potential medical errors attributed to AI. Only 9% of the participants reported no concerns.

Simultaneously, the findings highlight a paradox: Although patients increasingly trust AI-generated advice, they may perceive physicians who use AI as less competent, empathetic, and trustworthy.

Evidence suggests that disclosing the use of AI in clinical practice may reduce patients' confidence. In a study published in JAMA Network Open, Moritz Reis, MSc, from the Institute of Psychology, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany, and colleagues found that physicians associated with AI rated lower on empathy, trustworthiness, and competence.

The researchers presented the participants with advertisements for medical practices that either mentioned or did not mention the use of AI. The participants then rated the physicians depicted in the vignette.

Speaking with Medscape's German edition, Reis said, “Afterward, we asked participants how competent and empathetic they rated the physician and how likely they would be to make an appointment with him. There was clearly a limitation: Physicians associated with AI are perceived more negatively in terms of empathy, trustworthiness, and competence.”

Approximately 30% of respondents considered chatbot guidance valuable as a physician's second opinion. According to a survey by Bitkom,16% reported that they disregarded a medical recommendation in favor of AI-generated advice.

Rising trust in “Dr AI” and declining trust in physicians who use AI are reshaping doctors' roles in healthcare delivery. Physicians express concern that they may struggle to maintain authority during traditional bedside examinations.

The German Medical Association cautioned in a position paper on digitalization that “knowledge competition” could emerge between clinicians and patients. The dynamics, as the association wrote, could create pressure to justify clinical decisions and potentially restrict therapeutic options.

In a commentary in the Journal of Medical Systems, Florian Reis, MD, from the Institute of Medical Informatics at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, argued that patients who arrive with AI-derived knowledge may contribute to the “democratization” of the physician-patient encounter.

Reis suggested that the central challenge lies less in the technology itself than in the psychological context surrounding psychological factors, such as a lack of transparency and ambiguity.

If patients do not understand how AI tools are integrated into care and if digital systems are experienced as impersonal substitutes for human judgment, trust may erode.

“When AI is thoughtfully integrated and transparently disclosed, it has the potential to reinforce the very trust it threatens to displace,” wrote the authors.

Reis further argued that clinical decision-making should evolve toward greater transparency and participation. When presenting a treatment plan, physicians can explicitly reference both their expertise and AI-based contributions.

“It is no longer enough to simply teach doctors how to use technology. We also need to teach them how to talk about it,” he said. Similarly, algorithms may not be understood as competitors but as amplifiers of clinical care.

Around 1 in 3 people in the Europe, including pregnant women, are consuming potentially unsafe amounts of fish containing high mercury levels, according to a new European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) report. EFSA defines “unsafe” as eating three or more portions per week of fish containing ≥ 1 mg of methylmercury (MeHg) per kilogram of fish wet weight.

The report found a sharp rise in frequent consumption of high-mercury species between 2023 and 2024. By EFSA's account, the proportion of respondents saying they consumed three or more portions per week of high-mercury fish rose from 26% in 2023 to 50% in 2024.

Increases in fish consumption were similar in countries with and without updated consumption advice, indicating that other factors may be driving dietary changes. According to the report, taste, price, and perceived health benefits often outweigh safety concerns.

“There is a need for tailored communication strategies: frequent consumers may require targeted risk messages, while infrequent consumers may benefit from information emphasizing health benefits and safe fish and seafood choices,” EFSA said in its report.

Most EU national authorities advise limiting consumption of high-mercury fish (≥ 1 mg/kg MeHg) to one to two portions per week or three to four portions per week for species with lower MeHg (< 0.5 mg/kg). Large predatory species such as shark, swordfish, and large tuna typically have the highest mercury concentrations; smaller species such as salmon, mackerel, trout, sardines, and anchovies tend to have much lower levels.

EFSA surveyed adolescents, adults, and pregnant women across all 27 EU member states by telephone in 2023 and again in 2024, conducting nearly 15,000 interviews in the first wave and about 8000 in the second. Participants were asked about consumption of 38 fish species and about their awareness of contaminants and national dietary advice.

The surveys found that consumers are far more likely to be aware of fish's health benefits than of its risks: up to 60% were fully aware of benefits such as omega-3s, whereas only 10%-14% were aware of contaminant risks.

“Recent increases in frequent fish consumption may reflect strong health messaging around omega-3 benefits, sometimes without enough emphasis on choosing appropriate species and practicing moderation,” Xavier Coumoul, PhD, professor of biochemistry and toxicology at Université Paris Cité, Paris, France, told Medscape News Europe.

“The most vulnerable populations to mercury in food are the fetus, infants, children up to 6 years, and pregnant/ breastfeeding women, or those planning pregnancy, due to risks of impaired neurodevelopment,” Tony Smith, EFSA spokesperson, told Medscape News Europe.

Lars Barregård, professor at the School of Public Health and Community Medicine at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden, told Medscape News Europe that pregnant women or those planning pregnancy should skip high-mercury fish out of caution.

“For the rest of us, the potential for other risks like a suspected increased cardiovascular risk, is the problem, but that possible risk requires much higher MeHg doses. Consumption of those high MeHg species should be limited to a few times per month,” he said.

Barregård noted, however, that diets including one to five portions of fish per week are beneficial, and that most marine fish species carry no risk for adverse health effects due to low MeHg levels.

Smith agreed, adding that the 2015 EFSA's scientific committee concluded that one to two servings of fish per week, or up to three to four during pregnancy, is linked to better neurodevelopmental outcomes in children and lower heart disease mortality in adults provided specific high-mercury species are avoided.

“An easy way to know for consumers which types of fish to eat is to consider the size. For example, tuna is big and accumulates mercury, while sardines generally have lower levels,” said Coumoul.

The main concern, he stressed, is not fish consumption overall, but consumption of large, predatory fish that accumulates mercury over time.

“Regular consumption of smaller species such as sardines, anchovies, and herring generally presents lower risk. If people do not like their strong taste, you can prepare them with yoghurt, garlic, and coriander and serve with bread. It's quite good,” he said.

Barregård noted that the guidance doesn't necessarily apply to all types of tuna.

“It is the big tuna that may have a high content of MeHg. If you like tuna, then you could still eat a lot of canned tuna, which is based on the less expensive small tuna fish,” he said.

Ronan Gormley, PhD, adjunct professor at the School of Agriculture and Food Science at University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, added “All fish are high in high-quality protein, but tuna is probably the highest. Mainstream fish species like cod, mackerel, and hake deliver 18-20 g/100 g, which is lower than tuna but is still excellent. Canned tuna is usually in brine, which increases the salt content a bit which is a small negative,” he said. “The bottom line is: eat fish 2-3 times per week and you will get plenty of good quality protein and essential fish oils.”

Barregård, Gormley, and Coumoul reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) may have helped extend the lives of more US women with breast cancer, a large, long-term study finds.

In the years since US states began expanding Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 ACA, studies have pointed to benefits for patients with cancer, including earlier diagnosis and better access to treatments.

The new study, published in JAMA Network Open, suggests that those gains have translated into improved long-term survival for women with breast cancer. Among more than 1.5 million US women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2006 and 2021, those living in Medicaid-expansion states saw an absolute reduction in overall mortality of 1.4 percentage points over 5 years, compared with women in non-expansion states.

That difference corresponds to about 1400 deaths averted for every 100,000 patients who gained coverage under Medicaid expansion.

“Our message is, Medicaid expansion is associated with life-saving measures. It saves lives,” said lead researcher Oluwasegun A. Akinyemi, MD, PhD, a senior research fellow at Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, DC.

While some previous research has linked Medicaid expansion to longer survival among women with breast cancer, the new study is notable for its size and length of follow-up, according to an accompanying editorial.

“The fact that this was able to show over the course of over a decade that Medicaid expansion had a durable effect is something that is novel,” said editorialist Oluwadamilola Fayanju, MD, chief of the Division of Breast Surgery at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.

The findings also come at a critical time, Fayanju told Medscape Medical News. “This certainly is a timely manuscript, given multiple things happening in the changing American healthcare landscape,” she said.

Last July, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” was signed into law, with plans to cut over a trillion dollars in federal Medicaid spending over 10 years, which will result in nearly 15 million Americans losing their coverage, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.

Patients with cancer “will almost certainly” experience treatment delays as a result, Fayanju and colleague Meghan Maceyko, MD, wrote — and it will be those from marginalized groups who are most affected.

“We often see that the people who are most vulnerable in a society are the ones most likely to suffer an adverse effect,” Fayanju said. “That will have [an] impact not only on the individuals [and] their families but potentially also on their communities.”

Healthcare systems will pay a price, too, the editorialists noted: They will “bear the financial burden” of interruptions in care caused by patients' loss of coverage and increases in later-stage cancer diagnoses due to declines in screening.

For their study, Akinyemi's team analyzed data from a National Cancer Database cohort of over 1.5 million women who were diagnosed with breast cancer between the ages of 40 and 64 years.

Overall, 58% lived in Medicaid-expansion states — defined as states that expanded eligibility between 2010 and January 2014. The rest lived in non-expansion states, defined as those that had not implemented expansion at the time of the dataset release. States that expanded Medicaid eligibility after January 2014 were excluded from the analysis.

The researchers found that between 2006 and 2013, there was no difference in mortality trends between patients with breast cancer in expansion and non-expansion states. That changed post-ACA implementation: Medicaid expansion was associated with a modest but significant reduction in overall mortality (hazard ratio, 0.95; P < .001), in models adjusted for factors such as race/ethnicity, zip-code-level income, education level, and initial treatment type.

“The policy saves life,” Akinyemi said. “And it saves it irrespective of your disease stage, your race, your income, or even the treatment modalities that you received.”

Even so, the researchers did find that survival gains were particularly pronounced among Hispanic patients, who experienced a 19% relative reduction in mortality associated with Medicaid expansion.

That, Akinyemi said, might be because a particularly large proportion of Hispanic individuals lacked insurance prior to the ACA.

Meanwhile, the relative mortality reduction associated with Medicaid expansion was less for non-Hispanic Black women, at 4.3%. That finding highlights persistent inequities that insurance coverage alone may not fully address, according to Akinyemi's team.

More work is needed, they wrote, to see whether additional policy measures can help close the gap between Black women and other historically marginalized groups.

In real-world clinical practice, adding p‑tau217 testing significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and increased neurologists' diagnostic confidence, with marked reclassification seen in mild cognitive impairment and dementia and confidence gains occurred across all cognitive stages.

""[The study] findings support the clinical utility of p-tau217 from both a biomarker validation and a real-world clinical decision-making perspective, and across all stages of cognitive decline, including subjective cognitive decline,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Jordi A. Matías‑Guiu, San Carlos Health Research Institute, Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain. It was published online on February 10, 2026, in the Journal of Neurology.

Only a subset of patients underwent cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis as this study was conducted under clinical practice conditions. Since the diagnosis after the initial visit was mainly based on the clinical history and neurologic examination, p-tau217 could complement to a brief clinical assessment. The study used serum rather than plasma.

This study received partial funding from the Spanish Ministry of Health and Lilly. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Varicose veins and associated chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) are among the most prevalent vascular disorders worldwide. Prevalence estimates vary considerably, ranging from 40% to 73% in women and 20% to 56% in men. Established risk factors include older age, female sex, obesity, pregnancy, a history of deep vein thrombosis, and prolonged standing. However, the relative contributions of genetic factors have not yet been fully elucidated. A genome-wide association study identified 855 nucleotide polymorphisms and 30 independent genetic variants associated with varicose veins.

The clinical presentation of leg heaviness, edema, and skin changes often reflects years of disease progression. In primary care, distinguishing CVI from other causes of edema, such as heart failure or adverse effects of medications such as calcium-channel blockers, hormone therapy, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is the first step. The study authors emphasized that a structured clinical examination supplemented by duplex ultrasonography forms the basis for every treatment decision. Identifying the refluxing segment is critical for selecting the appropriate compression class, according to the expert team.

Compression therapy remains the gold-standard treatment. Evidence shows that even a moderate pressure of 20-30 mm Hg provides significant relief in most individuals with uncomplicated CVI. Pressures > 30 mm Hg are recommended for ulcer healing but are difficult to tolerate. Caution is warranted in individuals with peripheral arterial disease and an ankle-brachial index < 0.8. In such cases, the arterial status must be assessed before initiating high-pressure compression, particularly at pressures > 30 mm Hg, to ensure that the limb retains adequate arterial perfusion. When a patient's symptoms correlate with duplex ultrasonography findings, interventional procedures such as sclerotherapy or vein stripping may be justified to relieve symptoms and facilitate wound healing.

A critical issue, however, is adherence: Many individuals discontinue compression therapy because of difficulties in its application. The use of donning aids or a switch to low-pressure compression stockings may be helpful. In addition, weight reduction and targeted ankle exercises play a role that is frequently underestimated.

GPs should not wait for the development of venous leg ulcers before treating CVI. Early counselling on leg elevation and consistent skin care to prevent stasis dermatitis are essential. Pharmacologic options, such as venoactive agents, may provide supportive benefits in selected cases but do not replace mechanical support. Conservative management of CVI requires patient care and close follow-up. Well-informed patients have a significantly better quality of life and a lower risk for ulceration.

Sports participation during childhood or adolescence was associated with higher physical activity levels during adulthood, and together, these were linked to improved health-related quality of life during adulthood, particularly in the general health domain.

""[The study] findings suggest that initiating PA [physical activity] at an early age may yield the greatest long-term subjective health perceptions,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Tuomas S.M. Lehtola, Department of General Practice and Primary Health Care, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. It was published online on February 06, 2026, in the European Journal of Public Health.

MET hours represent only rough estimates as they were calculated on the basis of available responses to questionnaires. The study's observational design limited the ability to establish causality between early sports participation and adult health outcomes.

On January 20, the European Parliament adopted a series of proposals aimed at improving the availability and supply of critical medicines within the EU. The regulation passed with 503 votes in favor, 57 against, and 108 abstentions.

According to a Parliament press release, Members of the European Parliament support the creation of industrial ‘strategic projects' within the EU to build, modernize, and improve production capacity. They want national governments and the EU to prioritize financial support for these strategic projects in the current budget and the next EU multiannual financial framework. Companies receiving public financial support must adhere to clear obligations, including prioritizing supplies to the EU market.

The proposed Critical Medicines Regulation states, “The EU has a strong and competitive pharmaceutical sector, which holds a leading global position in the production of medicines and contributes significantly to the EU economy, directly employing around 800,000 people. However, in recent years, the Union has experienced a growing number of medicine shortages, including shortages of medicines whose insufficient supply causes serious harm or a risk for serious harm to patients.”

The regulation noted that shortages may have structural causes and may result from “supply chain disruptions and vulnerabilities affecting the provision of key ingredients and components.” These issues are linked to the EU's dependence on a limited number of global suppliers and its insufficient capacity to produce certain medicines, their active substances, or essential pharmaceutical raw materials.

To address these challenges, the proposed regulation seeks to establish a framework designed to:

• Facilitate investment in manufacturing capacity for critical medicines, their active ingredients, and other key inputs within the union.

• Reduce the risk for supply disruption and strengthen availability by encouraging the diversification and resilience of supply chains in public procurement procedures for critical and other medicines of common interest.

• Respond to the aggregated demand from participating member states through collaborative procurement procedures.

• Supports supply chain diversification by facilitating the establishment of strategic partnerships.

This proposal outlines several core components.

Rapporteur Tomislav Sokol from European People's Party, Croatia, and member of the European Parliament stated, “Today we agreed on clear priorities: coordinating national and emergency stockpiles, strengthening the competitiveness of the EU pharmaceutical industry, and tackling medicine shortages by ensuring their accessibility and availability for EU patients.”

The European Parliament is now ready to begin negotiations with EU governments regarding the final form of legislation.

While physical activity is recommended for patients with heart disease who have a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), it requires choosing the right device and programming to prevent inappropriate shocks, Christophe Vô, MD, pediatric cardiologist at Saint-Luc University Clinic, Brussels, Belgium, reminded attendees at the European Days of the French Society of Cardiology (JESFC 2026) held on January 14-16, 2026.

“We are starting to take the patient's physical activity into account when deciding whether to implant a pacemaker. We consider the type of pacemaker or ICD to implant based on the sport practiced and the best site for implantation. For example, in a left‑handed patient, we will avoid placing the device on the left side,” Vô said.

To choose the most appropriate device, “you have to assess the patient's sporting habits or the expectations of younger patients in terms of physical activity” even before implanting an ICD or pacemaker. Some devices, for example, are equipped with algorithms and sensors that better detect heart‑rate changes related to physical activity.

Programming must consider the physical activity as well as the underlying heart condition after evaluating arrhythmia risk using an ECG and an exercise stress test. It is important to optimize the device's response to exercise, set appropriate monitoring frequency limits, and clearly define the arrhythmia detection zones.

With this personalized programming, it is important to determine the maximum heart rate the patient can reach and inform them that exceeding that rate may place them in the arrhythmia detection zone and trigger the device.

Adult congenital heart disease is the most common congenital abnormality. Whereas deaths formerly occurred early, more than 80% of affected children now reach adulthood. “This is a young population that may be seeking regular physical activity, even competition,” Vô said.

In these patients, the benefits of physical activity are well demonstrated, both physiologically and psychologically. Besides improving self‑esteem and promoting social ties, exercise reduces the risk for physical deconditioning, increases functional capacity, and can even improve cardiac output in some heart conditions.

However, in this higher‑risk population for arrhythmia, nearly 10% have an ICD or a pacemaker. The risk for bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia depends on the heart condition. Overall, the more complex the heart disease, the greater the arrhythmia risk.

So, how do you adapt sports activities and the implanted device? It depends on the type of stimulation. For example, in atrioventricular block, the device's role is to stimulate the ventricle after atrial stimulation. During physical activity, the pacemaker needs to pace at higher frequencies. However, the device is programmed by default with low frequencies, explained Vô.

In patients with atrioventricular block, programming expertise is required to adapt the pacemaker to physical activity before implantation. Depending on age and the sport practiced, it may be necessary to reach 160-180 beats/min, especially in younger patients. Only certain models can go above 180 beats/min.

For a pacemaker to be able to pace at high frequencies, the interval between atrial sensing and ventricular pacing — and the device's refractory period — must both be shortened. If this is not considered, high rates can lead the pacemaker to generate a 2:1 block — a sudden halving of the ventricular rate under heavy exertion.

Another example: in sinus node dysfunction, the choice of pacemaker depends on the integrated sensor that allows the heart rate to increase in response to detected effort. Most often, this is a motion sensor (accelerometer) that measures upper‑body acceleration. Other pacemakers can estimate effort by analyzing respiration or cardiac contraction.

These sensors are generally poorly suited to static exercises or intermittent sports that alternate between static and more physical activity. A pacemaker with an accelerometer is ideal for activities such as running or hiking, but is not well suited to cycling.

For cycling or static activity, patients with a pacemaker equipped with a motion sensor are advised to move their upper body to activate the device, Gilles Bosser, MD, University Hospital of Nancy, France, said at the end of the presentation during a Q&A session. This advice also applies before a strenuous activity.

Only Biotronik devices are equipped with sensors that assess changes in impedance after myocardial contraction to adapt heart rate. In sinus node dysfunction, this is probably the most physiologically appropriate stimulation. The device can thus more easily detect static activity.

With an ICD, there is a risk for inappropriate shocks if the rate detection zones have been poorly set. Inappropriate shocks can occur even when the patient is engaged in physical activity that increases their heart rate up to the detection zone.

In this context, the stress test is important to evaluate the device's response. “It also helps determine the arrhythmia detection zones that will trigger defibrillation and the refractory‑period zones that can cause a 2:1 block from a pacemaker.”

The risk for arrhythmia also depends on the type of heart disease, as well as surgical procedures, which increase or decrease the risk for ventricular arrhythmias depending on scarring. Some arrhythmias can also be linked to surgical complications, such as coronary artery damage. 

To determine this risk and adapt the cardiac device accordingly, clinicians should rely on the exercise stress test and ECG, as well as Holter monitoring and electrophysiological study, to record continuous heart activity. Clinicians should not hesitate to use these tools to determine arrhythmia risk.

Finally, the device's implantation site is important. If the patient wants to practice a one‑sided sport, like tennis or badminton, the stimulator should be implanted on the nondominant side. In contact sports, it can also be useful to wear a pad over the device for protection.

As a reminder, patients are advised to wait 6 weeks after implantation before resuming sports, Vô said. Except for combat sports, all sports can be practiced.

Bimekizumab produced better relief from plaque psoriasis symptoms and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores than secukinumab in a phase 3b study.

“Many patients treated with bimekizumab had concurrent improvements in clinical outcomes and PROs, both of which are important for informing treatment decisions, suggesting that bimekizumab's high clinical efficacy translates into benefits to patient-perceived symptoms and health-related quality of life,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Matthias Augustin, MD, PhD, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, and was published online on February 18 in JAMA Dermatology.

The eligibility criteria could limit the generalizability of findings to some real-world patients with comorbidities. Additionally, potential bias may have been introduced through the open-label extension phase and its lack of treatment blinding to patients and physicians. Switching patients from secukinumab to bimekizumab may not reflect clinical settings because these patients were not switching due to treatment failure as they would in clinical practice.

The study was funded by UCB. Augustin reported receiving grants and personal fees from AbbVie, Almirall, Amgen, Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Celgene, Centocor, Eli Lilly and Company, Galderma, Hexal, Incyte, Janssen, Klinge Pharma, LEO Pharma, medac, MSD, Mylan, Novartis, Pfizer, Sandoz, Sun Pharma, Takeda, UCB, and Viatris.

Trividia Health, Inc., has issued an Urgent Medical Device Correction regarding a specific displayed error message on TRUE METRIX brand glucose meters.

The “E-5” error code designates either a test strip error or a blood glucose value > 600 mg/dL. New instructions clarify that if the E-5 error appears and the patient is experiencing symptoms such as fatigue, excessive urination, thirst, or blurred vision, they should seek medical attention immediately.

As of January 16, Trividia Health has reported 114 serious injuries and one death associated with this issue.

“A delay in treatment may result in serious adverse health consequences, such as dehydration, altered mental status, or death, especially for users with very high blood glucose levels,” according to the Trividia statement, which the FDA announced as an “early alert.”

If the device displays the E-5 message but the patient does not have hyperglycemia symptoms, they should retest with a new test strip. And if the error persists, they should call 1-800-803-6025 weekdays from 8 AM to 8 PM Eastern Standard Time for assistance.

Affected products are the TRUE METRIX, TRUE METRIX AIR, and TRUE METRIX GO Self-Monitoring, as well as TRUE METRIX PRO Professional Monitoring Blood Glucose Systems.

Healthcare professionals are advised to notify patients of the correction but that they can continue using the products.

In multiple patient facilities, the “Urgent Medical Device Correction” notice should be posted in areas where the products are stored within the facility so that all relevant personnel will see it.

The FDA says it will keep the public informed and will update its webpage as significant new information becomes available.

At the 38th Congress of the French Society for Rheumatology (SFR), held on December 14-16, 2025, in Paris, France, a session bringing together psychologists and rheumatologists focused on managing stress among physicians. “Stress is defined as a state of anxiety or mental tension caused by a difficult situation. This phenomenon is unique to each person and is not solely negative. It can be positive, helping to mobilize resources in the face of difficulties, fostering cohesion, vigilance, or creativity. Conversely, negative stress leads to emotional tension, reduces performance, and can cause exhaustion and loss of control. We distinguish three types of stress: hypostress, which is lack of motivation; hyperstress, which is emotional overload; and eustress, the ideal form because it stimulates and motivates better responses to challenges,” said Lisa Biale, a rheumatologist at the Bégin Military Teaching Hospital in Saint-Mandé, France. “In neuroscience, optimal performance rests on a balance among three neurotransmitters: dopamine (reward), norepinephrine (motivation via stress), and acetylcholine (focus). Maintaining this right balance is essential to remain in a state of maximal performance,” added Marie-Victoire Chopin, PhD, a clinical psychologist in Paris.

Current risk factors for stress among healthcare workers fall into several categories, Biale said. First, individual factors include gender (disproportionately affecting women), mental workload, the need for recognition, a history of anxiety or depressive disorders, and difficulty setting boundaries. “In medicine, it can be complex to precisely define the boundaries of one's role. Certain personality traits predispose individuals to detrimental chronic stress, such as perfectionism, an extreme sense of duty, high ideals of caregiving, and great empathy. Finally, difficulty in letting go is an additional factor, often raised in discussions on professional well-being,” she added.

Risk factors are also organizational, Biale said: “The main organizational risk factors are work overload, staff shortages, task shifting between professions, a frenetic pace, constant connectivity (emails outside regular working hours), lack of resources, and conflicting demands. These elements all contribute to suffering in the healthcare sector.” The culture of “holding on at all costs” is also an aggravating factor that reinforces a survival bias and prevents asking for help, said Margaux Moret, MD, a senior rheumatology clinician at the Nancy Regional and University Hospital Center, Nancy, France.

The ultimate consequence of stress is burnout, but that state develops progressively after passing several stages: “Vulnerabilities that lead to burnout often follow an insidious process. You don't wake up one morning suddenly exhausted; generally, it begins with stress situations sometimes described as secondary stress: an intense reaction, frequently linked to our constant exposure to suffering in the clinical environment. At this stage, it's not yet a case of profound exhaustion, but we already observe a strong response to our patients' traumatic accounts: hypervigilance, irritability, sleep disorders, mental overload, although recovery is still possible,” Chopin explained.

Next comes compassion fatigue that develops gradually and leads to emotional wear from prolonged exposure to distress. This fatigue shows up as growing exhaustion and a progressive loss of pleasure and meaning associated with work. “Gradually, indifference sets in, sometimes accompanied by dark humor and a feeling of powerlessness. It is then that empathy, so essential to the helping relationship, tends to diminish. Ultimately, when burnout occurs, it is a true professional exhaustion caused by chronic exposure to stress, overload, and organizational constraints. At this stage, we observe emotional withdrawal, defensive cynicism, a decrease in efficiency and commitment, until everything seems to collapse,” Chopin continued.

For preventative purposes, it is possible to assess one's stress with practical tools such as the vulnerability barometer based on Well-Being Therapy, presented by Chopin. It evaluates six dimensions of well-being: self-acceptance, control of the environment, positive relationships, purpose in life, personal growth, and psychological safety. This barometer helps detect early warning signs and determine the need for psychological care.

Biale's day-to-day stress management tips:

“To overcome difficult periods individually, it's essential to first take care of your lifestyle, both emotionally and cognitively,” Biale said. “Support groups, debriefing, and mentoring for younger colleagues also help manage complex situations. It is essential to learn to delegate, accept imperfection, structure recovery time, and identify strengths and weaknesses, so you can progress with tolerance,” she concluded.

Pharmacies across England are at risk for closure, with most operating at a loss and warning that they may be forced to cut services within weeks, the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has said. 

In a survey of its members, 65% reported operating at a loss in 2025. The association said this left two thirds of pharmacies at “real risk of imminent closure.”

In a letter to Health Secretary Wes Streeting, signed by 3200 independent pharmacies in England, the NPA said that without urgent funding, one third of pharmacies that had reached “breaking point” would cut services to keep their doors open.

The association said the closure risk stemmed from “intolerable financial pressures.” Many pharmacists had resorted to “taking out loans, maximising overdrafts, and raiding pensions” to keep their businesses afloat.

Business rate rises and increases in the national minimum wage from April were cited as major contributors to the financial challenges.

“The fact that so many pharmacies operate at a loss should set off serious alarm bells in government,” said NPA chair Olivier Picard.

“As a tsunami of new costs arrives, pharmacies are faced with agonising decisions about how they can continue,” he added.

Last year, pharmacies closed at a rate of more than one a week. In January alone, eight pharmacies shut permanently.

Deprived areas with high health needs recorded the highest closure rates between 2022 and 2025. Liverpool had the highest number of closures per head of population, followed by Blackpool, Coventry, and Hull.

The pharmacy network in England is now at its smallest since 2006. West Berkshire was described as the “nation's pharmacy desert,” with fewer than a quarter as many pharmacies per head of population as Westminster, which has the highest provision.

The NPA said closures had disproportionately affected patients in deprived communities and those in isolated rural areas.

A review of pharmacy finances commissioned by NHS England identified a gap of more than £2 billion between NHS pharmacy funding and the economic cost of running a pharmacy, the NPA said.

In its survey, 95% of pharmacies said they were not in a financial position to support the government's ambition to shift care into the community.

The closure of pharmacies would “jeopardise access” to medicines for millions of patients, “blowing an enormous hole in the government's 10 Year Plan before it has even begun,” the association warned.

“We do not want to make the agonising decisions about whether the pharmacy can stay open or what services to cut in April,” Picard said.

The NPA added that it was “simply not right” that pharmacies were “routinely subsidising NHS prescriptions.” It called on the government to reform the pharmacy contract and provide an above-inflation funding uplift.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said, “Pharmacies are central to our shift towards community-based care. This year we increased community pharmacy funding to £3.1 billion, which is the largest uplift for any part of the NHS over the last 2 years.”

Physical violence in sexual assaults against young people has become more common and more severe. This is shown in a new doctoral thesis from Karolinska Institutet. The studies cover both women and men and point to the need for clearer clinical procedures and better education about consent.

The thesis examines how young women and men experience physical violence in sexual situations, both in consensual situations and in case of abuse. The results are based on a combination of medical record reviews and interviews.

A total of over 1,300 people were included in the quantitative analyses, based on anonymised medical and forensic medical records from the Emergency Department for Rape Victims at Södersjukhuset.Among young women between the ages of 16 and 29 who sought care in 2012, 2017 and 2022, there was a clear increase in severe violence during the assaults. The researchers found that strangulation had become more common over time.

""This type of violence often occurred in the home and in combination with other forms of violence,"" says Frida Larsson at the Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, who recently presented her doctoral thesis.Frida Larsson believes that the increase may be due to greater awareness among healthcare professionals, who have become better at asking questions about strangulation and documenting it. But that does not explain everything, she says.

We cannot say what is behind the increase, as we have not researched the factors driving this development. It is a complex issue that requires further study before we can draw any firm conclusions about its causes.""

Frida Larsson, Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet

Part of the doctoral thesis also covered young men who sought care after sexual violence.

""The results showed that moderate to severe violence was more common when several perpetrators were involved. Among young men, there was also a link between attempts at self-defence and more extensive violence,"" says Frida Larsson.In addition to reviewing medical records, 24 women and men between the ages of 16 and 24 were interviewed about their experiences of sex, violence and consent. Several described how so-called 'rough sex' is often shaped by gender roles and ideas of dominance and subordination. Some experienced this type of sex as voluntary and positive, while others felt uncomfortable. The participants talked about the importance of consent in these practices, as they can increase the risk of boundaries being misinterpreted.""What we see is that young people know that consent should be clear and mutual, but that there are obstacles in practice. These can include fear of hurting someone, expectations linked to gender, or not wanting to appear uncertain,"" says Frida Larsson.Several participants also described how social media, friends and pornography influence their perception of what is 'normal' in sexual situations.""These influences can make some people feel pressured to do things they don't really want to do, or find it difficult to set boundaries,"" continues Frida Larsson.According to the results of the thesis, better procedures are needed within healthcare to identify and deal with strangulation violence. There is also a need for clearer teaching about consent in schools, with a focus on communication, boundaries and power.The thesis was supervised by Anna Nielsen, Anna Möller, Anna Mia Ekström and Mariano Salazar. The public defence took place on 13 February 2026.

Diabetes and kidney disease are major risk factors for heart disease, yet many cases are undiagnosed. In addition, a consumer survey done last fall suggests that most people don't realize that their heart, kidney and metabolic health (how the body creates, uses and stores energy) are connected.

According to the American Heart Association's new 2026 statistics update, almost 1 in 4 U.S. adults with diabetes are unaware they have it. In addition, Centers for Disease Control data report that as many as 9 in 10 adults with chronic kidney disease do not know they have it.

Because heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes are closely linked, having one condition often increases the likelihood of developing the others. This is largely due to shared risk factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, excess weight and reduced kidney function. The Association's statistics report indicates that screening for kidney disease in particular could be improved, as two-thirds of patients with high blood pressure or diabetes are not aware that they also have kidney disease due to lack of uACR testing, a urine test for kidney function. For people with diabetes or high blood pressure, two screening tests for kidney health are suggested: the uACR urine test and eGFR blood test. Each measures different aspects of kidney health and function.

We are encouraging people to become aware of the connection between conditions so they and their health care team can think about their overall health beyond individual conditions. Understanding the connection helps you better prevent complications through lifestyle changes and appropriate treatment.""

Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, volunteer president of the American Heart Association

The medical term for the connection between heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes is cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, or CKM syndrome. The biggest health threats from CKM syndrome are disability and death from heart disease and stroke, which make up the ""cardiovascular"" part of CKM.

The ""metabolic"" part of CKM syndrome includes diabetes and obesity. Kidney disease is closely linked with both metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.

Rosen emphasizes that regular screening of your cardiovascular, kidney and metabolic health can catch problems early, as approximately 80% of heart attacks and strokes are preventable, according to the American Heart Association. In addition, risk factors often develop slowly, with few or no symptoms at first.

""Due to the current risk factor rates, everyone could benefit from being screened this way,"" she adds. Rosen is executive director of the Katz Institute for Women's Health and senior vice president of women's health at Northwell Health in New York City.

The Association's 2026 statistics report shows that about half of all U.S. adults have high blood pressure, about 1 in 3 has high total cholesterol, more than half have prediabetes or diabetes, over half have a high waist circumference, and about 1 in 7 has kidney disease.

Screening for CKM syndrome may include the following tests:

A healthcare professional can put results from these tests into the PREVENT online calculator to estimate your individual risk for cardiovascular disease over the next 10 or 30 years.

CKM syndrome is preventable and treatable. Healthy habits like those in Life's Essential 8 and evidence-based treatments can improve multiple health conditions together.

Axol Bioscience Ltd. (Axol), a leading provider of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies for drug discovery and research, today announced that it has acquired the ophthalmology business of Newcells Biotech (Newcells), a leading drug discovery partner specializing in the development of in vitro models and bespoke assay services.

The acquisition of Newcells' ophthalmology business includes its specialist team, facilities and intellectual property related to supply of proprietary iPSC-derived products and ophthalmology research services to biopharma, biotechnology and CRO customers across Europe and the United States. Developed over more than a decade, the platforms encompass advanced retinal organoids and 2D retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) models designed to support preclinical research and translational drug development.

Growing investment in research to discover new therapeutics for eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and rare disease has driven Axol's strategic expansion into ophthalmology with the acquisition of Phenocell in October 2024. The acquisition of Newcells' ophthalmology business further strengthens the company's position as the leading independent provider of iPSC-derived in vitro models for ophthalmology drug discovery, gene therapy development, and retinal safety and toxicity studies.

The news follows Axol's recent $2.8 million financing, led by US life sciences investor BroadOak Capital Partners, which is supporting expansion of its US commercial operations, product development and manufacturing scale-up.

Following our recent financing and continued strong revenue growth, we are executing on a clear strategy to scale Axol internationally and deepen our scientific capabilities. The addition of Newcells' retinal organoid business is our third acquisition in five years and significantly enhances our ophthalmology offering, combining complementary expertise and intellectual property to create the most comprehensive independent portfolio of iPSC-derived retinal models globally.""

Liam Taylor, CEO, Axol Bioscience

""Newcells has developed a highly sophisticated and scalable retinal organoid platform focused on predictive, human-relevant iPSC-derived retinal models that are recognised across the industry. Integrating this capability with Axol's existing ophthalmology portfolio enables us to offer a broader, more physiologically relevant toolkit to support research. As drug developers increasingly seek predictive human models to de-risk programs earlier, this acquisition further positions Axol at the forefront of ophthalmology drug discovery and safety testing"" said Florian Regent, Head of Ophthalmology, Axol Bioscience.

Financial terms of the agreement are not disclosed.

Genetic ancestry may play a key role in how acral melanoma, a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer, develops and behaves, with important implications for diagnosis and treatment, according to researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and their collaborators.

The team analyzed the genetic makeup of over 100 acral melanoma tumors from Mexican patients to understand how this cancer develops, including studying how ancestry influences tumor biology. They uncovered that acral melanoma varies, with three groups showing distinct gene expressions that are associated with different outcomes.

Published in Nature, the study provides one of the most comprehensive genetic studies of acral melanoma in a Latin American population to date. The findings highlight the importance of including diverse populations in cancer research and clinical trials to fully understand how cancers develop and respond to treatment.

Most melanomas, a type of skin cancer, are caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun and are commonly studied in populations from European ancestries.

However, acral melanoma is a different subtype of skin cancer as it arises in parts of the body that are not exposed to sunlight, in particular the palms of hands, soles of feet and under the nails. Over 330,000 people were diagnosed with melanoma globally in 2022, but acral melanoma is considered a rare type, accounting for only about 1–3% of all melanoma cases diagnosed. However, in many cases, it represents the majority of the diagnosed cases in people with Indigenous American, Asian and African ancestry.

Despite the differences seen in acral melanoma, melanoma is often treated as a single disease based on knowledge from studies of UV-driven melanoma, despite growing evidence showing that acral melanoma behaves differently to UV-driven melanoma.

As a result, acral melanoma has been historically understudied, underrepresented in cancer genomic studies and lacks an approved specific targeted treatment. These gaps are particularly evident in Latin America, where national cancer registries are limited or absent.

In the new study, the researchers sought to understand what genetic changes underlie acral melanoma in Latin America, focusing on tumors from Mexican patients. The team analyzed 123 tumors from 92 Mexican patients diagnosed with acral melanoma by generating genomic data at the Sanger Institute. Using a combination of DNA sequencing and gene expression analysis, the researchers examined tumor mutations, large-scale genetic changes and patterns of gene activity.

They also looked at the genetic ancestry of patients, allowing them to directly study how ancestry relates to tumor DNA. This allowed the researchers to link the molecular structure of acral melanoma tumors with clinical outcomes, providing deep insight into how genetic background shapes the behavior of this type of cancer.

The researchers found that classic melanoma mutations were far less common overall in the acral melanoma tumors from Mexican patients. For example, the BRAF gene normally includes instructions to make the BRAF protein, which is involved in cell development pathways. A mutated version of BRAF is present in around half of UV-driven melanomas. However, in this cohort, patients with more European ancestry were more likely to carry BRAF mutations than those from Indigenous American ancestry.

By analyzing the gene activity across tumors, the researchers also identified three distinct clusters of acral melanoma that were associated with different outcomes. Firstly, tumors showing higher expression of immune-related genes were associated with better outcomes. Secondly, tumors that showed rapid cell growth and pigmentation pathways—the cellular processes that regulate pigment production in cells—were linked with recurrence and poorer outcomes. Thirdly, a group of tumors that showed a change in their metabolic pathway were associated with more variable outcomes.

Together, these results bolster the understanding of acral melanoma. It is not a single disease, but shows groups of high variability, which are distinctly associated with how the cancer behaves. Therefore, incorporating genetic information of tumors could improve prognosis and support a more personalized treatment plan.

More broadly, the study highlights a key issue in cancer research: the lack of genomic data from non-European populations. By focusing on a Latin American population, the study demonstrates how research that includes diverse populations can lead to a more accurate and equitable understanding of disease.

Dr. Patricia Basurto-Lozada, first author at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said, ""We found that acral melanoma is not a single disease. Tumors fall into distinct biological groups that are linked to different patient outcomes. This information may be crucial for developing targeted treatments for acral melanoma in the future and ultimately improving the lives of patients.""

We have an issue in Latin America where we have limited cancer registries, which are essential for tracking cancer trends over time. That's why it's key for us to gather and analyze data that helps scientists, clinicians and ultimately patients, to deliver the best care possible for those diagnosed with acral melanoma.""

Dr. Patrícia Abrão Possik, co-author, International Fellow at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Group Leader at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA)

Dr. Carla Daniela Robles-Espinoza, senior author and former International Fellow at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, based at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, added, ""When patients enter clinical trials, it is not a one-size-fits-all approach. To understand how well treatments work, we need studies that include people from diverse ancestral backgrounds. This research provides crucial context about the genetic makeup of acral melanoma, which may influence response to treatments.""

Dr. David Adams, co-senior author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, observed, ""Our research highlights the underrepresented nature of cancer genomics studies. By emphasizing the need for more diversity in research and clinical trials, we hope the findings contribute to improved outcomes for patients with rare and aggressive cancers like acral melanoma.""

Oral cancers with a high risk of recurrence can be identified at an early stage by examining the lymphatic vessels of the tumor. Finnish researchers have discovered for the first time that the surface cells of the lymphatic vessels in oral cancer contain proteins that indicate cell division and strongly predict disease progression and mortality.

Oral cancers are the most common malignant tumors in the head and neck region, causing more than 188,000 deaths worldwide each year. Unlike in many other cancers, even small and early-stage tumors in oral cancer can lead to death. In Finland, where the study was conducted, up to a fifth of patients treated in the early stages later die from the disease.

The research team from the University of Turku and the InFLAMES research flagship used early-stage oral cancer samples collected from approximately 300 Finnish patients to study the properties of various defence and structural cells found in the tumor tissue. By studying multiple different protein markers, the researchers made the surprising discovery that some tumors showed a higher number of proliferating lymphatic vessels than normal. The high number of proliferating lymphatic vessels predicted cancer recurrence and death better than any other previously known risk factor for oral cancer.Lymphatic vessels are normally present in the mouth, but in a healthy oral cavity, their cells rarely divide and marker proteins indicating this process are not usually seen.

It is crucial to identify aggressive forms of the disease at the diagnostic stage to ensure that the increased risk of cancer recurrence and death can be addressed when planning the treatment. Currently, local oral cancer treatment mainly involves surgery, and there are no precise methods for targeting adjuvant therapies. We need biomarkers so that we can treat high-risk patients more effectively and avoid exposing patients with a better prognosis to the potentially serious adverse effects of adjuvant therapies."" 

Joni Näsiaho, lead author of the study, Doctoral Researcher at the University of Turku and physician specializing in oncology

""We are excited about the results and believe that the findings could also be applied as a practical tool for clinical use. Furthermore, it would be interesting to find out whether the marker we discovered has a similar predictive value in other cancer groups,"" says Näsiaho.The study was published in the prestigious medical journal Cell Reports Medicine. The work was funded by the Research Council of Finland, the Cancer Foundation Finland, and the Finnish Government research funding, and was carried out at the MediCity Research Laboratory of the University of Turku in the group of Professor, InFLAMES group leader Marko Salmi. In addition, three ear, nose and throat specialists who treat and study oral cancer in the Turku University Hospital also participated in the study.

The move from seeing artificial intelligence as an interesting add-on to treating it as a core lab capability rarely happens through a sweeping, top-down strategy. More often, it happens in small, practical steps that are driven by immediate needs at the bench rather than a fully coordinated master plan.

Because of that, the results vary. In many cases, AI adoption is shaped just as much by the shortcomings of existing tools as by intentional design. Some labs are seeing clear, measurable improvements. Others have more activity and more tools in play, but not much lasting change to show for it.

If we want to understand why outcomes differ so widely, it helps to step back from individual features and look at the bigger picture. A lab AI maturity model can be useful here as a way to think about how documentation, interpretation, and decision-making are beginning to connect again in a more systematic way.

At the center of this shift is a growing disconnect between recording experimental data and actually being able to use it in a meaningful way.

Over the past decade, laboratories have invested heavily in electronic lab notebooks. Those investments have largely paid off in documentation and compliance. In recent research, 62 percent of lab professionals say their ELN supports efficient day-to-day work.

Interpretation, however, remains a weak point. Eighty-one percent report that their ELN captures data but does not help them interpret it. Prior work may exist, yet still be difficult to find, compare, or trust in context. The result is a paradox. Labs can be compliant and data-rich, while still struggling to leverage their own experimental history.

This friction has real consequences. Sixty-five percent of scientists report repeating experiments or assays because previous results were too hard to locate or reuse with confidence. That repetition is not a failure of scientific rigor. It is a workflow problem.

This pattern defines the first stage of the maturity model, often described as the passive lab.

In a passive environment, the ELN functions primarily as a system of record. It reliably captures data, but plays a limited role in active scientific thinking. Interpretation and analysis frequently happen elsewhere.

Autonomy is constrained. Only 7 percent of researchers report being able to configure assays or templates without specialist support. Routine changes can introduce delays, and interpretation becomes fragmented across spreadsheets, specialist tools, and informal processes that sit outside the governed notebook.

Scientific work continues, but context does not accumulate in a durable way.

As pressure for speed increases, many passive labs drift into a transitional state.

Scientists begin supplementing the ELN with public generative AI tools to summarize results, explore explanations, and plan experiments. The productivity gains are immediate. The structural costs are not.

Research shows that 77 percent of lab professionals now use public AI tools alongside their ELN. For many, this is not driven by policy decisions, but by necessity. Governed tools do not yet support the interpretive work scientists need to do, so they look elsewhere.

In this middle stage, the pace of work accelerates while the scientific record thins. Reasoning shifts into unmanaged environments. The “why” behind decisions lives in personal chat histories that the organization cannot review, audit, or reuse.

The most mature stage of the model is the active lab.

Here, intelligence moves back inside the governed environment. A third-generation ELN supports interpretation at the point of documentation, retaining reasoning alongside results so it can be reviewed, reused, and trusted.

The defining characteristic of an active lab is not simply the presence of AI. It is the ability to take governed action within the workflow. Interpretation, comparison, and planning occur close to the experimental record rather than being reconstructed after the fact.

Progression to this state is incremental. Early gains come from retrieval and comparison. Scientists can pull relevant prior work, summarize outcomes across runs, and explore interpretations with clear links back to source data. As trust and governance mature, more orchestrated actions can be introduced, always within defined guardrails and with explicit human oversight.

It is also worth remembering that scientific culture is inherently evidence-driven, and that discipline carries over to AI. Eighty-one percent of researchers say they would only trust AI-generated suggestions if they can review the underlying data and logic. Transparency is not a secondary feature. It is a prerequisite rooted in scientific norms.

Taken together, these shifts change what the lab notebook actually represents. 

Instead of serving as a static repository, it starts to function as an integration hub where experimental data, analytical tools, AI support, and human judgment come together. Connectivity across the broader ecosystem becomes critical. Interpretation rarely happens in isolation, and context is easily lost when systems don't communicate with one another.

Sapio Sciences' ELaiN reflects this third-generation notebook model. It embeds science-aware AI directly into governed workflows, helping ensure that interpretation stays anchored to underlying evidence. The objective is to make sure that speed, trust, and reuse develop in parallel. 

As AI becomes more embedded in laboratory operations, the question is no longer whether labs will use it. The more pressing issue is how intentionally they decide where it belongs and how it fits into daily work.

When interpretation is as straightforward to capture as documentation, informal workarounds become less attractive and institutional knowledge can finally keep pace with the science itself. 

Sapio Sciences' mission is to improve lives by accelerating discovery, and because science is complex, Sapio makes technology simple. Sapio is a global business offering an all-in-one science-aware (TM) lab informatics platform combining cloud-based LIMS, ELN, and SDMS.

Hip fractures are common in the elderly, with many patients experiencing a decline in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) post-surgery. Therefore, postoperative rehabilitation plays a crucial role in helping patients recover to their pre-injury ADL level. Previous studies have shown that providing rehabilitation on weekdays and outside of normal business hours, such as on the weekend and public holidays, during hospitalization promotes improvements in ADL. However, many medical institutions have limited human resources, making it difficult to provide rehabilitation services to all patients on holidays. Consequently, decisions on which patients should receive priority intervention are currently made based on medical professionals' discretion.

To devise a better course of action, a Graduate School of Medicine research group, led by the student Tsubasa Bito, Specially Appointed Assistant Professor Ryota Kawai, and Professor Ayumi Shintani from the Department of Medical Statistics and the Department of Orthopedic Surgery's Dr. Shinji Takahashi, analyzed 77,947 patients aged 60 or older who underwent surgery after a hip fracture. Using the Barthel Index, which assesses ADL from 0 (complete dependence) to 100 (complete independence), the research team analyzed the impact on ADL at discharge when rehabilitation was provided within 7 days after surgery, including on holidays. The team made comparisons according to differences in age and ADL status at admission.

Their findings revealed that patients over 80 and those with initial Barthel Index scores of 0−10 who received rehabilitation on holidays had higher ADL scores at discharge. In contrast, those admitted with higher Barthel Index scores did not show significant improvement in ADL scores after additional holiday rehabilitation by the time they were discharged.

""The results of this study provide large-scale data supporting the practice of prioritizing interventions for elderly patients and those with difficulty performing activities independently, which had previously been based on empirical experience,"" stated Bito.

We believe the research findings will provide useful information for prescribing effective rehabilitation with limited human resources.""

Evidence review finds no clear advantage","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260217/Does-intermittent-fasting-help-you-lose-more-weight-Evidence-review-finds-no-clear-advantage.aspx","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:33:00 GMT","

A major Cochrane review challenges popular claims about intermittent fasting, suggesting it may help with weight loss but offers no meaningful advantage over conventional calorie restriction.

Review: Intermittent fasting for adults with overweight or obesity. Image Credit: Tetiana Chernykova / Shutterstock

In a recent systematic review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, researchers synthesized data from 22 randomized controlled trials involving 1,995 participants to evaluate the efficacy of intermittent fasting (IF) for adults with overweight or obesity. The review compared various fasting regimens against regular dietary advice, such as continuous calorie restriction, and no intervention.

Review findings suggest that, contrary to popular belief, IF results in little to no difference in weight loss compared to traditional dieting methodologies, based largely on low- to very-low-certainty evidence with potential risk of bias. While the evidence regarding IF's impact on participants' quality of life (QoL) and adverse side effects remains uncertain, the review concludes that IF is a potentially viable but not superior weight-loss strategy based on generally low-certainty evidence. Any statistically observed differences were generally considered unlikely to translate into clinically meaningful advantages.

Obesity is frequently highlighted as one of the most severe behaviorally modifiable public health challenges and is predicted to substantially worsen in the coming years. Clinically defined as a body mass index (BMI) exceeding 30 kg/m2, obesity has traditionally been treated with continuous energy restriction, a reduction in daily caloric intake.

A growing body of research highlights that adherence to energy restriction regimens is difficult, often leading to a ""yo-yo"" effect in which weight that may be temporarily lost is subsequently regained. These challenges have contributed to the popularity of several fasting programs, many of which are marketed as metabolic ""biohacks"" that purportedly promote and sustain weight loss.

Intermittent fasting (IF) is one of the most popular approaches, characterized by alternating periods of normal caloric intake with extended periods of little to no food consumption. Proponents posit that fasting triggers physiological benefits beyond simple calorie reduction, such as improved insulin sensitivity and increased fat metabolism. However, these claims remain incompletely substantiated in human clinical evidence, and current data are insufficient to confirm clinically meaningful metabolic advantages beyond calorie restriction alone.

The present systematic Cochrane review evaluated the potential benefits and drawbacks of IF regimens. Data were collated from several major scientific publication repositories, including CENTRAL and MEDLINE (Ovid), and comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating IF in adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight or obese.

The combination of a custom search strategy and screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts yielded 22 RCTs comprising 1,995 participants. Analyses investigated three primary comparisons.

IF versus regular dietary advice (RDA): This comparison evaluated IF protocols, such as time-restricted feeding or alternate-day fasting, against conventional continuous energy restriction or dietary counseling.

IF versus no intervention: This comparison evaluated patients on IF regimens against those on waiting lists or receiving no treatment despite being overweight or obese.

Impacts of IF on safety and participant experience: Included publications were analyzed for adverse events and QoL outcomes.

The primary outcome was the percentage change in body weight from baseline. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of participants achieving at least 5% weight reduction, a validated clinical benchmark for health improvement, planned metabolic outcomes such as lipid profiles, and participant-reported QoL changes. Several planned outcomes, including participant satisfaction and diabetes status, were not reported in the included trials. Evidence certainty was generally low for comparisons involving dietary advice and moderate for some comparisons without intervention.

When comparing IF to RDA, analysis of 21 studies involving 1,430 participants showed a mean difference (MD) in weight loss of -0.33% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.92 to 0.26), indicating similar weight loss across intervention approaches. Evidence certainty was rated low.

The clinical benchmark of achieving at least 5% body weight reduction yielded a risk ratio (RR) of 0.98 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.18), suggesting that IF did not increase the likelihood of clinically significant weight loss compared with conventional RDA approaches. Confidence in this estimate was rated very low.

When comparing IF to no intervention, fasting participants showed greater weight reduction, with MD = -3.42% (95% CI -4.95 to -1.90). Although evidence certainty for this comparison was moderate, the authors interpreted the difference as unlikely to be clearly clinically meaningful, and long-term sustainability remains uncertain. Most studies assessed outcomes over 6 to 12 months, limiting conclusions regarding long-term effects.

QoL data were sparse, reported in only three included trials, and suggested that IF did not significantly improve mental or physical QoL compared with standard diets.

Some studies reported adverse events, including headaches, nausea, and fatigue. However, findings were inconsistent and imprecise, preventing firm conclusions about whether IF carries higher risks than standard dieting. Overall evidence certainty for safety outcomes was low or very low.

This review establishes IF as an alternative dietary approach that appears broadly comparable to, but not superior to, traditional calorie-restriction methods or standard diets. Healthcare providers and the general public may consider IF based on personal preference, practicality, and sustainability rather than expectations of superior weight-loss outcomes. Interpretation should remain cautious given the limited trial duration, methodological variability, and overall low certainty of evidence. Longer-term, higher-quality trials are needed before firm clinical recommendations can be made.

From eco-score apps to immersive virtual supermarkets, researchers explore whether technology can nudge people toward healthier and more sustainable eating habits, and why stronger, longer-term evidence is still urgently needed.

Study: Digital Tools for the Promotion of Healthy and Sustainable Eating Behaviors in the General Population: A Systematic Review of the Literature. Image credit: KucherAV/Shutterstock.com

A recent systematic review published in Nutrients examined whether digital technologies effectively promote healthier and more sustainable eating habits in the general population. The review followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and synthesized evidence from 16 empirical studies.

A proper food system is not only critical for public health but also for environmental sustainability. Diets high in animal-based and ultra-processed foods increase the risk of chronic illness and contribute to environmental problems, including higher greenhouse gas emissions and resource use.

The One Health approach emphasizes that human, animal, and ecosystem health are closely connected, making it essential for sustainable food systems. This framework highlights how dietary choices affect public health, the environment, and animal welfare. Shifting towards plant-based and flexitarian diets can significantly improve health outcomes, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce harm to animals.

Promoting sustainable eating habits can improve both environmental outcomes and personal health, but it requires a holistic perspective. Not all sustainability-focused diets are healthy, especially if they are overly restrictive or unbalanced. Guidelines emphasize that healthy, sustainable diets should provide adequate nutrition, minimize environmental impact, and support overall well-being. The authors also highlight a bidirectional relationship between diet and mental health, noting that poor diet quality can worsen psychological outcomes, while certain mental health conditions may contribute to dysfunctional and environmentally harmful eating behaviors.

Adopting healthy, sustainable eating habits can be challenging due to cognitive, social, and cultural barriers. These include emotional attachment to traditional diets, lack of environmental concern, and practical issues such as limited availability or convenience of sustainable food choices.

To date, the impact of digital technologies on sustainable and healthy eating habits has not been thoroughly studied. This systematic narrative review evaluates digital technologies for promoting healthy and sustainable dietary behaviors, with emphasis on categorizing psychological factors and behavioral strategies within digital interventions. Researchers obtained relevant literature from PsycInfo, PsycArticles, PubMed, and ProQuest.

The current review included 16 studies, of which 56 % were randomized controlled trials, and 50 % were non-controlled designs. Only 31 % included follow-up assessments that typically lasted 1–4 weeks, and no study included long-term follow-up beyond 3 months. The sample sizes in the research varied significantly, with mobile app–based studies more often including larger samples and follow-up assessments compared to many virtual reality studies. Interestingly, most participants were healthy, non-vegetarian adults, and 31 % were university students. Approximately 94 % of the studied articles comprised mixed-gender samples; a few included unspecified genders or focused only on women.

According to the methodologies used, around 69 % of studies employed ad hoc questionnaires or interviews to assess outcomes, with only one referencing the original Theory of Planned Behavior Questionnaire. Furthermore, some studies used additional tools, such as food diaries or semi-structured interviews, and 29 % used standardized psychometric scales. Several mobile app studies relied partly on qualitative or descriptive data, limiting the strength of statistical inferences.

It should be noted that research quality varied: 44 % of studies were rated strong, 25 % moderate, and 31 % weak. Weaknesses mainly resulted from short or absent follow-up, small sample sizes, and risk of bias. More than 50 % of research failed to control for confounding variables. The authors also note that, in several cases, psychological and behavioral strategies had to be inferred by the reviewers rather than explicitly stated by study authors, introducing potential subjectivity into the categorization process.

The literature synthesis was challenged by inconsistent terminology for “sustainable diets” and a tendency for studies to focus on isolated aspects, such as meat reduction and waste minimization, rather than the multidimensional nature of sustainable eating.

The current study included 16 studies that targeted interventions supporting both individual health and environmental sustainability. Broad inclusion criteria reflected the field's novelty, leading to heterogeneity in study designs, sample sizes, and settings and precluding meta-analysis. Despite this, evidence indicates that digital tools employing diverse psychological and behavioral strategies can produce promising short-term improvements in dietary practices, though effect sizes varied and were inconsistently reported across studies.

Technology offered innovative ways to help people adopt healthier and more sustainable eating habits. Tools such as smartphone apps, web platforms, and VR can encourage positive change by making information more accessible and engaging. Many technologies use psychological techniques such as gamification and nudging to support conscious, sustainable choices. Research areas such as Design for Sustainable Behavior and theories, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, also guide the development of effective digital interventions.

Smartphone apps and VR platforms were most frequently employed and were associated with short-term positive effects, particularly in reducing red and processed meat intake, increasing plant-based food choices, and enhancing food-related awareness and decision-making. However, the magnitude and durability of these effects remain uncertain due to short follow-up periods and methodological variability.

Self-monitoring features, present mainly in smartphone apps and messaging interventions, enabled tracking dietary behavior and progress toward personal goals, often within systems that provided reminders and feedback. VR and web platforms often target self-efficacy and response efficacy, enhancing users' confidence in making sustainable choices through immersive feedback and real-time visualization of health or environmental impacts.

The review also systematically categorized psychological factors and behavioral strategies used in digital interventions. Awareness was the most frequently targeted construct, often operationalized through educational content, gamification, or interactive experiences to enhance knowledge of sustainable practices and environmental impact.

Digital tools helped people make decisions through features such as eco-scores, feedback, and motivational messages. Techniques to influence emotions, such as making users feel pride or regret, were used less often but can also encourage sustainable choices. Digital technologies and interactive platforms are also valuable in clinical psychology, where they support the treatment and prevention of eating disorders and help manage these conditions, although the present review focused specifically on interventions in the general population rather than clinical samples.

The current review highlighted that digital tools, such as smartphone apps and VR, can help people make more sustainable food choices, especially when they include feedback, engaging content, and step-by-step guidance. However, the authors emphasize that most evidence reflects short-term behavioral shifts rather than sustained change. Adding design elements that encourage sustainable behavior may improve results, but more research is needed to determine whether these changes persist over time.

The authors further note that digital interventions often rely on individual-level prompts and nudges, raising questions about their long-term transformative impact compared to broader systemic or community-based approaches.

Overall, while digital technologies show potential as scalable tools to promote healthier and more sustainable diets, the evidence base remains methodologically heterogeneous and relatively immature, underscoring the need for more rigorous, longitudinal, theory-driven, and better standardized research to clarify long-term effectiveness and comparative impact across technologies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals poxvirus's unique DNA clamp for gene activation","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260218/Study-reveals-poxviruss-unique-DNA-clamp-for-gene-activation.aspx","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 11:03:00 GMT","

A research team at the University of Würzburg has deciphered another aspect of poxviral gene activation. The study reveals a unique viral mechanism: a molecular ring anchors the viral copying machine to the DNA.

Compared to other organisms, viruses have very small genomes. Their genetic material is not sufficient to maintain their own metabolism, produce proteins or reproduce independently. Therefore, they hijack the biological processes of their host cell.

A central step in viral replication is transcription - the precise 'overwriting' of viral genes in messenger RNA (mRNA). While most DNA viruses smuggle their genetic information into the cell nucleus - the logistical control centre of the host cell - in order to use the machinery there, poxviruses pursue a different strategy.

They remain in the cytoplasm and act there independently of the cell nucleus. To do this, they bring their own highly specialized mini-factories, including a viral transcription apparatus. This autonomy requires its own control tools to activate the viral genes at the right time.

A study by the University of Würzburg, now published in the journal Nature Communications, shows for the first time the mechanical elegance with which the viral protein VITF-3 controls this process. Vaccinia viruses, the most widely studied model viruses from the poxvirus family, were examined at the molecular level by a research group led by Utz Fischer, holder of the Chair of Biochemistry 1. Stefan Jungwirth, Clemens Grimm and Julia Bartuli carried out the central work in the laboratory.

In the study, the team was able to show that VITF-3 acts as a molecular clamp. This factor consists of two building blocks that together form a closed ring structure. What is special about it is that: ""VITF-3 alone is completely unreactive towards DNA. The ring is so stably closed that it cannot attach itself to the genetic material,"" explains Utz Fischer.

Only with the help of a second player can viral transcription begin. Viral RNA polymerase (vRNAP) - the virus's actual copying tool - plays a central role in this process. ""Contact with the polymerase opens the VITF-3 ring and places it precisely around the DNA like a cuff,"" explains Stefan Jungwirth, who conducted extensive experiments with the viral complexes for the project.

Closing the clamp anchors the entire machinery at the starting point. This intervention breaks the DNA double helix, creating a kink of about 90 degrees in the genetic material, and the DNA is literally forced into the throat of the copying machine (cleft). The sharp kink is crucial: it exposes the DNA strands so that the polymerase can begin copying.

With the help of cryo-electron microscopy, the team has succeeded in solving this molecular puzzle. ""With this technique, the protein complexes are flash-frozen at minus 196 degrees Celsius to stop them in their natural motion. An electron beam and magnetic lenses then provide us with a greatly magnified image,"" explains Clemens Grimm, who was responsible for elucidating the structure.

The team analysed around nine million individual molecules in this way. Using the data set obtained in this way, it was able to reconstruct a model with a resolution of 2.4 Ångström. To put this into perspective, one Ångström is about the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom or, in other words, one ten-millionth of a millimetre. At this scale, the researchers were able to identify the molecular details of the viral motor and every turn of the DNA helix.

The structural analysis of VITF-3 revealed an architecture that is completely atypical for this protein family, as the related proteins in humans or yeast do not interact with each other on their own. In contrast, the ring observed in vaccinia is already locked in place in its free state.

The atomic structural analysis also revealed the role of the so-called capping enzyme. It is stably integrated into the complex and ensures that the newly formed viral mRNA is immediately provided with a kind of protective cap. Thus camouflaged, the host cell does not recognise the foreign code as a threat and begins to produce viral proteins.

The electron microscope data also show that direct physical contact with VITF-3 also positions the polymerase on the DNA. This interaction enables the machinery to recognise the specific start signal of viral genes on the DNA with extreme accuracy. Smallpox viruses thus prove to be highly efficient specialists that achieve maximum results with a minimum number of factors.

The study also suggests a fascinating dynamic at the end of the process: as soon as the newly formed mRNA reaches a length of about twelve nucleotides, it physically collides with an extension of VITF-3. This collision may cause the polymerase to detach from the clamp and allow the mRNA production phase to begin.

Deciphering this unusual mechanism not only provides fundamental insights into the evolution of gene control, but also opens up new avenues for antiviral therapies. Since it is specific to the Poxviridae family - which includes not only the vaccinia virus but also the mpox virus and variola viruses, the pathogens that cause deadly smallpox - it offers a target for new drugs. Future drugs could, for example, prevent the VITF-3 ring from closing, thereby nipping viral replication in the bud.

Furthermore, the study highlights the impressive adaptability of viruses, which have developed highly efficient tools over the course of evolution to repurpose the complex processes of life for their own replication.

Researchers at Kumamoto University have discovered that behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic-particularly widespread mask-wearing-may have reduced the risk of certain types of heart attacks triggered by air pollution.

The study, led by Dr. Masanobu Ishii and colleagues, was published in the European Society of Cardiology's flagship journal, European Heart Journal.

Fine particulate matter known as PM2.5-tiny airborne particles small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs-has long been recognized as a major environmental risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Exposure can trigger inflammation, oxidative stress, and blood vessel dysfunction, potentially leading to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack.

Using Japan's nationwide cardiovascular database (JROAD-DPC), the research team analyzed data from 270,091 patients hospitalized for AMI between 2012 and 2022. They examined short-term exposure to PM2.5 and compared risks before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought dramatic shifts in public behavior, including mask use and reduced mobility.

The researchers found that short-term exposure to PM2.5 significantly increased the risk of all types of AMI. However, one subtype-MINOCA (myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries), a heart attack without coronary artery obstruction-showed a particularly strong association with air pollution.

Most notably, after the onset of the pandemic, the PM2.5-related risk of MINOCA significantly declined. In contrast, the risk of the more typical heart attack with coronary artery obstruction (MI-CAD) remained largely unchanged.

The findings suggest that pandemic-related preventive behaviors-especially mask-wearing-may have reduced individual exposure to harmful particulate matter, thereby lowering the risk of pollution-triggered vascular dysfunction such as coronary spasm or microvascular impairment.

This study provides real-world evidence that simple protective measures can mitigate cardiovascular risks associated with unavoidable environmental exposures. Even in Japan, where no strict lockdowns were imposed, voluntary public health practices appear to have delivered measurable cardiovascular benefits.

The researchers emphasize that improving air quality remains a long-term priority. However, the findings also highlight the potential of accessible interventions-such as mask use during high-pollution periods-to protect vulnerable populations.

As societies confront ongoing environmental challenges, these insights may help shape future preventive cardiology and public health strategies worldwide.

Military service members and veterans frequently experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is linked to a range of psychological challenges and adverse effects.

Cognitive-behavioral therapies like cognitive processing therapy (CPT) are the main treatments for PTSD and are most effective when given daily. However, many patients continue to have PTSD symptoms after treatment, highlighting the need for more research to improve its effectiveness.

In previous studies, stellate ganglion block (SGB), a long-acting anesthetic injection into the cervical spine thought to ""reset"" sympathetic arousal, has shown promise as an additional treatment by reducing PTSD symptoms.

In a first-ever randomized clinical trial, researchers at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and College of Medicine evaluated the efficacy of SGB when delivered in combination with front-line PTSD psychotherapy treatment.

Our research shows SGB enhances CPT effectiveness when administered beforehand. Military personnel and veterans not helped by initial daily CPT experienced significant PTSD symptom reduction when SGB is given after CPT. In addition, we found that SGB before CPT may offer a faster treatment response for some patients.""

Jaryd Hiser, PhD, senior study author, psychologist at Ohio State's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health

Study findings are published in the journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics.

The study involved 86 military personnel and veterans with PTSD, who were given SGB either before or after daily CPT. PTSD symptoms were measured using the PCL-5, a standardized tool for assessing post-traumatic stress after a traumatic event.

Hiser noted that the intervention produced quick and effective results. Over an average period of just two weeks, participants' PCL scores fell from 50 to 20-more than double the standard improvement-and this positive effect lasted for at least one year after treatment.

PTSD is the most common mental health issue among military personnel and veterans, affecting up to 23% of this population. PTSD often results from combat trauma, but can also result from non-combat trauma, such as sexual assault, domestic violence or childhood abuse.

PTSD causes psychological issues like intrusive thoughts, avoidance, mood and cognitive shifts, and increased arousal, which can lead to problems such as work or relationship dissatisfaction, aggression, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts. These challenges hinder deployment readiness and diminish the overall quality of life for military personnel.

Though the sample included veterans and service members, many participants had non-combat trauma. The results suggest this therapy could also benefit civilians with difficult trauma cases. While veterans were the main focus, these treatments could help others as well, Hiser said.

""The combination of SGB before daily CPT may be of particular interest to the Department of Defense for treating military personnel with PTSD,"" Hiser said. ""Such an approach could maximize treatment response in a brief period of time and return military personnel to mission readiness sooner. This approach could also enhance clinical efficiency by reducing symptoms quickly, which is important because specialized PTSD care is not always available, especially in rural areas.""

Researchers from RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences have developed a novel implant that delivers tiny growth-promoting particles directly to injured nerve cells, helping them to regrow after spinal cord injury.

The study, published in the journal Bioactive Materials, shows how a 3D implant designed to mimic the structure and stiffness of the spinal cord can be combined with tiny particles engineered to carry RNA to encourage nerve cells (neurons) to grow. The work was led by researchers at RCSI's Tissue Engineering Research Group (TERG) and the Research Ireland Centre for Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research (AMBER).

Spinal cord injuries often result in permanent paralysis because damaged neurons in the central nervous system have a very limited capacity to regrow. While biomaterial implants can provide physical support at the injury site, these cells also face molecular barriers that prevent their regrowth.

To overcome this, the team developed a multifunctional implant that not only supports regenerating tissue but also delivers RNA-based signals that encourage neurons to switch their growth mechanisms back on.

These signals target one such barrier, a gene called PTEN, which is known to suppress neuron regrowth after injury. By silencing PTEN at the injury site, the implant helps remove an internal barrier to repair in these cells.

We've created an environment that both physically and biologically re-enhances the regenerative capacity of injured neurons, which is a key requirement for restoring function after spinal cord injury. In laboratory models of spinal cord injury, neurons exposed to the RNA-activated implant showed significantly enhanced growth.""

Fergal O'Brien, Deputy Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, Professor of Bioengineering and Regenerative Medicine and Head of RCSI TERG

The research was developed with guidance from an advisory panel supported by the Irish Rugby Football Union Charitable Trust (IRFU-CT), bringing together people living with spinal cord injury, clinicians, neuroscientists and engineers to shape research priorities and ensure relevance to patients' real-world needs.

""While this study focused on laboratory models, the next steps will to be to test the approach in vivo and explore how RNA-activated biomaterials could help bridge damaged spinal cord tissue and restore lost connections,"" said Dr Tara McGuire who carried out the research as a PhD student in TERG.

The study was supported by the IRFU-CT and Research Ireland with additional funding from the Anatomical Society and the Health Research Board.

A new editorial was published in Volume 18 of Aging-US on February 8, 2026, titled ""Polyploidy-induced senescence: Linking development, differentiation, repair, and (possibly) cancer?""

In this editorial, Iman M. Al-Naggar of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, UConn Health, and the University of Connecticut Center on Aging, with George A. Kuchel of the University of Connecticut Center on Aging, examines the biological and clinical significance of polyploidy-induced senescence. The authors discuss how this process may contribute to normal tissue development and long-term repair, while also influencing cancer risk. Their perspective centers on the bladder and outlines how aging-related cellular changes may shape tumor initiation.

Aging remains the strongest risk factor for bladder cancer, which is predominantly of urothelial origin. Cellular senescence is defined as a stable growth arrest in which cells remain metabolically active but no longer divide. Polyploidy refers to cells that contain extra copies of their genome. Although polyploidy is frequently associated with cancer, it also occurs in several healthy tissues as part of normal development and adaptation to stress. The editorial highlights increasing evidence that polyploidy and senescence can function together as a coordinated biological program.

The authors focus on bladder umbrella cells, which form the barrier between urine and the bloodstream. In mice, these cells naturally become polyploid early in life and display markers of senescence across the lifespan. Rather than representing dysfunction, this state may help maintain tissue architecture, reinforce barrier integrity, and support resistance to environmental stress. In this context, polyploidy-induced senescence may act as a differentiation program that preserves organ structure.

""Polyploidization and senescence may be interrelated stress responses, yet they have been studied mostly in isolation.""

However, this protective mechanism may become unstable. Polyploidy-induced senescence depends on intact tumor suppressor pathways, including regulators such as p16. If these safeguards are lost through mutation, deletion, or epigenetic silencing, polyploid senescent cells may escape growth arrest. Re-entry into the cell cycle under these conditions may promote chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, increasing the likelihood of malignant transformation. The authors propose that a subset of bladder cancers may arise from polyploid umbrella cells that have bypassed this senescent barrier.

The editorial also discusses implications for cancer therapy. Many anticancer treatments induce senescence and polyploidization in tumor cells. Although this approach can initially suppress proliferation, some polyploid cancer cells may later adapt, reduce their ploidy, and resume division, contributing to relapse and treatment resistance. Understanding how polyploidy and senescence interact may therefore inform therapeutic strategies.

Overall, the authors emphasize the need to study polyploidy and senescence together rather than in isolation. Integrating ploidy assessment into large-scale mapping efforts of senescent cells may improve insight into aging biology, tumor initiation, and resistance to therapy.

In a new study published in Nature Communications, a research team at the University of Oslo have examined how cancer cells develop in the bone marrow and whether it might be possible to stop them. The study finds a way to stop malignant stem cells. The researchers believe their findings could open up new avenues for treatment in the future.

Our study provides new insights into acute myeloid leukemia. We believe the findings can be used to develop new treatments for the disease in the future."" 

Lorena Arranz, Associate Professor, University of Oslo

She is also Leader of the group Stem Cells, Ageing and Cancer, and Deputy Director at the Centre for Embryology and Healthy Development, CRESCO. Together with her team, she aims to find better ways to detect and treat leukemia.

In the study, the researchers focused on blood stem cells in the bone marrow. Stem cells can either lie dormant or divide actively and become new blood cells. In healthy individuals, they develop into red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. In people with acute blood cancer, by contrast, stem cells develop into cancer cells rather than healthy blood cells.Arranz and her team believe it may be possible to prevent this from happening. How stem cells develop depends on signals from their surrounding environment.""We have identified signals that influence the development of this type of leukemia and that we can exploit to fight the cancer,"" she says.The signals the researchers identified help maintain a healthy balance by telling the stem cell whether to remain dormant or become a new cell. The researchers have found that these signals involve the molecules succinate and succinate receptor SUCNR1. Their levels influence whether the stem cells press the accelerator or apply the brake. SUCNR1 activation keeps stem cells in a healthy state by controlling the alarmins, S100A8 and S100A9.In the study, the researchers examined data from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. They also conducted experiments in mouse models of this type of blood cancer, using advanced methods such as stem cell analyses, RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry.

In patients, they studied the levels of expression of SUCNR1. The study demonstrates that low levels of SUCNR1 in patients are associated with poorer survival. The researchers also observed that the levels of these molecules and the associated signaling through S100A8 and S100A9 influenced how the disease progressed in mouse models. Arranz and her team showed that they could influence the development of leukemia in mice by altering the levels of succinate, SUCNR1 and S100A9.

Arranz is optimistic about the way ahead. ""Succinate has typically been seen as a 'bad guy' that drives the progression and worsening of this form of blood cancer. We have now discovered a new, protective side to succinate, acting on SUCNR1. The next step will be to explore how we can harness this in treatment,"" she says. Researcher and first author Vincent Cuminetti also sees potential for future new treatments for blood cancer. ""We believe the study can help develop better, future, personalised treatments for patients based on SUCNR1 levels,"" says Cuminetti.

by

While the senior U.S. women's national team trains and competes in the 2026 SheBelieves Cup, 24 players from across the National Women's Soccer League, USL Super League and collegiate level will convene for the first U-23 women's national team camp of 2026.

The camp will run from Feb. 27 to March 7, in South Florida. It will conclude with two matches against the Mexico U-23 women's national team, scheduled for March 3 at 12 p.m. (Noon) ET and March 6 at 2 p.m. ET, both at the FIU Soccer Stadium in Miami. The matches are open and free to the public.

In 2025, 14 players who appeared for the U-23s eventually earned full USWNT call-ups. This age group's first camp of 2026 continues senior team head coach Emma Hayes' focus on this age group as a vital part of the continued growth and depth of the senior side.

U-23 head coach Heather Dyche will lead a roster featuring 19 NWSL players, two USL Super League players and three college players. Of the 19 NWSL players, 10 are entering their rookie seasons in the league. Portland Thorns FC has the most players on the roster of any club with four, while expansion team Denver Summit and Gotham FC have three players each.

The one player in training camp with full U.S. women's national team experience is Denver Summit defender Ayo Oke. She earned her first cap on Jan. 27, playing 90 minutes in the 5-0 win over Chile in Santa Barbara.

The two USL Super League players called up are Lexi Missimo from Dallas Trinity FC, and goalkeeper Liz Beardsley, who was loaned by the Houston Dash to the Tampa Bay Sun in late January. Defenders Sydney Cheesman (Louisiana State) and Sierra Sythe (Wake Forest), and attacker Hope Leyba (Colorado) are the three call-ups still in college.

The full U.S. U-23 women's national team roster by position (Club/College; Hometown) is:

Goalkeepers (2): Liz Beardsley (Tampa Bay Sun FC; Lakeland, Fla.), Neeku Purcell (Seattle Reign FC;Seattle, Wash.)

Defenders (8): Macy Blackburn (Racing Louisville FC; Fort Worth, Texas), Carolyn Calzada (Portland Thorns FC; Sugar Hill, Ga.), Sydney Cheesman (Louisiana State; Lafayette, Colo.), Leah Klenke (Houston Dash; Houston, Texas), Ayo Oke (Denver Summit FC; Lawrenceville, Ga.), Jayden Perry (Portland Thorns FC; Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.), Evelyn Shores (Angel City FC; Atlanta, Ga.), Sierra Sythe (Wake Forest; Long Beach, Calif.)

Midfielders (7): Sofia Cook (Gotham FC; Huntington Beach, Calif.), Shae Harvey (Portland Thorns FC; Hermosa Beach, Calif.), Ally Lemos (Orlando Pride; Glendora, Calif.), Yuna McCormack (Denver Summit FC; Mill Valley, Calif.), Lexi Missimo (Dallas Trinity FC; Southlake, Texas), Sarah Schupansky (Gotham FC; Pittsburgh, Pa.), Taylor Suarez (Angel City FC; Charlote, N.C.)

Forwards (7): Jasmine Aikey (Denver Summit FC; Palo Alto, Calif.), Andrea Kitahata (Gotham FC;Hillsborough, Calif.), Karlie Lema (Bay FC; Morgan Hill, Calif.), Hope Leyba (Colorado; Phoenix, Ariz.), Kat Rader (Houston Dash; Stuart, Fla.), Pietra Tordin (Portland Thorns FC; Miami, Fla.), Sarah Weber (Racing Louisville FC; Gretna, Neb.)

Seattle Reign FC goalkeeper Neeku Purcell has been named to the United States Under-23 National Team roster for the first training camp of 2026. Camp is set to take place in South Florida and includes 24 players – 19 NWSL players, two USL Super League Players and three college players. 

The training camp will culminate with two matches against the Mexico U-23 National Team, on March 3 and March 6. The matches, which will be played at the FIU Soccer Stadium in Miami, are free and open to the public. 

Purcell, a product of Seattle Reign Academy, has tirelessly built a strong foundation for success at the youth and collegiate level. Following her time in the Reign's Academy, she made 27 appearances for UCLA and conceded just 13 goals, while making 33 saves.  

The 22-year-old made her professional debut with Brooklyn FC in the Gainbridge Super League before she first signed with the Reign as a short-term replacement player in June 2025, and earned a full contract ahead of the 2026 season. 

Though the Seattle native has not made her NWSL debut just yet, she's made a strong impression on all of those at the Reign – and on the international stage. In November, she was one of two goalkeepers called into the U.S. U-23 Women's National Team training camp in Europe, alongside Reign FC teammates Emeri Adames and Maddie Dahlien, who are spending this international window with the U-20 squad and senior USWNT squad, respectively. 

The U.S. U-23 team had a highly successful year in 2025, as 14 players who saw minutes with U-23s eventually earned their full USWNT call-ups. Purcell, a player who provides consistency and resilience on the pitch, is one of eight players on the U-23 roster that has represented the USA in the FIFA Women's World Cup at the youth level. 

As evident by her performance in preseason training and her call-up to the U-23 squad, Purcell is continuing down a path of long-term development that will fuel not only her career, but the overall success of the Reign. She continues to progress in Seattle's first-team environment, she remains a key part of the Reign's solid goalkeeping union.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Why Trinity Rodman didn't accept European clubs and stayed in the U.S","https://www.hola.com/us/celebrities/20260218884657/why-trinity-rodman-stayed-in-united-states/","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:43:03 GMT","

Women in Sports

Trinity Rodman has stepped into 2026 with clarity, confidence, and a contract that reset the market. After weeks of uncertainty, her National Women's Soccer League future is secure with the Washington Spirit, thanks to a reported three-year deal worth $2 million annually — the highest salary in global women's soccer.

Her body is cooperating, too. A sprained knee has healed. Chronic back issues have eased. And in her long-awaited return to the United States women's national soccer team, she didn't just blend in. She wore the captain's armband. She scored. Then she scored again.

Now, with coach Emma Hayes calling her back in for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup, Rodman is positioned as a central figure in the early build toward the 2027 World Cup. “I'm just motivated to be on the field as much as I can,” Rodman said after Spirit training in suburban D.C. “I've felt really good in national team camp [last month], and then coming into preseason [getting] a lot of minutes” in two friendlies.

Rodman had options. European clubs were watching. The idea of testing herself abroad was real. “I definitely go through phases of like, ‘OK, I'm good. I can do something different, try something new,'” she said.

But stability mattered. “There's also times where I'm like, ‘OK, I'm not ready to do something or I need to be in a stable situation, comfortable in the U.S.'” The internal tug-of-war was ongoing.

“I go back and forth: ‘Oh, should I have done this, should I have gone overseas or whatever?' But through it all, it's just trusting myself, because I've been open to everything, and I've teetered back and forth where I've been so close to being like, ‘OK, I'm going,' and I'm like, ‘Wait, no, I'm not ready.'”

Ultimately, unfinished business in Washington won out. “There's still more to do, and if I do make a big jump or a big decision like that, I want to feel like I've fully fulfilled what I want to do in D.C. before I'm bouncing around everywhere, if that makes sense.”

It makes perfect sense for a player who won an NWSL title as a rookie in 2021, then landed on the losing side of the last two finals. “We have redeeming to do,” she said.

Spirit coach Adrián González called her “super excited” in camp and emphasized how critical her return is not just for the club, but for the league's growth. “For the fans, for the team, for the league, for the people that love soccer in this country, it's really positive having players like her,” González said.

The 23-year-old forward is no longer just a rising star. Through her performance, personality, and marketing power, she has become the face of U.S. soccer talent based in the U.S.

Last season was fragmented. Injuries limited her to 15 regular-season matches, two playoff appearances as a substitute, and one U.S. friendly. Contract uncertainty hovered in the background. This year, she wants clean lines.

“With contract matters behind her, Rodman aims to have a year without interruption or distraction.” That means consistent minutes, chemistry with new teammates, and building toward Washington's March 13 opener against the Portland Thorns at Audi Field.

“We still have a lot to show and a lot more to our game as a team as a whole,” she said. “Having a lot of new faces this year and more internationals, there's still a lot of connections to be built in certain units on the field, so I'm excited to see those grow.”

There will be one noticeable absence. Close friend and U.S. teammate Croix Bethune was traded to the Kansas City Current after requesting a move. “I was really bummed about Croix. I can't lie,” Rodman said. “We're very close friends, so I was just really sad about that, in general. She has to do what's best for her.” Then, with a grin, “Unfortunately, Kansas City. I think she's going to thrive. She'll thrive at any club.”

Off the field, Rodman found a rare scheduling sweet spot. Because Spirit camp timing aligned, she was able to attend boyfriend Ben Shelton's tournament in Greater Dallas, where he pushed toward his fourth tour title. “Him being able to win that conveniently on my off days was amazing,” she said with a smile. “So I'm really happy.”

Shelton even acknowledged the pattern: “This is the second tournament that my girlfriend has shown up on the semifinals day. I'm 2-0 in semis when she shows up for that.”

Rodman, ever practical, described their balance clearly. “We do really good at being there for each other, but also trying to be realistic at times where it's like, ‘OK, that's a little much. That's going to exhaust us,'” she said. “Yeah, big moments I try to show up for. Thankfully, I was there for Dallas, but we go with the flow.”

Rodman enters her sixth professional season healthy, financially secure, and central to both club and country plans. The National Women's Soccer League needed to keep her. The Spirit needed to keep her. And she chose to stay.

Now the focus narrows: SheBelieves Cup, NWSL redemption, and laying bricks toward 2027. Trinity Rodman is building, and right now, everything is aligned.

Competition will be fierce with a strong roster going into the Cup

Emma Hayes has called in her roster for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup and it gives a glimpse into the state of the USWNT heading into a year that will conclude with World Cup qualification. She called in a strong, experienced roster with no uncapped players and some key positions that can be solidified with good performances in the tournament. The players who are and are not included say a lot about those players and about how the team is shaping up this year.

Some of the players who are not in the picture have been in recent callups or might have been expected to get a look for the Cup have some work to do in order to make future rosters.

Croix Bethune - After making the roster for the Olympics the midfielder got two caps in 2025 and made the field in both of the USWNT matches in January. Bethune has some work to do if she wants to fit into the aggressive style Hayes needs in the midfield and for now will be sitting on the bubble when it comes to making the national team unless she steps up in the NWSL this year.

Sophia Wilson - The striker isn't ready yet but that can change. Wilson is aiming for an NWSL opening day return but won't get a chance to train with the USWNT for the SheBelieves Cup. The striker depth is decent but with her skill and fit in Hayes' system well established, she can still be in the picture for upcoming callups.

Korbin Sharder - The young midfielder is still out of the picture. With the European season in full swing and players representing clubs in France and the UK featuring on the roster, Sharder being left off the roster firmly puts her on the U-23 squad at this time. She has been inconsistent with the senior team and hasn't seen the field for the USA since April of 2025.

Some players are making a return after being absent from the team or did well enough in recent callups to earn a place on the team. Those spots are looking more solid but depth around the field will make claiming an ongoing role with the team a challenge.

Jameese Joseph - The midfielder will have a chance for her third cap following her first international goal against Chile in January. She obviously did enough to get another look and it seems like Hayes wants to get a clear picture of options for striker this year.

Claire Hutton - Hayes set high expectations for the midfielder in January and she has met them. The midfielder is here to stay. In general the midfield depth is a big strength of the team and the 20 year-old just made a huge move to Bay FC from the KC Current in a deal worth $1.1 million. It will be no surprise seeing her anchor the midfield throughout the Cup.

Phallon Tullis-Joyce - The goalkeeper is back in the picture and has played well for the national team. That said, she has work to do to start over Claudia Dickey who made six starts in 2025 and one this year.

U.S. Soccer is poised to present a fiscal 2027 budget projecting record revenue of $397M, driven largely by this summer's FIFA World Cup in North America. That represents a 30% increase over the updated revenue forecast for fiscal 2026, which runs through March 31, and a 50% jump from fiscal 2025. The proposed FY27 budget, set to be presented for approval at U.S. Soccer's Annual General Meeting on Saturday in Atlanta, incorporates significant one-time World Cup revenue and expenses. Although the document does not break out gross tournament figures, it projects a net $5M investment tied to ticketing, hospitality, marketing campaigns, sporting preparation and player payments. 

Notably, World Cup legacy funds from FIFA have not been factored into the budget. U.S. Soccer has not publicly indicated how much it expects to receive from FIFA and said it lacks clarity on the timing and potential use restrictions. Excluding one-time World Cup revenue, the federation projects core revenue growth of 6%–9%. 

Commercial activity represents the largest share of budgeted revenue at $269M, including $227M from sponsorship, licensing and fan engagement. U.S. Soccer has grown its partnership roster dramatically in the lead-up to the World Cup, with 23 brands currently on board. Fundraising is expected to contribute $77M. 

Sporting revenue, which includes projected World Cup prize money, is pegged at $21M. FIFA is distributing a record total of $655M to the 48 participating nations, with individual payments ranging from $9M to $50M depending on how far a team advances. The $21M sporting revenue projection suggests the federation is budgeting for the men's national team to advance beyond the group stage, though the figure does not correspond exactly to a specific FIFA prize tier. 

Beyond the World Cup, fiscal 2027 is also notable in that it will mark the opening of the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center in Fayetteville, Ga. The federation expects to spend $9.5M operating the facility in its first year while generating $1.3M from conferences, catering and operations. Sponsorship income associated with the training center is included in commercial revenue. 

Overall, U.S. Soccer projects a $6M operating surplus after investment in fiscal 2027, more than three times the forecasted surplus for fiscal 2026. After accounting for $11.8M in depreciation and amortization tied largely to the opening of the facility, however, the federation would post a consolidated deficit of roughly $6M.","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

There will be 111 days between the day the 2026 MLS season kicks off and the U.S. men's national team's World Cup opening match against Paraguay in Los Angeles, leaving many players scrambling for form and opportunity within that spell. 

While European talents have elevated their game in recent months, there will still be a significant number of American players on the squad who ply their trade in MLS when the World Cup comes around, making the start of the season a vital opportunity.

Here, Sports Illustrated takes a look at five USMNT players to keep an eye on in MLS, at least early this season. 

Columbus Crew fullback and midfielder Max Arfsten will adjust to a new tactical outlook under manager Henrik Rydström the first portions of the MLS regular season, with the intention of finding form before the March friendlies, where he is set to enter as a fringe player for the final World Cup roster.

He's been one of Pochettino's top MLS contributors and has had ample time under the Argentine manager since he earned a call into the 2025 January camp. The shift to a three-man backline with wingbacks also serves him well, and he could been seen as an invaluable national team player within months.

Yet, with any coaching change, there's risk with Arfsten that things take a different turn in Columbus under Ryström.

Sebastian Berhalter operated only in the shadow of Matt Freese among breakout players in 2025 who could represent the USMNT at the 2026 World Cup. 

Now close friends with German legend Thomas Müller, Berhalter enters this season as the heartbeat of Vancouver Whitecaps FC midfield, after racking up four goals and 11 assists in 29 regular-season games in 2025.

His presence, particularly his set-piece delivery with the USMNT, also stood out, with a goal and three assists in nine caps. Among those highlights is a perfectly curled set-piece finish against Uruguay in a friendly and pinpoint free-kick delivery for Chris Richards's winning goal in Gold Cup play against Saudi Arabia.

With Christian Pulisic's concerning bill of health at AC Milan, the USMNT needs someone who can deliver a potent set piece, and that looks to be Berhalter. The question throughout the start of the 2026 campaign will be whether he can maintain his composure and dominance in a physically demanding style of play.

All signs point to Matt Freese being the No. 1 goalkeeper for the USMNT at the World Cup this summer, and he will look to solidify that role with a strong start to the season with New York City FC.

At the same time, his performance will be measured alongside other American backstops, including the New England Revolution's Matt Turner and the Columbus Crew's Patrick Schulte, with it looking assured that the USMNT goalkeeping core will come out of the Eastern Conference.

Freese's ability as a pure shot-stopping backstop makes him stand out. Still, he will want to maintain his consistency from 2025 and continue developing his skills as a distributor out of the back, which is a key factor for a three-man backline on the international stage. 

It's been quite the rise for a goalkeeper who only made his USMNT debut at 26 last June and went on to start all but one match over the rest of 2025, leading into the World Cup year. 

With the shift to a back-three, Miles Robinson's versatility becomes more signfciant within the USMNT picture. A two-time MLS All-Star and now the highest-paid defender in MLS on a new contract, he will look to establish himself as a starter for the Stars and Stripes and to enjoy another strong season with FC Cincinnati.

The Eastern Conference won't be easy, and much of Cincinnati's focus remains on the central attacking pieces of Evander and Kévin Denkey. Still, Robinson's experience, skill and leadership at the back could be vital.

He missed out on the 2022 World Cup due to a torn Achilles' tendon a few months before kickoff, adding a little more motivation to stay in and stay healthy through the start of the MLS campaign.  

There is every indication that Cristian Roldan will play a key role for the USMNT at the World Cup, given his impressive showings in each of the six fall friendlies, notably with a pair of assists against Australia last October.

A veteran of the Seattle Sounders, Roldan's ability to be versatile makes him an attractive option to any team. Sometimes he can play an elusive attacking midfielder role, while at other times he fades into the rhythm of the game at the heartbeat of the pitch. His best use, however, might just be kickstarting transitions, as he has done with the Sounders and USMNT as a defensive midfielder at times. 

Having experience playing at the 2022 World Cup won't hurt either, even if he didn't get any minutes at that tournament.

Bundesliga

Noahkai Banks scored on his first Augsburg start, against Wolfsburg in October 2025 Adam Pretty/Getty Images

You would not think it to look at him: calm under pressure, fierce in the tackle and every inch the imposing modern centre-back, but Noahkai Banks felt anxious flying to New Jersey last September.

The teenager had been called into his first international camp with the USMNT, and suddenly — despite eye-catching Bundesliga appearances, praise from U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino and the confident demeanour that typifies him — he felt a flicker of self-doubt.

Advertisement

“I was pretty nervous when I got into camp, because I was 18 years old,” he said during a session with international media last week. “So I thought maybe the older guys would think, ‘Who's that? What is he doing here?'

“But it was great. It was incredible. Players like (Christian) Pulisic and (Tim) Weah helped me a lot.”

The nerves did not last long. Banks might not have made it onto the field in the subsequent friendlies against South Korea and Japan, but he left the camp with an extra spring in his step and a head brimming with information.

This included tips on positioning from former centre-back Pochettino, chats with veteran defender Tim Ream, and some great stories to tell the family WhatsApp group.

It was in that group that he found out about the opportunity — his mum Nadine had sent him a link to the manager's reaction to questions about her son prior to the camp.

Where some coaches may try to dampen down expectations, Pochettino took a different route. “I saw him playing in Germany and he's a massive talent,” the Argentine said. “You never know how he can explode — maybe at the end of the season he can be the best center-back in Europe or in Germany.”

Little wonder, then, that Banks' progress with Augsburg in the Bundesliga — Germany's top flight — has continued since. Now 19, he is becoming one of the league's standout young players.

His American father, Cedric, is a former U.S. army paratrooper and his German-born mother, Nadine, was once a promising college basketball player. It is therefore not surprising he is both fearless and athletic (standing 6ft 4in, 193cm tall).



His physical capabilities have meant that playing in a team battling to avoid being dragged into the relegation zone in his breakthrough season has not phased him.

He even marked his first start for Augsburg in October with a goal in the third minute of a 3-1 win over Wolfsburg.

Banks has not looked back since, starting the 16 subsequent league games bar one, when he was suspended against Bayern Munich, but he came straight back into the side thereafter.

“Because the goal was in my first start, it was great,” he says. “I was so chill after, but the emotions were crazy.

“I think it was one of the best moments of my life. My mom was sitting in the first row, and I saw her crying. That was very cool for my whole family.”

Banks' father is from Hawaii, where Noahkai was born before later moving to Germany with his mum when his parents separated. Despite interest from the German Football Association, he has so far chosen to follow the U.S. pathway onto the international stage.

He spent his childhood in the Bavarian town of Dietmannsried, and grew up wanting to emulate Bayern Munich and Germany World Cup winner Jerome Boateng. At the age of seven, he joined Augsburg's academy.

He already compares favourably in statistical terms with other center-backs in the German top flight this term.

He ranks highly for “true” tackles per 1,000 opposition touches — a metric that combines tackles won, tackles lost, and fouls committed while attempting a tackle — to give an indication of how often a player looks to put their foot in and challenge.



Combined with a high true interception rate, it paints the picture of an aggressive, front-footed defender who is proactive and does not shy away from a challenge.

He is an outlet for his team and has good vision on the ball. Banks has drawn plaudits for his passing accuracy and has the best long-pass completion rate of any Bundesliga center-back to have played 900+ minutes this season.

His calmness under pressure was evident during the 2-2 draw with Freiburg last month at Augsburg's WWK Arena. As the visitors pressed high, Banks showed for the ball in the six-yard box despite opponents coming at him at pace.



He quickly picked a pass upfield and delivered it perfectly to team-mate Fabian Rieder. Banks' quick thinking and accuracy had taken six Freiburg players out of the game in an instant, and Rieder was able to release the pressure on the hosts by launching a counter-attack.



His passing range is clear again in the images below. This time, he helped under-pressure Augsburg get up the field with purpose against Werder Bremen last December.

 

In this passage of play, Banks spotted space for Robin Fellhauer and played a clever long pass that allowed the wing-back to get behind Bremen's back line and create a chance with a dangerous cutback.



“It has been a great year so far, because I didn't expect to play that much, to be absolutely honest,” Banks says. “The coaches have given me a lot of trust, a lot of minutes. From time to time, I got more confident with the team, with my team-mates, with the players, with the tactics.”

Advertisement

Despite his abundant self-belief, he prefers not to talk too much about his chances of making this summer's World Cup, even with speculation growing that he may get another call-up for the friendly games against Belgium and Portugal next month. After that, Pochettino will begin to finalise his roster for June.

“It's not the right moment to think about the World Cup for me, because we have a lot of games left here (at Augsburg),” he says. “We want to win those games because we have goals for the season.

“So I really just focus — a lot of players say it, but I really mean it — on the games we have here.

“Then let's see what happens in the summer.”

Until then, Banks says his attention is on Augsburg's campaign, while also keeping warm in a harsh German winter by spending rare days off indoors watching action films.

His favorites? “The Equalizer and Man on Fire because I love Denzel Washington,” he says.

Don't rule out Banks becoming the leading man in a U.S. jersey before long.

Backing a sign of improved relations between presidents

Tournament expected not to be held every two years

Uefa is ready to back Fifa's proposed expansion of the Club World Cup to 48 teams for the next edition in 2029 in a sign of improving relations between their respective presidents, Aleksander Ceferin and Gianni Infantino.

European football's governing body had opposed plans to grow the Club World Cup over concerns an expanded tournament could threaten the status of the Champions League, but Uefa is now willing to back Fifa in return for an undertaking that the competition will not be held every two years.

Real Madrid proposed a two-year cycle for the Club World Cup during talks with Fifa in Miami last June, although given the opposition from Uefa and all the domestic European leagues that idea has not progressed. In a related development Real last week ended their five-year legal battle with Uefa by formally withdrawing from the European Super League,. They appear ready to fall in line with the global football establishment led by Infantino, Ceferin and Nasser al-Khelaifi, the Paris Saint-Germain president who chairs European Football Clubs.

The Guardian revealed before the Club World Cup in the US last summer Fifa was open to expanding the tournament from 32 teams, primarily to guarantee the participation of more of the biggest European clubs after Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United failed to qualify.

Infantino then said in a speech at the general assembly of European Football Clubs in Rome last October that expansion was on the agenda, saying Fifa was working “to see how we can make this event bigger, even better, even more impactful”.

Uefa's opposition was a potentially significant obstacle, but another remains with Fifa subject to legal action from the lobby group European Leagues that has been taken to the European Commission. That relates to the international match calendar, including decisions concerning the Club World Cup.

While some at Uefa remain concerned that the huge financial rewards of the Club World Cup will have a destabilising effect on European football, an expansion to 48 clubs is regarded as less disruptive than making it a biennial event.

Although the fine detail has yet to be agreed European clubs would be among the main beneficiaries of the expansion, with the number of Uefa qualifiers likely to increase from 12 last year to 16 in 2029. Chelsea won £85m from the competition's £774m prize pot for winning it last year and adding more European teams would have implications for the competitive balance of the Champions League.

Uefa's position is the latest sign of improved relations with Fifa, which reached a nadir when Ceferin and a group of European delegates including the Football Association chair, Debbie Hewitt, staged a walkout at Fifa congress in Paraguay last May in protest at the late arrival of Infantino, who had been on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East involving Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman.

With Ceferin and Infantino likely to seek re-election for fourth terms next year, sources close to both men have indicated that a period of calm is in both their interests.

Spain and Morocco are favourites to host the next Club World Cup, which will take place in the summer of 2029, before their co-hosting of the 2030 World Cup.

Travel rental platform Airbnb is rolling out a $750 incentive to attract new hosts in the 16 North American cities gearing up to welcome millions of visitors for the FIFA World Cup in mid-2026.

New “entire home” hosts who successfully fulfill their first guest stay between now and July 31 will qualify for the payout under the program, Airbnb said, describing it as the company's largest-ever incentive for new hosts.

Last month, FIFA said it received more than 500 million ticket requests for the 2026 World Cup during a 33-day application window.

Demand for lodgings during the FIFA World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, has been skyrocketing. 

On match days, vacation rental prices are up as much as 50% from a year ago in some host cities, according to travel data firm AirDNA.

Airbnb expects hosts in the New York-New Jersey area, Boston and Los Angeles to earn the most during the tournament, projecting per-host earnings above $5,000 in all three markets.

Beyond the three host nations, FIFA received most ticket applications from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.

The World Cup could provide a much-needed boost to US international inbound travel demand, which was down 5.4% through November 2025, per the US National Travel and Tourism Office.","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","soccer"

FOXBORO, MASS. (WHDH) - Foxboro town leaders are still waiting for the money to pay for security during the FIFA World Cup this summer. 

The select board refused to grant an entertainment license that would allow the World Cup to be played at Gillette Stadium.

On Tuesday, the board said they would not sign off on the license until the organizers could guarantee when the $7 million bill to put on the games would be paid – and who would be paying it. 

FIFA said they are not responsible, and the Boston 26 Host Committee said they have to wait for the federal government to pay them.

“I've got to be honest with you, it baffles my mind that you guys are sitting here in front of me right now and we still have no idea where this money is coming from,” said select board member Mark Elfman.

“We're not prepared to issue this license unless everything is in place,” said select board vice chair Stephanie McGowan. “I've seen people saying, ‘Oh, there's no way, they won't.' I'm going to tell you, this board will not issue this license.”

The select board will meet again on March 3. The deadline to issue the license is set for March 17.

Foxboro is scheduled to host seven World Cup matches this summer.

            / CBS Boston
          

Foxboro, Massachusetts is doubling down on its threat to cancel the FIFA World Cup matches at Gillette Stadium if it does not receive the security money needed to host the event.

Seven games are set to be played at the stadium, called Boston Stadium for the tournament, including a quarter-final match. They are scheduled to start on June 13 and end in July. The town can't afford to front the $7.8 million needed for security and wait to be reimbursed later.

""It's the equivalent of seven Super Bowls here and 39 days of coverage. Which is not small and not to be lost. We have to secure that facility for 39 days straight,"" said Bill Yukna, a member of the town's select board. 

The board met Tuesday night to try and get an answer about the funding for security. The Boston Globe reported that the town was supposed to get an answer about the funding on January 30.

During the meeting, the town said that major safety equipment still needs to be ordered, and that their fiscal calendar ends in the middle of the games. The board explained that it will withhold the essential entertainment license until they are reimbursed several million dollars. 

""The money has to be here. Everyone thinks we have a football stadium in this town. But with that being said we're a small town. We have 18,000 people,"" said select board member Stephanie McGowan. 

""It comes down to sounding like Foxboro is being the bad guys here, but we really aren't. All we're trying to do is protect our citizens,"" Yukna said. 

Leadership for the games said that grant funding will cover the costs.

""The White House task force is working on a daily basis to work with DHS and FEMA on that. I don't think I can say anything more about that. We're being told it's expected any day now,"" said Boston 2026 Host Committee Chair Mike Loynd.  

Homeland Security is currently shut down due to government funding that lapsed on Saturday. It's unclear if that will have an impact on when the town can expect its own funding. 

FIFA officials deferred any questions about funding to the Boston Host Committee. When WBZ-TV asked the officials about the funding Tuesday evening, they said they were late to dinner. 

The town wasn't happy that the meeting ended without a solid answer. 

""I'm shocked you're not sitting here in front of us right now   saying 'We've got the money for you,'"" said select board member Mark Elfman. 

March 17 is the deadline for the entertainment license. 

The Foxboro Police Department, Massachusetts State Police and Boston Police were awarded a collective $11 million in grant funding to protect against ""malicious drone activity"" during the games and American 250 events.

World Cup

Soccer players running off of the ball on a dirt pitch in a Brooklyn NYC park Keith Getter

FIFA president Gianni Infantino and vice president Victor Montagliani gathered before a room full of journalists in Manhattan in the summer of 2022 to unveil the 16 host cities for the 2026 World Cup.

Even then — six months before Argentina lifted its third World Cup in Qatar — the FIFA heads knew the next edition of the men's World Cup would be “special.” It did not matter that football was far from the most popular sport in Canada or the United States — two of the three host nations, along with Mexico.

“The game, especially here in North America, has been built on the backs of immigrants,” Montagliani told reporters that day. “The game here — like the countries, quite honestly — were built on the backs of immigrants, so was the game of football. So, I think (this World Cup) has a special meaning for immigrants.”

That this announcement happened at Rockefeller Center in New York City, arguably the immigrant capital of the United States, if not the world, was fitting.

Off the Statue of Liberty's shores. In a city where more than 800 languages are spoken. Less than 10 miles from MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., which would later be named host of the 2026 final.

Make no mistake: this region, and East Rutherford in particular, was selected to showcase eight matches, and the competition's crown jewel, in large part for its diverse population. Local leaders, such as former New York City mayor Eric Adams and former New Jersey governor Phil Murphy, have repeated that sentiment time and again.

After unveiling the location of the final two years ago, Infantino said, “Being in New York, which is such a cosmopolitan city, where you have, between New York and New Jersey, over 200 nationalities there, celebrating and uniting the world, is something unique.”

But the diversity that was celebrated for so long is now being turned on its head.

I was recently at a bar in East Rutherford with friends who, like me, grew up in this small town, defrosting from the snow at our neighborhood pub with pints of beer.

That's when one of my friends landed a dark joke: “We'd be screwed if ICE came through right now.” He was kidding, but there was some truth to his ‘joke' that stuck with me.

You see, most of these friends were first-generation immigrants. Our parents migrated to New Jersey from places such as Brazil, Argentina and Canada by way of Sri Lanka. Another friend moved here from Poland as a child; he's the reason we all know the words to Sto Lat (a Polish birthday song). Growing up, our group of friends hailed from South Korea, Croatia, Morocco, the Philippines, Italy, Colombia.

For our small town, diversity was the default — thanks to the immigration policies of the 1990s that allowed our families to not only immigrate here but thrive. We were welcomed with open arms. The door to the U.S. was never locked.

So, sitting here now, three decades later, an inappropriate joke about ICE felt like a twisted way to cope with the stress of what has been unfolding.

Since President Donald Trump reclaimed office in January 2025, he has made good on at least one of his key campaign promises — a sweeping overhaul of the U.S.' immigration policies through mass deportations; a continuation of what he started in 2016.

The backlash over the past year has been steady. In recent weeks, two American citizens have been killed by federal ICE agents in Minnesota, setting off a flurry of protests around the U.S and demands for accountability. The pushback has been loud and clear, from the Grammys to the Winter Olympics.

The question over how Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement will impact the World Cup — when millions are expected to visit — remains a thorn in FIFA's side.

A coalition of immigrant advocacy and civil rights groups last week issued a travel alert for visitors, highlighting multiple examples of visitors landing in ICE's crosshairs. This week, ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, did FIFA no favors by saying his agents will play a “key part” in the tournament.

All the while, Infantino continues to tout that the 2026 World Cup will be the most inclusive and welcoming edition of the competition — even with the steep costs making it inaccessible for the average fan.

But my mind keeps coming back to the immigrant communities and what a missed opportunity this will be for longtime football fans.

The melting pot I grew up in had one constant: soccer was the thread that weaved so many of us together.

My friends and I would spend hours on end playing pick-up on pitches around North Jersey — in the blistering heat, in between thunderstorms, and at all hours. During men's World Cup years, we'd all come together to watch our favorite teams fight for glory — unless Argentina was playing and my family had a strict policy on who could watch with us. (There's no yapping while the match is on, and absolutely no Brazilian jerseys on Argentina match days — rules courtesy of my 78-year-old, football-loving mother.)

Nearly a decade ago, when word began to spread that a World Cup was coming to the U.S., and then more recently when we learned a final would be played right here, it felt like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that we would not dare miss. Now it feels like a tournament that was designed without the fans who have been dreaming of going to these matches in mind.

My family was in East Rutherford when the 1994 World Cup took over the U.S. Tickets were so affordable that you could have made plans to attend a match on a whim. My family — diehard Argentinos — was there when La Selección defeated Nigeria 2-1 on June 25 at Foxboro Stadium near Boston. It was Diego Maradona's final match of his international career. The story of this moment and everything my family experienced has been and will continue to be passed down for generations.

This coming summer, will immigrant families have the chance to experience similar life-altering moments? I'm not so sure. My family, at least, is still trying to figure this out. After we received several rejections following FIFA's latest ticket lottery phase, my 34-year-old nephew put it succinctly in our group chat, “Resale is $1,000 and up. No thanks.”

For additional context, according to prices on FIFA's resale platform, tickets for the opening match at MetLife Stadium between Morocco and Brazil are starting at $1,495 (as of Feb. 11) for seats in the nosebleed sections. Tickets for that same category at the final are starting at $9,775.

There remain questions over so much — will fans of countries facing travel bans be allowed in the U.S.? This affects teams such as AFCON champions Senegal and Haiti, who are appearing in the World Cup for the first time in 52 years. Will immigrants already in the U.S. feel safe, knowing ICE will play a “key role”? Will ticket prices keep rising?

On a recent bus commute to The Athletic's offices in Manhattan from New Jersey, I was reminded of what makes this region so special. As I rode past MetLife Stadium to my right, the bus later weaved through some of the heavily immigrant communities where I grew up. Union City, North Bergen, West New York. I took in the New York City skyline, as the bus circled down the Lincoln Tunnel Helix — grateful that, of all the places in the world, my family chose to live near this city.

I thought about this coming World Cup, and back to the messaging around the competition, about how it was awarded to the United States, Mexico and Canada because of its diversity. Because of its immigrants. Because of families like ours.

I thought back to sitting in that room with Montagliani and Infantino in 2022.

“We're both sons of immigrants, right? Me in North America, Gianni in Switzerland, and football probably is what linked us to our fathers more than anything else,” Montagliani told us. “It's obviously a momentous occasion for our region and for the three countries. It will be a watershed moment for the sport.”

But will this moment be one that welcomes immigrants? Or keeps them out of the sport they helped build?

CHESTER, Pa. (WPVI) -- The national soccer team for Cote d'Ivoire, or Ivory Coast, will use the Philadelphia Union's stadium as its official training site during this summer's FIFA World Cup, bringing one of the tournament's elite squads to the Philadelphia region.

Organizers said the decision marks a historic moment for Chester and the Delaware Valley as the team prepares for its first World Cup appearance since 2014.

""It is a world-class facility for world-class athletes,"" said Meg Kane, the Philadelphia Soccer 2026 host city executive.

""It's huge for us. We're thrilled,"" added Philadelphia Union President Tim McDermott.

McDermott added Ivory Coast will have full access to both Subaru Park and the WSFS Bank Sportsplex.

""We have built this facility to host things like this and bring in world-class powerhouses around the globe,"" he said.

Kane said the team's presence is expected to energize fans across the region.

""The other part that's really exciting for us is the fans they will draw,"" she said. ""There is an incredible African diaspora in the United States, especially in the Philadelphia region.""

Ivory Coast enters the tournament after winning the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, and Kane said the team's identity will resonate locally.

""One of things I love is their nickname, Les Elephants,"" she said. ""Because it is symbolic to the animal that represents their nation, but also for strength and heritage, and I think that's something that resonates in our community.""

The team will stay in Wilmington, Delaware, while training in Chester.

Ivory Coast is scheduled to play two matches in Philadelphia, including the city's opening game on June 14 against Ecuador.

Kane said she expects the region to embrace the team.

Philadelphia Union's Subaru Park will play a huge part in a team's preparations ahead of and during this summer's FIFA World Cup 2026 tournament.

Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations champion, will use Subaru Park as a team headquarters and one of its training bases during the 2026 World Cup tournament.

According to a Philadelphia Union news release, the Côte d'Ivoire 'Les Éléphants' will also train at the WSFS Bank Sportsplex in Chester, Pennsylvania.

Here's where to find Subaru Park, and if you can watch Côte d'Ivoire train and practice.

Subaru Park is located at 1 Stadium Drive in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

The WSFS Bank Sportsplex is on Seaport Drive in West Chester.

Most FIFA World Cup training and practice sessions are closed to the general public, but that rule may be relaxed as the tournament approaches.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup group stage will begin on Thursday, June 11 2026, and run through Sunday, July 19.

Canada, Mexico and the United States are 2026 FIFA World Cup host countries.

According to FIFA, Lincoln Financial Field in South Philadelphia is set to host six 2026 FIFA World Cup matches, including two matches featuring Côte d'Ivoire:

Citing an exorbitant security bill, Foxborough's select board told the Boston Host Committee to pony up the $7.8 million it will cost for event security.

On Tuesday night, the select board met and said they will not sign off on the games until they know who is paying the security tab.

""All we're asking for is a collaboration that gets us the answer as to who,"" said Bill Yunka, Vice Chairman of the Foxborough Select Board. ""It's obviously an NFL game on steroids because this is a SEAR 1 event, it's the equivalent of 7 Super Bowls here and 39 days of coverage.""

Town leaders said it shouldn't be on Foxborough taxpayers to fund an international event. They also said security details need to be paid in a timely manner.

""The money we're asking for is strictly for security, number one,"" said Foxborough Vice Chair Stephanie McGowan. ""Number two, if it's a misconception for anybody, the town... we're going to get what we get for any event at that stadium. This is not a moneymaker for this town. In fact, it's probably more of a headache than it's worth.""

The host committee is trying to smooth things over with town leaders as they wait for federal funding to be awarded.

""We are not looking to put the town of Foxborough at risk,"" said Mike Loynd of the FIFA World Cup Boston Committee. ""The stadium has stepped up to provide what we call a liquidity agreement, which protects specifically all of the public safety payroll... so that's a substantial amount of the federal grant and public safety cost... what percentage? Probably 80% or more.""

It's not clear how much federal grant money is coming. 

The Kraft Group bid on the World Cup but is leasing the stadium to FIFA.

At this point, the group has not formally committed to paying for security like it does for Patriots games.

Liverpool have been urged to consider a move for West Ham United captain Jarrod Bowen if they decide to move on from Mohamed Salah in the near future. The 'Egyptian King' has a contract at Anfield running until 2027 but he has been tipped to leave this summer while the club can still extract a transfer fee for him.

Salah was voted the PFA Players' Player of the Year for 2024-25 as Liverpool ran away with the Premier League title, but they have struggled trying to defend their crown. Through 26 rounds of fixtures, the Reds sit sixth in the table, 15 points behind leaders Arsenal.

Salah took home the Golden Boot last year with 29 goals, but he has scored only four times in the league so far this term. His long-term future at Liverpool was thrown into doubt back in November when he claimed his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down, and though reparations appear to have been made on that front, Salah has been heavily linked with a summer exit.

Former Chelsea star and TV commentator Andy Townsend has claimed that Salah's form has been of concern, but the performances of his team-mates can't be ignored either.

Townsend told BOYLE Sports who offer the latest football odds: ""Liverpool showed something in that second half against Manchester City. Playing towards The Kop, they started to apply pressure and squeeze City, press them to cause a few errors and back each other up. Once they start playing like that, they can still be a very good team but they've been too hot and cold this season.

""Let's be honest, they've had the Mohamed Salah situation before Christmas when he left to go to AFCON. He's come back now and he still hasn't got up to speed, really. I haven't seen Mo Salah kick a ball in the way we know he can. He's not been brilliant for some time now. Whether Mo is going to find that edge again, or if he'd even want to find that for Slot given what's gone on, that's another question.

""Virgil van Dijk turns 35 in July. He isn't going to be getting any quicker or any better. That is a fact. They've got some real issues in that camp and in their squad.

""Florian Wirtz has had the odd half a game here and there but hasn't come up with any sort of form that you would call world class yet. He still needs to put in a run of games where we're all going wow, I get it now. He's had moments so far but we haven't seen that. Not really.

""There are others in the camp who you'd now have question marks over too. Alexis Mac Allister doesn't look the same player as he was last year. He's only been on the edges of games in the middle of the park, seemingly unable to boss a game and control things for Liverpool like we were used to seeing.

""It's not just Salah. It's not just Van Dijk. There are other problems in that dressing room to solve too. Dominik Szoboszlai has been great. I really like Hugo Ekitike too. I think he's got every chance to be a top player at Anfield for years to come.""

With Salah's future up in the air, Liverpool have been linked with a number of possible successors, including Real Madrid winger Rodrygo. However, Townsend believes the Reds should instead be going after England international Bowen, who could be relegated from the Premier League with West Ham this season.

""Who can Liverpool bring in to take Mohamed Salah's place next season? I think Jarrod Bowen would do very well for Liverpool,"" Townsend continued.

""I don't quite get the Rodrygo links. Clearly if you play for Real Madrid you've got great ability but I've never seen him as a Galactico.

""Jarrod Bowen would absolutely go to Liverpool and be a real threat for them from the right on that side. They'd have Cody Gakpo, Hugo Ekitike and Jarrod Bown. They give you pace, work rate, goals and real output. That's a frontline that has everything you could want.

""Liverpool are going to have to look at Bowen because I just don't see Salah staying beyond this summer. Whatever's gone on at Anfield, it's just taken a bit of wind out of Mo's sails.

""Whether it's a relationship problem or he's just getting older, whatever it is he's never going to be able to keep producing the numbers like he has done in the past. It just looks like Mo is now running out of steam and there's no shame in that. It's just football. It's part and parcel of getting older. Mo's best days are behind him and they've got to replace him.""

Did Gianluca Prestianni racially abuse Vinicius Junior at the Estadio da Luz on Tuesday night? We don't know. Not yet at least. And that's mainly because the Argentine very deliberately covered his mouth with his shirt as he exchanged words with Vinicius after being inexplicably enraged by the Brazilian celebrating his 50th-minute goal with a little dance in front of the corner flag.

However, Vinicius immediately reported Prestianni to the referee, Francois Letexier, who suspended play for 10 minutes, while Kylian Mbappe later claimed that he himself had heard the Benfica winger call his team-mate a ""monkey"" five times.

""Everyone can have their opinion, but this kind of behavior is unacceptable,"" the France forward said in the mixed zone. ""I called [Prestianni] racist because I think he is. He tried to hide behind his shirt, but his face doesn't lie.

""This type of person is not a professional colleague. A young player cannot have the freedom to say things like this on a football field. It's a big problem, and we'll see what happens.""

Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa said afterwards that he has absolutely zero reason to doubt the word of either Vinicius or Mbappe but as we await the outcome of UEFA's enquiry into the incident, Prestianni should - whether we like it or not - be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and it's worth noting that he has publicly denied the accusations levelled at him.

""I want to clarify that at no point did I direct racist insults at Vinicius Jr., who unfortunately misunderstood what he thought he heard,"" the 20-year-old wrote on Instagram on Wednesday morning. ""I have never been racist toward anyone. And I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.""

Here's what we already know for sure, though: Benfica boss Jose Mourinho is a hypocritical clown who embarrassed himself in Lisbon by somehow managing to make a bad situation worse.

After Roma's loss to Sevilla in the 2023 UEFA Cup final in Budapest, Mourinho waited in the carpark to call match referee Anthony Taylor a ""f*cking disgrace"" - which makes for a crude but rather accurate way of describing the Portuguese coach's reaction to the Vinicius-Prestianni racism row.

You see, for Mourinho, and countless other idiots, Vinicius had once again brought the abuse upon himself - which represented a depressing new low for the seemingly 'Stupid One'.

""I told him him - when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was black,"" the 63-year-old told Amazon Prime.

""This club, the last thing that it is, is racist. If in his mind there was something in relation to that – this in Benfica. They [Vinicius and Gianluca Prestianni] told me different things. But I don't believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.

""These talents are able to do these beautiful things, but unfortunately he [Vinicius Junior] was not just happy to score that astonishing goal. When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.""

Quite what Eusebio's legendary status at the Estadio da Laz had to do with anything that happened on Tuesday night is anyone's guess. Maybe Mourinho was foolishly suggesting that nobody connected to the club could possibly be capable of racial abuse because the most famous figure in the club's history was black.

If that was the case, it was horribly flawed logic - because racism is, by its very nature nonsensical, nothing than an irrational hatred of another human being simply and usually because of the colour of the skin.

That's why we, in the football world, are regularly subjected to the ludicrous sight and sound of supporters of teams packed with players of all sorts of ethnicities racially abusing opponents.

We should perhaps be thankful that Mourinho stopped short of calling Vinicius ""a liar"". He instead left that to Benfica, who posted a video in the early hours of the morning and argued that ""the images demonstrate, given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.""

The shameful crux of Mourinho's argument, though, was that Vinicius was not so much a victim but a provocateur. 

Mourinho pointed to the fact that Tuesday wasn't the first time that almost an entire arena had turned on Vinicius.

""There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,"" the Benfica boss stated. ""A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.""

Obviously, that's not true. Vinicius is by no means a universally popular player. His petulance and propensity for diving are hardly endearing traits.

But the implication that he causes trouble wherever he goes is wrong in both senses of the word, because as well as being incorrect, it also supports the incredibly dangerous and damaging narrative long established in Spain that Vinicius provokes people into racial abuse.

Remember, supposedly disrespectful dancing has long been used as a stick with which to beat Vinicius, who, at times, has been left to fight racism in La Liga almost singlehandedly while enduring numerous death threats. 

All the way back in September 2022, Pedro Bravo, the president of Spanish football agents, infamously told El Chiringuito in September 2022, ""When you score a goal, if you want to dance Samba, you should go to sambodromo in Brazil. You have to respect your opponents and stop playing the monkey.""

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

Of course, the mere fact that Mourinho felt he was in a position to lecture Vinicius on how to celebrate goals was the definition of unintentional irony.

The former Chelsea, Inter and Manchester United manager has never been subjected to racial abuse during his coaching career but when he has been targeted by opposition fans, he's repeatedly reacted with inflammatory gestures.

Why, then, is it okay for Mourinho to respond with a cupped ear or finger of the mouth to a victory - but not for Vinicius to celebrate a stunning strike in the Champions League with a joyous nod to his Brazilian heritage?

Why is it one rule for a sprint down the Old Trafford touchline, and another for a display of samba at the Stadium of Light? Maybe Mourinho will explain it to us ahead of next week's return fixture at the Santiago Bernabeu, as it would be great to hear more about acceptable behaviour from a man who has previously eye-gouged a rival coach.

What Mourinho really needs to do, though, is apologise for defending the indefensible.

Clarence Seedorf was one of many people astounded by the former Madrid coach's take on Tuesday's events in Lisbon but was hopeful that it was simply a case of Mourinho's emotions getting the better of him after a controversial clash in which he'd also been sent off for insulting the referee.

""I think he made a big mistake today to justify racial abuse,"" the Dutch legend said on Amazon. ""He's saying it's OK when Vinicius provokes you to be racist - and I think that is very wrong.

""We should never, ever justify racial abuse. Vinicius has had enough of that unjustified behaviour from people.

""I know Mourinho by heart would agree with me but he expressed himself a bit, unfortunately, I believe.""

The sad thing is, though, that we're not dealing with an isolated incident here. Vincius Junior alone has found himself at the centre of a racism row on far too many occasions - and through no fault of his own. 

But it's also now seven years since Moise Kean's own team-mate, Leonardo Bonucci, said that the striker should accept 50 percent of the blame for racist abuse he received while celebrating a goal by standing silently and defiantly in front of a Cagliari crowd that had been subjecting him to monkey chants for the entire game - which just begs the question: has anything changed in the interim? Have any lessons been learned at all? The shameful scenes in Lisbon would suggest not - because it still feels as if Mourinho and so many others still don't get it. 

It's not about the nature of the celebration. It's about the completely unjustified response. As a result, the focus simply has to now shift from blaming the victims of racism to prosecuting the perpetrators.

As Vinicius himself wrote on Tuesday night, ""Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to show how weak they are. But they have the protection of others who, theoretically, have an obligation to punish them.""

But the responsibility to finally take adequate action doesn't just fall on UEFA and the rest of the game's authorities. There's also an arguably even more important onus on Mourinho and other-like minded morons within the game to start supporting those who stand up to racism - rather than immediately attacking them.

Benfica boss Jose Mourinho has been accused of ""justifying racism"" following his comments on Vinicius Junior after Tuesday's Champions League between his side and Real Madrid. The game had to be halted for 10 minutes after the Brazil international alleged a racial slur had been directed at him by Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni after he had scored what turned out to be the winning goal.

Real Madrid beat Benfica 1-0 in the first leg of their Champions League knockout stage play-off tie at the Estadio da Luz on a chaotic night in Portugal. Vinicius Jr was booked for his celebrations after scoring a brilliant winner, but the game was then stopped after the Brazil star accused Prestianni of racism. Vinicius went off the pitch and was seen speaking with manager Alvaro Arbeloa and Mourinho before the game restarted on the hour mark. However, tempers flared again in the dying moments of the game as Mourinho was sent off for dissent by the referee. The red card means that Mourinho will now be banned from the touchline for the return game at the Santiago Bernabeu next week.

Mourinho spoke about Vinicius Jr after the game with comments that have drawn criticism. He said: ""It should be the crazy moment of the game, an amazing goal. These talents are able to do these beautiful things, but unfortunately not just happy to score astonishing goal. When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way."" 

Mourinho was then asked if he felt Vinicius had incited the home crowd with his celebrations and said: ""Yes. I believe so. Then the words that they exchange Gianluca Prestianni with Vinicius I want to be an independent. I saw two completely different things. I want to be independent, and I don't comment about it. I told him [Vinicius Jr] exactly that. I told him, 'when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back.' When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist. If in his mind there was something in relation to that, this in Benfica. They [Vinicius Jr and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don't believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.""

Mourinho was criticised for his comments on Vinicius Jr by television pundits on Amazon Prime. Dutch legend Clarence Seedorf said: ""I think he is still emotional. I think he made a big mistake today to justify racial abuse. He's saying it's OK, when Vinicius provokes you, to be racist - and I think that is very wrong. We should never, ever justify racial abuse. Vinicius has had enough of that unjustified behaviour from people. I know Mourinho by heart would agree with me but he expressed himself a bit unfortunately, I believe.""

Former Arsenal star Theo Walcott added: ""I am quite calm and composed and I am not someone who gets angry often. I love everything Jose Mourinho has done in football but I think he has made a poor decision in that sense. It was maybe the one time we shouldn't have heard from him, the one night he should not have been in front of the cameras.""

Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney said: ""It's very unfair what he's saying about Vinicius.""

Meanwhile, in the CBS Sports studio, ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher called Mourinho a ""hypocrite"" for criticising Vinicius's goal celebration. ""Anyone can celebrate however they want, and Vinicius shouldn't suffer racial abuse. It seems a bit hypocritical coming from Mourinho, a man who has celebrated and possibly antagonized opponents more than any other coach in the past,"" said Carragher. ""Do you remember him running down the sideline at Old Trafford [celebrating Costinha's goal for FC Porto]? I remember Mourinho, in a Cup final against Liverpool, when Chelsea scored a late goal, telling the Liverpool fans to shut up. How many times has he put his hands to his ears at opponents? So, it's a bit hypocritical of him to criticize Vinicius. It was a great goal, in a Champions League game, he has every right to celebrate however he wants.""

UEFA has issued a statement in response to the allegations from the game: ""The official reports from the matches played last night are currently being reviewed. Where matters are reported, proceedings are opened and should they lead to disciplinary sanctions being imposed they are announced on the UEFA disciplinary website. We have no further information to provide you or any further comment to make on this matter at this stage.""

Real Madrid will host Benfica at the Santiago Bernabeu for the second leg of the tie in a week's time.

Coming into the 2025-26 season, few - if any - were carrying the kind of momentum that Chloe Kelly was. She was the Lionesses' hero in the summer, scoring the penalty that delivered the 2025 European Championship title after also enjoying huge moments in the quarter-and-semi-finals to get England into that title-deciding clash with Spain. With a permanent move to Arsenal secured after all that, having helped the Gunners win the Champions League in May while on loan, Kelly felt primed for a huge season.

So far, it hasn't quite panned out like that. Injuries have limited Kelly massively, with her only able to start one Women's Super League game so far this term as a result. Indeed, just when it looked like she was gathering some momentum before the winter break, she was forced off with a knee issue 23 minutes into England's victory over Ghana.

Last Wednesday, though, Kelly was able to make her first start since that December international break, and she looked sharp in Arsenal's 4-0 win over OH Leuven, a result which has all-but-secured the Gunners' place in the Champions League quarter-finals. The hope will be that this can mark the start of a big end to the season for a player who came into this campaign with plenty of eyes on her, but has yet to showcase the match-winning - and title-winning - qualities she possesses.

It was around this time last year that Kelly really started to make her mark on a 2025 that would prove huge for her, her club and her country. Having secured a loan move away from a difficult situation at Manchester City, Kelly's second debut for childhood club Arsenal came in the north London derby on February 16, allowing her to squeeze into an England squad she had initially missed out on for that month's international break.

A couple of weeks later, Kelly bagged a goal and an assist on her first WSL start in almost five months, and that would spark quite a run of form for a player who had barely got on the pitch during the first half of the season. Two goals and five assists in the final 12 games of Arsenal's campaign helped the Gunners clinch a Champions League berth for this season and, most importantly, that European title in May.

Given the way her season ended, and the history she has of producing huge moments for England over the years, perhaps it is no surprise that Kelly took centre stage when Euro 2025 kicked-off, despite not even starting a game for the Lionesses. The winger provided a goal or an assist in all three of her country's knockout ties, as well as scoring in both of the penalty shootouts that England won as Sarina Wiegman's side retained their title from 2022 - one also sealed by a Kelly goal.

""She loves these moments,"" Wiegman said of Kelly after her spot-kick decided the shootout in the final against Spain. ""She really wants to take the penalty. To be able to score that penalty under that pressure is very impressive.""

It was all set up for Kelly to carry that momentum into the 2025-26 season, back in Arsenal's colours on a permanent basis, back in favour and back getting minutes for club and country. But it just has not panned out that way.

Kelly missed a game at West Ham early in the season due to a knock, sported visible strapping on her right knee for a few weeks after that and didn't look herself as she nursed the issue, registering just two goals and three assists in her 12 appearances before being forced off in England's final game of 2025.

The winger then spent almost two months on the sidelines, returning just in time to be part of Arsenal's FIFA Women's Champions Cup triumph at the end of January.

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

But the good news is that Kelly is back now,  just in time for those big games which she appears to relish more than most. The winger has been slowly but surely building her minutes up over the last few weeks, making substitute appearances against AS FAR, Corinthians and Man City before that start in Leuven, where she looked surprisingly sharp given her time on the sidelines.

Kelly played an hour in Belgium before being replaced by Alessia Russo and she impressed, most notably with the perfect delivery for Olivia Smith's goal. That was one of three accurate crosses the England star produced - a number only bettered by Katie McCabe's four, which she had the whole 90 minutes to rack up. Kelly's passing was accurate, her play was positive and her defensive work was strong, too, in a dominant win.

""I am feeling really good, building minutes in the legs, building momentum, getting the rustiness out of them,"" she said after the game.

Though Arsenal's trip to Brighton was postponed on Sunday, Kelly has two more important games before the upcoming international break to keep building those minutes and that momentum. On Wednesday, the Gunners host Leuven in the second leg of their Champions League play-off, and then they welcome second-tier Bristol City to north London at the weekend, in the FA Cup. The European champions will be big favourites in both games, giving Kelly a relatively pressure-free go at working her way back to her best.

Her return couldn't come at a better time for England, either, given the Lionesses are going to be without both Ella Toone and Beth Mead for the upcoming international break, which begins after the FA Cup weekend. Kelly's creativity could be key in crucial World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine and Iceland, who will both be expected to sit back and make it difficult for England's attack.

After that, the big games come thick and fast. Unless Leuven pull off something incredible on Wednesday, a two-legged Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea awaits Arsenal in a few weeks' time, with the Gunners also expected to be involved in the last eight of the FA Cup. In the WSL, meanwhile, every game is huge given how tight the race for European qualification is. After their trip to Brighton on Sunday was postponed, the Gunners are now four points off Chelsea in the third and final UWCL spot, albeit with two games in hand.

Fortunately, in Kelly, Arsenal have a player who thrives in these moments, and they have a nice runway to get her back up to speed in time for them to come along.

""We've missed her,"" Gunners boss Renee Slegers said of the winger upon her return to action at the end of last month. ""She's so hungry, she's so engaged and you could see that on the pitch as well. She wanted to be back and make an impact on the team. You can just feel that desire, so it's really good for us as a team to have Chloe back.""

That's because this is a player who doesn't just decide games; she decides the biggest games. Arsenal know that, England know that, and both club and country will hope Kelly can prove as much again before the end of what has been, for reasons out of her control, a tough season so far.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Vinicius Jr scored the only goal of an otherwise controversial fixture as Real Madrid beat Benfica 1-0 in the first leg of their Champions League knockout play-off. The Brazilian forward's second-half strike was followed by a lengthy delay for an alleged racist remark from a Benfica player to Vinicius. Play continued, and Madrid held on for a crucial lead in the tie.

Benfica had their chances early on, and peppered Madrid's goal - but Thibaut Courtois made a series of handy stops to keep the hosts out. Los Blancos' best chances came from some lovely wing play from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who fired a teasing ball that Kylian Mbappe couldn't quite turn in at full stretch. The Frenchman came close shortly before half-time, rattling the bar from close range. 

Vinicius changed the game in the second period. The Brazilian provided the first moment of real quality, cutting inside his man before unleashing a wonderful curled attempt into the top corner. 

But things took a turn for the worse in the immediate aftermath. Vinicius indicated to the referee that Gianluca Prestianni made a racist comment, and took a seat on the bench - refusing to play. The game resumed after a 10-minute delay for the racism protocol, and the Madrid star returned to the pitch - continuing to affect the game. Twice he was denied by the goalkeeper, and he caused constant problems down the left. Benfica boss Jose Mourinho was also sent off, as Madrid survived late pressure to hold on for a crucial 1-0 win.

GOAL rates Real Madrid's players from Estadio da Luz...

Thibaut Courtois (7/10):

Made some tidy saves early on when Madrid struggled to establish a foothold. 

Trent Alexander-Arnold (7/10):

Fired in some truly lovely crosses and was Madrid's most obvious threat in the first half. His influence waned in the second, though. 

Antonio Rudiger (7/10):

A bit wayward in some of his passing, but wonderful in one on ones. 

Dean Huijsen (8/10):

Completed more passes than anyone else, won his tackles, and was good in the air. A commanding showing at the back. 

Alvaro Carreras (6/10):

A bit of a mixed night against his former club. Beaten a few times on the dribble - even if he didn't get loads of defensive cover. 

Aurelien Tchouameni (6/10):

Not his best game. Lost possession here and there and didn't offer the defensive coverage Madrid wanted. Shuffled the ball forward well, though. 

Eduardo Camavinga (6/10):

Lost the most duels in the match, but also created a pair of good chances. 

Federico Valverde (7/10):

Back into a midfield position, where he looked far more comfortable. An effective box-to-box presence. 

Arda Guler (6/10):

Looked to find all sorts of clever angles, and had a few decent attempts on goal, but rather lacked the killer pass.

Kylian Mbappe (5/10):

Missed a few good chances in the first half. Not really involved in the second. A rare off night. 

Vinicius Jr (8/10):

Excellent all night. Ran at his man relentlessly, scored a wonderful goal, and could have added a couple more. Overcame some significant adversity.

Brahim Diaz (N/A):

No time to make an impact. 

Thiago Pitarch (N/A):

Introduced late on and couldn't really make a difference.

Dani Carvajal (N/A):

Came on late and almost got himself in a tangle but used his strength well.

Alvaro Arbeloa (7/10):

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Real Madrid warned transfer target Rodri would prefer to join another club if he leaves Man City","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/real-madrid-warned-transfer-target-rodri-prefer-another-club-leaves-man-city/blt7220b9efd9d8b700","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 16:24:18 GMT","

Real Madrid have been warned to not expect Rodri to join them if he chooses to leave Manchester City due to his preference for another Spanish club. Rodri is on the road back to his best after missing almost all of last season due to tearing his ACL and having repeated injury setbacks this campaign, boosting City's bid to win the Premier League and go deep in the Champions League.

Rodri's long-term future at City, however, is far from assured. He is soon to enter the final year of his contract at the Etihad Stadium and Real Madrid have long been tipped as his next destination. Madrid are experts at convincing players to see out their contracts in order to move to the Bernabeu on a free transfer, as they have done with Kylian Mbappe, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Antonio Rudiger among others. But Spain legend Gaizka Mendieta believes Rodri might have another destination on his mind.

Mendieta told BetBrothers: ""When he does leave Man City I could see it being an agreement with the club, there is also a big connection there with Barcelona. There was Txiki Begiristain there and of course Pep Guardiola, but it would still be up to Rodri personally. I still think it would be hard for him to join Real Madrid.""

Mendieta predicts that Rodri will actually want to remain at City and get back to the form he was in just before he suffered his serious injury in 2024, one month before winning the Ballon d'Or. 

He added: ""Personally, I think it's difficult to see that [him leaving] happening, especially knowing Rodri, how he is attached to the club and everything else. It would have to be a very extreme situation where he is kind of forced to leave rather than leaving just because he wants to. I think he wants to stay there and wants to perform to the level he did when he was in the running for the Ballon d'Or and Champions League medals. So I think as a player that's his challenge, and that's what he wants to prove to himself and for the club and the fans.""

Mendieta, however, believes that there is one thing that might make Rodri consider his future in Manchester: Pep Guardiola leaving. There is an expectation that the serial winning coach could leave City at the end of the campaign, which is his 10th at the Etihad Stadium. Guardiola has refused to comment on the speculation, pointing to the fact that he has one year left on his contract. 

He said in December: ""The last three or four years, every time during a certain, period someone asks me that question. Sooner or later, when I'm 75 or 76, I will quit Manchester City. I understand the question when I have the end of a contract (coming) but I have 18 months left and I am so delighted and happy and excited about the development of the team and being there. That is all I can say.

""That question happens every single season at a certain point and I'm OK. The club and I are incredibly connected in terms of the decisions we have to take and when it's going to happen, it's going to happen. There are no discussions - end of the subject. There are no discussions. I will not be eternally here, but I've said before I will not be here forever. None of us will be forever in this world but there are no discussions.""

Guardiola has won six Premier League titles in eight attempts with City as well as capturing the club's first Champions League in 2023. His departure will inevitably leave a huge shadow around the club and Mendieta believes it could lead to Rodri also leaving.

The former Barcelona, Valencia and Middlesbrough midfielder added: ""If there are to be any changes, I think the time will be when Pep leaves the club for Rodri to think about his future too.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Serhou Guirassy explains emotional reason behind t-shirt message as Borussia Dortmund striker celebrated goal against Atalanta","https://www.goal.com/en-sa/lists/serhou-guirassy-explains-emotional-reason-t-shirt-message-borussia-dortmund-striker-celebrated-goal-atalanta/bltedd41ba10054170e","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 13:40:22 GMT","

Borussia Dortmund striker Serhou Guirassy was the undisputed hero on the pitch during the 2-0 Champions League victory over Atalanta, but it was his actions after finding the back of the net that truly resonated. After enduring a frustrating dry spell earlier in the campaign, the Guinean international has hit a rich vein of form, netting six goals in his last four competitive outings. However, his latest strike was accompanied by a poignant tribute that revealed a deeply personal struggle behind the scenes.

After scoring to help put Dortmund in the driving seat for a place in the quarter-finals, Guirassy lifted his jersey to reveal a handwritten message on his undershirt. The text read: ""Missata, I miss you! Rest in peace. You are safe now, in paradise! Amen!"" 

It was later confirmed that the message was a tribute to his niece, who passed away recently. Despite the jubilation of the Westfalenstadion, the striker's thoughts were clearly with his grieving family during a difficult period of bereavement.

Speaking to Amazon after the final whistle, the former Stuttgart man opened up about the significance of the gesture and who it was intended for. Guirassy stated: ""It was a message to my brother. We are all standing by him. It is a hard time for the family. But life goes on. We will all die one day."" 

On the pitch, Guirassy was the architect of Atalanta's downfall, providing both a clinical finish and a vital assist to ensure the Bundesliga giants took a significant advantage into the second leg of the play-off tie. His return to form has been timely for manager Niko Kovac, especially following a period where the striker's place in the starting XI was being questioned by some sections of the German media. His ability to compartmentalise his personal grief and deliver a Man of the Match performance, including a goal and an assist, has drawn widespread praise from teammates and staff alike.

The striker's resurgence is statistically impressive, as he has managed to end his goal drought emphatically with his recent scoring streak. Having arrived at Signal Iduna Park in the summer of 2024, Guirassy has quickly become the focal point of the Dortmund attack. His contribution against the Italian side served as a reminder of why BVB were so keen to trigger his release clause from Stuttgart originally, even as speculation regarding his long-term future begins to mount in the background.

Despite his on-field success and emotional connection to the club, reports are circulating that Guirassy may not see out his current contract, which is set to run until 2028. There are suggestions that the forward is looking for one final lucrative deal before he reaches the twilight of his career. These rumours have put several clubs on high alert, particularly given the relatively modest exit clauses that have become a trademark of the striker's recent career moves.

The latest whispers from Germany indicate that the player is looking to sit down with the BVB hierarchy once the current campaign concludes to discuss his trajectory. It is understood that Guirassy is planning a meeting with BVB bosses to clarify whether his journey in North Rhine-Westphalia will continue. While the fans are currently enjoying his prolific output, the possibility of a summer departure remains a genuine concern for the Dortmund faithful as the transfer window approaches.

For now, Guirassy and Dortmund will be focused on finishing the job against Atalanta and progressing further in the Champions League. The striker's ability to turn personal pain into a driving force on the pitch has made him a focal point of Dortmund's season. Whether he stays or goes in the summer, his emotional display under the lights of the Champions League will go down as one of the most human moments of the tournament so far, proving that there is often much more to the game than just the scoreline.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Who will cast their line for Doha glory this week?


Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Andrey Rublev are among those competing at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open, where the superstars swapped their racquets for fishing rods ahead of the ATP 500 tournament. Daniil Medvedev, who fell to Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round, was also part of the fishing fun on Sunday. 



The lighthearted outing made waves on social media, with fans enjoying everything from Sinner's catch of the day to clips of the four rivals sharing laughs.

Alcaraz and Sinner are both vying for their first Doha crown. The Italian is making his first appearance while Alcaraz is competing in Qatar for the second consecutive year. 




Alcaraz recently won the Australian Open to complete the Career Grand Slam and extend his lead over Sinner in the battle for World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Should Alcaraz and Sinner meet in the Doha final, it would mark their first clash in 2026 and 17th Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting overall.

Rublev is the defending champion in Doha, having also triumphed in 2020. He is seeded to meet Alcaraz in the semi-finals.

Casper Ruud won't have to look far for extra motivation as he begins his debut campaign at the Delray Beach Open this week.

Just weeks after he and his fiancée Maria welcomed the birth of their first child, a daughter, the Norwegian arrives in Florida carrying more than racquets and expectations. He brings with him the life-altering joy of new fatherhood and, ahead of his opening match against Marcos Giron at the ATP 250 hard-court event, Ruud reflected to the media on the emotional whirlwind that has reshaped his world.

“It was an incredibly emotional moment,” Ruud said. “I think for anyone who has become a parent, it's an incredible feeling and hard to explain with words.

“I'm excited for the future. This is just the beginning of 20 to 25 years of taking care of her. It's fun and exciting, I will try to use it as motivation and try to remember that you've travelled this far and being away from her, you might as well try your best and play some good tennis while you're at it.”

Ruud had already gathered momentum this season by reaching the fourth round of the Australian Open before he returned home to Norway, where he announced his daughter's arrival at the end of January. Now, the challenge shifts from balancing backhands to balancing life on Tour with life as a new father.

The early-season hard-court swing will test that balance. Delray Beach marks the first stop in a stretch that also includes the ATP 500 in Acapulco and ATP Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells and Miami.

For Ruud, the former No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, the miles may feel longer than before.

“It will be a tough trip, because it won't be that easy for them to come over here and I will miss them and at times feel homesick,” Ruud said. “I'll do my best and see if I can end the hard-court swing, for a while, on a good note before we head back to Europe and start the clay season.

“That will be the goal for these couple of weeks and months coming up, [starting] here, then Acapulco, Indian Wells and Miami: To win some matches and see if I can play for more than myself.”





Ruud begins that run in a strong Delray Beach field that features two-time champion Taylor Fritz and reigning Next Gen ATP Finals titlist Learner Tien.

First up for the second-seeded Ruud is Giron on Wednesday, with their Lexus ATP Head2Head series locked at 2-2. While much has changed in his personal life, he is confident his tennis foundations remain intact.

“My forehand still feels pretty similar to before, and my backhand as well,” Ruud joked. “I haven't got an overuse of my arm yet. I haven't carried her too much yet!”

Brazilian teen Joao Fonseca is eyeing a return to next month's ATP Challenger 175 event in Phoenix, Arizona, where he is the defending champion. The 19-year-old is entered in the Arizona Tennis Classic, which is held during the second week of the ATP Masters 1000 event in Indian Wells.

Players who exit early from the BNP Paribas Open could appear in Phoenix or at the Challenger 175 event in Cap Cana, often leading to stacked fields at both events. Former World No. 6 Hubert Hurkacz is entered in the Cap Cana Challenger.

Fonseca is joined the Phoenix field, subject to change, by six other Top 50 players. Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, the No. 30 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, is the highest-ranked player on the entry list. Corentin Moutet, Alex Michelsen, Zizou Bergs, two-time champion Nuno Borges and Adrian Mannarino are also entered.

Six Americans are entered in Phoenix, including Michelsen, Marcos Giron, Eliot Spizzirri, Reilly Opelka, Ethan Quinn and Emilio Nava.

The Cap Cana Challenger, which made its debut last March, could feature Hurkacz, 2023 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Hamad Medjedovic and defending titlist Aleksandar Kovacevic, among others. Argentine Tomas Martin Etcheverry, World No. 51, is the highest-ranked player entered in the Republica Dominicana Open, Copa Cap Cana Ciudad Destino.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","#NextGenATP Jodar sets Fritz showdown in Delray Beach","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/jodar-quinn-delray-beach-2026-tuesday","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 02:49:28 GMT","

#NextGenATP star Rafael Jodar is rising, and quickly.

The 19-year-old Spaniard cruised past 21-year-old American Ethan Quinn 6-2, 6-3 on Tuesday to reach the second round of the Delray Beach Open, setting a showdown with top seed Taylor Fritz.

One year ago, Jodar was outside the Top 900 of the PIF ATP Rankings and playing college tennis at the University of Virginia. But he is up to No. 112 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and rapidly approaching the world's Top 100.

Jodar, who competed in last year's Next Gen ATP Finals, entered the Delray Beach draw thanks to the ATP Next Gen Accelerator, which provides increased opportunities for players aged 20 and under. Now he will face a Top-10 opponent for the first time when he challenges Fritz, a finalist last week in Dallas.

To earn the opportunity, Jodar converted six of the 10 break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats. The Spaniard won 16 of his 20 second-serve return points (80%) against the 2023 NCAA singles champion.

Watch Extended Tuesday Highlights:

Fifth seed Tommy Paul needed to work hard to rally past French lefty Corentin Moutet 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Paul needed 11 match points to close out the match, letting slip 10 match points at 5-3 in the decider before successfully serving for the victory.

""I don't feel like I was feeling the ball amazing today, but I think I competed very well,"" Paul said. ""Obviously losing that game at 5-3 in the third sucked, but I had to bounce back and it's all about serving that last game out, right?

In one of the matches of the day, seventh seed Brandon Nakashima clawed past former World No. 3 Marin Cilic 7-6(4), 7-6(5) in a gruelling two hours and 13 minutes. The American leveled their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1 behind 13 aces. Neither player lost serve.

“Very pleased. It's definitely not an easy match, especially him coming off a semi-final run in Dallas. He's a very dangerous player on any given day, so I knew I had to bring my best game and definitely served really well,” Nakashima said. “Exciting time. I always love, first of all, being back in the U.S., and of course playing on the hard courts, so I'm looking forward to this stretch.”








Defending champion Miomir Kecmanovic also moved on with a 6-1, 6-4 triumph against Mattia Bellucci, while lucky loser Adam Walton eliminated big-serving Canadian Gabriel Diallo 7-6(4), 6-3.

There were two all-American clashes Tuesday in Florida. Sebastian Korda beat wild card Mackenzie McDonald 6-4, 7-5 and qualifier Zachary Svajda surged past Aleksandar Kovacevic 7-6(4), 6-3.

Elina Svitolina advanced to the round of 16 in Dubai after Paula Badosa retired with an injury. The Ukrainian recovered from a 4-1 deficit to win the first set 6-4 before the Spaniard forfeited the match. Svitolina will face Belinda Bencic next and leads their head-to-head series 3-2.

Ukraine's Elina Svitolina advanced to the third round of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships after Spain's Paula Badosa retired following the first set of their match Tuesday.

Badosa led 4-1 in the first set before seventh-seeded Svitolina won five straight games to take it. The Spaniard called for the physiotherapist after the set and then decided to retire.

The win improved Svitolina to 3-0 against Badosa in their head-to-head meetings. She also beat Badosa in the Billie Jean King Cup in 2025 and at Eastbourne in 2021.

""I was expecting Paula to play well,"" Svitolina told the media after her win. ""I was very sad that we couldn't continue after the first set but I think the level was pretty high. She was striking the ball really well. In the end, I found my way, found my game. So, it's a mixture of feelings. I hope she gets well and comes back stronger.""

Svitolina will face fellow mother Belinda Bencic in the third round Wednesday. Earlier Tuesday, ninth-seeded Bencic advanced with a walkover after her scheduled second-round opponent, Sara Bejlek, withdrew before the match because of an abdominal injury.

Both players returned to the top 10 earlier this year and made history as the first mothers to be in the top 10 of the PIF WTA Rankings at the same time.

Svitolina and Bencic have played five times on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. The Swiss won the first two meetings, including the 2019 Dubai semifinals, while Svitolina has won the last three.

""We actually practiced two days ago,"" the Ukrainian said. ""We know each other's game. We've been on tour for a couple of years together. And I think it's also very nice that we have both similar stories in the way of moms coming back, reaching the top 10. I think it's great for sport. It's going to be another big challenge for both of us. She's also a good, informed player. I have to bring my best. We're playing tomorrow, so I have a little time to recover. But I feel like it's going to be a good match.""

Lucky loser Antonia Ruzic advanced to her first WTA 1000 quarterfinal after Elena Rybakina retired due to health issues. Ruzic faces Elina Svitolina next. Svitolina overcame Belinda Bencic in a three-set match.

Lucky loser Antonia Ruzic reached the first WTA 1000 quarterfinal of her career after top seed Elena Rybakina withdrew in the third set of their third-round match at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Wednesday. She will next meet seventh seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine for a spot in the semifinals.

Ruzic took an early lead in the first set before Rybakina — who won her second Grand Slam title at the Australian Open earlier this month — rallied to win it 7-5. The Croat, ranked No. 67 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, broke early again in the second set and this time held on to win it 6-4 and force a deciding set.

What a BATTLE! 😤Antonia Ruzic digs deep against the No.1 seed Rybakina to take the second set 6-4.#DDFTennis pic.twitter.com/DmCfuioF01

After Ruzic broke Rybakina's serve in the opening game of the third set, Rybakina called for the trainer and retired from the match due to gastrointestional issues. It was Ruzic's first win over a top-20 opponent, and she matched the best result by a lucky loser at a WTA 1000 event. She beat former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu and Anastasia Zakharova, both in three sets, to reach the third round.

It was the second lucky break of the week for 23-year-old Ruzic. She lost in the first round of qualifying after holding six match points against Rebeka Masarova, but entered the main draw as a lucky loser.

""It was actually a crazy story that I got in as a lucky loser because I lost the first round of qualification,"" Ruzic told the media after her win. ""I stayed here because of the doubles because we were first alternate and then they said like sign in because maybe you would get in. Sometimes you have to take the second chances. A lot of girls had amazing runs from the lucky losers because you get a second chance so you have nothing to lose anymore. You can just show your best tennis. I'm happy with how I played today.""

In the battle of Top 10 WTA moms, Svitolina came from a set down to defeat Switzerland's Belinda Bencic 4-6, 6-1, 6-3. This was the Ukrainian's fourth win in a row over Bencic after losing their first two meetings on the tour.

""I think I missed some opportunities in the first set,"" Svitolina said after her win. ""Lost a little bit just the way that I wanted to play. I think she played well in the end of that first set. I knew what I had to execute and I was just trying to find my game again. I think my serve was working really well in the second set. In the third set, the 5-1 lead helped me to find again my good game.""

Tiafoe, laughing, asked what he was supposed to do about the rest of his shirts. The American is known for sweating heavily and going through multiple outfit changes during a match. He packed his spare shirts into a bag, sent it to his team along with the marker, and had them black out the Barclays logo on each one.According to the ATP rulebook: “If sleeveless, then two logo positions may be placed on the front, however neither shall exceed 6 sq in (3 sq cm).”It wasn't the first time a player has run afoul of logo rules before a match. Last year at Roland Garros, Hailey Baptiste was stopped because the Nike logo on her headband was too large. In that case, the fix was the same—an umpire used a black marker to cover the logo.

Bearman: 'We haven't unlocked the full potential of the car'

Grid performance branded 'fake' by Vasseur

Aston Martin have admitted they are not where they want to be following the first 2026 pre-season test in Bahrain, but there's still plenty of hope for the team's future ambitions.

""The bottom line is we are slow. We are not where we want to be.""

That was Aston Martin Team Representative Pedro de la Rosa's brutal assessment of where the British squad stand a few weeks out from the opening Australian Grand Prix on March 6-8.

There is no doubt that Aston Martin had hoped to be in a far better spot than they are right now, having turned up late to the Barcelona Shakedown and following the first three days of pre-season testing in Bahrain last week.

When speaking to the media during the first test in Bahrain, Lance Stroll cut a despondent figure admitting the team need to work on ""engine, balance, grip"" and that they look like they are ""four seconds off the top teams"". 

When his double World Champion team mate Fernando Alonso got behind the wheel, he concurred there was work to do. ""We need more performance,"" he said.

""Missing [most of] Barcelona was not ideal, this is the very first test for us, so we're still going step-by-step into the car. We are a little bit on the back foot, we have to admit that, but hopefully there is time to improve.""

So, what's going wrong? How can a team that has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on a state-of-the-art factory, a state-of-the-art wind tunnel, a works power unit for the first time in their history with Honda, a double World Champion in Alonso – who is considered one of the best in F1 – as well as one of the greatest design minds the sport has ever seen in Adrian Newey be struggling so much?

Well, it's one thing to have all of those individual advantages – and quite another to bring it all together in harmony.

The wind tunnel was only in a position to take a 2026 model in April last year, around four months after all the other teams will have had their own model in their respective tunnels. That's quite a chunk of lost time – both in terms of actual runs and thinking time to analyse the data – and thus Newey, who only started last March, has had to compress the programme into just 10 months.

In trying to push development as hard as he could within that 10-month window, it meant the team only arrived in Barcelona on the penultimate day, with Stroll getting a few laps before Alonso took over the following day. They were then already significantly behind all of their rivals in terms of total mileage heading to Bahrain.

Aston Martin are also doing several things for the first time, including making their own gearbox and suspension (they used to take those parts from Mercedes as was permitted under the regulations). Those individual projects required completely new workstreams and are huge tasks in their own right.

They are also welcoming Honda back to the sport, after the Japanese manufacturer left in 2021 – but still had people working on the existing engine with Red Bull – before deciding in 2023 to come back with Aston Martin for 2026.

While Honda have proved they can win World Championships through their partnership with Red Bull, they are playing catch up having diverted resources to other parts of the business while many of their staff either went to Red Bull or into other Honda divisions. Creating a new PU from scratch is not the work of a moment, as Honda learned when they initially came back with McLaren in 2015, but they have proved they can fight back.

Given their lack of running in Barcelona, running across three days in Bahrain was understandably a little bumpy for Aston Martin as they really started to get to grips with their new machine, which has turned heads with some very interesting design features penciled by Newey. But they still did get 206 laps on the board, which is around 3.5 race distances, so that is progress and they have something to work with heading into this week's final three-day test.

Aston Martin know they are up against it – but they also know they have the resources in place to, first, catch up and then get to where they want to. The team see this as a 10-year project to fighting for wins and titles – and they are around halfway through.

The focus is on giving Newey, who was roaming around the garage with his clipboard throughout the test, time to let his designs breathe and evolve and help the technical team work to a level that can aggressively develop a car – and get the most out of it – consistently through a season, something they have yet to show they can do.

Newey has shown he has what it takes to deliver on Aston Martin owner Lawrence Stroll's lofty ambitions – he's won championships with Williams, McLaren and Red Bull over the course of three decades so why would anyone doubt he can do the same with Aston Martin?

That's why the team remains positive that, while it might be a tough start to the year with the team in the midfield rather than up front, they will find a way to charge forward. Newey has already said the car that caused such a stir in Barcelona will look very different to the one that breaks cover in the first race in Melbourne, Australia – so that's further proof of their rapid development.

When I asked Alonso if he believes the team can catch up quickly after a slow start, he replied: ""On the chassis there is no doubt, we have the best with us. After 30 plus years of Adrian Newey dominating the sport, I think no one will doubt that we will find a way to have the best car eventually.

On the power unit, we need to wait and see when we unlock all the performance, where we are and what is missing, and then work hard.""

His team mate Stroll added: ""We are where we are. Do we want to fight for race wins? Yes. Are we fighting for race wins today? It doesn't look like it. Does that mean we can't fight for race wins in the future? No, I believe we can. I don't have a crystal ball. I didn't have a crystal ball before the season started. We are where we are here today.

""It doesn't look like it's amazing. Can that change in the next few weeks? Can it get a lot better? For sure. Will it 100% get way better? I don't know. I don't have the answers to those questions. All I can say is we are pushing as hard as we can.

""We are focused on bringing performance to the car, to the engine every single second of every single day. Time will tell how competitive we look at the first race and throughout the whole season.""

While Aston Martin know they have a steep mountain to climb, there remains plenty of hope inside the team that they have everything they need to succeed and they just need time to get everything work in unison. How much time, though, is anyone's guess.

Bearman: 'We haven't unlocked the full potential of the car'

Grid performance branded 'fake' by Vasseur

Craig Skinner has departed the Red Bull team, having first joined the squad back in 2006.

Red Bull's Chief Designer Craig Skinner has left the Formula 1 team with immediate effect, the six-time World Champions have confirmed.

Skinner joined Red Bull in 2006 and worked closely with Adrian Newey, who has since left to join Aston Martin, and Pierre Wache, who heads up Red Bull's technical division.

He played a key role in Red Bull's success when they won consecutive world titles between 2021 and 2024 with Max Verstappen.

Red Bull, under the leadership of Laurent Mekies, enjoyed a resurgence at the back end of last year following a raft of updates on the car, which in turn enabled Verstappen to win six of the last nine races and fight for the title until the season finale.

Ahead of the second pre-season test in Bahrain, it has emerged Skinner has left the team but it remains unclear what his next move will be.

Red Bull said in a statement: ""After 20 years with the team, Craig Skinner, our Chief Designer, will be leaving the Red Bull Technology team.

""Craig has been an integral part of our team and its success, and we would like to thank him for his hard work and commitment. The whole Red Bull team wishes him all the best for the future.""

Following his departure, it is believed his role will be covered internally in the interim.

Red Bull have enjoyed a strong start to their 2026 campaign, with their first-ever Formula 1 Power Unit, in partnership with Ford, running very reliably while its deployment performance has turned heads.

They will join their 10 rival teams in Bahrain once again this week for three more days of pre-season testing before everyone heads to Australia for the season-opener on March 6-8.

Bearman: 'We haven't unlocked the full potential of the car'

Grid performance branded 'fake' by Vasseur

Alpine have shared cautious optimism over their chances as F1 teams continue preparations for the sport's new era.

Alpine have created a “much better” car for the upcoming season and F1's overhauled regulations, according to Managing Director Steve Nielsen, who has also noted “big gains” with their new Mercedes power unit.

After successive top six finishes from 2021 to 2024, Alpine placed 10th and last in the 2025 Teams' Championship standings, having switched focus to the 2026 rules reset earlier than the majority of their rivals.

With Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto getting a solid number of laps on the board across the Barcelona Shakedown and the first pre-season test in Bahrain last week, the noises coming out of the Alpine camp are cautiously optimistic.

Asked to sum up how he was feeling about Alpine's programme in the Sakhir desert, Nielsen said: “Pretty confident. It's probably quite a dull answer, but we're working through the programme, trying to understand what everyone else is doing, trying to second guess what their pace is, what our pace is.

“Very new cars, a lot of new things to learn. You've probably heard a lot of people talk about energy recovery and deployment; it's a big learning curve for us, the drivers. How you use that has a huge effect on lap times on so on. So, there's a lot of new stuff to understand, and drivers are having to drive in a completely different way than they used to.

“Honestly, I'm not really sure where we stack up. I think we've made a much better car than last year – well, I know we have. But, if the race was tomorrow, where we'd line up, I don't know. I think reasonably strong midfield, but I don't know.”

Pushed on the apparent step forward with Mercedes' power unit, Nielsen smiled: “I think we're happy with our PU supplier. That's one area where we've definitely made big gains, yeah.”

Nielsen expects more answers over the competitive order to come during this week's second test at the Bahrain International Circuit, where teams are likely to chase more performance ahead of the season-opener in Australia.

“We're all doing the same, we've all got programmes,” he continued. “I don't think anybody's run low fuel yet – I think you'll probably see that [at the final test].

“We did see a long run from Ferrari, a couple of other people, and the long runs are what help build the picture, because if someone's done 20 laps, they definitely had a certain amount of fuel in at the start of it, for example. The more long runs you get, the more picture you can build.”

Alpine and the rest of the F1 field will be back in action in Bahrain on Wednesday.

Bearman: 'We haven't unlocked the full potential of the car'

Grid performance branded 'fake' by Vasseur

With the second pre-season test in Bahrain fast approaching, Ferrari's Fred Vasseur is anticipating several significant upgrades across the field.

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur is “convinced” that most teams will “bring huge upgrades” to the second pre-season test in Bahrain, with the Frenchman also setting out his expectations for how the development race could initially unfold.

Prior to the 2026 season getting underway – in which a wave of new technical regulations have been introduced – Vasseur suggested that the Scuderia would bring a “spec A” version of their challenger to the Barcelona Shakedown and pre-season testing in order to gain mileage before later focusing on performance.

With the first of two tests at the Bahrain International Circuit now complete, Ferrari completed a solid lap number of laps across the three days of action – with only McLaren and Williams holding higher lap counts – and Vasseur was left feeling positive about what the squad achieved.

Pushed on whether he felt that the “spec A” plan had worked well, the team boss responded: “Yeah, on this side I would say so far so good, that we did something like 4,500km so far.

“It went pretty well on the reliability side, and it's the best way to collect data and to try to understand what are the options and how we can improve the car step by step. We are not speaking at all about performance so far, but everybody is focused on themselves.

“We can't make any comparison, but so far it went well on our side to build up the knowledge of the car step by step. It's still a long way to go.”

After bringing new parts to the SF-26 during the opening Bahrain test, Vasseur believes that most of the field will continue to do this when the second test takes place from February 18-20.

“I'm really convinced that everybody will bring huge upgrades next week and perhaps again in Melbourne,” he explained.

“And it will be like this at the beginning of the season because the rate of development is very, very high and it makes sense to speed up the new parts and the lead time on the new parts, but I'm focused on myself.”

In terms of how happy he is with where Ferrari are currently at with their pre-season programme, Vasseur added: “You always want to do more – you always want to do more laps, but overall I think it went pretty well, that we didn't have any big issue on the reliability, that we didn't stop the car so far.

“This is good – we have a good correlation, it's positive. But it's nothing about performance – it's about the quality of work that we are doing in the development.”

As the start of the 2026 season fast approaches, Aston Martin have made changes to their trackside engineering structure.

Aston Martin have made changes to their trackside engineering team ahead of the 2026 season, with the squad expanding the structure in order to cope with the additional demands posed by the new technical regulations.

Gary Gannon is set to step up to the role of Senior Race Engineer on Lance Stroll's side of the garage, with Stephen Glass moving to the position of Race Engineer.

Andrew Vizard, meanwhile, will stay on as Race Engineer to Fernando Alonso, while Chris Cronin becomes Senior Race Engineer, a role he will hold alongside acting as Trackside Chief Engineer.

The restructuring comes as Aston Martin continue their preparations for the 2026 campaign, with the British outfit having been open about their early struggles during the Barcelona Shakedown and pre-season testing in Bahrain.

Away from the track, a crucial aspect of how a driver prepares for the season is in terms of their fitness. For Stroll, performance coach Henry Howe supports the Canadian driver when it comes to ensuring that he is functioning at his top level.

Speaking to Aston Martin's official website, Howe offered an insight into how his role fits alongside the likes of the engineers and mechanics in working with Stroll to prepare him for the upcoming campaign.

“On the medical side, I manage musculoskeletal care and recovery,"" Howe explains. ""On the fitness side, I'm keeping Lance healthy and in race trim. Because he's played sport his whole life, that's pretty easy, and it's more about me directing him towards the best stuff to do, rather than motivating him to do it.

“As a taller driver (1.84 metres), Lance has always had to be on top of his physical wellbeing to avoid giving away lap-time through weight. So it's about constantly being on top of his diet and training rather than having to manage big swings in his weight.

“If you arrive at a race weekend not fit or healthy, it's too late. Once we're at the track, my job is to create an environment where Lance can focus purely on driving.”

In terms of Stroll's pre-season regime, Howe adds: “We're constantly exploring and searching for ways we can do things better and improve. In a sport where the only constant is change, we have to keep evolving.

""We control what we can control. We refine. We research. And then we do it all again.""

Bearman: 'We haven't unlocked the full potential of the car'

Grid performance branded 'fake' by Vasseur

TWG Motorsports boss Dan Towriss has shared news on the timescale for Cadillac's own power unit.

Cadillac have shared an update on when they expect to debut their own power unit in F1, with the new team still focused on their original target of 2029 whilst acknowledging that they will “speed up” the process if there are ways to do so.

After Cadillac's entry for 2026 received its final approval in March 2025, it was confirmed one month later that GM Performance Power Units LLC. – founded by TWG Motorsports and General Motors to build powertrains for the Formula 1 team – had been officially approved as an F1 power unit supplier starting in 2029 by the FIA.

Speaking to a select group of media, including F1.com, TWG Motorsports boss Dan Towriss was quizzed ahead of the team's 2026 debut on whether this timescale for the engines was still the plan, with his response being that the hope is for Cadillac's own power unit to be up and running “as soon as possible”.

“We're really following the conversation on the [regulations] closely,” Towriss explained. “It's possible that the regulations could change before 2031, it's possible that they don't change before 2031.

“Regardless of the funding, I think it's important that we see a Cadillac power unit on the grid as soon as possible, and so that's really the main focus from my standpoint. If there are ways to speed it up, we will, but right now the focus is still 2029.”

Towriss also shared news on how work is progressing on the team's new United States headquarters in Fishers, Indiana, which will run alongside their European facility next to the Silverstone track.

“We're hoping that construction to wrap up later this year or in the first quarter of 2027, as we continue to get the building right and figure out exactly the manufacturing components that are going to be there, so we're super excited,” said Towriss.

“That's going to be a state-of-the-art facility. Right now a lot of the teams that are in that location are working out of temporary office space as we complete the design there.”

And while Cadillac's own power unit will not make an appearance just yet, the team's engines and gearboxes are being supplied by Ferrari in the meantime.

Pushed on how the American outfit have found the experience of working with the Scuderia, Towriss responded: “Ferrari's been great to work with.

“Fred [Vasseur] and his team have been really good and supportive from that standpoint, even through Barcelona [Shakedown], so we're very happy with the Ferrari relationship and how that's going.”

Both the F1 Commission and the F1 Power Unit Advisory Committee met for discussions amid pre-season testing in Bahrain.

Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, have issued a pair of updates following meetings of the F1 Commission and the F1 Power Unit Advisory Committee on Wednesday.

In the F1 Commission gathering chaired by FIA Single-Seater Director Nikolas Tombazis and F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali, refinements to the 2026 F1 regulations were agreed and will now be referred to the World Motor Sport Council for approval.

“In common with the introduction of such significant regulatory changes, there are still collective learnings to be taken from pre-season testing,” read the statement on the F1 Commission meeting.

“As a group – the teams, the power unit manufacturers, FIA and Formula One Management (FOM) – there was a commitment to work through all technical aspects ahead of the opening race of the 2026 season in Melbourne next month.

“Constructive discussion took place among all the teams following initial feedback from drivers arising from a survey instigated by the FIA. Topics covered include overall car characteristics, energy and power unit, aerodynamics, overtaking and racing, tyres and mechanical grip.

“Positive feedback from drivers was received on the reduced weight and smaller dimensions of the 2026 cars. Drivers generally agreed that the new car exhibited improved ride quality and stronger initial acceleration.

“Further evaluation and technical checks on energy management matters will be carried out over the following three days at the second pre-season test in Bahrain.

“It was agreed that no immediate major regulatory changes were required given that initial evidence and feedback remains immature and that premature change carried the risk of increased instability ahead of the first race. Further reviews will be carried out once more data becomes available.

“There were constructive talks and proposals centred on the race start procedure during the commission meeting. As a result, further evaluation of updates to race systems and on-car management will be undertaken during the current Bahrain test.”

There were also discussions around the possibility of increasing the number of Sprint events up to 12 given the demand from fans and promoters.

Alongside the F1 Commission update, there was a development from the F1 Power Unit Advisory Committee regarding the assessment of the power unit compression ratio in running conditions.

“Over recent weeks and months, the FIA and the power unit manufacturers have collaboratively developed a methodology to quantify how the compression ratio changes from ambient to operating conditions,” read the statement.

“Following validation of this approach, a proposal has been submitted whereby, from August 1, 2026, compliance with the compression ratio limit must be demonstrated not only at ambient conditions, but also at a representative operating temperature of 130°C.

“The vote has been submitted to the power unit manufacturers, and its outcome is expected within the next 10 days and will be communicated in due course.”

As with all F1 regulatory changes, and as touched on above, any amendments remain subject to final approval by the FIA World Motor Sport Council.

Ferrari topped the timesheets over McLaren at the Bahrain International Circuit on Wednesday morning.

Charles Leclerc posted the fastest lap time as pre-season testing resumed on Wednesday – the Ferrari driver leading the way from McLaren's Lando Norris and the Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli.

Leclerc worked his way down to a 1m 33.739s across the four hours of morning running at the Bahrain International Circuit, putting him three-tenths up on Norris and another tenth ahead of Antonelli.

All three will hand over to their respective team mates for the afternoon session in the Sakhir desert, with Hadjar currently the only driver scheduled to complete a full day of running aboard the Red Bull.

Haas' Esteban Ocon was the first driver out on track when the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane at 1000 local time, with sizeable aerodynamic rakes – used to record valuable data – attached to plenty of cars.

Most other teams promptly followed suit, but Sergio Perez spent the opening hour or so stuck in the garage while Cadillac worked through sensor issues – his first installation lap coming around 75 minutes into the session.

As the morning progressed and drivers began to push the limits again, Nico Hulkenberg was seen dipping two wheels into the gravel after a slide, while both Fernando Alonso and sole 2026 rookie Arvid Lindblad both had wild moments through the final corner.

Behind the top three of Leclerc, Norris and Antonelli, Williams continued their recovery from missing the Barcelona Shakedown en route to P4 with Alex Albon, while Alpine's Pierre Gasly and the aforementioned Hadjar – who lost a chunk of track time due to work being carried out on the Red Bull – completing the top six.

Seventh went to early-starter Ocon, from Aston Martin's Alonso, Audi's Hulkenberg and Racing Bulls' Lindblad, who completed the most laps of the morning by charging his way through a race distance, with Perez bringing up the rear as he gradually got some laps on the board after those sensor delays.

Drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock to run through the morning data, take a break for lunch and work towards their afternoon programmes – as touched on, 10 of the 11 teams deciding to split their days and give both racers time at the wheel.

The Los Angeles-based luxury fashion brand founded by Mike Amiri also tapped actor and musician Malcolm McRae and models Jordan Daniels and Heather Diamond Strongarm for the campaign.

	Chateau Amiri, California is open for business.


	The Los Angeles-based luxury fashion brand founded by Mike Amiri has launched a new spring-summer campaign dubbed Chateau Amiri, California and drafted actors Danny Ramirez and Michael Imperioli to check in alongside multi-hyphenate Malcolm McRae and models Jordan Daniels and Heather Diamond Strongarm. 




	They were tasked with playing “a heightened, imagined version of themselves” for photographer Hart Leshkina and director Bon Duke who captured the campaign inside the faux hotel, which was designed to pay homage “to the haunts and locales” that have shaped the modern mythology of Hollywood, per Amiri. The brand's founder, Mike Amiri, who launched the label in 2014, explained it a little further.

	“Character is the starting point for everything I create, shaped by cinema, the soul of Hollywood. Our Amiri campaigns have become spaces to explore this idea — creating immersive worlds of still and motion pictures, where our collections come to life with new context, different stories,” said Amiri. “Building on that universe we're crafting, this season we welcome you, and a cast of true stars, into the Chateau Amiri.” 


	The campaign features the models outfitted in fits from Amiri's spring-summer collection, accessorized by martinis, sunglasses, room keys, hand bags and more framed by hotel suites, lobbies and pools. See below for shots from the campaign.


	Imperioli is best known for his starring turn opposite James Gandolfini on the iconic Sopranos. More recently, he's been seen in Song Sung Blue, The Nice Guys, The White Lotus and The Many Saints of Newark. Ramirez meanwhile is best known for his work in Top Gun: Maverick, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Captain America: Brave New World and The Last of Us. He'll next be seen in Avengers: Doomsday. Rocker McRae had a role on Daisy Jones and the Six.

The 25-year-old actress, fresh off a busy 'Heated Rivalry' winter, is preparing to close out her long journey on Showtime's ‘Yellowjackets' as production for the final season begins. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	Sophie Nélisse, coming off of a busy winter with the release of Heated Rivalry, is preparing to head back into the wilderness for the fourth and final season of Showtime's Yellowjackets.


	“There's a lot of pressure coming into this season knowing it's the last one,” the 25-year-old actress told The Hollywood Reporter on a Zoom call earlier this month. It's about a week out from when Nélisse is scheduled to return to the show that has, in her words, shaped her young adult life.




Heated Rivalry and Yellowjackets seemingly have nothing in common, but the Montreal native doesn't feel like they have to. “I approach every role with a different purpose and idea of what it's going to bring me,” she explains. Heated Rivalry, she says, was a project she took because she knew it had the potential for greater meaning and real-world impact.

	In the series she plays Rose Landry, the Hollywood starlet who has a brief fling with the show's main character Shane Hollander, played by Hudson Williams. Rose becomes Shane's support system — and in one of the most heartwarming scenes of the show — she is the first person he ever comes out to.


	“What's really important in selecting a character is the creative team attached, to make sure I work with people I feel really passionate about who are there for the right reasons,” Nélisse explains.

	











	She continues, “It's really easy in this industry to fall into the machine of Hollywood and doing content just for doing content. At the end of the day, we all have to work and sometimes you don't have that luxury to be able to be so picky. I definitely want to be very intentional when selecting my characters. That's also why I've gotten into producing, because there are books I've read that have moved me so much. To have that creative power has been a really fun journey to be on.”


	Below, Nélisse breaks down her emotional Heated Rivalry scene, why the show means so much to her, what to expect from Yellowjackets season four — and why you might not see her in another horror project for a bit.


	***


What about Heated Rivalry drew you in?


	I fell deeply in love with these characters the second I read it. The first two episodes are fun. It's such a hook, and I'm such a sucker for rom-coms and that will they-won't they? I was hooked on the first episodes, but then I loved how it developed into something that felt so honest and raw and vulnerable. What I love the most is that it really gave me hope. With all the darkness and all the heaviness in the world right now, we needed a show that brought some levity, but in a way that feels achievable. Beyond that, it's not a story that I feel like I've seen on screen before, and it was really refreshing to see. It gave so much visibility to a community that doesn't have enough representation. Often when there is a queer couple, they don't make it or they get killed in the first 15 minutes of a show. To see them coming out as heroes was my takeaway.

	











What about Rose as a character?


	There's something so genuine about her, something so mesmerizing and captivating because of the way she has this self-confidence that's not obnoxious or condescending. She has that gravitas, but also knows when not to be in the spotlight. Her point in this entire story is to let Shane shine. A lot of that is through that subtle and quiet support. It was really important for us to really feel those. A lot of our scenes are a little slower, especially at the restaurant. To me, Rose is someone who everyone needs in their life.


	There's nothing as important for any human being than to have someone with whom you can be 100 percent yourself, completely stripped out of every wall and facet and still be loved unconditionally. That is so precious and very rare to find in a friendship, no matter the nature of that friendship or that relationship. Characters like Rose are one in a million that you come across. I loved how she loved him unconditionally and gave him such a safe space for him to feel like he could be his truest self.


What were your talks with creator Jacob Tierney like to tackle the restaurant scene in particular?


	We didn't talk about it that much. Hudson and I actually never rehearsed it. We ran lines, and then when we rehearsed the scene before doing the first take, we went off script because we have a very similar sense of humor, and we just started shooting [the] shit. We were messing around with the scene, and we weren't saying what was scripted because we were like, “This is a five-minute scene. We're not going to rehearse it to just do it in a second.” There's no movement. It's just us.

	











	There's something so unique about a first take because it's the most honest it gets — there's something magical because it's untouched. We both wanted to leave it at that and see just how the first take runs out. The only thing Jacob had mentioned was, “Don't be scared of the silences. Don't be scared of the awkwardness, don't be scared to make it slow.” There are a few beats after — once the show's edited, obviously you trim down — but there's not much to say.


What about your character specifically in that scene?


	I didn't want her to outshine him. She was really in the passenger seat, and sometimes it's in the eye contact and the energy of being like, “I will be here whenever you're ready to talk and open up.” There's that beautiful moment when it cuts back to his flashbacks. I remember doing ADR after we'd shot the scene once the show was about to be released, and just knives straight to my heart. It's what really gets me in that scene. Rose is not saying anything, it's just him living his emotion and all of his duality, everything that's tearing him apart. And the conflict, and you feel all of that. It's silent. Even the images are silent. It's so powerful. We really wanted the scene to be quiet and intimate. 


	On the very first take, just watching Hudson's inner monologue, you could see the battle in his eyes and it made me tear up instantly. We both were in a place of really listening to one another in the scene. It wasn't about what I was going to say next. It was about, how can I make him feel seen and understood and cared for?












What has the show's response been like for you? It seems like you all knew that you had something special, but sometimes the world doesn't always realize that right away. It hit at a great time for you guys.


	You said it so well. People love to ask that question, “Did you guys know it was going to blow up?” We knew what we were a part of was special, and we all care so deeply for the story. It was a story that needed to be told, especially in this day and age, and felt very of its time. We poured our hearts and soul into it and we knew we were in great hands with Jacob. We knew we would be very proud of the final product, but it's such a question and matter of timing and who's seen it, who's talked about it, the PR around it, the promoting of it. There are so many elements that are out of our control that I don't think any of us could have predicted how overnight the success was going to be.


	We're so grateful, honored. Before the show coming out, I remember wrapping and being like, “This is one of the best sets I've ever been on in my entire life.” Everyone was so genuine and there's no sense of competition. The chemistry that everyone has is what it was like on set. Hudson is unhinged and chaotic and hilarious, and Connor is so caring. Actually, he's so unlike his character because he's so not cold. He's the warmest, sweetest man. And Jacob, I've never seen someone direct a set that felt so effortless. He makes directing look so easy when this guy literally is showrunning, writing, doing everything. I really do believe that when the creators and everyone on set, all the way down to the crew members, are there for the right reasons, there is something that transgresses on screen.

	











I agree with you.


	There's something really magical about it, and I think the audience really felt that. I fell into this industry very randomly, but I do feel somewhat of a responsibility to be able to make somewhat of a change with my work. Cinema, TV is a great medium to be able to do that because I remember seeing characters on screen growing up that made me feel less alone because they made me feel so seen and understood. In moments that I was having the shittiest day, I would go to the movies and for an hour and a half, I would forget everything that was hard in my life. I'm getting emotional just thinking about it.


No, it's absolutely OK.


	I think of people who have been battling so many things that they've never been able to express or talk about, who feel so lonely and that there's no light for them at the end of the tunnel. Then they fall upon this show and this is their lifeline. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but especially for the gay community, I feel like there hasn't been the opportunity or chance to have this representation on screen, for some people to finally feel there's a character that they can relate to. It's helped some people come out. To know my work has brought people closer together, that it's bonded people and helped them out of really hard times, that it's changed their lives to some extent, is really all I can ask for. I've been feeling very grateful and emotional of how well the show has resonated with people.


You've been working as an actor since you were young. How do you think your outlook on the types of roles you seek has grown alongside you?












	When I started, it was all fun and games. I was not a theater kid. I've never taken any acting classes to this day. I probably should. You can always become a better version of yourself. It doesn't have any limits. I will forever be learning from my peers and can always improve. At the beginning, I had no plan or set destination or goal. I randomly fell into acting because I needed a bit of money to be able to afford gymnastics that I was doing at the time and the traveling competitions. I was just very lucky. My first movie went to the Oscars and then I booked The Book Thief, which was a big movie.


	At first, I was taking whatever came my way that was fun without any second thought or trying to curate my career. When I graduated high school and wanted to apply for college, and I didn't really know what I wanted to do, that's when I started being a bit more selective and take it a bit more seriously and putting a bit more thought into the scripts I was reading. Then I quickly booked Yellowjackets and since then, it's opened some doors, for sure, and I've been able to be a bit more selective. I just want to have a great balance. Obviously with Yellowjackets, I've been offered a lot of horror driven-[roles].


Yeah, I can imagine.


	I really don't want to pigeon-hole myself in that genre, especially because actually, horror is my least favorite genre. I think moving forward, it's about trying to create a career that feels really different with characters who are as far away from me as possible. That's what's fun, sometimes, to step out of your comfort zone, however terrifying that can be. But I really want to try comedy. I've never done comedy. I would love that because I think it looks really hard.

	











I recently interviewed an actor and we talked about how rom-coms are harder.


	I do think it's harder. In comedy, there's probably a lot of improv and trying things and it not working out. The idea of shooting an idea that comes out of my mind and it landing and everyone being like, “That's such a bad idea,” would traumatize me, but in a great way. I need to live through that embarrassment because, what is acting if not trying things? It's a classic process, but I would be really interested in doing comedy. People We Meet On Vacation is actually a role I'd really love, I think would be really fun. I'm a big rom-com gal, so I'm manifesting that for myself. I just want to try to do as many different characters as possible.


I know you're preparing to go back to Yellowjackets, correct?


	I leave in a week to go back.


Wow. Very soon. Have you seen any scripts? How are you taking in the fact that it's the last one?


	They're very secretive about what happens in this show. We literally get the scripts two weeks before shooting an episode, sometimes even a week.


Wow.


	We have no idea. People are like, “Give us spoilers.” I'm like, “I wish I could.” I have nothing myself. But I do think that obviously, there's a lot of pressure coming into this season knowing it's the last one. We all feel a lot of responsibility in offering the audience a season that will live up to the expectations that we'll close out the show, but stay true to the very first season, honoring all of the episodes at the same time. I think it'll be a really fun one. Luckily, the showrunners have had time to write it and I think are very committed to putting in their all, so it's very bittersweet.

	











	This show will have shaped my 20s. I've known these girls for almost 10 years now in the most formative years of my life. The things that I've come to learn about myself… they've made me grow so much, so it really feels weird for this to come to an end. But at the same time, so exciting to be able to try different kinds of characters. Every good show wraps at four, honestly.


Or it gets to a point where…


	Where everyone's like, “I would rather stay true to the show and not go off rails just to keep giving.” We've been excited about the rescue [of the teen survivors, including Shauna] since we started the show. The time in the wilderness has been so interesting to see how, emotionally, they navigate all of these circumstances, but I think the back to reality is going to hit all of us hard. Then being confronted by all of their demons, all of them navigating the demons they had before going into the wilderness and the things they were dealing. 


	Obviously, there were different issues to deal with out in the wilderness. [They didn't have to] deal with a lot of these things that are now all going to come back to the surface, whether that's previous relationships or their relationship with their parents. There's a lot of things that were broken before they even went out in the wilderness, so it's going to double down on them. That is going to be very interesting to see how it unfolds.


What are you going to miss the most? Like you said, the show's really shaped a lot of your adult life and it is obviously going to be a bit of a change when it is no longer there.












	There's something very fun about being so established, that we know each other so well and we really operate as a group. I'll miss that we know each other's flaws and weaknesses and strengths from working season after season together. It'll be weird whenever I shoot on another project, when you are new to some actor and you don't know how they operate or their style or technique. To be so in tune with other actors is going to feel weird to not have anymore. And the friendships, it really does feel like you go home to one big family. Working with the crew as well, there's something so familiar and comforting, especially when you're not working in your hometown, it does feel a bit like home away from home when I get to go back with the same ADs and the same crews. You've established running jokes on set and we know this from season one. That's going to be really hard to lose, I think.

In the wake of the Super Bowl halftime show, he places a record 29 titles on the chart.

Bad Bunny starts the week with a massive sweep across Billboard charts. He lands a record-breaking 29 simultaneous titles on the Hot Latin Songs chart (dated Feb. 21), as his track “DtMF” adds a 47th week at No. 1 on the multimetric ranking, while also securing the No. 1 spot on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100.


	Among his 29 titles on Hot Latin Songs is his 14-minute “Super Bowl LX Halftime Show (Live)” medley, which debuts at No. 31.


	Following his halftime performance at Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8, Bad Bunny's songs experienced a massive surge as fans flocked to his catalog. On the Hot Latin Songs chart, he lands 29 concurrent songs, surpassing Peso Pluma's previous record of 25 titles set in 2023 — when songs from his album Génesis populated the tally. The Hot Latin Songs chart blends streaming, radio airplay and sales data into its formula.

	











	Starting with “DtMF,” the song adds a 47th week at No. 1 on Hot Latin Songs, inching closer to Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's “Despacito” (featuring Justin Bieber), which holds the record with 56 weeks at No. 1 beginning in 2017. “DtMF” races at breakneck pace, with a 185% increase in streams during the week ending Feb. 12, generating 43 million official clicks in the United States, according to Luminate. That sends it to No. 1 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, his second leader there. It also jumps 4-1 on the overall Streaming Songs chart and adds a 33rd week at the summit on Latin Streaming Songs (tying José Feliciano's “Feliz Navidad” for the third-most weeks at No. 1; they trail Enrique Iglesias' “Bailando,” featuring Descemer Bueno and Gente de Zona, with 66 weeks at No. 1, and “Despacito,” with 59 weeks).




	In addition to his No. 1 with “DtMF,” Benito dominates the entire top 10, and beyond, on Hot Latin Songs. “BAILE INoLVIDABLE” holds at No. 2 for a 16th week with significant gains in streams. The previous two-week champ registered 28.8 million clicks, up 141%, during the tracking week, rebounding to No. 2 from No. 10 on Streaming Songs. Plus, it debuts at No. 18 on the overall Digital Songs Sales list with 4,000 downloads sold.


	“NUEVAYoL,” also on Benito's halftime setlist, is the Hot Latin Songs chart's biggest gainer in sales. It logged 5,000 in digital sales, up 238%, and holds at No. 3 for a ninth nonconsecutive week. That sum yields a No. 9 debut on the overall Digital Song Sales chart.


	Among the reentries, “Tití Me Preguntó” becomes the biggest winner, returning at No. 4 with 22.6 million streams and 10,000 sold.


	Plus, “Super Bowl LX Halftime Show (Live)” makes its first appearance, at No. 31 with 3 million U.S. clicks and 2,000 downloads sold.


	Here's a recap of Bad Bunny's 29 songs on Hot Latin Songs. Among them, 11 re-entries and one debut; he's the first artist to hold the entire top 25 in a single week, besting his takeover of the top 17 spots (Oct. 28, 2023):


	No. 1, “DtMF”No. 2, “BAILE INoLVIDABLE”No. 3, “NUEVAYoL”No 4, “Tití Me Preguntó” (reentry)No 5, “EoO”No 6, “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR”No 7, “La Canción,” with J Balvin (reentry)No 8, “MONACO” (reentry)No 9, “VeLDÁ,” with Omar Courtz & Dei VNo 10, “Qué Pasaría…,” with Rauw Alejandro (reentry)No 11, “DÁKITI,” with Jhay Cortez (reentry)No 12, “Me Porto Bonito,” with Chencho Corleone (reentry)No 13, “Safaera,” with Jowell & Randy & Nengo Flow (reentry)No 14, “CAFé CON RON,” with Los Pleneros de La CrestaNo 15, “WELTiTA,” with ChuwiNo 16, “LA MuDANZA”No 17, “PERFuMITO NUEVO,” with RaiNaoNo 18, “KLOuFRENS”No 19, “Yo Perreo Sola” (reentry)No 20, “Moscow Mule” (reentry)No 21, “LO QUW LE PASÓ A HAWAii”No 22, “EL CLúB”No 23, “Party,” with Rauw Alejandro (reentry)No 24, “KETU TeCRÉ”No 25, “TURiSTA”No 26, “BOKeTE”No 28, “PIToRRO DE COCO”No 29, “El Apagón” (reentry)No 31, “Super Bowl LX Halftime Show (Live)” (debut)

	











	Lastly, Benito holds the entire 25-position Latin Streaming Songs chart (a first), including nine reentries. As mentioned, “DtMF” adds a 33rd week at No. 1.


	Meanwhile, the Latin Digital Song Sales chart highlights Bad Bunny's dominance as 14 of the 15 songs on the list are his (a record), with the sole exception being Daddy Yankee's “Gasolina” at No. 9.


	All charts (dated Feb. 21, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Feb. 18 (one day later than usual due to the Presidents' Day holiday in the United States Feb. 16).

""DtMF"" rebounds for a third week atop the Global 200 and leads Global Excl. U.S. for the first time.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Bad Bunny's “DtMF” surges five spots back to No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200, adding a third frame atop the chart after it led for two weeks in January-February 2025. The track concurrently claims its first week at No. 1 on Billboard Global Excl. U.S.


	The superstar monopolizes the top five spots on the Global 200 and the top three on Global Excl. U.S. following his Super Bowl LX halftime show performance Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, Calif., with “DtMF” the closing song in the set.

	











	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.


	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.


	Here's a rundown of Bad Bunny's top five shutout on the Global 200, including the songs' worldwide totals and gains Feb. 6-12:

	













	Bad Bunny performed all five songs at the Super Bowl, with the top four from his 2025 album Debí Tirar Más Fotos; “Tití Me Preguntó” is from his 2022 LP Un Verano Sin Ti.


	“DtMF” hikes 8-1 on Global Excl. U.S. with 63.4 million streams (up 152%) and 4,000 sold (up 245%) outside the U.S. Bad Bunny's fifth and most recent Global 200 No. 1, the song becomes his fourth leader on Global Excl. U.S. Both totals mark the most among male soloists.


	“Baile Inolvidable” bounds 14-2 and “Nuevayol,” 19-3, both for new Global Excl. U.S. bests.


	Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” falls three places to No. 4 after eight weeks atop Global Excl. U.S. starting upon its debut last October and Djo's “End of Beginning” drops to No. 5 from its No. 2 peak.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated Feb. 21, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Feb. 18 (one day later than usual due to the Presidents' Day holiday in the United States Feb. 16). For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard's subscription-based service.

On the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie & Keith are talking about who could helm next year's show -- and when country could take the reins.


Bad Bunny‘s Super Bowl halftime show is still making waves more than a week later — including his song “DtMF” topping the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time — but that doesn't mean we can't start looking ahead to who might be up next for the 2027 halftime.


	On the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie & Keith are taking a closer look at the Billboard.com reader poll that went live last week asking who should headline next year's Super Bowl halftime show, Right now, BTS is leading by a landslide, with more than 85% of the vote. It would make sense for the newly reunited Korean superstars to cap their sure-to-be-active comeback year with potentially a big Grammys night — like Kendrick Lamar and Bad Bunny have done the last two years — followed by an epic performance on the Super Bowl stage. Of course, Taylor Swift is always in the Super Bowl conversation too, and we think Post Malone could be an overwhelmingly supported pick knowing how many genres he crosses.

	











	And speaking of genres, there hasn't been a country moment on the Super Bowl stage since the 1994 all-country halftime (Clint Black, Tanya Tucker, Travis Tritt and The Judds) or when Shania Twain was part of a show that also included No Doubt and Sting in 2003. Who could be the best country pick to take the massive stage?

	











	Listen to our full discussion below:


	Also on the show, for the third week in a row, we have new No. 1s on both the Billboard 200 albums chart and the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, as J. Cole's The Fall Off debuts atop the former while a Super Bowl-powered Bad Bunny gets his first solo No. 1 on the Hot 100 with “DtMF.”


The Billboard Pop Shop Podcast is your one-stop shop for all things pop on Billboard‘s weekly charts. You can always count on a lively discussion about the latest pop news, fun chart stats and stories, new music, and guest interviews with music stars and folks from the world of pop.

The Wiggles' new arrangement concludes their relationship with ABC Music, which had served as the group's record label since the outfit's formation in 1991.

	SYDNEY, Australia — The Wiggles are taking their big red car to Universal Music Group.


	The iconic Australian children's entertainers have struck a strategic global agreement with UMG, Billboard can exclusively reveal, marking a new chapter for an act, a brand, that's 35 years young.  


	Going forward, Universal Music Australia (UMA) will take the lead in amplifying the Wiggles' reach, feeding into UMG's global network and know-how on streaming, digital and physical distribution, promotion and marketing, and more.

Gil Kaufman 













	Put simply, the collaboration has a mission to introduce the Wiggles to more families worldwide through new recording projects, expanded digital content and integrated campaigns. 


	Through the arrangement, the Wiggles' recordings will be released in the United States through Republic Records: Kids & Family.


	“The Wiggles are a true cultural phenomenon and one of Australia's most iconic and enduring success stories,” comments Sean Warner, president and CEO, Universal Music Australia and New Zealand. “Their music has soundtracked childhoods for generations and continues to resonate across audiences worldwide. We're proud to be shaping the next chapter of their international journey as a trusted and much-loved Australian group.” 


	The new arrangement will be formally announced Tuesday afternoon (Feb. 17), and concludes the Wiggles' successful relationship with ABC Music, which had served as the group's record label since formation back in 1991.


	Since then, the jolly collective, know globally by their signature skivvies and upbeat songs, has accumulated 30 million album and DVDs sales, six billion YouTube views, with 10 million YouTube subscribers.


	On the awards front, the Wiggles have snagged 18 ARIAs, including induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame, and in 2011 its members were on hand to receive at Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music at the 2022 APRA Music Awards. 


	Celebrity admirers include Shaquille O'Neal, Coldplay's Chris Martin, Dolly Parton, Kevin Parker, Teddy Swims and Robert De Niro.


	“The Wiggles have built an extraordinary creative legacy in children's entertainment,” comments Andrew Kronfeld, executive VP, international and label and artist ventures, UMG. “We see strong potential to continue growing the Wiggles brand globally, while staying true to what has also made them so beloved for more than 35 years. We're thrilled to welcome them into the Universal Music family.” 


	Adds Bree Bowles, Republic Records: Kids & Family senior VP: “The Wiggles are a global cultural force whose music has shaped childhoods across generations. Their ability to connect with families around the world and their impact on children's entertainment is unmatched. We are thrilled to be working with The Wiggles as we look to amplify their magic, honor their legacy, and help write the next extraordinary chapter of their story.”


	With UMG on board for the recording side, the Wiggles' rights are brought under the one roof. Five years ago, in January 2021, Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) signed the Wiggles to the musical group's first exclusive, global publishing agreement.


	In the same year, the group expanded to an eight-member lineup. Today, the outfit includes Anthony and Lucia (Blue Wiggles), Simon and Caterina (Red Wiggles), Tsehay and Evie (Yellow Wiggles) and Lachy and John (Purple Wiggles).


	The Wiggles was established at the turn of the 1990s while the founding members were students at  Sydney's Macquarie University, enrolled in Early Childhood Education. Two of the performers had history with the 1980s pop-rock band the Cockroaches, which had a hit down under these parts with the song “She's the One.”


	“The Wiggles' mission has been about creating fun, educational and enriching music for children and families,” Anthony Field, the Wiggles' co-founder and original “Blue” Wiggle. “What makes this new partnership so special is the opportunity to take everything we do—music, storytelling, live performance—and amplify it on a truly global scale. Universal Music understands both the legacy and the future of the Wiggles, and together we're looking forward to reaching families everywhere across America and around the world in new and meaningful ways.”


	In Australia, where the Wiggles have landed No. 1 albums and, in 2022, topped the triple j Hottest 100 countdown, the act's flagship TV series Ready, Steady, Wiggle! will continue to air on ABC Kids and ABC iview. A new season is said to be premiering this year.

	Exhibitors are “apprehensive” about “placing too much stock” in Netflix‘s recent pledges to honor traditional theatrical release windows, Cinemark CEO Sean Gamble said Wednesday.


	Speaking to Wall Street analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, Gamble said theater owners have taken “some element of encouragement” from comments by Netflix management about theaters. At the same time, exhibitors remain wary of the messages due to “how contradictory they now are to many of the other disparaging remarks that have been made over recent years,” Gamble said. He noted that Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos less than a year ago described theaters as “outmoded for most people.”

	Given that history, “I think there's going to need to be more action versus comments, and firmer assurances to give everybody comfort that what's being said is real,” Gamble added.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Cinemark fell short of Wall Street earnings estimates in the October-to-December quarter, with Gamble citing a “softer-than-expected” film slate compared with the one in the 2024 period. On a diluted basis, earnings came in at 16 cents a share, down from 33 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Wall Street analysts had expected 24 cents. Revenue fell 5% from the year-ago quarter, reaching $776.3 million, ahead of Street estimates.


	After long spurning theaters, Netflix has made a show of embracing them as it looks to seal its pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery's studios-and-streaming division. Paramount, a longtime champion of theatrical releasing, has made a hostile bid for all of WBD and began a 7-day window of negotiation with WBD's board.


	Gamble was asked specifically about Netflix's recent vows to honor a 45-day window for Warner Bros releases in theaters. He called the window “a good target point” but said exhibitors are eager for more clarification.


	The stance from Netflix “begs the question of '45 days to what?'” Gamble said. He noted the difference between a film playing in theaters for 45 days before moving to PVOD or other transactional windows versus a title leaving theaters and going straight onto a subscription streamer. Those in the latter scenario are viewed as “free” by most consumers and are therefore “a different kind of construct,” Gamble added.

	











	“There's a lot still to clarify with what exactly is being referenced,” he said. “I think we're all looking for much firmer assurances that are longstanding for not only a window, but levels of continued investment, and also sustained marketing, which is a critical component of this, too, versus just verbal comments and promises.”


	Cinemark has conducted multiple tests with Netflix in recent years, giving movies like The Christmas Chronicles 2 and Army of the Dead and the last two Knives Out installments short, nationwide runs. The results have been generally inconclusive, though, and amounted to little more than marketing stunts.


	“We've been optimistic that in time Netflix would recognize the opportunity that theatrical exhibition provides their platform,” Gamble said, noting that Amazon and “even Apple” seem to recognize the upside. “We thought for a long while there's just value that was being ignored by not taking advantage of that opportunity.”


	As Netflix and Paramount jockey, the situation is “active and fluid,” Gamble said. Individually and via trade group Cinema United, Cinemark has tried to stay in close contact with the companies involved as well as regulators, the exec said, in pursuit of an outcome of “sustained exclusive theatrical windows.” 


	Exhibitors “just want to make sure that things continue to progress that way versus any type of risk that might ensue from the consolidation of a significant studio like Warner Bros,” he said. The studio “has been a strong partner of theatrical exhibition for many, many years and just had a record-breaking performance in 2025.”

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	The attention surrounding James Talarico‘s Late Show with Stephen Colbert interview has been very good for the Texas Democrat's campaign for U.S. Senate.


	He raised $2.5 million in the 24 hours after the segment was shifted from CBS broadcast to YouTube, his largest single fundraising period for the campaign.


	On Monday, Colbert said that he was prohibited from featuring Talarico on his late-night show, as the FCC has issued new guidance about the appearance of political candidates on talk shows. 


	Instead, Colbert said that the interview would be posted on YouTube. There, the interview has drawn almost 5.2 million views, greatly exceeding the show's average broadcast audience.

	Talarico said in a statement that the incident was “the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top. A threat to one of our First Amendment rights is a threat to all of our First Amendment rights.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	CBS was not banned from airing the interview. But had it aired on CBS broadcast, the network's affiliates in Texas may have been on the hook to provide equal time to Talarico's rivals in the Democratic primary, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) and Ahmad Hassan. 


	Previously, late night and daytime talk shows have assumed that they are exempt from the Equal Time Rule, given the newsworthy nature of many of their interviews and previous FCC decisions. But Donald Trump has lashed out at Colbert and other late-night hosts, and his FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, issued new guidance last month warning talk programs that they may not be exempt and be obligated to provide airtime to all candidates who request it in a coming election.

	











	In the controversy that followed Colbert's Monday show, CBS issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the host “was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico. The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.”


	But Colbert on his Tuesday show that CBS lawyers had reviewed his script where he said that he was blocked from airing the interview.


	Talarico will be in Los Angeles on Thursday for a fundraiser for his campaign.

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


Netflix “will not stand by and watch ByteDance treat our valued IP as free, public domain clip art,” the streamer told the TikTok owner in a short and stern cease-and-desist letter over Seedance 2.0 sent Tuesday night. Netflix wants AI-generated videos of the likes of its Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters, Squid Game and Bridgerton shut down now.


	With its two-page correspondence (read it here) and potential legal action to follow, Netflix has linked arms and attorney arsenals with Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount (its rival to buy WBD), and Disney to stop the user-created content that has been bastardizing their top shows, films and other moneymakers. While Amazon, Apple, Sony and Comcast-owned Universal have yet to join the party, it is clear now with the Ted Sarandos– and Greg Peters-led Netflix in the C&D house, this is serious stuff.

	“Current forensic evidence indicates that Seedance is being used to generate unauthorized derivative works including, but not limited to: 


	● Bridgerton: Unauthorized depictions of Season 4 content, specifically featuring characters in a masquerade ball setting. These outputs mirror specific, narratively important costumes like Sophie Baek's “Lady in Silver” gown. ByteDance has even promoted this content using #Bridgerton tags via its own official social media channels, such as @BytePlusGlobal.

	











	● Stranger Things: High-fidelity reboots of the series finale, which feature detailed reproductions of the iconic cast as well as the monsters from the series, including Demogorgons and the Mindflayer.


	● Squid Game: Seedance has generated re-creations of the “Red Light, Green Light” sets and the iconic Young-hee doll. These include unauthorized crossovers, such as inserting real-world figures like Elon Musk into the Squid Game environment.


	● KPop Demon Hunters: Seedance has reproduced the specific visual style and character designs from our animated musical feature, including the lead character Rumi.”


	The letter adds: “Netflix has never authorized ByteDance to use our content to generate these images or videos. ByteDance's activities are willful, and constitute direct and secondary copyright infringement. The use of copyrighted works to create a competing commercial product, especially one that regurgitates the original, is not protected by fair use.”


	Unlike Disney, Paramount and WBD, Netflix is in full FAFO-mode here and gives the Chinese tech company three days to set things straight. This comes one day after ByteDance swore it is “taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users.” 


	Netflix isn't buying it. 


	“To avoid immediate litigation, Netflix demands that ByteDance: 


	1. Cease Generative Output: Immediately implement technological guardrails to prevent Seedance from generating any content that resembles Netflix's protected characters, titles, or settings. 


	2. Remove Infringing Content: Remove all unlawfully obtained Netflix-owned content from training datasets, and also scrub all existing Seedance-generated videos featuring Netflix IP from all ByteDance-controlled platforms. 


	3. Identify All Infringements: Provide an accounting of all instances where Seedance has generated content based on prompts related to Netflix's IP. 


	4. Revoke Third-Party Access: Revoke access for any commercial partners or API users currently utilizing Seedance to generate unauthorized Netflix derivative works.”


	So, as Netflix awaits ByteDance's response later this week, will it be Amazon, Apple, Sony or Universal sending the next letter? Stay tuned.

	“Free Me,” Shia LaBeouf posted in the early hours of this morning after reports emerged of his arrest. 


	The Transformers star was making his first remarks after being arrested yesterday at a Mardi Gras event at which he reportedly struck two men. He had been spending time partying in New Orleans over the past couple of days.


	Having been arrested then treated for his injuries, before reportedly returning to a Mardi Gras party, LaBeouf posted “free me” to his 454,000 X followers in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

	A New Orleans Police Department statement to press confirmed LaBeouf's arrest. “A man identified as 39-year-old Shia LaBeouf was reportedly causing a disturbance and becoming increasing[ly] aggressive at a Royal Street business,” said the department. “Once removed from the building, the victim reported being struck by LaBeouf, who used his closed fists on the victim several times.”


	LaBeouf was arrested and faces two charges of simple battery, with his next hearing scheduled for March 19, The Guardian reported. According to The Daily Mail, LaBeouf was seen returning to Mardi Gras celebrations after he left the hospital.


	LaBeouf's credits include Transformers, Disturbia and American Honey. The former child star is a controversial figure. He was previously sued by ex-girlfriend FKA Twigs for sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress, which was later settled. We have reached out to his reps for comment on his arrest.

Addison Rae's father, Monty Lopez, was arrested last year after being accused of exposing himself in public. 

According to documents obtained by Page Six on Tuesday, the social media star's father — whose given name is Manolito Juan Lopez — was arrested on July 27, 2025 in Louisiana, following an alleged incident on August 31, 2024.

Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office accused Lopez, 50, of “intentionally” exposing “his genitals, pubic hair, in a public place or place open to public view, or in any prison or jail, with the intent of arousing sexual desire or which appealed to the prurient interest or was patently offensive,” per docs from the department.

Lopez's bond was listed at $2,500. At an arraignment on Sept. 2, 2025, he entered a plea of not guilty to the charges, listed as both an obscenity — felony and a sex crime.

He's scheduled next to appear at a hearing on March 19. TMZ was the first to report the news. 

Lopez did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment on Tuesday evening, nor did a rep for Rae.

The news comes just weeks after Rae, 25, was nominated as best Best New Artist at the 2026 Grammy Awards — though the award ultimately went to Olivia Dean.

The “Obsessed” songstress was born to Lopez and ex-wife Sheri Easterling — along with her brothers Enzo, 17, and Lucas, 12. The former couple married in 2004 and parted ways a few years later, only to remarry in 2017.

Lopez, who also shares daughter Macye with a previous partner, split from Easterling again in 2022.

A then-25-year-old woman named Renée Ash accused Lopez that same year of lying about the marriage to Easterling and claimed he “misled” her into a five month long affair.

“Personal matters being brought public are always challenging and overwhelming for anyone involved,”  Easterling wrote via social media at the time. “I will be OK.”

“My biggest concern is -and always will be- my children and their fragile hearts and minds. I will always do my best to protect them,” she added. 

Ash and Lopez reunited in November 2022, with Lopez exclusively telling Page Six at the time that his divorce from Easterling had been finalized months earlier.

“What I can do from here on out, I can move forward,” Lopez told us.

Easterling was briefly linked to Yung Gravy, while Lopez went on to marry medical professional Kaitlyn Nicole Robins said at the Little Chapel of Hearts in Las Vegas in October. 

“I just followed my heart and I've never been happier. I love this woman!” he told TMZ at the time.

Kunal Nayyar of “Big Bang Theory” has been quietly paying medical bills for random families in need. 

“Money has given me greater freedom and the greatest gift is the ability to give back, to change people's lives,” Nayyar said in a December 2025 interview with the iPaper, which has been going viral on X.

“We also support animal charities because we love dogs,” he added of himself and his wife, Neha Kapur. “But what I really love to do is go on GoFundMe at night and just pay random families' medical bills. That's my masked vigilante thing! So, no, money doesn't feel like a burden. It feels like a grace from the universe.”

Nayyar explained that his fortune does not “weigh heavy” on him, as he's able to donate to worthy causes anonymously.

According to Fortune magazine, the actor — who played Raj Koothrappali on the beloved series during its entire 12-season run, from 2007 to 2019 — boasts a net worth of $45 million.

In the December interview, the actor explained that he believes more happiness would come from more generosity. 

“Right now people are not happy, because we are all expecting someone else to be kind,” he told the outlet. “We are expecting a president or a politician, some leader, to come and bring us world peace.”

He added that there is “no world peace if your neighbor comes to your door wanting some sugar for their tea, and you lock it against them and say ‘get away.'” 

He also asserted that “no one is going to come and change the world for you. You have to do it for yourself.”

The resurfaced interview caught the attention of social media users following the massive success of a fundraiser for the family of the late James Van Der Beek, which has pulled in over $2.6 million since the actor's Feb. 11 death.

The “Dawson's Creek” star's wife Kimberly and their six kids found themselves “out of funds” after costly cancer treatments left them “facing an uncertain future” following his death, according to the GoFundMe page. 

Though Realtor.com later reported that the “Varsity Blues” star had purchased his rented Texas estate a month prior to his death, a rep explained to Page Six that he'd done so with the help of friends. 

“James secured down payment for the Texas ranch for the family with the help of friends through a trust so they could shift from rent to mortgage,” they told us. 

Van Der Beek's fundraising effort was defended by celebrities including Donna Vivino, many of whom noted the high cost of medical care in social media comments.

Tom Noonan, the actor best known for his roles in “RoboCop 2” and “Last Action Hero,” has died at 74.

Karen Sillas, Noonan's “What Happened Was” co-star, announced the devastating news on Wednesday, according to the Daily Mail. She confirmed that the late actor “passed peacefully” on Saturday. 

No cause of death has been revealed.

“My dear friend and co-star, Tom Noonan passed peacefully on Valentine's Day 2026,” Sillas began her touching Instagram announcement.

“Working with him in his original off-Broadway play, ‘What Happened Was…,' at the Paradise Factory Theatre in the early nineties, was a turning point for me and my career that still resonates throughout my life and work as an actor,” she added.

Sillas, 62, called her and Noonan's 1994 film adaptation of “What Happened Was” one of the “most iconic indies in American cinema” before paying tribute to her late co-star and his legacy.

“What a privilege and crazy fun it was working with this man and calling him my friend to the end … may his Legacy continue to shine on,” she concluded.

Born in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1951, Noonan started in theater and appeared in the original off-Broadway production of Sam Shepard's famous play “Buried Child” in 1978.

But it wasn't until 1980 when the beloved actor made his big-screen debut in the comedy-drama “Willie & Phil,” followed by “Gloria” and “Heaven's Gate” that same year.

Noonan's breakout role was in 1986, when he starred as the main antagonist, Francis Dolarhyde, opposite William Petersen's FBI Agent Will Graham in the edge-of-your-seat crime thriller “Manhunter.”

Noonan then starred as Frankenstein's monster in Fred Dekker's horror-comedy “The Monster Squad” one year later.

Dekker, in his own tribute to Noonan, remembered the late actor as “a highlight of my modest filmography.”

“He was the proverbial gentleman and scholar, and the world has lost a great talent,” the director wrote on Facebook. “R.I.P. Tom. Thanks for the great work.”

After solidifying his role as what one fan described as the “perfect bad guy” in “Manhunter” and “The Monster Squad,” Noonan was picked to play Cain in Irvin Kershner's “RoboCop 2” in 1990.

The science-fiction action film, which followed the 1987 original, saw Peter Weller return as the titular RoboCop. Noonan, meanwhile, played both the leader of the Nuke drug cartel and, later in the movie, RoboCop 2.

Three years later, the actor-turned-director starred as another antagonist, Ripper, opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger's Detective Jack Slater in 1993's “Last Action Hero.”

Advertisement

Following his directorial debut with “What Happened Was” in 1994, Noonan continued to appear in small roles on the big screen, including “Heat” (1995), “Eight Legged Freaks” (2002), “Synecdoche, New York” (2008) and “The House of the Devil” (2009).

Noonan's final film was the Todd Haynes-directed mystery drama “Wonderstruck” in 2017.

As for TV, Noonan also had an impressive and lengthy career that included small appearances in “The X-Files,” “CSI” and “Law & Order.” He also had roles in “The Blacklist” and “12 Monkeys.”

His final TV role was as a voice actor in the animated series “Animals” in 2018.

“Writing something is more of interest to me, because I do love doing it and I feel like I've learned how to do it enough that it's not a waste,” Noonan said in 2021 during one of his final interviews.

“It's a skill I was sort of blessed with. I would like to make movies,” he added at the time. “The acting thing, I don't know.”

Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of Crime 101.

Crime 101 has all the necessary components of a Heat clone. Born in the Michael Mann mold, writer-director Bart Layton's sprawling Los Angeles crime drama draws parallels between cops and robbers in a setting defined by extremes. Crime 101‘s crosstown trek shows a feckless ruling class that keeps amassing power, while middle-class have-nots struggle to make ends meet within and without the confines of the law. In this world free of principles, a cop finds hope in a crook with a code. 

Layton is hardly the first filmmaker attracted to the steady propulsion of Mann's beat. In 2018, writer-director Christian Gudegast found similar gold in his grimy L.A. thriller Den Of Thieves, a version of Mann's L.A. takedown that cranks up the machismo in its depiction of a lawless Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the jarhead bank robbers they infiltrate. Yet for all the superficial pleasures these movies find in Heat‘s icy cool action, they stumble just before the credits roll. While Heat ends on a moment of human connection found in violence and the unsettling catharsis it contains, its offspring—like Crime 101—want audiences to go home happy, undercutting the complexity in service of a smile.

Thanks to its weekly timeslot on TNT and Christopher Nolan's cape-based take, The Dark Knight, Heat has grown in esteem since its 1995 debut. Though a sleeper hit at the time, best known for the long-awaited screen meeting of The Godfather Part II stars Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Mann's three-hour crime saga has become the thinking person's '90s action movie. Well aware of Heat‘s long tail to profitability, Mann-inspired action is one of the few sequel-free avenues that Hollywood continues to explore. No wonder then, in his pursuit of thoughtful action (which includes a Mann film of his own), Chris Hemsworth brings the steely precision of his Blackhat character to Crime 101‘s tight-lipped, well-dressed, and obsessive-compulsive main character, James. Like De Niro's Neil McCauley, James prefers caution to chaos, carefully planning his crimes so there's little room for error. When a well-planned stickup goes sideways, he becomes rattled by his lack of control. The Vincent Hanna (Pacino) to Hemsworth's James McCauley is Mark Ruffalo, playing Detective Lou Lubesnick. Together they form the yin and yang of the film's L.A., two sides hoping to find peace on the 101 while lamenting a distinct lack of honor in their respective fields.

Crime 101 turns Heat‘s characters into archetypes so similar that lines from one film could describe characters in the other. In Heat‘s famed diner scene, Hanna describes his life as “a disaster zone […] I got a wife, we're passing each other on the down-slope of a marriage…because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.” McCauley's response could describe James' philosophy: “Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.” The movie tracks their personal relationships as they attempt to build a life inside lifestyles that don't allow for one. Just like the guy in Heat whose best pickup line is describing “a book about metals,” James attempts to date the first woman who talks to him, Maya (Monica Barbaro). Taking the spot of Ashley Judd is Crime 101‘s Sharon (Halle Berry), an insurance adjuster caught between both sides of the law. Other character stand-ins emerge throughout the plot, such as Nick Nolte as fence Money, who operates in the mold of Heat‘s fence Nate (Jon Voight), and Barry Keoghan, who menaces the picture as the unpredictable Waingro (Kevin Gage) figure. Keoghan even gets a suitably weird name: Ormon.

In moving Crime 101 from San Diego, the location of Don Winslow's original novella, to Heat‘s L.A, Layton's film begins to draw unfavorable comparisons. Rather than watching economic classes clash in a series of short stories about ex-cons trying to go straight—stories that give Heat its depth—this conflict now occurs on the city's great equalizer: crosstown traffic. Layton uses shorthand for the Heat‘s deeper themes without having to show the people living through those realities. It flattens the experience of L.A. crime, making it exclusive to the characters in the film. Heat‘s mastery is in its sprawl, not its concision, creating a film that echoes the city it moves through.

But the ending is really where these Heat clones falter. At the end of Heat, Neal McCauley breaks his rule to “walk out in 30 seconds” flat, so that he can exact revenge on Waingro for botching the opening heist. This allows Hanna to catch up to his perp, eventually killing him in a runway shootout. As McCauley dies, Hanna holds his hand. It's a tragedy: Two men caught in careers that will be the end of them, with the survivor recognizing that this criminal is the only one who truly understands him.

Neither Den Of Thieves nor Crime 101 shoots for such an operatic conclusion. In both cases, it's not the second lead, but the wild-card villain who is vanquished, allowing the heroes and antiheroes to fight another day. In Den, Big Nick (Gerard Butler) kills heist honcho Merriman (Pablo Schreiber), allowing Donnie (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) to make an exit that sets up a sequel. Similarly, Crime 101 concludes with a Mexican standoff that sees James killing Ormon to save Lou. Lou returns the favor by allowing James, the perp he's been chasing the whole movie, to go free, choosing to lay the blame on Ormon, a suspect who won't screw up his boss' all-important clearance rates. All's well that ends well.

Like Den Of Thieves, Crime 101 leaves its characters in a better position than when they started. James and Lou have new lives to pursue, and plenty of money with which to do it. The adventure has made them better people, ones who aren't so rigid in their rules—a particularly bizarre conclusion for Lou, a principled cop who once believed that getting the right guy was more important than hitting the right numbers. Crime 101‘s ending is a copout, implying that the L.A. way is to not sweat the small stuff, like a cop planting evidence or laying a crime on the wrong man. Everyone gets their crowdpleasing moment. Crime 101 is Hollywood, but Heat is pure L.A., impossible to navigate without getting your hands dirty.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Frederick Wiseman understood the subtle architecture of humanity","https://www.avclub.com/frederick-wiseman-documentaries-systems-humanity","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:17:54 GMT","

We meet many people in Frederick Wiseman's films. The crass American diner sticking his face into a plate of haute cuisine and taking a big whiff in Menus-Plaisirs, Les Troisgros. The migrant worker telling a harrowing story about her daughter's journey on foot to America in In Jackson Heights. The Black security guard slowly losing his patience with the racist ranting of an elderly white man in Welfare. The former schoolteacher, naked and shivering, shoved into a bare cell in Titicut Follies. And yet, none of Wiseman's documentaries are really about these individuals.

The Thin Blue Line director and fellow documentary legend Errol Morris used an entomological metaphor to describe Wiseman's work, writing in 2011 that he “has poked his camera into some truly nasty termite pile[s] and watche[d] with bemused satisfaction as the termites scurry around carrying odd parcels and such.” Where many documentarians would zoom in to focus on one particularly industrious (or lazy) insect, Wiseman could see the whole colony. 

His films are about people in general, their follies and worries and the things they do to get through the day. He loved to film closeups of faces, cutting between the individuals in a crowd as they reacted to a speech or a performance or a long-winded lecture from a teacher or a supervisor or a judge. But why, his films ask, do they carry these specific burdens, and why do they cope with them in the ways that they do? That's where the systems come in. 

It was not some sick fetish for bureaucracy that drove Wiseman's interest in the workings of institutions both seemingly frivolous (he documented the rarified worlds of both modeling and ballet, although he always found meaning in them in the end) and unbearably heavy (1989's Near Death is particularly sobering). Rather, he wanted to understand how the systems we live in shape human behavior, influencing the way we think and feel about the world. Heartbreaking moments are interspersed with silly ones—Wiseman loved a singing telegram—forming complete portraits of humanity in miniature.

Wiseman's 1975 masterpiece Welfare is a prime example. Early in this sprawling (yet relatively compact, compared to his later work) documentary, the employees at the New York City welfare office profiled in the film seem callous and unfeeling, denying desperate people emergency assistance on minor technicalities. But as Welfare wears on and the sheer scale of the poverty on display—not to mention the brokenness of the system supposed to address it—becomes apparent, it also becomes clear that the office workers are not sadists who revel in the suffering of others. They simply have no incentive to alleviate it. 

Although it's subtle, the editing in that film reveals Wiseman's personal feelings about the welfare system. In his later years, the filmmaker dismissed the more obvious commentary found in his early work as “heavy-handed.” But although he doubled down on his strict verité style over the subsequent decades—Frederick Wiseman documentaries have no interviews, no archival footage, and no narration—the very act of choosing what to include, what to condense, and what to leave out of his documentaries was itself an elegant form a storytelling. He was a master of the wraparound structure, and even when his subjects are tedious, his films are fascinating.

Famously uncompromising and independent, Wiseman refused to alter either the reality of the situations he was filming—in 2005, he admitted to Werner Herzog that he might illuminate a room if it was too dark, but that was about it—or the resulting work. His debut Titicut Follies was banned in Massachusetts from 1967 to 1991, and one of his films, 2004's The Garden, was shelved due to copyright issues. (Madison Square Garden sued; he countersued; the film remains unreleased.) For decades, the only way to see one of Frederick Wiseman's movies outside of its initial run was to write a letter to the director's own Zipporah Films, which would decide whether it would lend out one of the 16mm prints in its possession for an officially sanctioned screening. In 2007, he began selling individual titles on DVD through the Zipporah Films website. In 2018, Zipporah made a deal to make Wiseman's films accessible through the library-based streaming service Kanopy, but it took until 2023 to digitize all 45 of them.

Why was a filmmaker who was equally interested in the highest and lowest echelons of society so resistant for so long to making his work more widely accessible? The answer may lie in the work. Watch a couple of Frederick Wiseman documentaries, and it becomes obvious that no one understood the ways that individual people work within systems, and how those systems flatten and dehumanize them in turn, better than he did. Perhaps he was afraid of what might happen, to him and to his work, if he entered more deeply into his nearest system: the film industry. After all, he was only one man.

It was only a matter of time before the siren song of '00s nostalgia beckoned Miley Cyrus back to her teen-idol roots. Now, with the clarity of hindsight and a decade removed from her “I'm not a kid anymore” provocations, Cyrus is ready to face her early blonde ambition as the high school superstar once again. Announced earlier today, Cyrus is returning to Disney for the Hannah Montana 20th Anniversary Special. 

The special is neither a reunion episode of the series nor a revival season, dang flabbit. Shot in front of a live studio audience, the special will feature an “exclusive, in-depth interview” with Miley Cyrus by Call Me Daddy's Alex Cooper. But wait, there's more. The special will also feature never-before-seen archival footage and recreations of Hannah Montana's sets, including her closet and the family living room. Watch as Cyrus revisits the music, moments, and memories that launched the daughter of the “Achey Break Heart” guy to superstardom. It seems like the special will mostly feature Cyrus waxing nostalgic about her early career, as the Disney press release doesn't explicitly say Cyrus will perform any songs from the series. Until we hear otherwise, we'll go ahead and assume she'll be singing “Dream As One,” the hit song from Avatar: Fire And Ash. 

“Hannah Montana will always be a part of who I am,” Cyrus said in a statement. “What started as a TV show became a shared experience that shaped my life and the lives of so many fans, and I'll always be thankful for that connection. The fact that it still means so much to people all these years later is something I'm very proud of. This ‘Hannahversary' is my way of celebrating and thanking the fans who've stood by me for 20 years.”

The Hannah Montana 20th Anniversary Special premieres on March 24 on Disney+.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Relax, CBS says it wasn't blocking Colbert's guest; it was merely offering ""legal guidance""","https://www.avclub.com/cbs-denies-blocking-stephen-colbert-guest","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 01:04:00 GMT","

The gulf between Stephen Colbert and CBS continued to widen last night, as Colbert claimed on The Late Show that the network's lawyers told him he could not broadcast an interview with Texas State Rep. James Talarico because of the FCC's equal-time rule, which typically exempts talk shows. “I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I couldn't mention me not having him on,” Colbert said. In a statement, the network denies the allegations, saying it was merely offering Colbert some helpful legal advice. 

“The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,” a statement from CBS said. “The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”

Talk shows have been exempt from the FCC's equal time rule since 2006, when Jay Leno hosted California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on The Tonight Show. That seemingly came to an end in January, when FCC Chair Brendan Carr reiterated his commitment to going after talk shows that criticize Trump because there aren't enough cranks on TV ranting about vaccines, trans people, and immigration. At the time, Carr said lawmakers “were worried that TV programmers would broadly take advantage of trying to claim they were bona fide news when they weren't. But if you're fake news, you're not going to qualify for the bona fide news exemption.” Carr has not yet officially invalidated the exception. Still, nevertheless, Colbert claims CBS is “unilaterally enforcing it as if he had.”

The only Democratic FCC commissioner, Anna Gomez, agreed, calling it “another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this Administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech.” 

“The FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes or to create a climate that chills free expression,” Gomez continued in a statement. “CBS is fully protected under the First Amendment to determine what interviews it airs, which makes its decision to yield to political pressure all the more disappointing.” 

Paramount Skydance has torpedoed its credibility in recent months, first by publicly firing Colbert and then by hiring every billionaire's favorite blogger, Bari Weiss, as the head of CBS News, while also paying Trump $16 million to settle a weak lawsuit against 60 Minutes amid the Paramount-Skydance merger. The FCC has also tanked its authority as an unbiased institution in the last year, with Carr attempting to silence television's loudest Trump critics by using the various mechanisms at his disposal, including strong-arming local carriers who need FCC approval for another monopolistic merger. We expect these types of flame-ups to continue until Colbert is booted from the airwaves this May.

One of the most common ways people talk about games is the “X meets Y” pitch. It's a pretty self explanatory way of selling a game to the right audience. Let's use Love Eternal, from developer brlka and publisher Ysbryd Games, to demonstrate how it works. Someone might (and did) write that it is “Celeste meets Silent Hill” or even “Gris but grimdark.” Both are extremely evocative. They might even get enough players in the door. But what lies on the other side? In Love Eternal‘s case, not much.

In the spirit of the elevator pitch, let's start with the “X” factor of Love Eternal. It is, mechanically, a puzzle platformer that owes much to Celeste and VVVVVV. The name of the game is difficult rooms meant to challenge the player's ability to comprehend complex level design and execute pixel-perfect platforming. There are good bones here, with two aspects of gameplay that Love Eternal introduces and then uses as the foundation of every level, even as difficulty ramps up. First, you have the ability to flip gravity. This can only be done once before resetting upon touching the ground. Second, orbs scattered throughout levels will reset your gravity ability when broken, even in the air. Every level, therefore, is about finding a path through the obstacles laid out based on the right manipulation of gravity via platforms and orbs.

﻿﻿

In theory this is a simple but fantastic set up for challenging puzzle-platforming, and for a little while it feels like Love Eternal might live up to its influences. A major drawback quickly becomes apparent, though. Puzzle-platformers rely on precise inputs and the ability for the player to trust that a button press will do what is expected. Love Eternal fails this test. Controls feel both floaty and too heavy in different instances, while movement itself often lacks the necessary precision. Properly predicting the inertia when flipping the direction of gravity mid-movement is especially imprecise. It means that even early challenges can elicit frustration and test your patience. Failure is an essential part of a puzzle-platformer; successful ones make the player understand why they fail, while unsuccessful ones give the player reason to believe the game itself is in the wrong. Love Eternal too often does the latter. To make matters worse, there isn't a gradual climb to more compelling puzzles; the game's many rooms quickly hit a plateau in challenge that only really rises at the game's final half hour or so. 

Of course, the “X” is only half the story here, so let's talk about the “Y.” Love Eternal is a psychological horror game. You play as Maya, a young girl who finds herself trapped in a castle. There is another being here as well, a prisoner or warden (or perhaps both) that has set its sights on Maya. Periodically Love Eternal delves into this story and Maya's family issues through short cutscenes. The mechanically difficult and frustrating platforming has the potential to mirror the narrative horror that Love Eternal goes for, but again there is a problem in execution. Psychological horror can, sometimes, be more of an atmosphere and vibe than an actual coherent narrative; so it goes with Love Eternal.



This is perhaps, like the mechanical plateau, a result of Love Eternal‘s inability to pace itself properly within the short playtime. For too long Maya is left in the horror stage of being confused and terrified by her surroundings, meaning we have little time to actually be told what is happening. The failing of the “Y” is Love Eternal‘s inability to effectively communicate why any of this matters. Yes, the broad strokes are there, but even when its themes are easy to pick out it all feels so shallow. 

This might also be a result of Love Eternal‘s confounding decision to change up the form of the game. About two-thirds of the way through puzzle-platforming makes way for a point-n-click segment that goes on far too long. It almost seems like Love Eternal itself realizes that the player hasn't actually learned enough and uses this opportunity as a way to dump text on them to make up for lost time. And while changing form can work, in this case (as feels true of much of Love Eternal) the decision almost feels like it is weirdness for weirdness's sake.

The biggest challenge in talking about Love Eternal is in trying to make sense of its failings. It isn't awful, but worse: it's just boring. It doesn't offer much to chew on in terms of mechanics or story. At its best there's a sense that Love Eternal has something it desperately wants to say, but it grasps at straws to say it and perpetually comes up short. So what else is there to say about a game as shallow as Love Eternal? Only that it's like Celeste meets Silent Hill—Gris, but grimdark.

Love Eternal was developed by brkla and published by Ysbryd Games. Our review is based on the PC version. It's also available for PlayStation 5 and 4, Switch, and Xbox One.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos discussed the latest in the Nancy Guthrie disappearance case with reporter Brian Entin on Tuesday, February 17. 

The Sheriff explained that investigators “still don't have the video from Nancy's other cameras.”

It has been more than a week since investigators released footage obtained from Guthrie's doorbell camera showing a masked, armed man tampering with her security camera. 

“Over the last eight days, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Department have been working closely with our private sector partners to continue to recover any images and video footage from Nancy Guthrie's home that may have been lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors, including the removal of recording devices,” Nanos explained on February 10. 

“Working with our partners—as of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance,” he added. 

Nanos previously revealed in a press conference that Guthrie did not have a subscription service connected to her camera system, which would have allowed the footage to be saved and recorded.

Now, while speaking to Entin, Nanos explained, “It's in the hands of Google now.”

As the investigation continues into its third week, the search for Guthrie continues. However, little is known about the alleged suspect or suspects connected to her kidnapping. 

Based on the footage from Guthrie's front porch, FBI released a description of the suspect. 

“The suspect is described as a male, approximately 5'9” – 5'10” tall, with an average build. In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack' backpack,” the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Phoenix Division shared on February 12. 

That same day, the agency doubled its reward from $50,000 to $100,000 “for information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.”

As of Monday, February 16, the entire Guthrie family, including Nancy's children, Savannah Guthrie, Annie Guthrie and Camron Guthrie, as well as their spouses, have been ruled out as potential suspects, Nanos revealed. 

“Not one single person in the family is a suspect,” Nanos later told Tucson's KOLD. “So I am telling everyone, effective today, you guys [media] need to knock it off, quit. People are hurting. They are victims. I am saying they are clear. We have cleared them.”

On the camera showing the person trying to cover it – why do the eyebrows seem to possibly look like those of a female ?  Continued prayers for the Guthrie family and especially for Nancy that she be returned safely.

“Back to the Future” actor Christopher Lloyd shared a heartfelt Instagram photo on Feb. 14 with his wife, Lisa Loiacono, praising their relationship.

The veteran star posted the image to Instagram in a Valentine's Day tribute. It shows him smiling alongside his wife, Lisa Loiacono, in a relaxed and affectionate moment. Lloyd had his arms wrapped around his partner, while they both smiled at the camera. 

He captioned the photo with a simple but powerful message: “It's the sweetest love. My Valentine.”

The post immediately resonated with fans, many of whom praised the warmth of the image and the sincerity of the caption. At 87, Lloyd has largely kept his personal life private despite decades in the spotlight, making the social media update a rare and meaningful glimpse into his relationship.

According to People, Lloyd and Loiacono, 55, married in 2016 after being introduced through mutual friends. They opted for an intimate wedding ceremony and have prioritized privacy throughout their marriage. Since then, the couple has maintained a low public profile, appearing together only occasionally at industry events and premieres.

The social media post stood out because Lloyd rarely offers glimpses into his life offscreen. Relaxed moments like this are rarely shared publicly. The last time he posted an Instagram photo of the pair was in December 2025. The couple both wore dark outfits and smiled for the camera while standing in a kitchen with their dog between them. Lloyd simply captioned the post with a Christmas tree and a red love heart emoji.

Lloyd is best known for his portrayal of Doc Brown in the “Back to the Future” franchise. It was a role that cemented his place in pop culture history, popularizing the iconic catchphrase “Great Scott!” The performance introduced him to generations of fans and remains one of the most recognizable characters in film history.

Beyond the iconic franchise, Lloyd has built a career spanning more than five decades, with roles across film, television, and theater. He also recently portrayed Professor Orloff in Netflix's “Wednesday.” Despite his public success, he has consistently drawn a clear line between his professional work and his personal life.

For audiences who grew up watching him travel through time on screen, the photo offered something equally meaningful off-screen. It captured a moment rooted not in nostalgia, but in the present.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Savannah Guthrie's Husband Steps In to Support Family Amid Ongoing Search for Mom Nancy","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/savannah-guthrie-husband-tucson-nancy-search-update/","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:30:07 GMT","

As the Guthrie family faces an unthinkable stretch of uncertainty, they are holding tightly to one another and to hope. More than two weeks into the search for “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie's beloved mom, Nancy Guthrie, the family remains together, navigating each new development as it comes. 

Nancy, 84, was last seen on January 31 after spending the evening with family. She was reported missing the following morning when she did not attend church.

The pain has not eased, but neither has their determination. As the family continues to navigate each difficult day, another member has arrived in Arizona to stand beside them while the search for their matriarch grows more urgent.

TMZ now reports that Savannah's husband, Michael Feldman, has arrived in Tucson, Arizona, as the search for his mother-in-law, Nancy, enters its third week.

Feldman was spotted at the airport before quickly heading to a waiting vehicle. He did not make any public statements. His arrival comes during an emotionally draining period for the family as they continue to wait for answers.

Feldman's arrival came one day after authorities formally cleared all members of the Guthrie family as suspects in the case.

Amid speculation and online chatter surrounding the family's possible involvement, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos took a firm and public stance. The Guthrie family is not under suspicion.

Speaking to Tucson's KOLD 13 News, Nanos said relatives were ruled out “in the first few days” and have been “100 percent cooperative” throughout the investigation.

“Not one single person in the family is a suspect,” Nanos said. “So I am telling everyone, effective today, you guys [media] need to knock it off, quit. People are hurting. They are victims. I am saying they are clear. We have cleared them.”

He later reinforced that message in a formal statement.

“To be clear … the Guthrie family — to include all siblings and spouses — have been cleared as possible suspects in this case. The family has been nothing but cooperative and gracious, and are victims in this case,” Nanos said. “To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel. The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple.”

An FBI official told Fox News Digital that investigative genetic genealogy, known as IGG, is now being used in the Nancy Guthrie case.

IGG is a forensic technique that analyzes crime scene DNA to identify possible relatives through public genealogy databases when traditional law enforcement systems, such as CODIS, return no matches.

Earlier Tuesday, the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed that an unknown male DNA profile found on a glove two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home did not generate any hits in CODIS. 

DNA recovered from inside her home also produced no matches, according to the sheriff's department.

“The DNA found at the property is being analyzed & further testing needs to be done as part of the investigation,” the sheriff's department said on X.

CeCe Moore, chief genetic genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, told Fox News Digital she is confident IGG will ultimately identify the source of the DNA.

“Thanks to the power of investigative genetic genealogy, it is just a matter of time now until they discover who that DNA belongs to and the investigators are able to pursue those leads and, hopefully, provide answers to Nancy's family,” she said.

Savannah is remaining close to her family as the search for her mother continues.

A source told People that the “Today” co-anchor is “devastated” by Nancy's disappearance.

“This has been an incredibly emotional and stressful time for her and her family. They're leaning on one another for support while hoping for answers,” the source said.

In a separate interview with NBC News, Nanos explained why he felt it was important to defend the family publicly.

“Because sometimes we forget we're human and we hurt, and kindness matters. It is every cop's duty to stand up and be that voice for our victims. I'm not going to sit in silence when others are attacking the innocent. Isn't that what the badge represents?”

For now, Feldman's arrival reflects the family's approach from the start. They are staying together, holding onto hope, and waiting for answers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Sheriff Delivers Emotional Update in Nancy Guthrie Case After DNA Setback","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nancy-guthrie-investigation-search-update-sheriff-statement/","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 01:15:10 GMT","

The search for 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie has taken an emotional toll on her family as each day passes without answers. Nancy, the mother of “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie, was last seen on January 31 after spending the evening with loved ones. She was reported missing the following morning when she did not attend church.

Now more than two weeks into the investigation, her family is leaning on one another, trying to steady themselves through the uncertainty. The heartbreak lingers. So does the hope. 

With the case entering another critical phase, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos is sharing a sobering update.

In a new interview with Fox10, Nanos addressed mounting questions about the investigation and whether authorities believe Nancy is still alive.

“They ask me, do I have proof of life? I ask them, is there proof of death?” Nanos said.

He acknowledged the emotional weight of those words but made clear he is not ready to give up.

“I'm going to have that faith, and sometimes that faith, that hope, is all we have… My team, 400 people out there in the field today, woke up this morning and went out there with the hope and the belief that they're going to find Nancy.”

Nancy was last seen entering her home in the Catalina Foothills of Tucson. Hours later, her pacemaker disconnected from her Apple Watch.

Earlier this week, authorities revealed that DNA taken from a black nitrile glove discovered roughly two miles from Nancy's home did not match genetic material collected inside the residence or any profile in the national CODIS database.

At first, the glove seemed like a potential breakthrough. It closely resembled one worn by a masked person seen on Nancy's doorbell camera shortly before she vanished.

Still, Nanos cautioned against reading too much into the setback.

The sheriff told Fox10 that his detectives have “other DNA evidence from the scene, that is more critical to me than DNA found two miles from the scene”.

“All of that will still be submitted for further analysis,” he said.

“You take a fingerprint, and you hope to match it right away. But that's not that easy.”

Nanos added that investigators recovered DNA from multiple individuals inside the home. Forensic teams now must “hope” they can “separate that” as testing continues.

With traditional database searches yielding no results, authorities are turning to a different tool.

An FBI official told Fox News Digital that investigators have now turned to investigative genetic genealogy, known as IGG, in the case.

IGG uses crime-scene DNA to search for potential relatives in public genealogy databases when traditional law enforcement systems, such as CODIS, return no matches.

Earlier Tuesday, the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed that the unknown male DNA profile recovered from a glove near Nancy's home did not generate any hits in CODIS. DNA collected inside her home also failed to match any profile in the national database.

“The DNA found at the property is being analyzed & further testing needs to be done as part of the investigation,” the sheriff's department said on X.

CeCe Moore, chief genetic genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, said she is confident the process will ultimately identify the source of the DNA.

“Thanks to the power of investigative genetic genealogy, it is just a matter of time now until they discover who that DNA belongs to and the investigators are able to pursue those leads and, hopefully, provide answers to Nancy's family,” she said.

As the investigation moves forward, Nanos has drawn a firm line on one issue. The Guthrie family is not under suspicion.

Amid online rumors and mounting speculation, authorities formally cleared all immediate relatives.

Speaking to Tucson's KOLD 13 News, Nanos said family members were ruled out “in the first few days” and have been “100 percent cooperative.”

“Not one single person in the family is a suspect,” Nanos said. “So I am telling everyone, effective today, you guys [media] need to knock it off, quit. People are hurting. They are victims. I am saying they are clear. We have cleared them.”

He later reiterated that position in a formal statement. “To be clear … the Guthrie family — to include all siblings and spouses — have been cleared as possible suspects in this case. The family has been nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case,” Nanos said. “To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel. The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple.”

For now, the sheriff says the focus remains unchanged.

“We're going to continue working this case, every minute of every day, and we will find her.”

He also issued a direct appeal. “And we will find you… to the individual doing this, let her go, just let her go. It will work out better for you in the long run, trust me.”

As the search enters another week, the uncertainty weighs heavily. But hope, however fragile, remains. For Nancy's family, every development carries the same quiet plea—bring Nancy back home, where she truly belongs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Big Bang Theory' Star Spends His Fortune on Helping Families with Big Medical Bills","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/kunal-nayyar-gofundme-medical-bills/","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 02:58:48 GMT","

When Kunal Nayyar thinks about success, he does not start with awards or ratings. He starts with gratitude.

The former “Big Bang Theory” star recently revealed that he quietly pays medical bills for families in need by browsing campaigns on GoFundMe and covering expenses himself. The candid admission has resonated widely, offering a glimpse into how the actor chooses to use his wealth beyond Hollywood.

Nayyar shared the revelation in an interview with The i Paper. He said he sometimes scrolls through GoFundMe pages at night and steps in to help families facing overwhelming medical costs. He described the practice as something deeply personal and meaningful, explaining that financial success has given him the freedom to positively change lives.

The actor, who rose to global fame playing Raj Koothrappali on the hit CBS sitcom, said he views money as a responsibility as much as a privilege. He expressed gratitude for the career that allowed him to build financial security and said he feels fortunate that he can now extend that security to others during moments of crisis.

According to Variety, Nayyar has used his own funds to pay off medical-related GoFundMe campaigns for families he does not personally know. The actor does not attach publicity to the donations and has focused instead on the relief those contributions can bring.

Medical emergencies often arrive without warning, leaving families scrambling for resources. Through GoFundMe, many share their stories in hopes of easing the financial strain tied to surgeries, hospital stays, or long-term treatments. Nayyar's involvement underscores how one individual can make a direct and immediate difference.

Page Six reported that Nayyar's net worth, built largely during his time on “The Big Bang Theory,” has afforded him the ability to give generously. Rather than centering on luxury, he has chosen to center on impact.

Nayyar's generosity extends beyond medical bills. Reports note that he and his wife, Neha Kapur, also support educational initiatives, including scholarships for students from underserved communities. The couple also backs animal welfare causes, reflecting their shared love for animals.

In speaking about his philanthropic efforts, Nayyar emphasized gratitude and perspective. He acknowledged that his success in television created opportunities he once only imagined. Now, he said, he feels compelled to pay that success forward.

Fans have responded warmly to the revelation, praising the actor for using his platform and resources in meaningful ways. The story has sparked conversations about how celebrities can leverage their influence to address real-world challenges and uplift everyday families.

There are a few things audiences shouldn't worry about during the course of a snappy crime caper. Or, there are a few things audiences shouldn't even think about during one, let alone find the time to worry about — especially not if our seemingly devious criminals aren't worrying about them, either. Fingerprints. Surveillance cameras. Pretty obvious motives. The second we start doing the calculations, the grift is cooked, the fun is off, the show is over.

These were some of the many thoughts (and worries!) I found the time to ponder while watching John Patton Ford‘s loose “Kind Hearts and Coronets” remake, “How to Make a Killing.” While the inspiration for the “Emily the Criminal” filmmaker's latest is certainly more goofy than what Ford has brought to the screen for his sophomore outing, it's also significantly less funny and woefully devoid of the kind of snap and pop (hell, even the crackle) such a film should burst with.

If we're going to kill the rich for fun and profit, we need some actual fun, right? Alas.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The ingredients are all there: Ford's skill with stories about the evils of capitalism (and the delight of some good, old-fashioned revenge) was proven out with his Aubrey Plaza-starring debut, star and executive producer Glen Powell remains eager to bring his charisma and talent to all kinds of projects, the supporting cast is stacked, and the basic storyline is ripe for a new take. 

But the film suffers from a pair of unfortunate missteps, the first of which is plain from the start and only gets worse as the film drags on. Written by Ford, “How to Make a Killing” awkwardly plays out through copious voiceover narration from Powell's Becket Redfellow, heavy on exposition and light on much else. Becket knows enough to narrate his life story before it even starts — his mother grew up in insane wealth and privilege, but when she got pregnant at age 18, her cold father (Ed Harris) tossed her out without a care — and to guide us up until the precise moment the film actually opens.

It's not a spoiler: Becket is in prison, about to be put to death, but he's got four hours to chat it up with a baffled priest (Adrian Lukis). Becket uses this time to take the guy through his entire life story (with some sizable, murder-free jumps notably missing), most of it hinging on that essential wound inflicted on him before he was born. After losing his young father almost immediately (a pitch-black comedic bit that the rest of the film should have learned from), Becket's childhood was built on his bond with his mother (Nell Williams), who strove to teach her progeny about the finer things in life, even when they were living in (gasp) New Jersey, off (gasp) the freeway, and she (gasp) had to toil with a thankless job at the DMV.

 










So while Becket grew up poor in finances, he also grew up rich in experiences (the film's real locations and excellent costumes help out on both fronts). He knows how to play the piano. He did archery for a time. He loves a good suit. But when his mother died — and, crucially, his billionaire grandfather still refused to help her — Becket was left with only one burning desire, as demanded by his mom on her deathbed: to claw back the “right kind of life.” Financially speaking, that means he should get his inheritance (which, through some sort of mangled irrevocable trust, Becket can still benefit from), but only if every other person in front of him in the Redfellow line (all seven of them) kicks the bucket first.

And thus enters the film's second great misstep: attempting to cast the eminently charming Powell as a bad dude, driven by rage. That alone is a problem, but things get still thornier as we go, because Ford himself seems unable to determine if Becket is, in fact, a bad dude. Or even if he could be. If he is at certain moments. That lack of character clarity, as filtered through the kind of actor we always want to root for? It makes for a deadly (dull) combination.

Letting Becket narrate the entire outing sure doesn't help, adding a structure that isn't just boring, but also confusing. There are moments in which it seems — perhaps? — that Becket's narration is actually an internal monologue, but we never get close enough to him to decide if that's the case. It also robs the film of what should be obvious pleasures, such as Becket planning the multiple murders he needs to complete to secure his fortune. Instead, we simply arrive at the scenes of his crimes, no forethought or intention provided, no snappy planning montages, no joy or humor in these dark machinations.

 










And that's a real shame, because the killings? They're quite clever. A young cousin is offed on a yacht in hilarious, potentially accidental fashion. Someone else suffers at the hands (dental trays?) of poison made to look like teeth whitener. And while not every one of Becket's relatives gets the chance to shine, when they do, it gives “How to Make a Killing” the zing it's otherwise so sorely missing. Zach Woods is a riot as another dim cousin easily swayed by Becket's apparent interest in his “art” (later, Becket will take an actual interest in his girlfriend, Jessica Henwick, who plays the only person here with a moral center). Topher Grace offers up his own spin on “The Righteous Gemstones” as yet another cousin who absolutely has it coming to him (prequel spinoff?).

The stacked supporting cast also includes the great Bill Camp as Becket's Uncle Warren, who takes the kid under his wing after meeting him at one of (many!) family funerals. That includes giving Becket a job at one of the family companies, and as his star begins to rise (and a relationship with Henwick's Ruth starts to heat up), a curious question arises: Maybe Becket can stop the murders? Life seems pretty good right now? Billions, who needs 'em?

Such thorny moral questions are in short supply in the film, but this little pickle does provide the script's smartest step: Let's add in blackmail! When Becket was just a kid (playing piano, practicing archery, wanting so badly to be rich), he made pals with the wealthy Julia, a first love he's never gotten over. And when she strides back into his life, played as an adult by Margaret Qualley (who absolutely gets this particular assignment), he's still at her mercy. Julia, no slouch, knows full well what Becket is up to and is hellbent on using that information to cash out big time. Any time he shows signs of stopping? She's right there.

 










It's good motivation, the kind of stuff that keeps the film (and Becket) moving whenever it starts to slow, which is too often. We see the seams of it, of course, but at a certain point, that sort of craftsmanship is welcome. It's a far cry from the more lax elements, which are far more prevalent. This should be tighter, meaner, leaner, cutting. How to make a killing? Let's worry about the smaller stuff first.

A24 will release “How to Make a Killing” in theaters on Friday, February 20.

The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative report for 2025 showed that of the top 100 films at the box office, only nine were directed by women. In the 19 years that the study has been conducted, only three women had directed three or more films to be represented on that list: Anne Fletcher, Lana Wachowski, and Greta Gerwig.

You can now add one more woman to that list: Emerald Fennell. 

Fennell's “Wuthering Heights” this weekend opened to $88.5 million over the four-day weekend ($82 million in three days), all against a production budget of $80 million (before marketing costs). It's not exactly a record-breaker, as it's behind the domestic opening for plenty of other female-directed films, and it's #14 in terms of 4-day openings over Presidents' Day weekend. It even opened a little soft compared to some projections, which originally had “Wuthering Heights” reaching $40 million or even $50 million domestic before the weekend. It is however still a boon for Warner Bros., which now has had nine straight movies open to #1 dating back to last year (suddenly a lot is riding on Maggie Gyllenhaal's “The Bride!”).

But between her debut “Promising Young Woman” ($18.8 million) and “Saltburn” ($21 million), Fennell now has three movies that will crack the Top 100 on that Annenberg Inclusion Initiative report in a year, and it puts her in the conversation among some of the other top-performing female directors at the box office of all time. 

 










“Wuthering Heights” opened above the openings for last year's “Freakier Friday” from Nisha Ganatra ($149.2 million cumulative) and Emma Tammi's “Five Nights at Freddy's 2” ($238.1 million cumulative) and it has already in four days surpassed the overall gross of Nia DaCosta's “28 Days Later: The Bone Temple” ($56.8 million) and Chloé Zhao's “Hamnet” ($79.4 million). We just wrote about how well that one has done internationally, so Warner Bros. has a lot to be excited about.

Fennell has a ways to go before she reaches the Gerwig tier, which is technically a tier of one. Gerwig's “Barbie” grossed $1.4 billion for Warner Bros., but even Gerwig's film “Little Women,” another romantic period drama based on classic literature, grossed $220 million worldwide. “Wuthering Heights” could easily get into that ballpark. 

“Wuthering Heights” very likely could've gone the Netflix route, accepting a higher budget in exchange for being a streaming-only release, but the film landed at Warner Bros. because Fennell wanted theatrical, and that gambit seems to have paid off. It may have done very well on Netflix and had an even bigger reach, but we wouldn't be talking about Fennell's ability to produce box office hits.

Instead, it adds another feather to the cap of Warner Bros. entrusting filmmakers with a vision to go big and do what they want (“Wuthering Heights” is a very big film), it shows that Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi could be considered movie stars capable of opening a film, and it will surely give Fennell another bite at the apple for whatever she wants to make as her fourth feature.

 










Let's hope she pushes again for another theatrical release for that one.

Noah Hawley's “Alien: Earth” is a masterclass in turning a legacy I.P. into something that feels distinctly relevant to the present day. The prequel, which tells the story of a corporate arms race to develop immortality and the dark consequences that inevitably emerge, relies heavily on a cast that clearly buys into the premise from the very beginning. So it was no surprise that two of its stars, Babou Ceesay and Sydney Chandler, picked up Independent Spirit Award nominations for their performances. 

Prior to the ceremony, Ceesay joined IndieWire and Lavazza on the blue carpet to discuss his breakout performance as Morrow, the villainous cyborg employed by the Weyland-Yutani corporation. Ceesay opted for the more challenging Dark Roast questions and explained how he found the good in such a nefarious character.

“Finding humanity in him,” Ceesay said when asked about the biggest creative challenge he faced. “Making him, in my mind, a little more lovable than people would have expected. I know he was doing some really horrendous things, morally speaking, but I thought ‘He's still a human being.' He's a cyborg, but he's got human parts, so what's going on in there?” 

Offering such a nuanced take on a villainous character is not always easy, and Ceesay explained that some of the character's departures from his own morals required him to take a leap of faith as a performer.

“Those scenes where he's manipulating a child to get what he wants, those were interesting moments for me,” he said. “It's not what I would want to do in my own life, so I felt a sense of ‘Okay, let's push the boat out and see what happens.'”

Robert Duvall had a way of sticking out in the crowd. For much of his career, the Oscar-winning actor was a consummate supporting performer, adding his talents to the ensembles of films like “The Godfather,” “Network,” “M*A*S*H,” “Apocalypse Now,” and many other classics. 

In the '70s, People Magazine even memorably described him as “Hollywood's No. 1 No. 2 lead.” And yet, in his hands, no part was ever a small part. 

With his rugged charisma and a talent for conveying a quiet yet unyielding intensity, Duvall always shined in the roles he was given, frequently proving a standout who elevated the material into something greater. His sheer chops can easily be reflected in the number of accolades he received across his 60-something years in Hollywood: he only won one Oscar, for his gorgeous performance in the musical drama “Tender Mercies,” but he was nominated six other times, and also amassed a BAFTA, four Golden Globes, two Emmys, and a SAG Award. And he never really slowed down until the very end of his life, continuing to act, and give exemplary performances, well into his twilight years.

Born in San Diego to a military family, Duvall studied under Sanford Meiser before beginning his professional career, honing his understated, unshowy performance style that made him a natural fit for any role. He began his career in theater, and took some minor TV parts before nailing his big film break in 1962 after screenwriter Horton Foote, who saw him perform at the Neighborhood Playhouse, recommended him to play Boo Radley in the acclaimed film adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” 

From there, Duvall's film career built up slowly in the '60s, before exploding in the '70s, where he became a fixture of New Hollywood. He started slowly taking on more lead acting roles, in vehicles like “The Great Santini,” “Tender Mercies,” and “The Apostle,” which he also directed. Into the 2000s, he remained a welcome presence in movies, be they serious dramas (“Open Range”), silly comedies (“Kicking and Screaming”), or cracking thrillers (“Widows”).  

With the news of Duvall's death at 95 on February 15, IndieWire rounded up the best performances from his exemplary career. Read on for the 10 best Robert Duvall performances of all time, unranked and in chronological order.

Duvall was 31 when he made his feature film debut in the key role of Boo Radley in Robert Mulligan's celebrated adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Playing the mysterious town pariah in the film's final sequence, he somehow comes across as both younger and older, carrying himself with the shy demeanor of a child, yet with eyes that convey a lifetime of hurt and ostracism. 

In Harper Lee's celebrated novel, Radley is more symbol than character, a reflection of the book's themes of social intolerance and the importance of understanding who imparts a lifelong lesson on the young Scout (Mary Badham). Duvall has the presence to match, with a shock of white blonde hair that's positively ghostly, but his presence makes the quiet figure a man of flesh and blood rather than just a living allegory. As far as debut performances go, few leave quiet an impression like this.

Duvall is not exactly remembered for his long and proud history as a comedic actor, but he's a core part of the ensemble in Robert Altman's groundbreaking “M*A*S*H,” albeit more often the butt of the joke than delivering one. The shaggy comedy about medical personnel during the Vietnam War, as they drink and party to ignore the conflict raging around them, casts the taciturn actor as Frank Burns, a wildly pompous surgeon whose ego far exceeds his actual skill. He's the perfect villain to root against, a stick-in-the-mud authority figure who makes the lazy but talented Hawkeye (Donald Sutherland) seem like the ideal doctor in comparison. 

In an eccentric cast, he's the straight man you want to see get a good comeuppance — and his karma comes in one of the film's most famous scenes, as Hawkeye broadcasts his tryst with Nurse Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), who delivers the immortal request to “kiss my hot lips!”

Otherwise known as that other sci-fi film George Lucas directed in the '70s, “THX 1138” is the closest Duvall ever came to playing a conventional leading action hero role — which, considering how weird this strange little experiment actually is, says quite a lot. 

He's the title character, just another near-faceless cog in a future where humanity lives in underground cities and all citizens are required to take emotion-suppressant medications. But when THX stops taking his pills, he develops independent thought of his place in the world, and a forbidden sexual relationship with LUH 3417 (Maggie McOmie). In the cold and clinical world Lucas crafts, Duvall is an appealing presence, proving unexpectedly tender as a drone coming into his own emotions for the first time and fighting for his freedom.

The first two “Godfather” films feature a parade of some of the best actors in history doing career-best work: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, James Caan, and Diane Keaton are just the biggest names in the ridiculously stacked ensemble of Francis Ford Coppola's gangster epics. And with a lot of these actors doing big, big work — James Caan playing the family hot head to Brando going ice cold as the ruthless don — it can be easy to overlook just how incredible Duvall is right alongside them as Tom Hagen, the consigliere and informal adopted son of Don Vito and the voice of reason among an increasingly bloodthirsty clan of criminals. 

Duvall treads a deceptively tricky tightrope as Tom, an outsider to the Italian family who nonetheless considers himself one of them, and makes the few moments the typically taciturn and quiet maneuver expresses his real emotions — such as a standout scene where he pleas to Pacino's Michael that “I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you” in “Part II” — hit hard.

Sidney Lumet's classic TV news satire “Network” hasn't aged flawlessly in the 50 years since its release, but the performances from the cast, playing the sleazy cast of a failing network as they exploit the breakdown of longtime anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch) for ratings boasts an all-time great cast whose performances remain perfection. A perpetually great ensemble player, Duvall slots in effortlessly as the head of the station Frank Hackett, a ruthless company man who values profit above the well-being of his employees and lofty concepts like “integrity” and “public responsibility.” He's the archetypical sleezy exec, the exact type of man who has only increased in power since “Network” first released. 

There's a lot about “Apocalypse Now” that has entered into the public consciousness, even for people who haven't watched it: the use of “Ride of the Valkyries” during a brutal air assault, the trippy final 30-minutes or so where Marlon Brando arrives to steal the movie, and the infamously troubled production that spawned an entire documentary. 

But the defining moment of “Apocalypse Now” is when Duvall, a scene-stealer as the adrenaline junkie, bloodthirsty Kilgore, surveils the wreckage his men have left behind and cheerfully muses he “loves the smell of napalm in the morning.” When he follows it up with “Someday the war's gonna end,” the flicker of sadness in his voice is as chilling as anything else in the film. The eccentric Kilgore, with his love of surfing and brutal streak of violence, could be a cartoon. Duvall wisely underplays him, but his gravitas and presence makes him an instantly iconic character, one as beloved as anything else in the film.

Across most of the '70s, Duvall became mostly known as a character actor and supporting player. His first Best Acting Oscar nomination came at the tail end of the decade, when he played one of cinema's all-time frightening dads, the titular Great Santini. 

Conducting himself with militaristic standards even in his domestic life, Lt. Meechum becomes a terror for his family during peacetime, especially his rebellious son (Michael O'Keefe). Duvall never overplays the part; the film is best known for the brutal scene where Meechum assaults his son at a baseball game, but he's at his scariest in the quietest moments, when his gruff voice casually cuts down his kids or his wife with just a few curt words.

Duvall was nominated at the Oscars seven times over his career, but he only took home an award once, for his work in musical drama “Tender Mercies.” And, unlike some actors, he actually got it for some career-best work. He's phenomenal as country singer Max Sledge, a former star attempting to go sober and build his life back up via a tentative friendship with a young widow (Tess Harper). 

The film was a passion project for Duvall, who did his own singing and helped write a few of the songs performed in the film, and in his acceptance speech he thanked actual country musicians like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson for their praise of the film. Watching the movie today, it sticks out as a rare performance in which the typically stoic performer was allowed to be achingly vulnerable.

One of the biggest limited series of all time, “Lonesome Dove” was a massive phenomenon upon its airing in 1989, with 26 million people tuning in to watch the epic adaptation of Larry McMurtry's Western novel about the adventures of two men — Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call — as they embark on a cattle drive from Texas to Montana. 

Duvall was originally offered the part of the straight-laced Call, which ultimately went to Tommy Lee Jones, but was attracted to the more boisterous, free-spirited Augustus, and his charismatic performance anchors the entire project. Don't just take our word for it; Duvall himself often referred to “Lonesome Dove” as his personal favorite performance across his entire career.

Duvall directed a handful of films over the years, with the best coming in 1997 as “The Apostle,” arguably his best late-career triumph. He wrote and starred in the film too, playing Sonny Dewey, a Texas preacher seeking both refuge and redemption after he murders his wife's lover. On the lam, he reinvents himself in the bayous of Louisiana, opening a new church while battling the demons that lead him there. 

Boldly, “The Apostle” doesn't condemn its flawed hero, taking his attempt to find salvation seriously despite his great faults. It's one of the most complex roles the star ever played, and he's electric throughout, especially when he's preaching — and particularly in the climactic sermon that blows the house down.

Jill Scott's music feels like Black memory with a bassline. A blend of nostalgic soul, funk, and spoken-word poetry, it hums before it speaks, swaying before it testifies. Since her debut album in 2000, Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1, Scott has given Blackness—and her native North Philadelphia—the foundational centering it deserves: the fragrance of cocoa butter warming on brown skin, potato salad on white styrofoam plates, the humidity thick on summer evenings while the sun goes down. Her voice gathers these recollections. It calls in the cousins from the sidewalk, tells the uncles to mind the grill, lets the older women finish their stories without interruption. It is community scribbled in the pages of a notebook. But Scott's Blackness is also kinetic: It sounds like double-dutch rhythms on pavement, rope slapping concrete in perfect time while sneakers tap the block. Her cadences pivot and play, bending phrases into jazz-informed stretches, turning seemingly mundane occurrences into bright melody.

On her intrepid new album, To Whom This May Concern—her sixth studio LP and her first since 2015's Woman—one can hear the lineage immediately: the syrupy stretch of '70s groove, the blast of '90s hip-hop, the swing of big band jazz, the meditative aura of the neo-soul era from which she emerged. Across several tracks, I can hear her honoring those who steadied her: ancestors near like her uncle Lonnie, as far as the poet Nikki Giovanni. The tonal choices across the album, with its lush basslines, head-nodding beats, and live percussion that feels like Sunday morning praise, suggest continuity with those who came before. To my ear, it coalesces Who Is Jill Scott? and 2004's Beautifully Human: Words and Sounds Vol. 2 as music meant to evoke the past without treading all the way through it. Similar to how A Tribe Called Quest's 2016 album We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service sounded like an updated version of the left-of-center hip-hop Tribe always made, Scott is experimenting while staying true to herself, not pandering to what's hot.

There's a throughline of redemption coursing through this LP, yet her comeback doesn't sound tethered to public approval. Instead, this is a new, IDGAF version of Scott, who can still sing quiet-storm ballads but also talk shit about social media naysayers. “They stay chatting about my body on IG, say I'm a mean bitch, I'm in the illuminati,” she raps on “Norf Side,” one of several highlights. In years past, Scott could be best described as a purveyor of romantic love and sensuality. Not on this LP. “Pay U on Tuesday” is all swank and sass, a for us, not for them bluesy track about sidestepping energy-draining folks. The metaphor of deferred payment feels autobiographical—emotional debts, promises made and broken—yet the song's brassy rhythm keeps it from sinking. It's comedic, actually. Scott sings through a grin, refusing to let setbacks calcify.

In the weeks leading up to this album's release, the press cycle framed the project as Scott's triumphant return after a decade-long absence from the album format. The narrative was neat: beloved neo-soul luminary steps back into the spotlight, reminding everyone what they've been missing. Neat narratives rarely account for real life—especially not the kind of very public living that Scott has done. A decade is long enough for truth or myth to form. Long enough for divorce proceedings to become blog fodder, for interviews to be parsed into character studies, for the industry to shift beneath your feet. By the time Scott reemerged with singles and press appearances, the subtext suggested a confessional LP about her ups and downs away from the spotlight.

“I married a bitch,” she quips on “Me 4.” “I didn't know, I went too fast when I shoulda went slow.” Another song like “Be Great,” with its ascendant horns and Second Line arrangement (thanks to the noted New Orleans bandleader Trombone Shorty), feels anchored in affirmation: After some time being down, Scott's muscle memory kicks in and she remembers who she is, stepping back into a room she built. To that end, To Whom This May Concern might feel scattered to those wanting her more characteristic, sensuous R&B. But the album does a good job of flaring in different directions while keeping close to Scott's artistic core. It occasionally sounds like a jukebox, and a song like “Ode to Nikki”—where she attempts to mimic Giovanni's tone and cadence—doesn't land. Yet the missteps are few, despite the crowdedness.

“Beautiful People” carries a gentle charge. There's a glow to the arrangement, akin to 2004's “Family Reunion,” that points out how Scott's music functions as communal balm. Beneath the uplift is a woman who has seen affection curdle, as if love and loss somehow don't pertain to the most visible. The song likens adoration to a whisper, a messy communion. “Yes, our love traversed the seas,” Scott declares. “Yes, our love is the art of war/Conquering all algorithms.” There's that word: algorithm. The invisible curator, with its cold hand nudging taste, rewarding brevity, and flattening risk into whatever loops cleanly for 15 seconds. In the end, To Whom This May Concern moves as if untouched by it. Because who gives a damn when the results are this personal and resistant, when Black joy is this pronounced and unashamed.

Argentina's underground has long been a hotbed of unhinged creativity. It's an ecosystem of park rap battles, parties, collectives, and young artists intentionally trying to piss off rock-loving oldheads. The trap scene evolved locally in waves: It really took off in 2017 with stars like Cazzu and Auto-Tune god Duki, a freestyler who broke through after winning the El Quinto Escalón battle rap tournament. Then, during the pandemic, the rapper Dillom co-founded RIP GANG, an essential Argentine collective with new-gen oddballs like digicore artist Saramalacara and hyper-dance princess Taichu. It's impossible to distill the depth of the scene in a few sentences—they pull generously from genres born abroad (baile funk, drill, the mutant, multinational rush of Latin Core) and at home. Peep cumbia villera (Argentine shantytown cumbia) and the popular reggaeton hybrid it influenced, RKT, whose dirty snares and dembow sway took off after 2020 with hitmakers like L-GANTE.

In 2026, most of these artists have become the old guard. Some of them are more popular than ever, like critical darlings CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso, who took home five Latin Grammys in 2025 for their slick and fame-sick jazz rap EP PAPOTA. But over the last few years, we've seen the rise of an even more out-there vanguard. Boomers will drop dead when they hear PILF, the newly formed “boyband” consisting of four of the nation's most carefree young MCs. On the dancier side, too, there's a fleet of producers and pop girls and labels like TURRXCORE pulling the underground forward. Talking to Remezcla, the Argentine producer Heartgaze described the musical zeitgeist they're involved in as one that stretches across multiple countries, a network of “freaky, Latino, non-binary internet music.”

Stiffy, Zell, turrobaby, and AgusFortnite2008

Broadly speaking, the Argentine underground seems to be the most experimental it's ever been. Six Sex is straight-up moaning on the track and singing with a pilates instructor flow about how to make your ass bigger, while Stiffy raps about boom bap being “shit” and AgusFortnite2008 makes music videos that smush 1,000 browser pages into one frame. Over a crazed 24 hours last November, I hung out with the misfits of PILF and the electro-pop duo EQ. I developed a sense for how Argentina's new vanguard sees itself, forming its peripatetic and puckish identity amid an era of global internet cross-pollination and the election of Javier Milei, a Trump-like, supposedly ultra-libertarian and anti-government figure casting a shadow over everything.

In the underground, AgusFortnite2008 tells me, it used to be uncommon to get over 300,000 plays a month. “Some 30-year-old man listens to one of my songs and kills himself. They don't understand the distortion, the references. It's a generational appeal,” Agus joked to me years ago. Now, a growing audience is finally starting to get it, and underground MCs regularly notch over a million plays. “There's a lot of new people listening,” he says. “It's like a snowball.”

It's an unseasonably warm November day in Buenos Aires as the city edges into summer. Restaurants full of bloated loungers line the roads; the smell of grilled meat wafts in the air. I approach a black compound with large windows, guarded in front by a wall that looks faintly Japanese with long vertical slats. A key-coded door opens and I'm ushered into the studios for Dale Play, the label home to the rap group PILF. Soon, the boys arrive like they've just been dropped off by a parent after carpooling to a movie theater.

Zell, 20, is the most clean-cut and the only sober one, with sharp features and baggy sweatpants that swoop down to his ankles. Stiffy, 19, looks like a tourist, a camo hat across his long puffy hair and a bag strapped around his white tank top; his shorts advertise local football team Club Atlético Ferrocarril Midland. turrobaby, 18, wears a stained athletic t-shirt and ripped-apart Nike flip-flops that half-hide grimy toenails. AgusFortnite2008, 18, is the most fitted, with necklaces and snakeskin Roberto Cavalli pants that creep over his Doc Martens.

Today's a break day in the middle of PILF's national tour to celebrate their debut album P.I.L.F, a clown fiesta of slapstick disses and belligerent trap. The project came after 10 days cooped up in the country in an area called Chascomus. They played football and Wii, swam in the pool, and got high as shit on mushrooms. “It was like, um… you know The Beatles?” turrobaby offers. One night at 3 a.m., they walked into the woods and saw and heard what they genuinely believed was a monster. “Bwaaaooahhh,” Stiffy roars, imitating the beast. They ran like hell. Agus lost a Croc and Stiffy lost one of his shoes.

For the last couple of years, PILF's band of pendejos atrevidos have been breaking brains across Argentina. Agus and Stiffy unload a barrage of spinbacks, drunken FX, and asphyxiated Swag! shrieks. It's both generational and regional, the byproduct of kids nursed on YouTube poop from a country that's historically centered rock over rap.

In person, they're silly and chill; turro can't stop grinning and Stiffy erupts into giggles that ricochet like tiny rubber balls. We have a live “rage-baiting” session, where they try to one-up each other in a contest to see who can make the most outrageous claim. Agus, who's slumped beside me on a low-hanging green couch that's seen better days, begins by saying Skrillex is better than Luis Alberto Spinetta, one of the founding fathers of Argentine rock.

Then turrobaby, sitting on a chair nearby, says that the white underground rapper Boolymon is better than 2Pac, stroking his hairless chin in thought. “Far, far better.”

“People here love Gustavo Cerati and rock idols,” he adds, “like you can't say nothing.”

“They're like gods. If you say something, it's like whooaaaa,” Agus groans. “Lazer Dim is better.”

They don't actually hate 2Pac or Argentina's rock pantheon—the very influential Cerati, who founded the band Soda Stereo in the ‘80s, is perfectly cool to them. But inventing a weird new style sometimes requires killing your elders. “turrobaby?” AgusFortnite2008 says, smiling at his buddy across the room. “Better than Carlos Gardel.”

PILF began with just AgusFortnite2008 and Stiffy, who met online in 2020 while playing Minecraft, bonding over a love for the demented. They formed a duo, Swaggerboyz. Their early output was all Chief Keef cosplay and delicious brain poison with titles like “Jesus escucha plug.” They've since reached beyond their American inspo to a pulverized mash of local Argentine references and mindful provocation. They turned “montage parodies,” a 2010s style of videos madly defaced by stimuli, into a fully-fledged sonic aesthetic. The cover art of the duo's standout 2024 tape Murio La Musica, where they rap like sleep paralysis demons spamming hook-hexes, is a picture of Beethoven shooting himself in the face.

Agus and Stiffy met turrobaby and Zell after inviting them to perform at their annual festival Swaggerpalooza. Their first song as a foursome, “BABASONICO,” distilled their modus operandi: Over a degraded flip of MexikoDro's glittery beat for Playboi Carti's “Money Counter,”, they rap about getting a blowjob “Babasonicos style,” a play on the famous Argentine rock band and the Spanish word for “drool.” It's a cross-continental defacement, or a double homage, depending how you look.

turro grew up participating in rap battles in parks as a kid, but he only started making music two years ago. Zell began making music at 15 thanks to a government laptop he was given through Conectar Igualdad, a program launched in 2010 by former left-wing president Cristina Kirchner that sought to democratize access to technology across the country. That system was completely defunded and eliminated in 2024 by a Milei government that's basically waged war against any and all cultural funding.

“Kirchner's government used to be known for supporting national culture and young artists: we had a lot of free festivals, new cultural centers, funds for film productions,"" says Antonia Kon, a music writer from Buenos Aires who works at a cultural center. Most of that is gone—and there's a new veil of censorship, where state-owned cultural centers are now ""now prohibited from approaching feminist and LGBT topics, and also speaking about the dictatorship that Argentina faced between ‘76 and ‘83.”

The result is a scattered landscape full of artists who dislike the current government but fear speaking out. Some have done so and faced consequences: The pop star Lali, an LGBTQ ally who tweeted something anti-Milei (“Que peligoroso. Que trieste” — “How dangerous, how sad”) after he won the election, was banned from performing at state-owned cultural centers, along with Maria Becerra, another leading Argentine singer who defended Lali.

PILF have gotten political in a few eye-catching instances, like on turrobaby's early breakout jerk song “COLOMBIANA HOODTRAP,” when he shat on Javier Milei and declared he'll fuck women best because he's a “real Peronist,” a reference to Juan Peron, the former Argentine president popular among the working class. For the most part, the boys aim their vitriol at unnamed losers who ""pee in pools,"" dudes so lonely and dirty their only friend is the lice in their hair, and random celebrities (Lil Tecca and Edgar Allen Poe catch strays in Stiffy's madcap mixtape HACELOS CONCHA STIFFY).

Kon thinks their music reflects a hypersaturated and ""cynical, unhopeful"" generation. ""Their lyrics are satirizing the first generation of trap stars' fixation with accumulating capital and bragging about drugs and sex,"" she says. ""A lot of rock critics here in Argentina believe that it's shallow that the trap scene became so big—and not a more explicitly ‘political' music scene I guess—but for me it's the total opposite.""

She understands why youth uncertainty would manifest in this kind of ignorant-aspirational music against the backdrop of Argentina's recent recession and hyperinflation. ""They dream of becoming big trap artists or streamers and making money because it's so hard to dream of socially ascending here—it's almost impossible.”

Perhaps part of the reason the PILF boys trash Argentina's legends is projection, and secretly a wish to restore the country to what it was like when they were younger, when government funding of the arts was abundant and everyone was more united under a monoculture. “It's a culture that's lost in the years,” Agus laments, speaking yearningly of an era when there were genuine bands; it's why they decided to call themselves a “band” and not a collective. Stiffy grew up admiring the punk band Flema, playing in a folk orchestra in the hood in Morón and busking on the guitar in Plaza Francia, a public square near the water in the barrio of Recoleta.

Like many choices the band makes, their name came haphazardly: They took one of their perennial crude obsessions, MILFs, and changed “moms” to “pendejos,” idiots. (In what may be a shocking blindside to fans, Stiffy, after penning countless odes to hot mothers, announces on PILF's debut album that he's done with them and only interested in models now.)

The pubescent dumbass spirit is baked into PILF's art. During one show at Teatro Opera in La Plata, Agus accidentally elbowed Stiffy in the face until he started bleeding everywhere; Zell shows me a picture of a paper setlist stained with Stiffy's blood. They tell me about the making of the video for lead single “HIT,” a raucous bender of woodwind trap, which involved them trashing a staged wedding reception and, in the process, tarnishing their industry cred. “The production [team] hated us,” turrobaby laughs. “They told us not to break things, objects. Glasses, plates. When I was trying to step on the table, I was kicking everything.”

“People were crying, it was a mess,” Agus adds matter-of-factly. “We are struggling with the next video because of that. But we're still going to make it.” They all start talking about their dream video ideas. Agus wants “50 seconds in the Pyramids, 50 seconds in Paris, in Malaysia, in Japan.” Stiffy wants a stop-motion animation. Zell wants his own episode of a cartoon. “Or a video with, like, 1 million girls!” Agus interjects, sending the room into hysterics.

In both their sound and visuals, PILF are straining to dress their microwaved instincts with a more mainstream sensibility. The results are uneven, and sometimes generic. Judging by the unreleased music they played me in the studio, however, they're finding a way to elevate their psycho impulses to arena grandeur. One track juddered with extreme vibrato; another was a feverish collaboration between Zell and boolymon, with a “ZELL Y BOOLYMON” hook that tore out of the speakers like a neon claw. They're working on a tune with the tantalizingly trembly enzocerobulto, the “GOAT of the Argentina underground” per turro, and would like to collaborate with Modo Diablo, the trio of Duki, Neo Pistea, and YSY A. “That would be the only PILF fit—or a Korean band, like BTS,” Agus says. Agus and Stiffy aren't done with Swaggerboyz, either; they're plotting a new tape all about them growing up.

It's impressive how influential these four dropouts have managed to become at their age. Fans swarm PILF shows with bandanas and long hair like Agus and Stiffy. turro recently returned to his school, the one he not too long ago dropped out of, to talk about his career, and claimed the kids were fitted like them.

“We are like heroes in the underground,” Zell tells me proudly. “It's beautiful that people are dressing like us.” “It's like you are looking like yourself, but young,” Agus adds. I mentioned “Swaggerboyz” to dozens of people on my trip, and everyone was amused—either they loved them or thought they were clowns. But everyone knew them.

I asked PILF what their families think of their rise.

“My mom is my number one fan,” Zell says with a sheepish expression.

“My mom is also my fan,” turro smirks. I later learn that turrobaby is the son of the poet Cecilia Pavón. Only a few years ago, turro was writing political analysis about the conditions that led to Milei and literary criticism for the magazine Revista Jennifer. His turn from culture critic to trashy rotslop rapper broke my brain a little, but he acts like his path was destiny.

At the end of our convo, we spill out into a rocky little patio-garage with a motorcycle, the boys posing for photos and passing a joint. For now, it's time to eat asado and bounce to the tour van.

Twelve hours earlier, late afternoon, I'm sitting around a table with Candela Mattera and Laura Ferreira, who make dance pop as EQ. While their music couldn't be further from the profane filth of PILF, both groups are linked inside the incestuous ouroboros of this local and global, increasingly country- and genre-hybridized underground. They've been to each other's shows and they're friends, both groups coming up in Buenos Aires' post-COVID milieu.

Ferreira wears a funereal black hat gifted from her mother, a black graphic top, and a patchwork skirt with a chunky belt. Mattera's also in all-black with a Betty-Boop-themed motorcyclist purse. We're at the pretty and pastel Merienda Cafe in the Palermo Soho neighborhood in the north of Buenos Aires. The waitress gives us impossibly huge menus that look like brochures for a Great Gatsby weekend getaway package.

Qiri

Estratosfera and Qiri

Politics come up a lot faster in this conversation, as EQ describes how they think the current underground Buenos Aires scene has diminished slightly compared to that thrilling moment a few years ago. “Our president Javier Milei, that fucking fascist, he won,” Ferreira shoots. “I think a lot of cultural paradigms [here have] shifted to the right. As soon as he won, a lot of venues got shut down.” They pointed to the venue Maquinal as a frequent target of police raids and shutdowns. They were supposed to DJ at another venue for Pride, but it got shut down last minute.

Like any major city, Buenos Aires has a network of venues. Among them is Local Support in Palermo, which Agus described to me as for the ""starter underground."" “You know Pokémon? That's like the lobby when you spawn,” he explained. There's also the popular Niceto Club, a pit stop for every rising artist in the scene. Despite the political and economic situation, the city seems to be a fizzling motherboard of activity, with a host of gender- and genre-oscillating underground parties like Popperosa! and Kioskera.

EQ met online, during COVID, amid what Mattera describes as the worst year of her life. At one point, she tried to learn skateboarding and had an accident that required cold metal rods be inserted into her wrists. “I thought she tried to kill herself when she posted that, I was like, what the fuck?” Ferreira says. “I was milking that shit online,” Mattera giggles. “I was always quoting the Bladee lyric, ‘I broke my wrist, I gotta ice it.' That was my shit.” They didn't meet in person until 2021, at a Halloween show, where Mattera dressed as a juggalo and Ferreira a vampire.

Like PILF, their music doesn't rage violently against the machine. But instead of the vulgar pleasures of blown-out bass and MILF worship, EQ opt for delicate club distraction. They tingle the cochlear nerves with ringlets of ASMR vocals and tasteful sub-bass. And unlike PILF, EQ are bigger abroad than at home; they've made music with the Canadian producer CFCF and the British club pop darling Shygirl. “Boytoy,” one of the most shivery-sexy songs of 2024, unfurls like a finger tracing the nape of your neck. Ferreira, who performs as Estratosfera (the “E” to Mattera's “Q,” Qiri), sings about the zygote stage of a relationship when everything's red-hot with possibility. That was the first song they made, and it became the opener for their self-titled debut EP.

Mattera has been playing music her whole life, singing “when I was wearing diapers, basically,” and taking classical opera singing and piano lessons. She studied electroacoustic experimental composition at the National University of Arts for six years, before dropping out. Ferreira also gave the National University of Arts a shot, quitting three months in.

E and Q rolled into one partly because Ferreira wanted to learn how to produce on Ableton. Her government-subsidized laptop in high school couldn't handle anything beyond stock plugins, but Qiri had a fully functional PC. “Boytoy” came out of a period where they'd meet up to work on music, attend parties and have sleepovers.

They're party girls but also production nerds who know how to manipulate negative space so every bauble of bass glitters just right. “You can be a baddie or whatever, but we're also the brains,” Ferreira elaborates. “In pop music, because of the patriarchy, the popstar is this woman that's like an object of desire. And then the person that maybe makes most of the music is just some guy—and I hate that so much. You can tell when an instrumental is done by a woman. When I listen to New York, for example, even without their vocals, you can just tell. It was clear for us that we had to make that.”

This is deconstructed sleaze, rewiring and blurring SOPHIE and PC Music's concepts of fake products and hyper-emotion. “I feel like someone, Getty image stunt,” Ferreira cries ecstatically on “B.S.A.S.,” imagining the act of becoming as a stock photo, a single-shot climax of airbrushed perfection. Their lyrics conjure up American frat parties spilling with Solos, but the compulsively organized, curlicue-fine music sounds like the last thing you'd hear at Alpha Delta Phi.

Their sensibility has paid off. “Boytoy” became a small hit online, escaping the confines of Argentina, and the pseudo-stock photos they made as art went viral. Because of the way the internet is baked into their sonic DNA, they feel unmoored from any specific place. “I feel more in touch with a global modern art underground scene, with people like Babymorocco and Frost Children,” Mattera says. “I feel like we have already had a little taste of everything in Buenos Aires' local scene.”

I haven't had a taste, though, so they agree to take me to Niceto Club in Palermo for a show by rapper-turned-synthpopper K4 and the “transfeminist noise-punk” band Blanco Teta, hosted by the indie label EQ works with, Fractura. Inside, the women seem to know everyone we pass. On the floor, hundreds of people convulse to Blanco Teta's ravenous yowls and monster-truck basslines off their July album La debacle de las divas. Onstage, Violeta García grasps a cello striking profane sounds that do not seem like they should spawn from that gracefully curved instrument. Despite the “POR FAVOR NO FUMAR” signs, lit ends pierce the darkness everywhere.

Next, we hop in a car and head to the city center. Along the way, Ferreira and Mattera name some of their homegrown influences: Gustavo Cerati, the supernatural singer-songwriter Juana Molina and composer Daniel Melero. Mattera tells me the punk band Fun People introduced her to bilingual singing, which became a core element of EQ. We circle around the Obelisk, a skinny relic of Argentine modernism built to celebrate 400 years since the founding of Buenos Aires.

Earlier, Mattera and Ferreira reminisced on attending the first-ever Swaggerboyz show in 2022, as part of something called Schizophrenic Fest. ""They literally played the tracks out of YouTube from the mixer, then their mics on top with no chain, just direct output, which was fucking hilarious. It sounded like shit, the venue was shit. There was like 100 people—crazy 16-year-olds,” Ferreira remembered. “Stiffy brought his whole family. I remember seeing his grandfather and his mom rooting for him from the crowd, it was very cute to witness,” added Mattera.

The chaotic event was personally inspiring to the duo, who had just become friends and were excited to see a new generation burst to life after COVID. In a recording online, you can see a younger Mattera bouncing gleefully with a white hat and bunny ears in the pit. The venues are bigger now, but the scene's attitude is still as delightfully homegrown. The communal spirit hasn't fallen apart, even as it spills across the internet and wider world.

“We're ruining a whole generation,” AgusFortnite2008 told me, grinning. “Or saving it.”

Donald Trump has been a major supporter of the coal industry since he entered American politics and donned a hard hat at his “Trump Digs Coal” rally in 2016. It's been part of his attempt to build an image as a populist, and he's repeatedly said he's going to revive the industry and bring back coal jobs. It was apparently with this goal in mind that the president last week ordered the Pentagon to purchase coal energy.


	“I will sign an executive order that directs the Department of War to work directly with coal plants on the new power purchasing agreements, ensuring that we have more reliable power and stronger and more resilient grid power and we're going to be buying a lot of coal through the military now,” Trump said at a signing ceremony last Wednesday.


	The coal industry has been in decline for well over a decade, partially because natural gas started out-competing coal after the fracking boom. At the same time, the cost of renewable energy has plummeted over the past 15 years, making it cheaper than coal energy. In short, coal has become one of the most expensive forms of energy in the U.S.

	Trump says he's going to bring back coal jobs, but that's pretty unlikely. Beyond the fact that coal is economically not the right choice for new energy infrastructure, many of the jobs in coal that used to be done by humans are now done by robots and machines. Automation came for the industry, and the jobs aren't coming back. 


	Costa Samaras, director of the Carnegie Mellon University Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, tells Rolling Stone that Trump's plan to make the Pentagon buy coal doesn't make much sense.

	











	“On its face, this doesn't seem like a viable strategy for military installation energy resilience,” Samaras says. “It looks more like a strategy to have the government intervene in energy markets to prop up a favored fuel source that largely can't compete economically.”


	Erin Sikorsky, director of the Center for Climate and Security, a climate change research institute, agrees — noting the cost of bringing new coal power to military bases “would be enormous.”

	“There's nothing prohibiting the military from buying coal if it wanted to,” she says. “If it made economic sense or energy sense for them, they could do that. The fact that they're not doing it suggests the cost is too high.”


	Military bases typically run on the same grid as their surrounding communities. Outside of some bases in Alaska, the military isn't getting a ton of energy straight from coal plants. Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, says Trump's plan to force them to would be “costly, backwards-looking and probably harmful,” noting that the price of coal power has stayed relatively steady over the past couple of decades while the cost of natural gas and renewable energy has gotten cheaper.


	Between 2010 to 2020, for example, the cost of solar energy plummeted from roughly $378 per megawatt hour of electricity to around $68. Coal remained at around $100 over the same time period.


	The Department of Defense said in a statement provided to Rolling Stone that it “fully supports” Trump's executive order, and that it will “seek to procure long-term Power Purchase Agreements with coal-fired facilities where they enhance grid reliability, prevent blackouts, and ensure mission assurance for critical defense and intelligence operations.”


	While Trump is working to prop up the coal industry, he's also doing what he can to kneecap the renewable energy industry. Since he retook office last year, Trump's administration has stripped funding from renewable energy projects, and even tried to cancel renewable energy projects that are already in progress. The Environmental Protection Agency also recently revoked the “endangerment finding,” a landmark scientific conclusion that served as the basis for federal climate regulation.

	Samaras says the administration is going about this all wrong. 


	“The top line is that the administration is restricting the growth of new clean energy supply and canceling investments in grid resilience … at the same time that artificial intelligence is spiking energy demand,” Samaras says. “We need a generational reinvestment in grid resilience to make sure our communities and our military installations have reliable and affordable power.”

	











	Samaras says that simply because of market realities it is likely that solar, wind, and battery power will represent “90 percent or more” of any new power capacity added to the grid in coming years. The Trump administration can try to stop renewable energy, but it can't change the math.

	While Trump tries to keep coal alive, the rest of the industrialized world is gradually moving away from fossil fuels. Trump and his allies love to cite that China is still building coal plants, but the nation is also building a ton of renewable energy, and coal energy use is declining in the country. China simply sees coal power as a decent backup in case of an energy emergency.


	“Smarter national leaders elsewhere are investing in clean energy with more jobs, more flexibility and a lower cost,” Kammen says. “It is like having a president playing checkers while everyone else is playing chess.”

	Few things unite people on the internet these days but if there's one thing that can bring social media together, it's a heartwarming animal video.


	That's why Twitter users have been quick to rally around Punch, a six-month-old baby macaque monkey from Japan who found solace in a stuffed toy after he was rejected by his mother after birth.

Another video of a macaque with a heartbreaking storyThis toy replaced his mother for the little one.We don't pay for the internet to cry 😭💔 https://t.co/E15UTdBZM6 pic.twitter.com/IVvxhPDeI1


	Punch (or Punch-kun in Japanese) was born in July at the Ichikawa City Zoo in Chiba, and has been hand-reared and hand-fed by zookeepers since being abandoned by his mother and her troop. Other monkeys in his enclosure have been similarly hostile, leaving poor Punch to fend for himself when not under the watchful eye of his handlers.


	Fortunately, the zookeepers found a solution, purchasing a stuffed animal to keep Punch company. His companion of choice: an orange plush orangutan from IKEA.











		Though it's not quite a stand-in for his mother, the IKEA monkey offers a similarly cuddly and furry companion for Punch (or others) to snuggle up to. Its long arms let the plush orangutan hang from your shoulders or around your waist (a velcro fastening lets you press its hands and feet together).	


	At 14 inches in height, it's just a tad smaller than a female macaque, which can range from 15-20 inches in size depending on the species. But Punch doesn't seem to mind, with videos from the zoo showing him curling up with the plush toy when sleeping, or dragging it around his enclosure during the day time.




	IKEA says its toy orangutan is made from a polyester shell with a recycled polyester fiber filling. Either Punch has been super gentle (doubtful if the photos are to be believed) or the plush animal is super durable, because we have yet to see any of the stuffy's stuffing fall out.




	You can pick up the orange monkey toy now for $19.99 at IKEA.com. We recommend adding to cart while it's still in stock — like all viral toys and merch, the IKEA DJUNGELSKOG Orangutan is expected to sell out soon. 


	While IKEA hasn't officially confirmed that the zookeepers purchased their stuffed toy, the furniture store's social media handles have been replying to posts about the orangutan in the affirmative. The word Djungelskog by the way, is Swedish for “jungle forest.”



本日ご来園された皆様に心より御礼を申し上げます。スタッフ一同これまで経験したことのない想定外の賑わいに大変驚いています。ゲート通過に時間を要し大変申し訳ありませんでした。来週の三連休に向け、快適に楽しんでいただけるよう準備を進めてまいります。#市川市動植物園#がんばれパンチ pic.twitter.com/PDCTM9sbI6


	You can follow little Punch's exploits through the Ichikawa Zoo's social media channels. The zoo says visitors to the park have significantly increased since Punch went viral, writing that the staff is “Greatly surprised by the unprecedented and unexpected crowds we experienced.”


	Punch is lucky to be cared for by the Japanese zookeepers — most baby monkeys who are rejected by their mothers or troops in the wild face almost certain death, as they aren't able to find food or shelter on their own.

	As the celebrity children of the 2010s come of age and follow in their parents' footsteps, we've arrived at the next generation of nepo babies. There's no better example right now than North West, scion of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's celebrity empire, who, at 12 years old, seems poised to become a fixture in the future of not only music but also fashion. Take her recent single, “Piercing on My Hand,” which arrived on DSPs on Feb. 6, and was reported as a soul-sampled track produced by Ye and Will Frenchman. The single was reportedly released via Gamma., the independent music company co-founded by former Apple exec Larry Jackson in 2023 — the same company Ye recently partnered with for the release of his upcoming album, Bully. She also joined her dad onstage in Mexico City to debut “Piercing on My Hand” live. It's a position that's by now familiar for North, who previously appeared on Ye and Ty Dolla $ign's Vultures single “Talking/Once Again,” which reached Number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also charted in the U.K.

	











	Perhaps this all represents a maximalist approach to the challenge of raising kids in the public eye. While it's common to see celebrities attempt, with varying levels of success, to shield their children from the limelight, North has been slowly learning how to navigate being born into fame. This week, People reported that her mom, Kim Kardashian, filed applications in January to trademark the company name “NOR11” for use in the sale of clothing and accessories, including dresses, footwear, loungewear, hats, watches, jewelry, handbags, and cosmetics cases. North has already gained attention for her sense of style, raising eyebrows after revealing piercings on her middle finger last September, prompting online criticism because of her age. Her debut single is partly inspired by the controversy.

	In addition to “Piercing on My Hand,” North has since racked up a handful of production credits for the underground rap staple Babyxsosa, including “Tokyo” and “Viral,” released as loosies on social platforms last month. The latter samples Chief Keef's “Love Sosa” with a kind of dense, atmospheric texture that also recalls “Hold My Liquor,” the Chief Keef-assisted cut from Kanye's 2013 opus Yeezus. North West's producer tag, an anime voice squeaking “North-Chan” in Japanese with the sweetness of a kids' video game, is already on its way to becoming iconic. In January, she landed a notable early placement as a producer on “Justswagup,” a single by Mag!c and Lil Novi — Lil Wayne's son, who is 16 years old, putting him, like North, squarely in the “next-gen rap royalty” conversation.

	Last month, North went on Instagram Live and answered questions from her followers about her journey learning how to make music, sharing snippets of in-progress beats, and describing more about her inspirations. That she's so far leaned into the sound of her generational cohort, a frenetic, almost hyperpop-infused take on hip-hop, is more evidence of the genre's changing sound. For their part, both of North's parents are offering their support. On Monday, Kim Kardashian shared a clip on her Instagram of her listening to North's song in the car, despite what would appear to be ongoing acrimony between Ye and Kim. 


	North is less a carbon copy of her parents than a Gen Alpha translation. At 12 years old, she was raised in the feed, is fluent in online culture, and is learning early that identity is something you can iterate in public. The nepo-baby conversation, which typically ascribes unearned privilege and access to the children of celebs, falls short of describing what's actually interesting about North West. She represents how childhood, branding, and art are collapsing into a single timeline, and she is already moving through it like it's her native language.

	In a “Valentine's Day statement” shared on social media, Antonia Teixeira, the wife of the Lemonheads co-founder Evan Dando, addressed the allegations that the musician sent a fan unsolicited videos of himself masturbating before being hospitalized for mental-health treatment.


	Teixeira said that in the weeks leading up to the incident, the frontman was “struggling with heavy drinking, prescription-drug abuse, and a serious mental-health episode.” She said that during this period, Dando “engaged in inappropriate online exchanges.”


	While Teixeira said he believed he was participating in “consensual sexual messaging,” that belief “does not excuse his behavior” and that she was “not minimizing what happened.” 


	Last week, news broke that a fan identified as “Dawn” on journalist Tony Ortega's substack, The Underground Bunker, claimed she had reached out to Dando in social media DMs in October to congratulate him on releasing Love Chant, the Lemonheads' first album of original music since 2006's The Lemonheads. Dando allegedly replied, “Cool I'm sorry I'm an exhibitionist,” and the following day sent her an unwanted video of himself masturbating.

	Dando, who lives in Brazil with Teixeira and is a stepfather to her three children, was later admitted to a local hospital to receive help from mental-health professionals, his rep previously told Rolling Stone.Teixeira said that she has reached out to the woman who made the allegations to apologize and said, “No one deserves to receive unwanted sexual content, and I am sincerely sorry for the distress this caused.” She said Dando agreed to enter treatment prior to the claims becoming public and is now in rehab to address his substance abuse and mental health.


	“I have made it clear that continuing treatment is essential, and I will make decisions that protect myself if he does not follow through,” Teixeira continued. “I am not defending his actions. They hurt me deeply. At the same time, I believe addiction and mental illness can lead to destructive behavior that requires accountability and professional help.” She added, “I hope there can be room for both responsibility and compassion as he takes steps toward recovery.”

	On the day Dando's rep confirmed the artist had checked into a hospital in Brazil, Teixeira spoke with Billboard and told the publication that the couple had traveled from their home in São Paulo to New York City for the Lemonheads' appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Jan. 20, which was followed by a Tiny Desk episode in Washington, D.C. However, Teixeira said, “that day, he was totally out of his mind,” adding, “So out of his mind, that the Tiny Desk won't be aired.”


	“I'm very mad, because he betrayed me,” Teixeira said when discussing discovering the alleged unsolicited videos. Teixeira said she believes the video was messaged to the wrong woman. “From what I'm looking [at] now, it wasn't … he doesn't remember what he did,” she said. “He was in a mental meltdown.”

	During Raye‘s This Tour May Contain New Music stop in Paris on Sunday, Feb. 15, 65 ticket holders were reportedly turned away and left stranded outside her concert at Accor Arena.


	The singer took to social media on Tuesday to address the Ticketmaster fumble. “I am completely devastated for the 65 ticket holders who were turned down from entering our Paris show on Sunday night,” wrote Raye on Instagram Stories the following Tuesday. “This is completely unacceptable and wrong.”


	Raye said she was told there was a “system error” at Ticketmaster, which led to the tickets not being “fully validated when they were purchased.” Despite the issue being “outside of anything I could control,” the artist said she felt “saddened and let down” by the blunder. She added that “everyone affected was refunded and given a voucher from Ticketmaster,” while also offering all 65 people who were denied entry complimentary tickets to any of her future shows and a signed vinyl.


	“I know this doesn't even remotely make up for this mess, but it's all I can think of in this moment to soften the blow,” she said before ending her note. “My deepest apologies to those of you affected.”

	In a statement to Rolling Stone, a Ticketmaster spokesperson acknowledged that a “small number of fans experienced a technical issue when entering the show.” The rep said, “While we know it doesn't replace the show, we have fully refunded those affected and provided a gift card.”


	Back in November, Olivia Dean delivered a scathing criticism of Ticketmaster, Live Nation, and AEG over resale ticket prices. “You are providing a disgusting service. The prices at which you're allowing tickets to be re-sold is vile and completely against our wishes,” she wrote in a social media post at the time. “Live music should be affordable and accessible, and we need to find a new way of making that possible. BE BETTER.”

	Dean's denouncement arrived about two months after the Federal Trade Commission and seven states sued Live Nation and Ticketmaster (the companies merged in 2010) and accused the country's biggest concert promoter and ticketing website of allowing scalpers to amass millions of tickets so they can be resold on Ticketmaster's own resale platforms at steep markups to customers.

Former President Barack Obama recently said he believes aliens are real — but clarified that he has never seen one and does not believe they are being held at Area 51.

In a Feb. 15 Instagram post, Obama expanded on earlier podcast comments, saying that “the odds are good there's life out there,” citing the vastness of the universe. However, he added that he believes the chances Earth has been visited by aliens are slim.

That leaves a lingering question: Where are the aliens?

The National UFO Reporting Center collects reports of unexplained flying objects and unidentified anomalous phenomena for investigation. Since its founding in 1974, the organization says it has processed more than 180,000 reports nationwide.

In New York state alone, the center has logged 6,309 UFO and UAP sighting reports.

The earliest reported New York sighting dates back to 1790 in Carlisle.

According to the database, the unnamed witness — whose account was submitted in 2007 — described seeing what was believed to be a meteor while playing the fiddle outside on a summer night.

“The meteor as I shall now call it, was about 300 yards long in a serpentine shape, excepting the head which resembled the root of a tree plucked up by force,” the witness wrote. “It had no appearance of a neck, the body was thick as a bullock, tapering off like a serpent at the end of the tail.”

The most recent report was filed Feb. 5 in Poughkeepsie. The witness said they saw three bright lights forming what appeared to be a “V-shaped craft” while driving near the Route 44/55 exit to the Hudson Bridge on Route 9. No explanation was listed in the report.

While thousands of sightings have been reported in New York, many have later been attributed to planets, stars, aircraft or even Chinese lanterns.

For now, though, the question of where the aliens are remains unanswered.

Following online rumors about a possible UFO speech by President Donald Trump, his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said he has mentioned a speech that may involve extraterrestrial life.

Lara Trump acknowledged online chatter about a rumored speech by the president on unidentified flying objects, saying on her show, The Right View, that she had seen claims suggesting he had a UFO address “queued up.” 

However, although no evidence has emerged that such a speech is planned, in a video shared on X, she said: “I think my father‑in‑law actually said it. There is some speech he has that I guess at the right time he's gonna break out, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life.”

Rumors of a coming announcement intensified earlier this month after British writer and ufologist Mark Christopher Lee circulated claims that a historic disclosure was imminent—assertions Newsweek could not verify.

Newsweek previously noted that Donald Trump expressed skepticism about UFOs in 2024, saying he had never been “a believer,” which provides context for current rumors that do not present corroborating evidence.

Lee told Newsweek in an email that “a Washington insider” had claimed the president had prepared a historic speech acknowledging extraterrestrial visitation and recovered non‑human materials and craft, though Lee did not identify the source or provide evidence of their access.

Lee said: “A Washington insider I have known personally and conducted business with—has repeatedly affirmed that President Trump has prepared a historic speech acknowledging extraterrestrial visitation and the existence of recovered non-human materials and craft.” 

According to Newsweek's review of Lee's social media posts, he has said the rumored remarks would reference a number of incidents dating back to the 1947 Roswell event, and would outline steps toward declassification and international cooperation. 

Newsweek reported that Lee pointed to July 8—coinciding with the anniversary of the Roswell incident—as a possible date for the rumored announcement, while also saying it could occur sooner: “The planned date remains July 8, 2026, marking the 79th anniversary of the Roswell incident, though momentum is building rapidly.”

At the time of publication, the White House has not announced a UFO-related address and hasn't given an on‑the‑record response to the rumors, leaving no confirmed timetable for any such speech about UFOs.

More from The Sun

A MASSIVE UFO is hiding in plain sight in a secret overseas location, according to bombshell claims by a United States congressman.

Rep Eric Burlison said on Monday that the facility is “guarded like it's some kind of commodity” and has previously claimed that Donald Trump has been “fully briefed” on the existence of aliens.

He added that the US president has also been made aware of alien-human hybrids allegedly living on Earth today.

The lawmaker claims that an entire building has had to be built around the immovable flying saucer, which theorists believe to be on the outskirts of Seoul, South Korea.

Investigative journalist Ross Coulthart made the original claim that the United States had possession of the extraterrestrial craft in an interview on the Project Unit Podcast last November.

Several UFO blogs and satellite sleuths have since pointed to the mysterious South Korean structure – which sits atop a mountain and is roughly 270 feet in diameter.

It is rumored to house a massive crashed or landed extraterrestrial craft that was reportedly too large to transport, leading to a building being constructed around it for concealment.

But a South Korean researcher has disputed the claims, saying the facility dates back to the 1970s and has no connection to UFOs.

He added that many such aviation installations exist across the country.

Joe Rogan and other prominent podcasters have popularised the claims, which have gained notoriety in the UFO/UAP – Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena – communities as the alleged “Coulthart UFO/UAP Site”.

Now Burlison, who did not confirm that he was referring to that location, says bureaucratic hurdles are making it difficult to ratify the theory. 

The lawmaker acknowledged that he had no first-hand proof, sharing that the information had been cobbled together from accounts he has heard from government and non-official sources.

“I'm not going to mention the country because I heard of it inside of a closed setting, and I want to protect my classification level,” Burlison said, during an interview on Newsmax's Finnerty.

He added that the object is “not in the facility that's been widely reported in the news” and pushed back on speculation about its location.

Burlison also blasted the “insurmountable” task of accessing UAP-related sites near his Washington DC office.

He pointed the finger at congressional bureaucracy and claimed that committees “love turning each other down”.

But despite the barriers Burlison is committed to finding evidence of extraterrestrial life.

He said: “If I come under any hard evidence, whether it's physical or video evidence that is absolutely definitive, I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe.”

He added that no government has a right to withhold such information from its citizens.

Burlison has previously been granted access to secure locations across the US, such as the infamous Area 51, which have decade-old ties to UFOs and secretive government projects.

Despite the US government and Pentagon officially denying that proof of alien life has been recovered, Congress has heard whistleblowers' claims about secret state programs.

Burlison said that Trump has been informed of UFOs recovered by the military since the 1940s and alien life on Earth.

Former President Barack Obama made headlines this week when he made the bombshell claim that “aliens are real”.

He said: “They're real but I haven't seen them.

“They're not being kept in Area 51. There's no underground facility.”

Before he joked: “Unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

Obama later posted a clarifying statement on his Instagram, writing: “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there.

“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”

Oil, Ice, And The Strange Science Of Freezing.","https://twistedsifter.com/2026/02/if-it-gets-cold-enough-everything-can-freeze-or-can-it-oil-ice-and-the-strange-science-of-freezing/?amp=1","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 14:49:32 GMT","

Whether the temperatures are dropping outside or you're placing ice cube trays in the freezer, everyone knows that once water drops to 0°C (32°F), it will freeze.

This is because, as the heat energy leaves the water, the atoms and molecules slow down and condense closer together. Maxim Lavrentovich is an Assistant Professor of Theoretical Biophysics at the University of Tennessee, and he explained what is happening:

“Whether in plants and animals or rocks, foams and ice crystals, the intricate patterns that happen in nature come down to what's happening at the level of atoms and molecules. When water freezes, its molecules begin clustering together. Water molecules have a particular bent shape that causes them to stack into clusters shaped like hexagons as they freeze.”

It is this crystalline pattern that allows all water (with a few odd exceptions) to freeze at the set temperature.

This is not the case for all materials. Molecules of oil, for example, do not form the same clean crystalline shapes as the temperature goes down.

Shutterstock

This means that, unlike water, most oils do not freeze at a set point. Instead, they will become more and more viscous the colder they get. Even when oil is so cold that it seems solid, it is still not frozen in the same way that water is.

The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign explains what is happening in these cases:

“Eventually, if you get it cold enough, the oil will seem to be quite solid, as the molecules lose the energy needed to move around. In that sense, you can say that oil does in fact freeze, but it has no sharply defined freezing point, like water. Glass is similar, in that it gets soft and eventually quite fluid as it is heated, but there is no one sharp melting temperature. The molecules get stuck when cold, but not in any simple regular arrangement.”

This is much more than just an interesting science fact that could win you points on trivia night. Most people experience the results of oil's properties on a daily basis.

Your car engine (and millions of other products that require lubrication) uses oil to reduce friction. If oil froze in the same way that water does, when the temperatures outside hit a certain point, trying to start your car would be impossible, as the oil would freeze it up.

Of course, in very cold weather, the oil does become thicker and more viscous, which means your car's engine has to work harder to get things moving than it would in hot weather. This can even result in slight damage to the internal parts of the engine, especially if you start your vehicle and immediately start driving aggressively.

Shutterstock

Fortunately, modern engines heat up quickly and bring the temperature of the oil up to a safe level. It is, however, recommended that you let your car run for a minute before driving in extremely cold temperatures, and for the first several miles of driving, you accelerate more slowly than normal to help minimize any negative impact.

The science behind oil and how it reacts to temperature is incredible.

Netflix has announced new animated series “Bass X Machina” for the Halloween season, starring Oscar, Emmy, and Tony Award nominee Brian Tyree Henry (Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire).

“Bass X Machina” will debut on Netflix on October 6, 2026.

The series is set “in a lawless Steampunk West overrun by brutal outlaws, machines, and supernatural terrors, a father is forced to become judge, jury, and executioner—knowing that every act of justice meant to protect his family may ultimately cost him the very people he's fighting to save.”

Joining Brian Tyree Henry, who plays Bass and also executive produces, in the voice cast are Janelle Monáe (Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Hidden Figures) as Glory, Tati Gabrielle (The Last of Us, YOU) as Dana, Cree Summer (Voltron: Legendary Defender, Sabrina: The Animated Series) as Ahni, Chaske Spencer (Teacup, The Twilight Saga) as Lighthorse, Currie Graham (Reacher, Assault on Precinct 13) as Rivenbark, and Starletta DuPois (One Battle After Another, The Notebook, Big Momma's House) as Etta.

The first look images give a closer look at Henry's character, but not much else. It remains unclear just what supernatural terrors will await.

The animation for “Bass x Machina” will be done by South Korea's Studio Mir. The series will also feature original music by Roman GianArthur and Nate Wonder at Wondaland.

“Bass X Machina” will join Netflix's substantial animation slate, which includes Emmy-winning “Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft” and “Devil May Cry.”

If there was a prize for best book title, Lally Katz's new memoir would win hands down. The playwright and screenwriter has just published My Cursed Vagina, a memoir of her search for love – and, by extension, her vagina. It's not as sordid as it might sound, but it is extraordinarily candid. And very funny.

When Katz appears on my screen over Zoom from LA (born in the US, she moved to Australia as a child, and relocated to LA several years ago), I open our interview with a question I've never asked anyone before.

How is her vagina? “You know what? It's going pretty well,” she says. “They're all going to conk out eventually, but for now, the vagina is going pretty good.”

A prolific playwright, Katz has long mined her personal life for her creative output. Among the 50 or so plays she has written, including A Golem Story and Neighbourhood Watch, two have earned her the Victorian Premier's Literary Prize, and she's earned several Green Room awards. She wrote the libretto for Kate Miller-Heidke's Helpmann Award-winning 2015 opera The Rabbits, and she's written for television – everything from Wentworth to the recent adaptation of Shaun Tan's Tales From Outer Suburbia and the comedy-crime series Sunny Nights – and has sold several TV pilots to US studios.

But whatever she's working on, Katz is collecting stories from her own life – no matter how intimate or embarrassing. The impetus for the memoir came from her 2013 one-woman show Stories I Want to Tell You In Person, which toured extensively and was adapted for an ABC TV production. She wrote “about a third” of it before other projects overtook it.

In 2016, she relocated to LA for fresh adventures, hoping to find her soulmate and make it as a screenwriter in Hollywood. When her agent discovered the contract for the memoir a couple of years ago, they asked Katz if she wanted to get out of the deal.

“I was like no, I want to do it! And they still wanted it, 12 years later,” she says. And by this time, Katz had even more material – 15 years' worth of adventures and anecdotes. The embodiment of “doing it for the anecdote”. Katz will go with many situations in service of the plot, and once said, “everything I do, I do to get a story, learn about a character or have an experience that I can write about”.

She doesn't keep a diary, per se, but she does write everything down. Everything. “And with things I've done that with, I remember everything, detail for detail.”

Stories I Want To Tell You in Person was autobiographical, but very gentle compared to the tales in My Cursed Vagina. “The first third of it is stuff I had in the stage show and then life keeps going – and the stage show was much more wholesome,” says Katz.

Katz re-tells the story of the curse at the centre of that show. In 2010, while in New York on a Churchill Fellowship for playwriting, she visited a shopfront psychic, Cookie, who told Katz her love life was cursed. The curse, Cookie said, was keeping Katz from having it all, but she could thwart it with large sums of (her Fellowship) money. On that visit, she'd already blown through most of her grant and didn't have enough cash, so the curse remained. Katz came back to Australia, immortalising Cookie in Stories I Want To Tell You In Person.

On a subsequent visit to New York, Katz went back to Cookie (don't worry, she knows psychics aren't real; she just can't help herself) who revealed that it wasn't just her love life that was cursed, it was, in fact, her vagina, which “smells like rotting corpses to all men”.

Naturally, Katz paid to lift the curse.

Already a self-confessed neurotic though, she began to frame her romantic misadventures – and other aspects of her life – through the curse.

There's her slightly cringe-inducing relationship with a Melbourne partner (most of the names in the book are changed), her illness from an ovarian cyst (surely the curse), and her creative journey as a writer.

But mostly the memoir is a tour of Katz's dating life, the minutiae of which she compulsively records. Even as she's breaking up with someone, she'll snap some photos to remember the details. One-night stands are memorialised on her phone – pictures of the bedside tables, the messy bed.

When her show took Katz to Mexico, she stopped over in Texas, bought some hotpants on a whim, and joined Tinder. After meeting a man, and desperately hoping it would evolve into true love (again), a plot twist emerges.

Hilariously, Katz whispers it now, so her husband, who is working at home, won't hear. “The herpes”.

Her husband, whose name is changed in the book, hasn't read the memoir, but does know about the herpes. As does anyone who encounters Katz. Within minutes of a doctor telling her she needn't tell anyone about her virus, Katz immediately tells her brother. A week later, she's “told most people I know that have herpes. And some people I don't know.”

“I've always, always been an oversharer,” Katz says. When we talk, her mum is still reading the book. “It's hard for her,” Katz says with a laugh, but her dad read it in one day and loved it.

“My dad is surprisingly fine. He's always been very blasé about that stuff. As soon as I got herpes, I called my parents. They were like, ‘oh, it's no big deal', and they were Googling it and like, ‘oh interesting, you've got the kind that's usually cold sores'. They were totally involved in the journey of it – there's nothing that's news to them.”

The virus doesn't stop Katz's search for true love and the “three children and success” that Cookie predicted.

“That there was no way I didn't want to tell this as the truth, as it had been for me. Once I got herpes I was telling every single person and so many people had it! I realised, oh, there's so much shame around it. If we all just sort of talked about that, it wouldn't be this big thing,” Katz says. “I felt like there was no way to tell (this memoir) without … explicit detail. But it is like … the first part of the book is like, ‘oh, ok' – and then bang. It's on!'

Eventually, Katz's search for love is fruitful, and there's even a Vegas wedding (with some drama, of course.)

And married life did not quash her need to overshare; when she and her husband try for a baby, there are two miscarriages, and Katz details in visceral detail how she examined what she expelled from her body.

“The publishers sent me a couple of reader reviews, and they were … OK with it, but it is graphic. When I read it now I'm like … I'd definitely do it again, but I was in a state,” she says. “Maybe not all women do that,” she says, laughing. “But maybe some do? You've had this thing in your body, this thing that you've got such a connection with, and then it's … coming out. I was just compelled to find out.”

Now living in LA's suburbs with her husband and seven-year-old son – “I think my next book will be called ‘soccer mom'” – Katz is working on a play for MTC, co-writing a romcom with comedian Josh Thomas, still writing for TV and finding stories in everyone she meets. “The neighbours now tell me when they have a story about someone.” she says.

Surely she's considered a TV adaptation of My Cursed Vagina? “I would love that! I'd love the book to have as much life as possible,” Katz says. And given she's already sold a pilot in the US called Herpes, Hollywood should cope with the title of this one.

“I'm not sure how the title would go down here, but you know what? I'm going to do it.”

My Cursed Vagina (Allen & Unwin) by Lally Katz, is out now.

More than six years after Jeffrey Epstein died in a federal jail cell, the US government remains engaged in a sweeping cover-up. Millions of documents related to Epstein's criminal enterprise remain unreleased. Charging records from the 2008 Florida case and the 2019 federal prosecution are still being withheld. The Department of Justice has refused to unredact the names of Epstein's associates and co-conspirators, in defiance of the law governing the document release. Even the so-called “unredacted” files remain inaccessible to the public and are viewable only by a small number of members of Congress, where they are still redacted in any case.

At the same time, the Justice Department claims it has found no evidence of a broader criminal network and has brought forward not a single new charge, despite documentary proof that Epstein continued to operate internationally after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

Under these conditions, the major US newspapers have intervened to contain growing mass anger over the Epstein cover-up. In a coordinated fashion, the New York Times and the Washington Post have sought to recast mounting outrage over Epstein's crimes and his protection by the ruling class as a problem of “conspiracy theories,” thereby shielding the financial oligarchy and the police institutions that covered up his criminality.

A recent New York Times article in its Epstein series, “The Epstein Files and the Hidden World of an Unaccountable Elite,” published February 12, provides a textbook example of this method.

The article, written by Robert Draper, begins with admissions that demolish years of official denials. “In unsparing detail,” Draper writes, “the documents lay bare the once-furtive activities of an unaccountable elite, largely made up of rich and powerful men from business, politics, academia and show business.” The files, he continues, “tell a story of a heinous criminal given a free ride by the ruling class in which he dwelled.”

The Times situates Epstein's impunity within the broader social crisis produced by American capitalism, noting that his “Caligula-like antics” unfolded amid “rising populist anger and ever-growing inequality,” the collapse of manufacturing, and the subprime mortgage crisis that cost millions of workers their homes. It catalogs Epstein's documented relationships with former President Bill Clinton, billionaires such as Elon Musk, senior financiers, royalty and political operatives across the globe.

Having established this factual record, however, the article abruptly reverses course. The same revelations, the Times claims, “have done nothing to quiet the conspiracy theories that his behavior spawned,” instead fueling “feverish new speculation with little or no factual basis.”

Among the supposed “conspiracies” is Epstein's death in federal custody, which has been accepted uncritically by the media as a suicide. Newly released video logs from the Metropolitan Correctional Center show an unaccounted-for figure moving toward Epstein's cell on the night of his death. Rather than grappling with the implications of this evidence, the Times dismisses doubts as the work of “internet sleuths,” reiterating the official ruling, which no one believes, of suicide.

This framing collapses under minimal scrutiny. As reported by CBS News, both the FBI and the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General had already logged the unidentified orange-clad figure in their internal timelines years ago, while refusing to disclose this publicly. Senior officials repeatedly suggested that no one approached Epstein's cell. Dan Bongino, then in FBI leadership, explicitly stated that the footage confirmed no one else entered the cell block. That claim is now demonstrably false.

More than six years after Epstein's death, the government has still failed to identify the alleged ligature used in the supposed suicide. The breakdown of surveillance cameras, guard staffing, recordkeeping and evidence preservation has never been explained. Forensic doubts raised by Dr. Michael Baden, who stated that Epstein's neck injuries were “extremely unusual in suicidal hangings” and consistent with homicidal strangulation, have been brushed aside.

Another “conspiracy” the Times identified is Epstein's influence among the ruling class in the US and internationally. Despite documenting Epstein's “remarkable web of connections,” the Times nevertheless insists that his “influence on American policymaking was negligible.” His associates, the paper claims, were “farther down the food chain,” and “notably absent” were prosecutors, judges or law enforcement officials who could have protected him.

This argument collapses under the Times' own reporting. Within 24 hours, the paper documented a “friendly, and transactional” relationship between Epstein and Thorbjørn Jagland, a former prime minister of Norway and head of the Nobel Committee, a relationship that has since led to criminal corruption charges in Norway. The Times also reported on the resignation of Kathryn Ruemmler, Goldman Sachs' top lawyer and a former Obama White House counsel, after documents revealed she advised Epstein on managing media scrutiny and his response to sex crime allegations while receiving gifts, travel and career assistance.

Taken together with the resignation of Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the billionaire head of DP World, the picture is unmistakable. Epstein maintained intimate, transactional relationships with senior government officials, global financiers and corporate legal architects long after his 2008 conviction. That the New York Times can document these relationships while asserting that Epstein's influence was “negligible” exposes the political function of the “conspiracy theory” smear.

In its February 13 article, “Conspiracy Theories Only Flourish With More Epstein Evidence,” the Times escalates its effort to contain the fallout from the Epstein files by deploying a false equivalence, blaming both the “right” and the “left” for spreading “conspiracy theories.” While right-wing figures are cited for advancing grotesque fantasies, the Times claims that left-leaning users have promoted conspiracies by accusing the Trump administration of covering up Epstein's crimes and death in order to protect the president. 

The paper writes, “Left-leaning accounts circulated different theories, often accusing the Trump administration of having a hand in Mr. Epstein's death or of covering up his misdeeds to protect the president.”

It is, in fact, not a conspiracy theory to state that the Trump administration is engaged in a cover-up. It is an objective fact, demonstrated by the administration's own actions. The Trump administration has redacted Trump's name and image from released materials, withheld documents placing him in contact with Epstein during periods of investigation, and allowed Trump to falsely claim the files exonerate him. Trump himself is named in tips to the FBI as a participant in sexual assault alongside Epstein. To describe accusations of a cover-up as “conspiracy theories” requires ignoring the documentary record. 

Over the weekend, the Washington Post escalated the “conspiracy theory” smear by conflating exposure of the criminal ruling class with “antisemtism.” In an article titled, “How the Epstein files are fueling antisemitic conspiracy theories,” the Washington Post writes:

Denunciations of out-of-touch elites and the ‘money power' are a recurring feature of American politics. But in response to the Epstein files, antiestablishment voices have advanced the claim that Jewish networks and interests are corrupting American society.

Antisemitic slanders such as the medieval blood libel and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion are reactionary lies. But the existence of such lies has nothing to do with the extensive documentary evidence that Epstein maintained close relationships with senior figures in the Israeli state and intelligence apparatus.

The Post's method is to shift the axis of discussion from what is true to what is offensive, thereby immunizing state actors and intelligence agencies from accountability.

The paper cites grotesque statements by right-wing figures and then asserts guilt by association, extending the antisemitism charge to critics who have pointed to Epstein's documented ties to Israeli officials. For the Post, Matthew Schmitz, editor of the right-wing Compact, wrote: 

Progressive influencers got in on the act. Ana Kasparian, the host of a popular left-wing online news show, described Epstein's network as a “pedophile ring/Israeli blackmail operation.” The month before, she asked an Israeli interlocutor, “Why are you monsters always slaughtering innocent children and shaking us down for money?” Briahna Joy Gray, former press secretary for Bernie Sanders, called Epstein's network a “ring of billionaire pedophiles with ties to Mossad” engaging in “full-on blackmail.”

This paragraph performs the core maneuver of the Post's article. Evidence that Epstein maintained relationships with senior Israeli officials, facilitated covert diplomacy or operated within intelligence-adjacent networks is not antisemitic, any more than opposition to the genocide in Gaza is. It is a matter of record reported by investigative outlets and corroborated by released documents. 

Reporting by Drop Site News shows that Epstein facilitated back-channel diplomacy involving former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US officials during the Syrian civil war. Leaked emails show Epstein advising Barak, arranging meetings, sharing intelligence-adjacent information and pressing for US military intervention against Iran and Syria. These are matters of state policy and intelligence operations, not religious identity.

To describe such reporting as antisemitic is itself a blatant slander. States are not religions. Intelligence agencies are not peoples. Exposing covert diplomacy, blackmail networks and imperialist maneuvering is not an attack on Jewish people. It is an exposure of the criminal ruling class.

That the Washington Post advances this smear is not accidental. The paper is owned by Jeff Bezos, has recently laid off hundreds of workers, functions as a long-standing conduit for US intelligence agencies and has played a central role in downplaying Israel's genocide in Gaza while advocating expanded military confrontation with Russia and China. Its attack on alleged antisemitism is a continuation of the Biden administration's campaign to criminalize opposition to US imperialism and suppress student protests against the slaughter in Gaza.Taken together, the interventions by the New York Times and the Washington Post reveal a coordinated strategy to contain the Epstein revelations and protect the ruling class. Where the Times deploys the language of “conspiracy theory” to pathologize demands for accountability, the Post escalates to the antisemitism smear to shut down investigation into state and intelligence connections altogether. In both cases, the aim is the same: to sever documented facts from their political implications, delegitimize opposition and shield the institutions of wealth, intelligence and imperialist power that enabled Epstein's crimes and continue to block justice.

On October 6, 1970, the deep-sea drilling vessel Glomar Challenger returned to port in Lisbon, Portugal, bearing a cargo that would revise history. During its 54-day voyage, the Challenger had punched 28 holes into the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The recovered cores pointed toward a startling conclusion: About 6 million years ago, the sea had turned into a desert: a vast, barren, salt-filled bowl more than two kilometers [1.2 miles] deep. Half a million years after that, the Atlantic Ocean had burst through what is now the Strait of Gibraltar and unleashed the largest flood in history.

Kenneth Hsü, an oceanographer who was one of the two lead scientists on the Challenger expedition, imagined the scene vividly in the December 1972 issue of Scientific American:

""Cascading at a rate of 10,000 cubic miles per year, the Gibraltar Falls would have been 100 times bigger than Victoria Falls and 1,000 times more so than Niagara.… What a spectacle it must have been for the African ape-men, if any were lured by the thunderous roar.""

—The Red Sea experienced 'one of the most extreme environmental events on Earth' 6 million years ago

—Epic 11-foot-tall sea level rise drove Vikings out of Greenland

—Colossal underwater canyon discovered near seamount deep in the Mediterranean Sea

The catastrophe story was a hit: David Attenborough filmed a documentary about it, and Gibraltar even issued a 5-pence stamp portraying the ""3,000-metre waterfall."" The two hypotheses — first, that the Mediterranean Sea became landlocked during a half-million-year period known as the Messinian salinity crisis, and second, that it was restored by a cataclysmic deluge through the Strait of Gibraltar, dubbed the Zanclean flood — have been conventional wisdom among geologists for more than 50 years.

However, fresh doubts have arisen recently about every part of this story, from the mega-desert to the mega-Niagara. Many geologists have argued for a much briefer desiccation followed by a far more gradual refilling of the Mediterranean. Some think that the Mediterranean never completely disconnected from the Atlantic at all. ""The idea of a megaflood, and the data that supports it, are mostly flawed,"" says Guillermo Booth Rea of the University of Granada in Spain.

The most startling recent twist is that the floodway, if there was one, may not have been anywhere near the present-day Strait of Gibraltar, which separates southern Spain from Morocco. For 50 years, new research suggests, we have been looking for signs of a megaflood in the wrong place.

 




In the present-day Mediterranean, about three times more water is lost every year to evaporation than is recaptured from rainfall and rivers. The Atlantic makes up for the difference, supplying a steady west-to-east current of seawater through the Strait of Gibraltar. As the sea's water evaporates, the remaining water becomes saltier and denser and sinks to the bottom. The dense water then flows back out of the strait, east to west, underneath the less dense inbound water. This outflow prevents salt from accumulating in the Mediterranean.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

But what would happen if the strait were constricted, or shut off entirely? Given the hugely negative budget of fresh water, ""sea level"" in the Mediterranean Sea would drop rapidly, by as much as a kilometer in 2,000 years. Such a scenario would have seemed like science fiction until the Glomar Challenger's 1970 expedition.

At the first drill site, the Challenger's drill bit jammed on a very hard layer 200 meters below the bottom of the sea. The next day, Hsü and his co-lead scientist, William Ryan of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, found out why. ""It brought up buckets full of gravel,"" Ryan says.

Seafloors don't often contain beds of gravel, and when they do, it is usually continental rocks washed down from the adjacent land. But this gravel had marine fossils and rock, mixed with crystals of gypsum. Geologists call gypsum an ""evaporite,"" because in the present-day world it forms in evaporating shallow bodies of water — as in the Dead Sea, for example. The implication was startling. ""When Ken held up the gypsum crystals, he turned to me and asked, 'Do you think the Mediterranean dried out?'"" Ryan remembers.

The same story was repeated at every stop. Ryan and Hsü found other evaporites like halite (sodium chloride, aka table salt). Oxygen isotopes in seashells embedded in the gravel suggested that these unlucky animals had lived in a brine from which 90 percent of the original water had evaporated. Hsü and Ryan also gathered evidence that the colliding of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates had lifted up the land on both ends of the Mediterranean Sea, closing its former connection with the Indian Ocean and narrowing the connection with the Atlantic Ocean.

 




The clinching piece of evidence came to light after the Challenger mission had ended. Other geologists discovered what appear to be buried ancient beds of several rivers that flow into the Mediterranean, particularly the Nile and the Rhône. It looked as if those rivers once emptied into the Mediterranean at least a kilometer below their present outlets — something that would be possible only if the sea level of the Mediterranean had been a kilometer [0.6 miles] below the global sea level at some point in the past.

In 1973, a meeting in Utrecht, Netherlands, established the desiccation model as the consensus theory. But a considerable amount of dissent has emerged in the last 20 years. ""In the 1970s, the desiccation people won the debate,"" says Wout Krijgsman of Utrecht University, ""but there are several aspects it cannot really explain.""

In part, the dissent reflects an improved understanding of what was occurring on Earth and in the area 6 million years ago. Since 1973, the story told by rocks, core samples and seismic soundings — and, increasingly, by computer simulations — has become more detailed and more dynamic, with changing shorelines, land bridges and volcanoes, and repeated episodes of climate change.

Also, there were fundamental problems with the desiccation hypothesis to begin with. Take the evaporites, for example: They do not have to form via evaporation, says sedimentologist and stratigrapher Vinicio Manzi of the University of Parma in Italy. They can also form by precipitation from a sufficiently concentrated brine. This can happen underwater, so there is no need to posit that the Mediterranean went bone dry.

And the buried riverbeds? Those, too, Manzi and his colleagues can explain: The sinking of briny water can produce downhill currents (""dense shelf water cascading,"" in geology lingo) sufficiently strong to scour out a canyon.

The idea of a single evaporation event also faces a mathematical problem: The existing salt deposit is too big to be explained by a single evaporation event. It represents about 5 percent of the salt in the world's oceans (and may have originally been 7 to 10 percent). To collect that much salt, the Mediterranean would have had to empty and refill about 10 times.

In fact, evidence from salt deposits in Sicily suggests something like that actually happened. There, gypsum beds alternate with shale beds that are rich in organic material and could have formed in periods when the gateway between the Atlantic and Mediterranean was open. There are 16 beds in all, with ages spaced about 23,000 years apart.

This periodicity is well known to geologists: It's the time it takes for Earth's axis (like a wobbly top) to trace one complete circle. And it correlates with changes in climate and ancient sea levels the world over. With the presumptive Gibraltar gateway being so shallow during this period, sea level fluctuations due to this ""precessional cycle"" could have repeatedly opened and closed the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic.

 




That period of gypsum formation is now called Stage 1 of the salinity crisis. Stage 2 was a relatively brief 50,000-year period when (in the majority opinion) the gateway slammed entirely shut, the sea level in the Mediterranean plummeted, and huge deposits of halite (sodium chloride) precipitated out from the seawater. However, Manzi's group strongly dissents, arguing that the Gibraltar gateway remained open, but shallowed to such an extent that the water flowed through it in one direction only — in but not out — resulting in a runaway buildup of salt.

Even for adherents of the majority view, Stage 2 is not as simple as it seems. Data from chlorine isotopes suggest that the drawdown was not uniform. At its lowest point, in the western Mediterranean, sea level was 800 meters below its present level, while east of present-day Sicily it was at least twice as deep as that. If so, the east and west portions must have been separated by a land bridge. Indeed, there is evidence of African animals crossing over to Europe during this time.

The last 200,000 years of the salinity crisis, called Stage 3, have been the most puzzling of all. The halite stopped precipitating and there is evidence for a variety of sea levels in the Mediterranean during this time. Widespread fossils of a shrimp-like animal called an ostracod suggest that the waters became much less salty, so that the Mediterranean was a sea-sized lake (and indeed, this stage is sometimes called the Lago-Mare stage). But if the gateway to the Atlantic was still closed, then where did the fresher water come from?

A 2025 paper by Daniel García-Castellanos of the Spanish National Research Council helps solve the puzzle. Using a computer to model erosion, he argues that the Mediterranean was gradually refilling during Stage 3. The ostracods provide a clue to the source. They originated from the area of the present-day Black and Caspian Seas, which back then were connected to each other, but not to the Mediterranean.

With the shores of the Mediterranean being so newly exposed and so steep, its edges would have rapidly eroded toward today's Black Sea, which at that time was a much larger freshwater lake called the Paratethys. The first connection between them could have been established at this time. If so, the Mediterranean began to receive waters from rivers like the Volga, the Don and the Danube, which had previously been unavailable. The ostracods got a new home, and the Mediterranean got a vast new supply of water, which according to the computer simulation raised its surface to within 300 meters of its current level.

According Krijgsman, this interpretation conveniently reconciles the conflicting evidence. ""In the fight between a desiccated and full Mediterranean,"" says Krijgsman, García-Castellanos' paper does the job ""if you want to sit in the middle and give everyone credit for their observations.""

The literature on the Messinian salinity crisis is voluminous, and yet one thing is curiously absent. There is surprisingly little direct evidence of the megaflood that supposedly ended the crisis. Hsü's original Scientific American article devotes only half a page to it and adduces little in the way of evidence. Fifty years later, Ryan wrote a 100-page retrospective; only three pages are about the megaflood. Shouldn't this extraordinary flood have left very clear scars?

The current evidence is ambiguous at best. Geologists have found submerged flood-like deposits off Malta — but that's a long way from Gibraltar, the putative source of the flood. Also, if the Atlantic drained into a nearly empty Mediterranean basin, then sea levels around the world should have dropped by about nine meters — an anti-flood to pay for the Mediterranean flood. There is no sign that this happened, says García-Castellanos.

A recent deep-sea drilling expedition to the Strait of Gibraltar turned up more questions than answers. In December 2023, the JOIDES Resolution — heir to the Glomar Challenger — revisited the Alboran Sea immediately to the east of the Strait of Gibraltar. If the strait is the door to the Mediterranean, then the Alboran Sea is the vestibule. Any megaflood that passed through the Strait of Gibraltar would have passed also through the Alboran basin. But Rachel Flecker of the University of Bristol, England, co-leader of the expedition, says they found no traces of the flood in the cores they collected.

While still on board the ship, she wrote that the cores were ""exquisitely laminated in a variety of colors. This incredibly fine lamination requires very quiet, low energy conditions."" Exactly the opposite of a megaflood. Final results have not been published yet, but Flecker reports also that they found no salt layer and no evidence that the salinity crisis had ever touched the Alboran Sea.

""The connection between the Atlantic and Mediterranean before and during the Messinian salinity crisis wasn't through Gibraltar,"" she concludes.

 




How can this be? ""A feature that you must take into account, and nearly nobody does, is that the present physiography of the Mediterranean is very different from the Messinian one,"" says Booth Rea. ""Large basins have opened since, like the Tyrrhenian; other regions have emerged, like Sicily."" One possibility, he suggested, is that the gateway was somewhere to the east, through a volcanic arc of islands that once connected Africa to the Balearic Islands. Other possibilities include channels through Spain or Morocco, which are above sea level now but were underwater as recently as 7 million years ago.

Regardless of how it happened, this modern view of the story holds lessons: It emphasizes the power not of dramatic events but of small changes. ""Salt giants"" — that is, massive salt deposits like the one underneath the Mediterranean — have formed at other times in Earth's history, when basins were trapped between two tectonic plates. Their effects on climate and biodiversity have likely been huge: In this event, 89 percent of exclusively Mediterranean marine species died out.

And a slight shallowing of the Strait of Gibraltar (or whatever the true gateway was) might be all that was needed to trigger these vast changes. ""In some sense, this is more terrifying,"" says Manzi, because it shows that ""you can reach extreme conditions without extreme events.""

‘The public has been lied to': secretly made documentary insists that aliens exist
November 22, 2025, The Guardian
https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/22/age-of-disclosure-documentary-aliens

Director Dan Farah grew up with aliens. His documentary debut – The Age of Disclosure. Here, Farah makes the case that the United States has been hiding, for decades, a fount of information related to UAP (unidentified aerial phenomena) – the acronym rebrand of the stigma-ridden UFO. Making a point to “only interview people who have direct knowledge” of these programs from working within the US government was a north star for Farah. One of his early commitments came from Jay Stratton, a defense official who helped start AATIP. Stratton had an established career investigating UAP and non-human intelligence life on behalf of the government, and was responsible for briefing senior lawmakers in Congress and the White House. “I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings,” he says plainly. After Stratton agreed to “break his silence” it ... convinced others to come forward. When the current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, agreed to take part. “Then next thing you know, General Jim Clapper was participating,” Farah said of the former director of national intelligence under Barack Obama, who sat for an interview. The geopolitical arms race to reverse-engineer UAP technology is, Farah came to see, one of the biggest reasons behind the alleged cover-up. “You can't tell your friends without telling your enemies,” Farah says. “Here we are now where the people who run our country are not aware of the facts.”

Mysterious 'vehicle of unknown origin' hidden at US Navy Base raises questions about secret UFO program
January 19, 2026, Daily Mail
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15464157/Mysterious...

A mysterious UFO has been allegedly stored at a little-known US Navy base on the East Coast for decades as the military continues to reverse-engineer its secrets. A new report has claimed that Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, better known as Pax River, has kept an 'exotic vehicle of unknown origin' secretly housed there, possibly since the 1950s. According to anonymous sources tied to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), which is headquartered at Pax River, certain military programs at the base have been involved in analyzing and exploiting technology recovered from non-human craft for years. UFO whistleblower Luis Elizondo stated in written testimony to Congress that a specially built hangar was constructed at Pax River specifically for the transfer of extraterrestrial technology. Under oath, Elizondo described a plan where this hangar would help major defense contractor Lockheed Martin move non-human technology to another company called Bigelow Aerospace for further study and analysis. Last year, Dr Hal Puthoff, a physicist and electrical engineer who worked on the government's psychic spy and UFO research programs, revealed on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast  that the US military has recovered more than 10 spacecraft since the infamous Roswell incident. Puthoff claimed that some of these craft were actually fully intact craft that had been 'gifted' to humans by extraterrestrials.

Landmark Brazilian UFO Case Reaches Capitol Hill as Varginha Incident Turns 30
January 30, 2026, The Debrief
https://thedebrief.org/landmark-brazilian-ufo-case-reaches-capitol...

Congressional representatives sat rapt as a visiting Brazilian neurosurgeon described what it was like to stare back at the large lilac-colored eyes of a highly intelligent, nonhuman being. The closed-door session on Jan. 15 brought together three members of Congress seeking greater government transparency on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, long called UFOs, and a group of Brazilians who say they witnessed the crash of an otherworldly spacecraft and later encountered its nonhuman occupants. Coming thirty years after the striking events, the private Washington meeting ... followed by a public press conference five days later, raised the prospect of unprecedented Brazilian-American cooperation in unraveling the mysteries of one of the best researched—and shocking—UFO cases on record. The story is this: On January 13, 1996, in the countryside outside the municipality of Varginha, Brazil, the geography teacher—also an ultralight pilot—reported seeing a cylindrical craft trailing smoke and crashing to Earth. A week later, three girls walking home through a vacant lot reported encountering a cowering creature with reddish eyes and brown oily skin that reportedly communicated its suffering through its eyes. Before long, the streets of Varginha were filled with military trucks and emergency vehicles amid rumors of the capture of two nonhuman beings, one later hospitalized, and a clandestine American operation that spirited them out of Brazil.

In New Doc ‘The Age of Disclosure,' Military Servicemen Expose More Details About UFOs at Vandenberg
December 28, 2025, The Independent
https://www.independent.com/2025/12/28/in-new-doc-the-age-of-disclosure...

Today, Vandenberg is best known for the booming SpaceX launches that send satellites into orbit. But once upon a time, it was a hotbed for UFO sightings. This year, those sightings resurfaced. Details of extraterrestrial encounters on the Central Coast were discussed in government hearings and explored in the newly released documentary The Age of Disclosure (2025). The film features government insiders who claim the feds have spent 80 years trying to cover up the existence of non-human life. Based on what they claim to have seen, the former admirals, lieutenants, and colonels were convinced that UAPs are real and they are definitely not human. Witness testimonies recount highly unusual experiences at Vandenberg, such as a gigantic red, glowing square object that allegedly hovered over the base in 2003. In total, five incidents involving UAPs occurred at Vandenberg between 2003 and 2005, according to Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a former military police officer with 16 years of active service under his belt. He relays it all in detail: a red, glowing square the size of a football field, erratic lights dancing over the ocean or blinking in and out of the skyline, a huge sphere of light floating over his own home, and the intimidation of witnesses to keep their mouths shut. Vandenberg — home to the National Missile Defense Project — was “repeatedly visited by UAP,” back when personnel were completing “historic launches,” Nuccetelli said.

Russian UFO files reveal chilling encounters, near-miss nuclear launch
January 15, 2026, CBS News (Las Vegas affiliate)
https://www.8newsnow.com/mystery-wire/russian-ufo-files-reveal-chilling...

The largest investigation of UFOs in the history of the world ... was launched by the former USSR in the late 1970s. Back in September, Congress heard testimony about once-classified files from the Russian UFO programs, files that fell into the hands ... journalist George Knapp in the 1990s, who brought those files out of Russia and is now making them public, starting with two of the most important documents. Could UFOs ignite an apocalyptic World War? It almost happened in October 1982 at a Russian nuclear missile base in what is now Ukraine. One document contains some of the eyewitness statements collected by a secret Ministry of Defense program. The witnesses were stationed at a missile base near the hamlet of Usovo. They watched in awe as multiple unknown objects flooded the skies, changed shapes and colors, appeared and then disappeared, traveled at high speeds, and stopped mid-air. A few officers made drawings of the different UFO formations seen over a wide area around and over the base. The most dramatic statement was from a senior communications officer who watched in horror as the launch control system for the missiles suddenly lit up and someone, somehow, entered the proper codes that would unleash hell. Nuclear missiles that could reach and obliterate New York City in a mere 25 minutes were ready to launch. And the Russians were powerless to stop it. As soon as the unknown objects over the base vanished, the launch sequence ended.

At the Center of Trump's Vision for Rebuilding Ukraine: BlackRock
January 19, 2026, New York Times
https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/world/europe/ukraine-reconstruction...

In mid-December, as negotiations to end Russia's war in Ukraine gathered pace, a group of Ukrainian officials sat in a conference room in New York for a meeting with senior executives at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. They had come to discuss a crucial element of a peace plan drafted by Kyiv and Washington: Ukraine's postwar recovery. BlackRock had been enlisted to help build a strategy for what President Volodymyr Zelensky has called an $800 billion “prosperity plan.” The meeting, held at BlackRock's headquarters, kick-started work on identifying funding sources and investment priorities. BlackRock's role has generated more questions than answers, as the Trump administration steers plans for rebuilding Ukraine toward American business interests. Seven European and Ukrainian officials ... voiced doubts about BlackRock's ability to attract the enormous investments envisioned. The involvement in the talks of a private firm whose main business is to maximize financial returns has reinforced concerns that the Trump administration views Ukraine's reconstruction as a profit-making opportunity for the U.S. government and American companies, rather than as primarily a humanitarian or security matter. Last year, President Trump pushed for a deal granting the United States a stake in Ukraine's mineral wealth. In peace talks with Kyiv, the president's main negotiators have been real estate developers.

Note: First, Blackrock buys up government bonds used to finance military spending, meaning it directly profits from the debt created by war itself. Then, after the war, Blackrock is set to profit again — this time from reconstruction contracts, land grabs, and privatization efforts. Read about this and more with our Substack, Working Together To End the War On Peace in Ukraine, which hallenges the dominant narrative on the Ukraine war, arguing that US and NATO policies, covert intelligence agency operations, media censorship, and corporate profiteering have fueled the conflict while blocking genuine peace efforts.

JFK oversaw Vietnam decapitation. He didn't live to witness the rest.
January 8, 2026, Quincy Center for Responsible Statecraft
https://responsiblestatecraft.org/us-regime-change-vietnam/

American presidents have never been shy about unseating foreign heads of state, by either overt or covert means. But such efforts can backfire. The 1961 attempt to topple Fidel Castro, organized under President Eisenhower and executed under President Kennedy, led to a slaughter of CIA-trained invasion forces at the Bay of Pigs and a triumph for Castro's communist government. Despite being driven from power by President George W. Bush in retribution for the 9/11 attacks, the Taliban roared back in 2023, again making Afghanistan a haven for terrorist groups. One of the least known but most consequential U.S.-backed coups occurred in 1963, when the Kennedy administration secretly encouraged South Vietnam's generals to rise up against their authoritarian president, Ngo Dinh Diem. Diem was murdered during the revolt along with his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu, who ran the country's counterinsurgency program against the communist Viet Cong. Their demise had far-reaching consequences that U.S. officials did not foresee. The Diem coup effectively decapitated the South Vietnamese government, unleashing a host of long-suppressed blocs – military, political, and religious – whose ensuing competition badly destabilized the country. President Trump has decapitated the Venezuelan regime, with consequences yet to be known. While he has pledged to “run” Venezuela, we have few details of how he plans to do that.

Guantánamo Prison Enters 25th Year
January 11, 2026, New York Times
https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/guantanamo-prison...

The U.S. base in Guantánamo Bay, in southeast Cuba, is more than 100 years old and has about 4,200 residents. The prison opened on Jan. 11, 2002, with the arrival of 20 detainees from the war against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Over the years, the U.S. military has held about 780 men and boys there, with the Bush administration repatriating about 500 of them. Today the operation has a staff of 800 soldiers and civilians — more than 50 U.S. government workers for each detainee. In the past year, the Trump administration has used the base as a transit hub for federal prisoners, including about 775 migrants held there for days or weeks. In a secret operation this month, a U.S. military cargo plane brought the deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, to the base on the day of their capture by U.S. forces. The remaining 15 wartime prisoners at Guantánamo, ages 46 to 64, have been held in a single building since last year and are rarely seen by anybody but their guards and lawyers. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is accused of being the mastermind of the Sept. 11 plot, has been there for nearly 20 years and has not yet faced trial. Tens of thousands of troops have served there on temporary deployments. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, did so from 2004 to 2005. The last study of the costs of running the prison put the figure at more than $13 million per year for each prisoner in 2019.

I came back to life after being zipped up in a body bag for 45 minutes. I'm no longer afraid of dying.
October 20, 2023, Business Insider
https://www.businessinsider.com/i-came-back-life-zipped-up-body-bag...

The world began to spin. I collapsed ... and I watched, calmly, as paramedics rushed into the bathroom and worked over the body. I describe it as ""the"" body because I didn't recognize myself at first. It looked like a fake dead body. I watched as emergency services tried to resuscitate the man, but shortly after, they stopped and gave up. They zipped him up in a bright yellow body bag and carried him into the back of an ambulance. About 45 minutes into the journey to the hospital, a medic who was on his first week on the job decided to try to feel for a pulse one more time. After several minutes of checking, and re-checking, the medic later said he felt a faint pulse. I was in a coma for three days, officially declared brain dead by the doctors. They told my family that I had little chance of survival. But in those three days, I believe I traveled to ""the other side."" I was met with feelings of love and saw divine beauty. But I knew, deep down inside that it was not my time yet. So three days later, I opened my eyes in the hospital. Physically, I was completely fine. I was even described as a ""miracle"" by my neurologist. Although I was raised in a religious family, I was never a big believer. But I came back from my near-death experience with a deeper understanding of what our purpose is on earth. I try to live every day with a sense of gratitude and happiness. I know life is here to teach us many lessons. Also, I am no longer afraid of death.

I've studied more than 5,000 near death experiences. My research has convinced me without a doubt that there's life after death.
August 29, 2023, Yahoo News
https://www.yahoo.com/news/ive-studied-more-5-000-133633458.html

Thirty-seven years ago I was an oncologist resident, learning about how best to treat cancer using radiation. One day, I was flipping through a large volume of the Journal of the American Medical Association when I came across an article describing near-death experiences. It stopped me in my tracks. All my medical training told me you were either alive or dead. There was no in-between. But suddenly, I was reading from a cardiologist describing patients who had died and then came back to life, reporting very distinct, almost unbelievable experiences. When I finished my residency, I started the Near-Death Experience Research Foundation. I started collecting stories from people who had NDEs and evaluating them with the mind of a scientist and doctor. But in the face of overwhelming evidence, I've come to believe there's certainly an afterlife. No two NDEs are the same. But as I studied thousands of them, I saw a consistent pattern of events emerging in a predictable order. About 45% of people who have an NDE report an out-of-body experience. When this happens, their consciousness separates from their physical body, usually hovering above the body. I'm a medical doctor. I've read brain research and considered every possible explanation for NDEs. The bottom line is that none of them hold water. There isn't even a remotely plausible physical explanation for this phenomenon. And yet, my work with NDEs has made me a more compassionate and loving doctor.

The Truth Physics Can No Longer Ignore
December 15, 2025, The Atlantic
https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2025/12/physics-life-reductionism...

Physics students learn about the basic stuff of reality—space and time, energy and matter—and are told that all other scientific disciplines must reduce back down to the fundamental particles and laws that physics has generated. This philosophy, called “reductionism,” worked pretty well from Newton's laws through much of the 20th century as physicists discovered electrons, quarks, the theory of relativity, and so on. But over the past few decades, progress in the most reductionist branches of physics has slowed. Physicists largely ignored living systems. But today, many of my colleagues ... have come to believe that a mystery is unfolding in every microbe, animal, and human—one that challenges basic assumptions physicists have held for centuries, and could answer essential questions about AI. It may even help redefine the field for the next generation. Beginning in the 1980s, physicists ... began developing new mathematical tools to study what's called “complexity”—systems in which the whole is far more than the sum of its parts. Throughout the current AI boom, researchers and philosophers have debated whether and when large language models might achieve general intelligence or even become conscious. As the 21st century continues to unfold, my fellow physicists will undoubtedly continue to advance the study of black holes, quantum mechanics, and other traditional domains. The study of life, however, will take us to places we've never imagined, opening a path for the future of our field that, for once, unfolds on a level playing field with biologists, ecologists, neuroscientists, and sociologists. At its best, the pursuit of fundamental answers about the nature of living things might lead physicists not only to new scientific marvels, but also to an entirely new way of doing science.

Is death just an illusion? Here's what quantum physics reveals about life, death, and consciousness
May 23, 2025, MSN
https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/is-death-just-an-illusion...

Einstein once wrote about his friend Michele Besso, “Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us…know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.” Could death, as we understand it, be a construct of our consciousness rather than a universal truth? Proposed by Dr. Robert Lanza, a respected stem cell biologist and author, biocentrism is a revolutionary theory suggesting that life and consciousness are not byproducts of the universe, but the very forces that shape it. According to biocentrism: Space and time are not external, objective realities. They are tools of our perception, shaped by conscious observation. Reality does not exist without an observer. Biocentrism places consciousness at the center of the universe. In doing so, it opens the door to reevaluating what death really means—if the self is not simply the body, its “end” might not be defined by physical decay. In the [two-slit experiment]: When unobserved, particles act like waves and pass through both slits simultaneously. When observed, they behave like particles and choose one path. Quantum physics further supports the biocentric view by demonstrating that the universe behaves differently when observed. Quantum entanglement shows that particles can be instantly connected across vast distances—what Einstein called ""spooky action at a distance."" This challenges our understanding of time and space, and suggests that reality is not locally bound or strictly linear. Redefining death redefines life. If consciousness persists in ways we don't yet understand, every aspect of human society—from science to ethics—will evolve.

In this article

American tech companies should ""worry a little bit"" about the subsidies their Chinese competitors receive from their government in the AI race, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC.

As competition between U.S. and Chinese companies intensifies to develop the most advanced models, Smith said that the U.S. has ""an advantage in terms of access to the most powerful chips in the world"" and ""other technology innovation.""

But, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India, he also said: ""I do think we always have to think about, maybe even worry a little bit about Chinese subsidies.""

Chinese AI companies have been supported by their government with measures such as a multi-billion-dollar national investment fund and vouchers for cheaper energy for their computing needs. Smith's warning comes after Chinese firms released a slew of models over the past two weeks, and their lower-cost AI models could be attractive in developing nations.

Smith said subsidies from Beijing to Chinese companies were ""the fundamental approach that China successfully took to disrupt the telecommunications market,"" when state money and support helped companies like Huawei and ZTE expand.

""Some American companies disappeared. European companies like Ericsson and Nokia were thrown on the defensive,"" Smith added. 

Smith said data centers from Chinese firms Huawei and Alibaba exist around the world and ""it will not be difficult for China to subsidize those.""

""I think for the rest of us, we have to compete with that, and we have to be good at competing with that, with the support of our governments,"" Smith said.

CNBC approached Alibaba and Huawei for comment about whether they have accepted Chinese state subsidies but had not received a response as this article went live.

Alibaba's cloud computing division, through which it sells its AI services, operates globally. But outside China, it doesn't always build data centers, instead partnering with other infrastructure players. 

Beijing launched a 60.06 billion yuan ($8.42 billion) national AI fund last year to invest in early-stage projects.

Cities across the country, from Shanghai to the tech hub of Shenzhen, have offered ""vouchers"" to reduce the cost for companies looking to rent computing power.

Cheap energy has been another advantage for Chinese companies that are trying to build out the power-hungry infrastructure needed to train and run AI models.

Microsoft on Wednesday said it was on pace to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring AI to developing countries in the ""Global South,"" which includes investments in infrastructure and reskilling.

Rory Green, TS Lombard's chief China economist, told CNBC this week that a ""China tech sphere"" could easily form in developing countries.

""For these economies, I think the choice is fairly simple, and you could see easily a world where maybe most of the world's population is running on a Chinese tech stack in five to 10 years' time,"" Green said.

White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Wednesday that the authors of a recent New York Federal Reserve paper that found U.S. companies and consumers are shouldering most of the tariff burden should be ""disciplined.""

In a CNBC interview, the National Economic Council director ripped the report, saying that central bank researchers ignored key aspects of how the duties worked and instead simply focused on prices. Hassett said the research also should have included the upward impact on wages and benefits that U.S. companies see by bringing more production onshore.

""I mean, the paper is an embarrassment,"" Hassett said during the ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.""

The paper in question was published Feb. 12 on the New York Fed's website.

Essentially, the researchers looked at whether countries that export products to the U.S. were lowering their prices, or in effect eating the tariffs, or raising their prices and passing them onto consumers and companies. The paper found that some 90% of the added costs from tariffs were being passed on, though it noted that the impact waned slightly as the year progressed.

However, Hassett insisted that the tariffs had little impact on prices and were responsible for a better standard of living.

""Prices have gone down. Inflation is down over time. Import prices dropped a lot in the first half of the year, that leveled off, and real wages were up $1,400 on average last year, which means that consumers were made better off by the tariffs,"" he said. ""So consumers couldn't have been made better off by the tariffs, if this New York Fed analysis was correct. It's really just an embarrassment. I can't imagine who signed off on it.""

The consumer price index in January rose 2.4% from a year ago and is up nearly 2% from April 2025, when President Donald Trump first announced the tariffs. The sore CPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.5% in January, its lowest annual gain since March 2021. Import prices in December were flat from a year ago while export prices rose 3.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

A New York Fed official declined comment.

In this article

Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora addressed the recent downdraft in software stocks, telling analysts in an earnings call that artificial intelligence won't replace cybersecurity ""anytime soon.""

""I'm still confused why the market is treating AI as a threat to at least cybersecurity,"" he said Tuesday. ""I can't speak for all of software, but one thing we're definitely seeing is that customers have figured out that they need to drive more consistency in their security stack to be able to respond faster using AI.""

Shares sank 7% Wednesday following the cybersecurity company's fiscal second-quarter results, which topped Wall Street estimates. However, third-quarter earnings guidance fell short of expectations.

The rise of new AI tools creating enterprise workflows or websites in a matter of seconds has intensified a selloff in software stocks in recent weeks. 

These new tools, from the likes of Anthropic and OpenAI, have left investors fretting over whether AI will permanently disrupt their business models.

So far this year, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has slumped more than 23%. Palo Alto Networks has dropped 11% year to date and 21% over the last year. 

But Arora believes AI is far from displacing the security products. 

""It's not a secret,"" he said. ""Every one of us is working hard. Almost every AI, every security product has some version of a copilot that now runs in tandem with the product.""

Palo Alto has been betting big on AI in recent months and launched a suite of new agentic tools in the fourth quarter. 

The company has also invested heavily in new acquisitions to scale cybersecurity capabilities for customers in the age of sophisticated AI. 

Earlier this month, the company closed its massive $25 billion acquisition of identity security company CyberArk and completed its purchase of AI observability platform Chronosphere in January. Palo Alto announced on Tuesday that it's buying Israeli cybersecurity startup Koi.

""These investments are a direct response to the inflections we see taking shape in the market,"" Arora told analysts. ""While it's still early, the initial feedback from our customers has been very encouraging. We believe we're now entering the next phase of AI adoption.""

Oil prices rose about 4% on Wednesday, after Vice President JD Vance said Iran did not address U.S. red lines in nuclear talks this week and President Donald Trump reserves the right to use military force.

U.S. crude oil rose $2.65, or 4.25%, to $64.98 per barrel by 12:20 p.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent was up $2.65, or 3.93%, to $70.07 per barrel. 

U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held nuclear talks with Iran in Geneva on Tuesday. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, described the discussions as ""constructive,"" according to Iranian media.  Araghchi said the talks yielded a general agreement on guiding principles.

Oil prices closed lower Tuesday as traders interpreted the foreign minister's comments as a sign that the U.S. and Iran could still reach a settlement. 

But Vance said Tehran had failed to address core U.S. demands. 

""In some ways it went well, they agreed to meet afterwards,"" the vice president told Fox News on Tuesday evening. ""But in other ways it is very clear that the president has set some red lines that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through.""

Trump reserves the right to use force if diplomacy does not succeed in stopping Iran's nuclear program, Vance said. ""We do have a very powerful military — the president has shown a willingness to use it,"" the vice president told Fox News. 

Sources told Axios, meanwhile, that a U.S. military campaign against Iran would likely be massive, last weeks and look more like a full-fledged war than the raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in January. 

Iran's Revolutionary Guard conducted war games this week in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital trade choke point for global oil flows. About one-third of all waterborne crude exports pass through the narrow waterway, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. 

The market is worried those oil flows would be disrupted if the U.S. and Iran go to war. Iranian state media said traffic in part of the strait was closed Tuesday due to the military exercises. 

Kpler did not observe any halt in traffic in the strait on Tuesday, said Matt Smith, an oil analyst at the firm.

Trump has stationed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Middle East. The USS Gerald Ford is en route to the region.

Trump said Friday he deployed the second aircraft carrier in case negotiations fail. ""If we don't have a deal, we'll need it,"" the president told reporters outside the White House. 

The Iranian government did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

In this article

Lawyers questioned whether Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously lied about the board's inability to fire him in a courtroom on Wednesday. 

""If board wants to fire me, I could elect a new board and reinstate myself,"" he said, in response to remarks he previously made on Joe Rogan's podcast.

During his interview with the podcaster last year, Zuckerberg had said he wasn't worried about losing his job because he holds voting power.

The comments came during Zuckerberg's testimony in a landmark trial about social media and safety that's being likened to the industry's ""Big Tobacco"" moment.

The executive walked into Los Angeles Superior Court just before noon ET Wednesday, with several members of the team escorting him pictured wearing the Meta Ray-Ban artificial intelligence glasses.

The Ray-Ban logo was visible on the side, along with the small cameras in the corners. Recording is not allowed in the court room.

The trial, which began in late January, centers on a young woman who alleged that she became addicted to social media and video streaming apps like Instagram and YouTube.

Lawyers representing the plaintiff contend that Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Snap misled the public about the safety of their services and knew that the design of their apps and certain features caused mental health harms to young users. 

Snap and TikTok settled with the plaintiff involved in the case before the trial began.

Meta has denied the allegations and a spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that ""The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff's mental health struggles.""

Last week, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri testified that while he thinks there can be problematic usage of social media, he doesn't believe that's the same as clinical addiction.

""So it's a personal thing, but yeah, I do think it's possible to use Instagram more than you feel good about,"" Mosseri said. ""Too much is relative, it's personal.""

The Los Angeles trial is one of several major court cases taking place this year that experts have described as the social media industry's ""Big Tobacco"" moment, because of the alleged harm caused by their products and the related company efforts to deceive the public.

Meta is also involved in a major trial in New Mexico, in which the state's attorney general, Raúl Torrez, alleged that the social media giant failed to ensure that children and young users are safe from online predators.

""What we are really alleging is that Meta has created a dangerous product, a product that enables not only the targeting of children, but the exploitation of children in virtual spaces and in the real world,"" Torrez told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" last week when opening arguments for the trial began.

This summer, another social media trial is expected to begin in the Northern District of California. That trial also involves companies like Meta and YouTube and allegations that their respective apps contained flaws that fostered detrimental mental health issues in young users.

Moderna said on Wednesday the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to review its experimental mRNA flu shot, reversing the agency's earlier decision to refuse to accept the application in a move that stunned Wall Street and the medical community. 

The announcement clears a path forward for the vaccine, which is key to Moderna's experimental combination Covid-flu jab and the company's goal of breaking even by 2028. The FDA is slated to make a decision on the flu shot on Aug. 5, which will allow Moderna to make the vaccine available for the upcoming influenza season. 

""Pending FDA approval, we look forward to making our flu vaccine available later this year so that America's seniors have access to a new option to protect themselves against flu,"" said Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel in a release. 

Shares of the biotech company rose more than 6% on Wednesday. 

Moderna said it had a ""constructive"" meeting with the FDA and proposed a revised regulatory approach that addresses criticisms the agency made when refusing to accept the application last week, tailoring its new proposal to an older population.

Under the new approach, Moderna is seeking full approval for the shot in adults ages 50 to 64 and an accelerated approval of the shot for people 65 and up. The latter means that upon approval, Moderna will have to conduct an additional post-marketing study in older adults to confirm its benefits. 

In a statement, Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon confirmed that the FDA has accepted the modified application. 

The agency specifically took issue with Moderna's decision to compare its product to a standard, approved flu shot in a phase three trial, arguing that it ""does not reflect the best-available standard of care"" in the U.S. The FDA's previous feedback expressed a preference for Moderna to use a higher-dose vaccine for older adults as a comparator in the trial. 

In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday before the announcement, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary did not indicate that the agency would reverse course. But he emphasized that the FDA reviewed the application and the initial late-stage trial on the shot when it came in, so ""it's a little bit of a misnomer to say that it was not looked at."" 

Makary said the agency's guidance to Moderna on its mRNA-based flu shot ""was pretty clear."" He said the FDA recommended that the group of participants ages 65 and up in the study who didn't take Moderna's shot receive the ""standard of care, not the substandard of care"" as a comparison product. 

Moderna has disputed that reasoning, noting that FDA rules and guidance do not actually require trials to use the most advanced or highest-dose vaccine as a comparator in clinical studies. The company also said it was inconsistent with the FDA's prior written communication about the trial design, even before the study began, where the agency said using the standard flu shot would be ""acceptable.""

The saga follows sweeping changes to U.S. immunization policy and regulation over the past year under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. 

Moderna last week said the decision specifically stemmed from the FDA's top vaccine regulator, Vinay Prasad, who returned to the agency in August after being ousted. Prasad, who heads the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has been vocal about tightening regulations for vaccines and recently linked child deaths to Covid shots without evidence. 

Last week, Moderna released a so-called Refusal to File letter from the FDA that was signed by Prasad on Feb. 3. HHS does not typically share those letters, and has not provided any details on who drove the decision-making on the company's application. 

When asked about his stance on mRNA technology, which Kennedy and some of his supporters have criticized as unsafe, Makary told CNBC on Wednesday that he's ""hopeful and optimistic"" about the platform but would also ""like to see the data."" 

""We're not going to get ahead of the game,"" he said. ""We're going to basically say, we'd like to see the data, how far mRNA technology can be applied is a question where we'd love to see it applied, as far as it can be applied, but it's got to meet our scientific standards, so we'll see what it gets with cancer, with other infectious diseases ...""

In this article

New York-listed shares of British semiconductor firm Arm ticked more than 1% higher on Wednesday, after documents showed Nvidia sold its stake in the company it once wanted to buy. 

At the end of the third quarter, Nvidia held 1.1 million shares of Arm with a value of $155.8 million. The chip giant's filing to the SEC on Tuesday showed it had offloaded the stock. 

Nvidia had held shares in Arm since 2023, but wound down the size of its stake toward the end of 2024, according to past documents filed with the SEC. 

When Arm debuted on the Nasdaq in 2023, CEO Jason Child told CNBC that Nvidia had been among a group of strategic investors that collectively purchased $735 million of Arm shares. Apple, Google, Samsung and TSMC were also part of that cohort. 

Nvidia's investment in the IPO came after its failed bid to buy the company outright for $40 billion, a deal that was initially agreed between Nvidia and Arm's then-owner SoftBank back in 2020. The acquisition ultimately fell through in 2022 following regulatory hurdles on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Arm — whose commercial partners include tech giants Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon — now has a market cap of around $135 billion, according to LSEG data. 

Shares of Nvidia climbed on Wednesday. The company officially extended its AI chip deal with Meta after the bell on Thursday.

Nvidia's exit from its stake in Arm does not spell the end of ties between the two companies, however. 

Following the breakdown of the takeover bid in 2022, Nvidia retained its 20-year license with Arm, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stating at the time that the company will ""continue to support [Arm] as a proud licensee for decades to come."" Nvidia's Grace CPUs, which the company describes as ""the foundation of next-generation data centers,"" are built on Arm technology.  

Arm posted its fiscal third-quarter earnings earlier this month, with sales rising 26% year-on-year to $1.24 billion, above analysts' expectations. In a note following the earnings release, analysts at Morgan Stanley said Arm's report had demonstrated ""AI project momentum"" and confirmed high opex ""which suggests the company is building for long term demand."" However, shares dropped in after-hours trading following the earnings announcement, with analysts noting the slight beat on Arm's guidance. The stock is up 16% so far this year.

Morgan Stanley is overweight Arm, with a price target of $135 on the stock — a premium of just over 6% on Tuesday's closing price. 

Nvidia remains a major investor in the tech space, with its SEC filings showing it held major stakes in Coreweave, Intel, Nebius, Nokia and Synopsys at the end of 2025. 

The $1 billion stake in Finnish telco Nokia that the company added to its portfolio was first announced in October.

U.S. President Donald Trump has welcomed Japan's pledge to invest nearly $36 billion in oil, gas and critical mineral projects in Texas, Ohio and Georgia. 

The commitment represents the first tranche of investments by Japan following a landmark trade deal between the two countries, one in which Tokyo pledged to invest $550 billion in American-based projects and Trump cut tariffs on most Japanese imports to 15%.

""Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!"" Trump said Tuesday in a social media post.

""The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS,"" he added. 

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said the projects strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance and were expected to bring increased sales and business expansion for Japanese companies.

""We believe these initiatives truly embody the purpose of this Strategic Investment Initiative, namely the promotion of mutual benefit between Japan and the United States, the enhancement of economic security, and the promotion of economic growth,"" Takaichi said in a post on X, according to a Google translation.

By far the largest investment is a natural gas facility in Ohio that's expected to generate 9.2 gigawatts of power.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Portsmouth Powered Land Project, valued at $33 billion and operated by SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japan's SoftBank, would be ""the largest natural gas generation facility in history."" 

The White House said Japan would also finance a $2.1 billion deepwater crude oil export facility off the Texas coast. At full capacity, the Texas GulfLink project is expected to generate up to $30 billion in annual U.S. crude exports. Dallas-based energy infrastructure group Sentinel Midstream is developing the project. 

The Commerce Department said the third major project refers to plans to create a synthetic diamond grit facility in Georgia, with Japan set to invest approximately $600 million.

The project is set to be operated by Element Six, part of De Beers Group, the world's leading diamond company. 

Diamond grit, dust and powder are critical raw materials in U.S. industrial manufacturing due to their exceptional hardness and wear resistance, the Commerce Department said, making the material to U.S. economic and national security.

Geopolitics will be the main theme of the day, with markets watching the high-stakes talks between the U.S. and Iran, as well as Ukraine and Russia, that are being held in Geneva.

The talks between Kyiv and Moscow represent the latest round of the U.S.-brokered negotiations between the countries as Russia's invasion of Ukraine nears its 4-year mark.

The talks kicked off on Tuesday and are expected to enter their second and final day on Wednesday, with no concrete agreements yet reported. Russia reportedly struck Ukraine's power infrastructure on Tuesday, drawing condemnation from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Washington's and Tehran's negotiations appear to be yielding more progress so far.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that the sides reached a general understanding on ""guiding principles,"" Reuters reported, though that does not mean a deal on the countries' longstanding nuclear disputes is imminent.

Still, Araghchi's comments eased fears of an immediate conflict in the region, with oil futures down on Wednesday.

U.S. stock futures were trading slightly up on Wednesday, led by the Nasdaq which gained 0.25%. That was after a tepid session for U.S. equities on Tuesday, which saw major averages post slim gains.

Investors remain jittery about the impact of artificial intelligence. The software sector, which has already been under pressure due to fears of disruption by AI tools, continued to fall on Tuesday, with leaders such as CrowdStrike and ServiceNow losing 3.6% and 1.1%, respectively.

In an interview with CNBC's Arjun Kharpal, the CEO of leading European start-up Mistral AI, predicted that more than 50% of enterprises' current software could be replaced by AI. 

He made the comments on the sidelines of India's AI Impact summit which will continue this week. Major announcements have come from the event so far, such as a pledge from Adani to invest $100 billion into data centers in the country by 2035. 

Also coming Wednesday will be consumer price inflation numbers from the UK, a day after jobs data showed the UK's unemployment rate rose to a 5-year high while wage growth slowed in the last three months of 2025.

Shares of German multinational life sciences company Bayer will be in focus after its Monsanto unit said it had reached an agreement worth as much as $7.25 billion to resolve thousands of current and future lawsuits regarding concerns that its Roundup weedkiller caused cancer.

Anthropic rolled out Claude Sonnet 4.6. The new and improved AI model is the company's second major product launch in less than two weeks.

China exports add to freight trade slump for the biggest U.S. port. New data from the Port of Los Angeles shows that commitments made by China to buy more U.S. agricultural products have yet to materialize. 

Meta expands Nvidia deal to use millions of AI chips. The new sweeping deal will see Meta use the chips, including Nvidia's new standalone CPUs and next-generation Vera Rubin systems, in its AI data centers. 

Nvidia is partnering with Indian VC firms in AI start-up push. The company says it was working with several major venture capital firms, to identify and fund AI start-ups in India's growing AI market. 

Iran partially closed the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz. State media reported the news citing ""security precautions"" as Tehran's Revolutionary Guard conducts military drills in the waterway.

Japan export growth surges to over 3-year high. Exports climbed 16.8% year on year in January, sharply beating market expectations and growing at their fastest rate since November 2022.

[Pro] Appaloosa Management's David Tepper bullish on Micron, Korean stocks. The billionaire hedge fund manager added to his Micron stake and took a position in Korean stocks, both of which are AI plays.

There's nothing quite like the holiday rush in China for the Lunar New Year.

The Beijing city streets start emptying out several days in advance as the majority of residents return to their hometowns or travel elsewhere. A quiet calm replaces the normally tense atmosphere of people rushing to work or school.

So where are the locals going? Immersive experiences rank high.

NEW DELHI — More than 50% of enterprises' current software could be replaced by AI, the CEO of Mistral AI told CNBC on Wednesday, potentially adding to investor concerns over software stocks.

The comments by Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral AI, come after a sell-off in major software names that was sparked in part by Anthropic's Cowork product as investors grow increasingly worried that AI can do more of what current enterprise software does. 

Investors fear AI could eat into so-called software as a service, or SaaS, business models. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which counts names such as Microsoft and Salesforce among its top holdings, is down more than 20% this year. In India, major software stocks like Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys have also fallen. 

""I would say more than half of what's currently being bought by IT in terms of SaaS is going to shift to AI,"" Mensch told CNBC at the India Accelerates event on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India. 

""AI is making us able to develop software at the speed of light,"" Mensch added.

The Mistral CEO said as long as enterprises have the ""right infrastructure in place"" they're able to connect their data to AI systems to create applications to run certain parts of work.

""Then we do see with our customers ... in a couple of days, we can create fully custom applications to run a workflow, to run a procurement workflow, or to run supply chain workflows, for instance, in a way where I would say five years ago, you would actually need a vertical SaaS."" 

Mensch said there is a ""replatforming"" taking place where businesses are looking to use more AI instead of current SaaS. 

""The replatforming is a big opportunity for us, because we now have more than 100 enterprise customers coming to us also with that will of maybe changing and replatforming their IT system, so maybe getting rid of certain things that they bought 20 years ago, and that is starting to be a bit expensive,"" Mensch said. 

""They see AI as a way to replatform the thing so that it becomes more efficient and less costly.""

Mensch said software focused on systems of records ""are not going to change,"" however. This type of software is responsible for data within an organization and often works in tandem with AI. 

Bipul Sinha, CEO of Rubrik, has similar views to Mensch. In an interview on Wednesday with CNBC, Sinha said ""workflow software"" could be ""significantly disrupted by AI."" However, system of record or data infrastructure software that is enabling AI, ""will be a positive."" 

Mensch also told CNBC that the company plans to open its first office in India this year as it expands into a market that global tech giants are all trying to get a slice of. 

Mistral is currently working with international companies that have a footprint in India but is now ""prospecting"" potential customers based in the country in both the public and private sectors.

While Mistral is building data centers in Europe, the approach will be different in India, with the company planning to partner with companies that already have a physical infrastructure footprint in the country, Mensch said.

The Indian government is pushing AI firms to create models that can run locally with data stored domestically. India also has various languages such as Hindi and Punjabi which Mistral said its large language models are able to accommodate. 

""That's something that down the line will be super important for the Indian consumer market,"" Mensch said.

In this article

""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night called CBS' denial of his claim that it blocked the broadcast of his interview with Texas state Rep. James Talarico ""crap"" — and urged the network and its parent, Paramount Skydance, to stand up to the ""bullies"" in the Trump administration.

Colbert's broadside came hours after CBS issued a statement on the controversy. 

The host, whose show will end in May as it was canceled by CBS, held up a printed copy of the network's statement about Talarico's interview during his show Tuesday night and said, ""I don't even know what to do with this crap.""

He then pulled a plastic doggy bag from behind his desk, picked up the statement, tied a knot and mimed throwing it away before cutting to commercial.

The controversy is the latest flap to spark speculation that CBS is currying favor with the Trump administration as Paramount makes a hostile tender bid for Warner Bros Discovery. If WBD's shareholders accept Paramount's bid, federal government regulators would need to sign off on the deal.

Colbert had invited Talarico, who is running in the Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas, to appear on Monday night's broadcast of ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""

But early in that night's show, Colbert said to his studio audience that CBS' lawyers had told him ""in no uncertain terms ... that we could not have him on the broadcast."" 

Colbert said the lawyers wanted to avoid running afoul of new guidance by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr that suggests broadcast talk shows could be required to abide by the so-called equal time provision requiring broadcasters to give political candidates equal coverage if their opponents appear on air.

Colbert noted that he had put Talarico's interview on the ""Late Show"" YouTube channel — the video has been seen more than 4.4 million times.

CBS, in its statement on Tuesday afternoon, denied Colbert's main allegation that it had barred the interview from being aired.

""The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,"" the network said.

""The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett [D-Texas], and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled,"" CBS said.

Colbert scoffed at the statement during Tuesday's show.

""They know damn well that every word of my script last night was approved by CBS lawyers who, for the record, approved every script that goes on the air,"" Colbert said.

""In fact, between the monologue I did last night, and before I did the second act talking about this issue, I had to go backstage,"" he said. 

""I got called backstage to get more notes from these lawyers. Something that had never, ever happened before, and they told us the language they wanted me to use to describe that equal time exception, and I used that language,"" Colbert said. ""So I don't know what this is about.""

Colbert went on to say he wasn't ""mad"" at the network and does not want an ""adversarial relationship.""

""I'm just so surprised that this giant global corporation would not stand up to these bullies,"" he said.

""Come on. You're Paramount. No, no, no, you're more than that. You're Paramount+,"" Colbert cracked. ""And for the lawyers to release this [statement] without even talking to me is really surprising.""

The host also noted that there has long been ""a very famous exception to"" the equal time rule, ""and that exception included talk shows, interviews with politicians.""

""We looked, and we can't find one example of this rule being enforced for any talk show interview, not only for my entire late-night career, but for anyone's late-night career, going back to the 1960s,"" he said.

Colbert said that Carr has ""not gotten rid of"" that exception for talk show hosts ""yet.""

""But CBS generously did it for him and told me, unilaterally, that I had to abide by the equal time rules, something I have never been asked to do for an interview in the 20 years of this job,"" he added.

""Now, that decision, I want to be clear, is their right, just like I have the right to talk about their decision on air last night,"" Colbert said.

Paramount did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Early voting in the Texas Democratic primary began Tuesday. Talarico is in a close contest against U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett. The winner will face the victor of the Republican primary between Sen. John Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. 

Democrats have not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994.

CNBC has reached out to the FCC for comment.

Welcome to the ""boomcession.""

The term is a portmanteau of the words ""boom"" and ""recession."" It highlights how the average American doesn't feel like they're reaping the benefits of an economy that is — on paper — humming along, according to creator Matt Stoller.

Economic output and the stock market are surging, consumers are spending big and the post-pandemic recession that many expected never materialized. But many feel terrible about their finances, with debt at all-time highs, and the majority of Americans incorrectly believe the country is in an economic slowdown.

""Traditionally, the economy is doing really well,"" said Stoller, an antimonopoly advocate and research director at the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonpartisan thinktank. ""But ordinary people are saying they're not.""

It's thematically similar to the ""vibecession,"" a term popularized in 2022 to explain the disconnect between solid economic data and negative consumer sentiment readings exiting the pandemic. It can also draw comparisons to the ""K-shaped economy,"" a phrase illustrating how Americans can feel vastly different depending on their income bracket.

Stoller's ""boomcession"" framework aims to bring awareness beyond opinion to the material financial hardships faced by those not in America's uppermost echelons, he said. Once that's contextualized, it's easier to understand why many Americans believe the national economic engine they help power isn't propelling them forward, Stoller said.

On its surface, Stoller said the ""boomcession"" theory can help explain why data in recent years shows that U.S. GDP growth hasn't correlated with better consumer sentiment readings. That marks a significant break from the typical trend seen over the past six decades.

""I've never seen anything like it,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at consulting firm KPMG. ""I've been doing this for 40 years. And that's a long time to never see anything like this.""

Helping drive that disconnect, Stoller and economists say, is the fact that inflation isn't one size fits all. Consumers face different rates of price growth based on factors like their income class or geographical location, data shows.

Grocery and shelter inflation rose the most of any essential tracked by Morgan Stanley between 2020 and 2025. Those two categories made up a disproportionately high share of lower-income consumers' spending in 2024, the bank found.

Lower earners historically see higher rates of inflation than their better-off counterparts, said Morgan Stanley economist Heather Berger. The inflationary gap widens when overall price growth is above the Federal Reserve's target of 2% — as has been largely the case for the past several years, according to the bank.

This can't be written off as a post-pandemic idiosyncrasy. The Atlanta Fed reported this year that food prices rose around 9% more in poorer areas than richer ones between the second quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2020. More grocers in underserved communities can increase competition and drive down prices, Stoller said, in turn helping lessen the inflation disparity.

""If you look at monopolization as a systemic feature of the American economy and price discrimination as a systemic feature of the American economy, then it's not that hard to jump from there,"" Stoller said. ""The people who are happy are getting different prices than the people who are sad.""

President Donald Trump has pushed initiatives aimed at lowering prices for homes and pharmaceuticals this year. Trump claimed last month that there was ""virtually no"" inflation in the U.S. despite the latest data showing rates higher than the 2% annual level considered healthy by monetary policymakers.

Economists and investors are watching to see how affordability initiatives ramp up ahead of November's midterm elections.

In the meantime, households feel less insulated than they did when pandemic stimulus programs rolled out in the early 2020s, said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at financial education platform NerdWallet. Credit card debt hit a record high of $1.28 trillion in the fourth quarter of last year, according to data from the New York Fed released last week.

While high prices have been a perennial issue since the pandemic's inflationary shock, consumers without financial safety nets have more recently focused their concern on the job market.

Economists have described the current labor backdrop as a ""jobless boom"" and ""hiring recession."" Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dubbed it a low hire, low fire environment.

December job openings fell to their lowest level since 2020 despite the stock market rallying further, data shows. Because higher-income cohorts are more likely to own stocks, economists say that continued gains in these holdings can buoy economic confidence and pad consumer spending. Meanwhile, anxiety washes over the rest of the country as the labor market tightens.

""If you have the assets that are enjoying really high values, then you're feeling supported,"" said Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. ""But strong stock markets don't mean a lick to you if you don't own any stocks.""

Economic output by worker per hour broke out of its pandemic funk to new all-time highs last year, federal statistics show. But that may be bad news for employees: The boost can be taken as a sign that artificial intelligence is turbocharging productivity, which could encourage companies to whittle down headcounts.

Nike, Amazon and UPS announced large-scale job cuts this year. Layoffs surged more than 200% from December to January, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

So-called labor share, or the percentage of economic output trickling down to workers in the form of compensation, tumbled to new lows last year. What's more, the gap between corporate profits and employee pay as a slice of GDP grew to its widest on record. Michigan's survey of sentiment fell near all-time lows last year.

Strength in consumer spending despite the bad vibes helped the economy expand at a faster-than-expected rate of 4.3% in the third quarter of 2025. However, total spending is more driven than ever by the top 20% of Americans, according to a Moody's analysis. Fourth-quarter GDP data is scheduled for Friday.

Last week's nonfarm payroll report for January came in hotter than economists predicted, offering hope of stabilization in the job market. But those overall gains were mainly driven by the health care sector, which alone accounted for more than half of net growth.

Nearly three-fifths of Americans believe the U.S. economy is currently in a recession, which is widely defined as a period of multiple quarters with negative GDP growth, according to a Guardian-Harris poll conducted in December. That's up 11% from a similar survey taken earlier in 2025.

A new survey from Snap Finance shared exclusively with CNBC shows just how much worse the outlook is for those at the bottom of the financial food chain.

Just around one-fourth of respondents called their current financial situations ""unstable"" or ""very unstable,"" per data released Wednesday. But that percentage shoots up to 41% for those with credit scores below 670 and 54% for people in households with incomes at or below $50,000.

Snap Finance polled more than 1,400 people in December. 

That can help explain the growing skepticism of economic data from the government. YouGov found fewer Americans trusted federal reports on the economy than didn't in August of last year, a reversal from a few months prior. Trump fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in August, implying that the agency was manipulating labor market data under her leadership.

But NerdWallet's Renter cautioned against concluding that these reports — which are meant to be aggregate readings — aren't necessary if they don't match how an individual feels. These national data sets can help ensure, for example, that economic grants are appropriately allocated, she said.

""Multiple experiences can be true,"" Renter said. ""The economy can be doing quite well, and millions of people are pretty uncomfortable in it at the same time.""

Digital sovereignty is a ""matter of national survival,"" a European minister has told CNBC, as the continent scrambles to undo the dominance of U.S. digital services in its infrastructure amid geopolitical tensions.

The region's dependence on U.S. tech and military protection has come into sharp focus, as its relationship with President Donald Trump's administration has deteriorated amid challenges from China and Russia.

Trump alarmed Europe by imposing tariffs last year after returning to the White House. This year, he caused further alarm with his provocative refusal to rule out military action to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, before eventually ruling it out.

U.S. cloud providers dominate the European market with an 85% share, according to data from Synergy Research Group.

Critics warn that this dependency on non-sovereign providers is a risk amid reports of increasing cyberattacks by Russia and growing geopolitical tensions with the U.S. administration. Under the 2018 Cloud Act, the country's law enforcement can request user data from American companies, regardless of where the data is stored.

Estonia told CNBC it was accelerating its ""open-source first"" principle because of ""heightened security threats on Europe's eastern flank."" Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine raised fears it could target the Baltic states, including Estonia. 

""This has made digital sovereignty a matter of national survival, not just IT policy,"" Liisa Pakosta, the country's minister of justice and digital affairs, said.

Other European governments told CNBC how they were exploring homegrown and open-source alternatives to U.S. tech platforms and upping budgets for digital sovereignty.

""Strengthening digital sovereignty is one of the central goals"" of the current German government, a spokesperson for its federal ministry for digital transformation and government modernization told CNBC, pointing to ""geopolitical developments"" of recent years.

""The current situation is characterized by high volatility and ongoing conflicts,"" they said, adding that multilateral structures are being called into question by ""strained"" relations between the U.S. and Europe.

But Amazon, Microsoft and Google control more than 70% of the cloud market in the region, with U.S. companies holding at least 59% of the enterprise software market. 

In January, France announced it would roll out Visio — a video conferencing tool developed by the government — which it said would be available to all state services by 2027, in place of U.S. tools like Microsoft Teams and Zoom.

The same month, the EU said it faced a ""significant problem of dependence on non-EU countries in the digital sphere...potentially creating vulnerabilities, including in critical sectors.""

The Belgian federal administration is ""reassessing its dependencies in the digital domain, starting with the most critical areas,"" a spokesperson for the minister for digitalization told CNBC. 

""In this context, a Belgian cloud computing strategy for the federal administration is being examined, alongside an analysis of the federal data center landscape,"" they added. ""This approach aims to address issues related to data sovereignty, resilience, and security, including the storage of the most sensitive data.""

Numerous European nations have said they have been subjected to Russian state-sponsored cyber attacks in recent years. The EU said it had observed a ""deliberate and systematic pattern of malicious behaviour attributed to Russia,"" in a statement in July.

Estonia's Pakosta said: ""While we value our technological partnerships, relying solely on closed, proprietary 'black box' solutions creates a strategic vulnerability.""

""Open source ensures that even if global connections are severed or external vendor policies change, we retain full control over the code and can keep the Estonian digital state running locally,"" she added.

The country is increasing investments in strengthening sovereign digital capabilities in its 2026 state budget, Pakosta added.

Open-source alternatives to U.S. tech systems are increasingly being explored by European governments. 

Denmark said it would launch a pilot of an open-source alternative to Microsoft Office for some government employees in June. ""Too much public digital infrastructure is currently tied up with very few foreign suppliers,"" Minister for Digital Affairs Caroline Stage Olsen said in a translated LinkedIn post at the time. ""This makes us vulnerable.""

But a spokesperson for the department played down the move when approached by CNBC. Describing the pilot as ""minor"", they added it was intended to ""increase our understanding of alternative technologies"" and that no decision to move away from Microsoft and Windows had been made.

In November, all 27 European Union member states signed a declaration stating their ""shared ambition to strengthen Europe's digital sovereignty"" and reduce ""strategic dependencies.""

Spending on sovereign cloud infrastructure-as-a-service platforms in European countries will more than triple to $23 billion in Europe in 2027, compared to 2025 levels, a recent report by research firm Gartner predicted — a much bigger increase than in North America and China.

""As geopolitical tensions rise, organisations outside the US and China are investing more in sovereign cloud IaaS to gain digital and technological independence,"" said Rene Buest, senior director analyst at Gartner.

""Governments will remain the main buyers to meet digital sovereignty needs, followed by regulated industries and critical infrastructure organisations, such as energy and utilities and telecommunications,"" he added.

U.S. tech platforms aren't going to disappear from Europe any time soon. In their comments to CNBC, many European countries emphasized they were still keen to continue working with American tech companies for certain aspects of their digital infrastructure.

""We recognise and value the longstanding role that U.S. technology companies have played in Europe's digital transformation,"" said Estonia's Pakosta. ""American hyperscalers are important and trusted partners in the European cloud ecosystem.""

Even if they wanted to fully remove U.S. digital systems from Europe's tech infrastructure, it would be unlikely to happen anytime soon.

""In order to be a leading player, you have to be continually investing large amounts in research, service development, technical infrastructure, customer support and channel partners,"" John Dinsdale, Synergy Research Group's chief analyst, told CNBC.

""It will be incredibly difficult for European cloud providers to meaningfully reverse the market share trend,"" he added.

American AI chip darling Nvidia is expanding its partnerships in India, including with venture capital firms, as it bets on the country's AI ecosystem that has drawn massive Big Tech investments. 

The company in statement on Wednesday said it was working with several venture capital firms, including Peak XV, Z47, Elevation Capital, Nexus Venture Partners and Accel India to identify and fund AI startups.

This comes as venture capital investors have been increasingly showing interest in India's technology startups, with the country's strong initial public offerings market providing lucrative returns. 

India is currently holding an AI summit that has seen major tech CEOs as well as heads of states participate in the event. Nvidia top boss Jensen Huang was also expected to attend it but withdrew due to ""unforeseen circumstances."" 

More than 4,000 AI startups in India's have already joined Nvidia's global startup program, which helps tech startups build, scale, and go to market, according to the chip designer. 

The world's largest company by market cap also said it was collaborating with government agencies and research institutions, as well as continuing efforts to build the country's domestic data centers.

Nvidia's efforts are framed around New Delhi's ""IndiaAI mission,"" aimed at strengthening the country's AI capabilities and free up funding for its AI entrepreneurs. 

More broadly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has set goals for India to grow into a global tech superpower. As of September last year, New Delhi had approved $18 billion worth of semiconductor projects as it looks to build a domestic supply chain.

Nvidia has also partnered with Indian cloud providers such as Yotta, Larsen & Toubro, and E2E Networks to provide its AI chip clusters and help build data centers in the country.

A New Delhi official reportedly said Tuesday that the country expects as much as $200 billion in investments for data centers over the next few years.

India's Adani has announced plans to invest $100 billion toward renewable energy-powered AI-ready data centers. American tech firms including hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft and Google have committed more than $50 billion toward AI infrastructure and chips in the country.

Meanwhile, Nvidia said it was also supporting India's AI companies through its ""NVIDIA Nemotron models"" — a family of Nvidia AI models that organizations can use to build new chatbots, agents, and speech systems. 

These Nvidia models can be used by Indian companies to train new AI systems on India-specific data and language, aligning with the the country's goal of build sovereign AI. 

Sovereign AI refers to a country's ability to build artificial intelligence based on its own infrastructure, data and industry, so that increasingly critical AI systems don't depend on foreign providers.

The Vatican will not participate in US President Donald Trump's “Board of Peace” initiative, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's top diplomatic official, said on Tuesday, adding that efforts to handle crisis situations should be managed by the UN.

Pope Leo, the first US pope and a critic of some of Trump's policies, was invited to join the board last month.

Under Trump's Gaza plan that led to a fragile ceasefire in October last year, the board was meant to supervise Gaza's temporary governance. Trump thereafter said the board, with him as chair, would be expanded to tackle global conflicts.

The board is today to hold its first meeting in Washington to discuss Gaza's reconstruction.

Italy and the EU have said their representatives plan to attend as observers as they have not joined the board.

The Holy See “will not participate in the Board of Peace because of its particular nature, which is evidently not that of other States,” Parolin said.

“One concern is that at the international level it should above all be the UN that manages these crisis situations. This is one of the points on which we have insisted,” he said.

Many rights experts say that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's affairs resembled a colonial structure. The board has also faced criticism for not including a Palestinian representative.

Countries have reacted cautiously to Trump's invitation, with experts concerned that the board could undermine the UN. Some of Washington's Middle Eastern allies have joined, but its Western allies have so far stayed away.

The Gaza truce has been repeatedly violated with hundreds of Palestinians and four Israeli soldiers reported killed since it began.

Israel's assault on Gaza has killed more than 72,000 people, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza's entire population.

Multiple rights experts, academics and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defense after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in a late 2023 attack.

Leo has repeatedly decried conditions in Gaza. The pope, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, rarely joins international boards. The Vatican has an extensive diplomatic service and is a permanent observer at the UN.

Domestic media reported a few flights had resumed operating by afternoon from the airport in Wellington, the capital, although cancelations were still widespread after airport authorities said most morning flights were disrupted.
Air New Zealand said it hoped to resume services when conditions ease later yesterday, after it paused operations at Wellington, Napier and Palmerston North airports.

Denmark's King Frederik arrived in Nuuk on Wednesday as he embarked on his second visit to Greenland within a year, underscoring unity with the Danish territory in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's push to acquire the Arctic island.

The visit comes after Greenland, Denmark and the U.S. late last month launched diplomatic talks to resolve the crisis between the parties, following months of tension within the NATO defence alliance over Trump's repeated comments.

Denmark's Prime Minister said on Friday that she and her Greenlandic counterpart held a constructive meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but warned that Trump's desire to acquire Greenland hadn't changed.

The King wore a black customized puffer jacket with the Danish and Greenlandic flag on the left side of his chest.

He hugged Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and the head of the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, Kim Kielsen, who received him on the tarmac.

King Frederik will later on Wednesday visit a school and the headquarters of Denmark's Joint Arctic Command in Nuuk, as well as Royal Greenland, the island's largest company and seafood producer. 

The Danish royal family traditionally makes annual visits to Greenland, often appearing in the island's national dress, which includes a white anorak for men and an elaborate beaded collar in bright colours for women, as well as sealskin boots.

King Frederik has spent extended periods of time in Greenland, including a four-month expedition on the island's ice sheet.

On Thursday, the King will visit Maniitsoq on the west coast, around 140 km north of Nuuk. On Friday he will visit the Arctic Basic Training program in the western town of Kangerlussuaq.

            As the Florida Legislature ramps up efforts to rename the Palm Beach International Airport after President Donald Trump, a recent trademark filing has some state lawmakers wondering if the Trump family is looking to profit.
    


            The House bill to rename the south Florida hub the President Donald J. Trump International Airport passed the state's House of Representatives 81-30 on Tuesday. But some Democrats raised concerns about related trademark applications that were filed last week by the private entity that handles licenses and trademarks for the Trump Organization.
    


            Democratic Florida state Rep. Shevrin Jones was initially on board with the name change and supported it in a committee vote, saying he would have done the same for a Democratic president. But he said the trademark application was one of the two things that changed his mind (the other being the racist video recently posted and deleted on Trump's Truth Social account, which depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes).
    


            “No president, Democrat or Republican should be able to benefit” from an airport trademark license, Jones said.
    


            Jones quickly filed an amendment to explicitly prevent the Trump Organization from profiting off the trademark, but it failed. The companion Florida Senate bill has passed the required committees and is set to be considered by the full chamber soon before heading to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' desk.
    


            A spokesperson for the Trump Organization said that Trump and his family would not receive royalties or licensing fees from the renaming of the Palm Beach airport, and the House bill's text specifies that the branding would come at no cost.
    


            “To be clear, the President and his family will not receive any royalty, licensing fee, or financial consideration whatsoever from the proposed airport renaming,” said Kimberly Benza, Trump Organization director of executive operations. She stressed that the Florida bill requires a license agreement from The Trump Organization but that they are “willing to provide this right to his hometown county at no charge.”
    


            Still, the trademark applications for “DONALD J. TRUMP INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT,” “PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT” and “DJT” raised eyebrows, given Trump's known interest in renaming buildings, train stations or airports after himself, the broad scope of the applications and the potential for his family to profit.
    


            The trademark application is unusual — hubs named for leaders like Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy or Bill and Hillary Clinton were not protected with trademark filings by the former presidents or their families, trademark attorney Josh Gerben told CNN. For example, the trademark for Reagan National Airport is owned by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
    


            “Normally, the private individual who's being honored isn't protecting his or her name as a trademark,” Gerben said.
    


            Plus, the trademark includes a lengthy list of goods and services that would fall under its purview. It includes watches, clocks, jewelry, clothing, collectible coins, tie clips, belts, restaurants, airport baggage check-in, airport construction and “plastic slippers used in the airport environment when going through security to keep feet and socks clean.”
    


            “From a legal perspective, the attorney that drafted these did a really good job,” Gerben said. “There could be a whole market at the airport, or even off the airport premises. And again, Trump Org would own the trademark and be able to license that name to anybody that was making and selling that merchandise.”
    


            Benza did not respond when asked to clarify whether the Trump Organization would collect any royalties or licensing fees related to merchandise specifically.
    


            Other reasons exist for trademarking a name other than the potential to profit from licensing fees, Gerben noted. That includes preventing infringement on third-party platforms and setting quality standards in connection with the brand.
    


            Benza said the trademark would keep “bad actors from infringing upon or misusing the name.”
    


            Trump has also specifically pitched renaming Washington's Dulles International Airport after himself, as well as New York's Penn Station, CNN previously reported. And the Kennedy Center now bears his name, after a board stacked with Trump allies voted to change the institution's name to the “Trump Kennedy Center.”
    


            North Carolina GOP Rep. Addison McDowell introduced legislation to rename Dulles after Trump, which was cosponsored by a handful of Republicans and is still under discussion, according to a staffer of a member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. But those efforts could be complicated by the Palm Beach airport renaming, since two airports named after Trump could cause significant confusion.

Lawyer for defendants accused of terrorism at ICE protest decried by Trump appointee over shirt's potential for ‘bias'

A federal judge in Texas declared a mistrial on Tuesday after a defense lawyer wore a shirt in court with images from the civil rights movement, delaying a closely watched case in which the Trump administration is accusing a group of protesters of being terrorists and says they are part of a “North-Texas antifa cell”.

US district judge Mark Pittman, an appointee of Donald Trump, declared a mistrial only hours after jury selection began at the federal courthouse in downtown Fort Worth. He abruptly halted the proceedings after MarQuetta Clayton, an attorney for one of the defendants, had been questioning potential jurors for about 20 minutes, taking issue with a shirt she was wearing underneath a black blazer. The shirt contained images of civil rights movement leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr and Shirley Chisholm, as well as images of protests from that time.

Clayton was present in the courtroom all day with her shirt visible to Pittman, but the judge did not stop the proceedings until Clayton began questioning the approximately 75 potential jurors who had assembled.

Pittman claimed the shirt sent a political message that could bias jurors and equate the actions of the defendants in the case with that of the civil rights movement, adding that the decision to wear the shirt may have been intentional. Pittman also argued that the defense lawyers would be outraged if prosecutors were to wear shirts that showed pro-ICE or pro-Trump imagery in front of a jury.

The mistrial means the trial will start over with a completely new panel of potential jurors. The judge announced the trial would restart on Monday at 9am.

“I don't think I have any choice but to declare a mistrial,” said Pittman, who also admonished Clayton for showing a poster to potential jurors that had not been submitted to the court ahead of time. “This has to be a first in the history of American jurisprudence, I would think.”

Clayton is running for a county judge position in Texas, where early voting started on Tuesday. She declined to comment as she left the courthouse, only saying that she would continue to represent her client in the case.

The nine defendants whose trial began on Tuesday were part of a group of protesters who were criminally charged after a demonstration at an ICE detention facility near Fort Worth on 4 July.

Demonstrators set off fireworks outside in solidarity with people detained inside, and some of the protesters are accused of spraying graffiti on a guard shack and vehicles in the parking lot, slashing the tires on a government vehicle and destroying a security camera. In court papers, prosecutors described the incident as a coordinated attack, saying the protesters dressed in all black to conceal their identities and were armed. They also alleged one protester shot and wounded a police officer on the scene.

The case is the first time the government has filed terrorism charges against antifa, short for anti-fascist, which is not a defined entity but rather an umbrella of left-leaning ideologies. The Trump administration has vowed to crack down on antifa, and experts believe the case could set a dangerous precedent for prosecutors to bring criminal charges against protesters who demonstrate against ICE.

Lawyers for the nine defendants unanimously agreed they did not think a mistrial was necessary, questioning whether jurors had even seen Clayton's shirt and saying any potential bias could be rooted out during jury selection by questioning the jurors. Shawn Smith, the lead federal prosecutor in the case, did not take a position, simply saying he had not seen a similar situation before.

Harrison Stables, 23, one of the potential jurors who was dismissed after Pittman declared a mistrial, said in an interview he did not see Clayton's shirt, nor did he think it would have influenced his decision-making in the case at all.

Another dismissed juror who declined to give his name said he recognized the imagery on the shirt as saying something about “the fight”, but that it would not have biased his assessment of the case.

“I struggle to understand how this could be fair or reasonable in this judicial environment,” Lydia Koza, whose wife, Autumn Hill, is one of the defendants, said in an interview across the street from the courthouse where supporters had gathered with signs, coffee and food. A cadre of family members, attorneys, journalists, observers and supporters also crammed into an overflow room in the federal courthouse to watch jury selection through a simulcast on Tuesday.

Before the mistrial, questions to the potential jurors on Tuesday offered a glimpse into themes that are likely to be key to the strategy on both sides in the case. Smith, the prosecutor, asked potential jurors about bias against ICE and Trump, among other issues. Clayton asked jurors about the difference between a riot, a noise demonstration and a protest, and whether it was ever acceptable to bring a gun to a protest.

Pittman's decision on Tuesday came after a series of pretrial rulings penalizing lawyers for the defense. In December, he ordered three defense attorneys to each pay a $500 fine for filing aggressive motions for discovery. He also nearly blocked George Lobb, an attorney, from representing one of the defendants, saying he had not met the residency requirements to practice in the district. Lobb eventually withdrew from the federal case and Clayton replaced him.

After declaring the mistrial, Pittman gave a short speech decrying partisan division in the country, saying he was “absolutely disgusted” by it and that “we have to find a way to turn down the anger”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Assistant to hard-left parliamentarian among those held over fatal attack on 23-year-old Quentin Deranque

Europe live – latest updates

Eleven suspects, including a parliamentary aide to France's hard-left party, have been arrested in connection with the killing last week of a far-right activist in an incident that has shocked the country and laid bare its deep political divisions.

Quentin Deranque, 23, died on Saturday after sustaining a severe brain injury. The Lyon prosecutor, Thierry Dran, said he had been “thrown to the ground and beaten by at least six individuals” during an incident last week.

The attack took place as Deranque, a mathematics student, was on the sidelines of a protest against a university conference attended by Rima Hassan, a European member of parliament for Jean-Luc Mélenchon's leftwing party, La France Insoumise (LFI).

The anti-immigration Némésis collective, which was protesting against the conference, said at the weekend that Deranque had been there to protect its members and was assaulted by anti-fascist activists. Hassan and other members of LFI have condemned the killing.

The incident has inflamed political tensions in France in the run-up to next month's municipal elections as well as the 2027 presidential race, in which polls suggest the far-right National Rally (RN) could achieve its best result to date.

The first wave of arrests was announced late on Tuesday, as Dran said nine suspects had been arrested. Those detained included people who were suspected of having participated in the violence and others who had provided support to them, sources told Agence France-Presse.

Hours later, two more suspects were arrested: a man who the prosecutor said was suspected of being directly linked to the violence as well as his partner, who was suspected of trying to help him evade justice.

The LFI politician Raphaël Arnault confirmed that his parliamentary assistant was among those detained, adding the aide had “ceased all parliamentary work”.

On Wednesday, as news of the arrests spread, the LFI said it had been forced to evacuate its national headquarters. “The national headquarters of LFI have just been evacuated following a bomb threat,” the party's coordinator, Manuel Bompard, said on social media. “Police services are on site. All employees and activists are safe.”

As videos of last week's deadly confrontation continued to circulate on social media, Mélenchon called for calm. “Let's not fuel the incitement to take the law into one's own hands,” the LFI leader said on social media.

Images broadcast by TF1 of the alleged attack showed several people hitting three others who were lying on the ground, two of whom managed to escape. One witness told AFP: “People were hitting each other with iron bars.”

Némésis, the anti-immigration collective linked to Deranque, has blamed the killing on La Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist youth group co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament. La Jeune Garde – which was dissolved in June – has denied any links to the “tragic events” and Arnault has called the killing “horrific”.

While the government has singled out LFI and La Jeune Garde, the Lyon prosecutor on Monday declined to comment on those claims, instead telling reporters that the investigation was looking into suspected “intentional homicide” and aggravated assault.

Politicians held a minute of silence on Tuesday afternoon at France's national assembly in memory of Deranque, while a march is expected to be held in Lyon next Saturday in his honour.

In a post this weekend, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, addressed the incident and called for calm. “It is essential that the perpetrators of this ignominy be prosecuted, brought to justice and convicted. Hatred that kills has no place among us,” he wrote on social media. “I call for calm, restraint and respect.”

Coffee-growing regions are seeing more hot days as the climate changes, reducing yields, researchers say.  ""Climate change is coming for our coffee,"" said one climate scientist.

Key coffee-growing regions around the world are experiencing more days of heat driven by human-made climate change every year, which is leading to lower yields and higher prices for the commodity, researchers said on Wednesday.

The report comes as climate scientists say the world has seen the three hottest years on record as the use of fossil fuels and other human activities continue to cause the Earth's atmosphere to warm.

According to an analysis by the independent research group Climate Central, 25 countries that produce almost all the world's coffee experienced 47 days more of coffee-harming heat on average between 2021 and 2025.

The five countries that account for 75% of global coffee production — Brazil, Vietnam, Ethiopia and Indonesia — saw 57 more days of such temperatures in the same period.

Temperatures above 30 C (86 F) are ""extremely harmful"" to arabica coffee plants — the dominant variety making up some 60-70% of global production —  and ""suboptimal"" for the robusta variety that accounts for most of the rest, Climate Central said.

For its analysis, Climate Central estimated how many days each year would have stayed below 30C in a world without global warming but exceeded that level in reality.

Kristina Dahl, Climate Central's vice president for science, said climate change posed a serious threat to coffee production.

""Climate change is coming for our coffee,"" she said.

""Nearly every major coffee-producing country is now experiencing more days of extreme heat that can harm coffee plants, reduce yields and affect quality,"" she added in a statement.

""In time, these impacts may ripple outward from farms to consumers, right into the quality and cost of your daily brew,"" she said.  

Climate Central said a recent surge in coffee prices around the world was ""at least partly"" caused by extreme weather in coffee-growing regions, with US tariffs on imports from Brazil, however, also playing a role.

The polling found Christian nationalists are more likely to embrace authoritarian views than the rest of the population.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

Roughly one in three Americans are Christian nationalists or sympathetic to the cause, according to a new survey.

The survey, conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, also found strong connections between support for Christian nationalism and support for the Republican Party and President Donald Trump in particular.

“I think the threat is (to) our democracy,” said Public Religion Research Institute CEO Melissa Deckman. “We found consistently that Christian nationalists tend to endorse more illiberal views in the sense that they're more likely to embrace more authoritarian views, which can essentially be used to justify limiting access to the ballot for some people, or it can be used to use undemocratic means to stay in power.”

Most Christian nationalists want America to be a theocracy ruled explicitly by biblical principles, often interpreted through a fundamentalist lens. Many also think only Christians should be able to hold political office.

While the vast majority of Americans do not support Christian nationalist ideals, the survey found that about 11% of Americans are active Christian nationalists while another 21% are sympathizers. Researchers categorized most Americans — 64% — as either skeptics or rejecters of Christian nationalism.

“Long story short, far more Americans reject it than endorse it,” Deckman said in an interview. “But politically, why it's so important to measure is that we now have a political party where you have prominent Christian nationalists in charge right within the Republican Party, whether it's in the Trump administration, and, the executive branch, that really have disproportionate influence and folks like the speaker of the House is someone that would endorse this currently in Congress.”

The findings were based on interviews with more than 22,000 adults conducted throughout 2025. 

The survey found that 56% of Republicans are adherents or supporters of Christian nationalism, compared to a quarter of independents and 17% of Democrats. It also found a correlation between support for Trump and support for Christian nationalism. Backers of the ideology were far more likely to express support for political violence than their fellow Americans.

The states that held the most Christian nationalist views are concentrated in the South. Arkansas, Mississippi, West Virginia and Oklahoma registered the highest support for the ideology. But ruby red Idaho has become a center for Christian nationalist thought, as the home of influential pastor Doug Wilson's, whose Christ Church and connected national education and church networks have helped shape a generation of far-right leaders. Wilson has called for America to be run as an explicitly Christian nation.

Idaho-based pastor and writer Ben Cremer said that school of thought should worry Americans.

“Every American would have their lives dictated by the set of beliefs by a single Christian sect, whether they aligned with those beliefs or not,” he said. “Given the patriarchy, supremacy, and racism intertwined with the current brand of Christian nationalism, you would see women losing the right to vote and ethnic and religious minorities sidelined and infringed upon.”

Cremer said it's incumbent on faith leaders to push back on what he sees as a perversion of Christianity.

“First, Jesus called us to love our neighbors as our selves — that is part of his greatest commandment to us,” he said. “My neighbor is every human being. Christian nationalism is actively harming and dehumanizing so many of my neighbors and our planet. That is simply unacceptable. Secondly, it is carrying this harm out in the name of my sacred faith.”

Christian nationalism, until recently a fringe ideology, has been in the spotlight in recent years, as Donald Trump has become receptive to the movement's ideas and even appointed some Christian nationalists to prominent positions. 

For example, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is a member of one of Christ Church's affiliates, sports Crusader tattoos and has broken down the separation of church and state in the military. Russ Vought, one of the architects of Project 2025 — a Christian nationalist blueprint for government — is Trump's Office of Management and Budget director.

Deckman said if Americans want to see Christian nationalism banished to the fringes again, demographics are on their side.

“I guess the answer is … voting,” she said. “I think that you know this is something that's not going to change overnight, necessarily. You know, younger Americans are more secular, they're less likely to be conservative Christians. I think it's just a matter of people voting right and getting enough people who are willing to challenge these kinds of viewpoints within the Republican Party.”

Correction: This story was updated at 9:45 a.m. Feb. 17, 2026, to correct the percentage of Americans who sympathize with Christian nationalist ideals. It's 21%.

Rescue crews on skis and snowcats battled blizzard conditions in an effort to reach six backcountry skiers still alive but trapped Tuesday after an avalanche high in the rugged Northern California mountains that left 10 other skiers missing as the danger of more slides remained high.

NEVADA CITY, Calif. (AP) — Eight backcountry skiers have been found dead and one remains missing after an avalanche near Lake Tahoe in California, officials said Wednesday, making it the deadliest avalanche in the U.S. in more than four decades.

Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said during a news conference that authorities have told the families the mission has moved from rescue to recovery. It is the deadliest avalanche in the U.S. since 1981, when 11 climbers were killed on Mount Rainier, Washington.

Crews have faced treacherous conditions in their search for the missing skiers since the avalanche struck Tuesday morning. Search and rescue crews were dispatched to the Castle Peak area of the Sierra Nevada after a 911 call reporting the avalanche had buried 15 skiers. 

Six of them have been found alive.

The group was on a three-day trek in Northern California's Sierra Nevada as a monster winter storm pummeled the West Coast.

Two of those rescued after several hours of searching were taken to a hospital for treatment, said Ashley Quadros, a spokesperson for the Nevada County Sheriff's Office. Heavy snow and the threat of additional avalanches slowed the rescue effort in the mountains near Castle Peak, northwest of Lake Tahoe. 

The area near Donner Summit is one of the snowiest places in the Western Hemisphere and until just a few years ago was closed to the public. It sees an average of nearly 35 feet (10 meters) of snow a year, according to the Truckee Donner Land Trust, which owns a cluster of huts where the group was staying near Frog Lake.




The Sierra Avalanche Center warned Wednesday that the risk of avalanche remains high and advised against travel in the area. Multiple feet of snowfall and gale force winds in recent days left the snowpack unstable and unpredictable, and more snow was predicted to fall, the center said.

Nevada County Sheriff Capt. Russell Greene said authorities were notified about the avalanche by Blackbird Mountain Guides, which was leading the expedition, and the skiers' emergency beacons. The sheriff's office said Tuesday night that 15 backcountry skiers had been on the trip, not 16 as initially believed.

The skiers were on the last day of a backcountry skiing trip and had spent two nights in the huts, said Steve Reynaud, an avalanche forecaster with the Sierra Avalanche Center. He said the area requires navigating rugged mountainous terrain. All food and supplies need to be carried to the huts.

Reaching the huts in winter takes several hours and requires backcountry skills, avalanche training and safety equipment, the land trust says on its website. 

Blackbird Mountain Guides said in a statement said the group, including four guides, was returning to the trailhead when the avalanche occurred. 

“Our thoughts are with the missing individuals, their families, and first responders in the field,” Blackbird said in a statement Wednesday. The company said it is helping authorities in the search.

Several Tahoe ski resorts had been fully or partially closed due to the weather. Resorts, which use controlled explosions and barriers to manage avalanche threats, were not expected to be at as high of a risk as the backcountry, the center said.

The area near Donner Summit was closed for nearly a century before the land trust and its partners in 2020 acquired Frog Lake, which is framed by 1,000-foot-high (300-meter-high) cliffs. Donner Summit is named for the infamous Donner Party, a group of pioneers who resorted to cannibalism after getting trapped there in the winter of 1846-1847.

In January, an avalanche in the region buried a snowmobiler and killed him, authorities said. Each winter, 25 to 30 people die in avalanches in the U.S., according to the National Avalanche Center.

CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Team USA skiers Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin, along with Italy's Federica Brignone, are among the many skiers who have expressed concern during these Olympic Games about the accelerating melt of the world's glaciers.

And Olympic host city Cortina is a fitting place for them to be talking about climate change: Glaciers once visible from town have dramatically shrunk. Many have been reduced to tiny glaciers or residual ice patches at high elevations among the jagged peaks of the Dolomites. Any Olympian or spectator wishing to lay eyes on a major glacier would have to take a long drive on winding mountain roads to the Marmolada. It's melting rapidly, too.

The world's top skiers train on glaciers because of the high-quality snow there, and a warming world jeopardizes the future of their sport. Vonn started skiing on glaciers in Austria when she was just 9 years old.

“Most of the glaciers that I used to ski on are pretty much gone,” 41-year-old Vonn said Feb. 3 in response to a question from The Associated Press at a prerace press conference in Cortina before she crashed on the Olympic downhill course. “So that's very real and it's very apparent to us.”

As athletes in snow sports, Shiffrin said, they “get a real front-row view” to the monumental changes underway atop some of the world's highest, coldest peaks.




“It is something that's very close to our heart, because it is the heart and soul of what we do,” Shiffrin told AP after racing Sunday. “I would really, really like to believe and hope that with strong voices and sort of broader policy changes within companies and governments, there is a hope for a future of our sport. But I think right now, it's a little bit of a ... it's a question.”

Shiffrin became the first American skier to win three Alpine gold medals on Wednesday, in an emotional slalom win.

Italian glaciologist Antonella Senese said Italy has lost more than 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) of glacier area since the late 1950s.

“We are observing a continuous and uninterrupted decrease in glacier area and volume. In the last one to two decades, this reduction has clearly accelerated,” Senese, associate professor of physical geography in the University of Milan's environmental science and policy department, said in an interview.

Among the peaks surrounding Cortina d'Ampezzo, there are glaciers on the slopes of the Cristallo and Sorapiss mountains. The 2015 New Italian Glacier Inventory found these glaciers shrunk by about one-third since the 1959-1962 inventory. 

Shortly after winning a second gold Sunday at her home Winter Olympics, Brignone told AP that skiing is “totally different” now than when she was younger. Brignone lives in the Valle d'Aosta, about six hours away.

When she sees how glaciers are retreating to higher elevations, Brignone said she's not thinking about the future of skiing — she's concerned for the future of the planet.

“There we have a lot of glaciers, but they are going up and up, every year, more and more,” she told AP.

Yet many people who don't frequent the mountains remain unaware of what's at stake, so the University of Innsbruck created the Goodbye Glaciers Project. The loss of glaciers has far-reaching consequences, threatening water sources, increasing mountain hazards and contributing to sea level rise. 

The project shows how different warming levels change the amount of ice left on selected glaciers around the world. To be included, glaciers must have an estimated 2020 volume of at least 0.01 cubic kilometers. The Cristallo and Sorapiss glaciers no longer meet that threshold, said Patrick Schmitt, a doctoral student at the University of Innsbruck. 

Some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Cortina is the Marmolada glacier, one of the largest glaciers in Italy and the largest in the Dolomites. An apartment building-sized chunk of the glacier detached in July 2022, sparking an avalanche of debris that killed 11 hikers. The mountain is popular for hiking in summer and skiing in winter.

The University of Padua said in 2023 the glacier had been halved over 25 years.

It's expected to be mostly gone by 2034 if the world warms 2.7 Celsius (4.9 Fahrenheit), according to the Goodbye Glaciers Project. But if warming is limited to 1.5 C (2.7 F — the international goal — the glacier's life could be extended by another six years, and around 100 glaciers in the Alps can be saved, Schmitt said.

“Cutting greenhouse gas emissions now will reduce future ice loss and soften the impacts on people and nature,” Schmitt wrote in an email. “The choices we make in this decade will decide how much ice remains in the Dolomites, across the Alps, and around the world.” 

Globally, more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) has been lost since 2000, according to a study last year. And the prospective impact of climate change on Olympic sport is enormous; the list of places that could host Winter Games is projected to shrink substantially in the coming years. 

In Cortina, Noa Szollos, who is competing for Israel, said in an interview the state of the nearby glaciers speaks to the condition of glaciers around the world.

“I hope we can do something about it,” she said, “but it's a hard time.”

Silja Koskinen of Finland said in an interview she can't train on some of the glaciers she used to because of crevices, rocks and flowing water. Team USA skier AJ Hurt talked about starting the season in October on glaciers in Sölden, Austria. 

“Every year, I feel like we come and there's a little less snow. And every time, we're like, are we really going to start in October? There's no snow here,'” Hurt told the AP. “It is really sad and it's hard to ignore in this sport, definitely, when we're around it so much and it is so clear.” 

Norwegian skier Nikolai Schirmer is leading an effort to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports. Burning coal, oil and gas is the largest contributor to global climate change by far.

In Bormio, Italy, Team USA skier River Radamus said athletes — as stewards of outdoor winter sports— should be on the forefront of trying to defend the environment as best they can.

“It's always present in our mind that we're on a dangerous trend unless we do something right,” Radamus said.

Former Justice department prosecutor Jim Trusty discusses five suspects, including Don Lemon, pleading not guilty to federal civil rights charges related to an anti-I.C.E. protest that disrupted a Minnesota church service in St. Paul on ‘The Story.'

In the America of our childhood, churches were untouchable ground – sanctuaries of refuge, worship, community and peace. They were the one place where the noise of the world fell silent and reverence took its rightful seat. They were the last places anyone imagined would require security plans and emergency drills. Today, those sacred walls are under threat, not in theory, but in cold and documented reality. The data delivers an uncomfortable truth: houses of worship are being targeted with increasing frequency, severity and lethal intent.

Over the past 25 years, nearly 380 violent incidents at religious institutions have produced almost 490 deaths and hundreds of injuries. These attacks have not been confined to troubled neighborhoods or high-crime areas. They have erupted during quiet Sunday services, in rural chapels and suburban parishes alike. Evil has shown up where grandmothers pray, where children sing and where families gather in faith.

These are not abstract statistics. They are real people, real congregations and real communities – forever scarred. A few recent tragedies stand as stark reminders of just how vulnerable houses of worship have become.

The deadliest attack on an American house of worship within the past decade occurred in November 2017, at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. A gunman opened fire during Sunday services, murdering 26 people and wounding 22 others.

FAITH, FREEDOM AND THE FIGHT AGAINST RISING ANTISEMITISM

One year later, in October 2018 at the Tree of Life congregation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, worshippers were again targeted simply because of their faith. Eleven people were killed as they gathered for prayer and fellowship.

More recently, in August 2025 at Annunciation Catholic Church and School in Minneapolis, violence invaded a place dedicated to children and learning. A shooter attacked the church school community, killing two young students and wounding 21 others.

Only weeks later, in September 2025 in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, worshippers at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel were targeted in another shocking assault. An attacker crashed a vehicle into the church building during Sunday services, set it on fire and opened fire on congregants. The attack left four people dead and eight injured, transforming a peaceful morning of worship into chaos and grief.

PASTORS WARN OF 'CHILLING EFFECT' AFTER ANTI-ICE AGITATORS STORM MINNESOTA CHURCH SERVICE

These are only a few examples among hundreds. They illustrate a painful reality: no denomination, no region and no community is immune.

The pattern is impossible to ignore. Violent acts against houses of worship have occurred in more than 30 states, crossing denominational lines and geographic boundaries. No church is too quiet, too humble or too far off the cultural radar to be considered untouchable.

Violence in churches may occur less frequently than other crimes, but frequency is not the point. Consequence is. When violence invades a house of worship, the damage is catastrophic and deeply personal. These are not anonymous buildings. They are sacred spaces filled with families, children and elders who assume, reasonably, that they are safe.

GUNFIRE, ARSON AND VANDALISM: TRACKING POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN AMERICA

An attack on a church is not merely a crime. It is an assault on the very idea that holy ground still exists in America.

This trend did not emerge in a vacuum. It reflects a broader cultural decay – a society increasingly indifferent, and at times openly hostile, to faith and tradition. In too many corners of society, disrespect for the sacred eventually becomes permission for the profane. Words create climates and climates eventually produce actions.

The deadliest attack on an American house of worship within the past decade occurred in November 2017, at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. A gunman opened fire during Sunday services, murdering 26 people and wounding 22 others.

The conclusion is unavoidable. The comforting mantra that ""it can't happen here"" has become indefensible. Churches need protection, not merely prayers and platitudes, but practical, responsible security measures that recognize the world as it is rather than as it used to be.

This is not a call for fear. This is a call for clarity. Acknowledging that evil exists is not paranoia; it is common sense. And evil, when it strikes, does not aim at hardened targets. It aims at the most vulnerable – families in pews, children in Sunday school and the faithful bowed in prayer.

Churches must be proactive guardians of their flocks, not passive observers of risk. This is bigger than a psalm or a sermon. This is about the soul of America.

Just as schools train for modern threats, churches must implement layered security, establish trained safety teams, coordinate with law enforcement and rehearse emergency response. Security should be as intentional as the sermon and as disciplined as the choir. Preparation is stewardship.

When the places where we pray, teach our children and sing our hymns are under siege, the question is no longer about church security, it is about the character of a nation that still claims to cherish freedom.

This is our moment to wake up, to think clearly and to act boldly. Not just to protect churches, but to protect the idea that Americans can openly worship without fear. That idea is not optional. It is foundational.

Vice President JD Vance addresses home affordability, Tom Homan's role in immigration operations and more on 'The Story.'

It's all about the economy.

That was the message from top members of President Donald Trump's political team, as they huddled in a closed-door strategy session with Trump administration Cabinet members and their top aides on how best to sell the president's agenda to voters in this year's midterm elections.

The meeting, which was confirmed to Fox News by sources familiar with the gathering, was hosted by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff James Blair, who is steering Trump's political strategy.

According to sources, the message during a slide presentation by chief pollster and strategist Tony Fabrizio was that the economy will be the top issue on the minds of voters, and that the White House needs to spotlight its efforts on easing affordability.

The meeting was held as the GOP works to defend their control of the Senate and their razor-thin House majority in November's midterms. Republicans are facing traditional political headwinds in the midterms, when the party in power usually loses House and Senate seats.

Republicans are also dealing with the president's continued underwater approval ratings, and a slew of surveys, including the latest Fox News polling, that indicates Americans are pessimistic about the economy and say things have not improved in the year since Trump returned to the White House.

Meanwhile, Democrats have scored a series of ballot box victories and overperformances in off-year elections and special elections during Trump's second administration, thanks to their laser focus on affordability amid persistent inflation.

Trump wasn't at the meeting, according to sources. But he's expected to spotlight the economy and his administration's achievements when he holds a political event Thursday in battleground Georgia, which is holding key elections for the Senate and governor this year.

IMMIGRATION ONCE FUELED TRUMP'S 2024 WIN — NOW SAGGING APPROVAL TESTS GOP GRIP ON CONGRESS

And the president will have an even bigger spotlight next week, when he delivers the annual State of the Union address.

Vice President JD Vance offered a taste of the messaging in an interview Tuesday on Fox News' ""The Story.""

Pointing to former President Joe Biden's administration, Vance argued, ""We're still digging out of the hole the Democrats put us in. And I think the question we're going to put to the American people is, do you want to give the government back over to the people who, frankly, burned down the house and made most Americans much less wealthy and much less safe? Or do you want to double down on the president's leadership?""

The Tuesday evening meeting took place at the Capitol Hill Club, a private venue popular among political insiders that's located next to the Republican National Committee's headquarters, a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol.

Besides messaging, sources say the meeting also focused on polling and the 2026 electoral map, with top Trump political aides walking those attending the gathering through new data on key midterm battlegrounds. And they also emphasized the importance of Cabinet officials hitting the trail as key surrogates to sell the president's agenda.

President Donald Trump argues that U.S. security demands the annexation of Greenland from Denmark.

There's no question that Greenland has outsize strategic importance to the United States. The island sits astride the entrance to the Northwest Passage, an increasingly important waterway as melting ice makes the route navigable for both Russia and China. The U.S. has maintained military bases there since World War II. The U.S. established Thule Air Base, since renamed Pituffik Space Base, in 1951 as a lynchpin in its primary early warning radar base to detect potential Soviet missile launches. The 1951 Defense of Greenland Agreement between the U.S. and Denmark was a model for Cold War cooperation among NATO's European and North American members.

As Trump's antics highlight, Greenland is also among the world's top repositories of rare earths that together will drive the late 21st-century economy the way petroleum fueled the late 20th-century economy. What Saudi Arabia and Iran were decades ago, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Greenland are potentially today. Whether or not Trump was serious about purchasing, invading, or annexing Greenland, or if he simply wanted to spark a crisis to force Europe to take Greenland's defense seriously, remains unclear.

If the latter, Washington and NATO more broadly are leaving a major loophole: the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Located nearly 800 miles north of the Arctic Circle, Longyearbyen is the world's northernmost functional town. The territory boasts more polar bears than people.

The problem is not just Svalbard's geography, but rather the outdated treaty that governs Norwegian sovereignty. Long uninhabited and only discovered by the Dutch in the 16th century, the largest island, Spitsbergen, became a base for British and Danish whale hunts a century later. Whaling ended in the early 19th century, and Russian and Norwegian hunters moved in, attracted by polar bear and fox pelts and walrus tusks. In the late 19th century, Spitsbergen became the launch point for Arctic exploration. In the first decade of the 20th century, British, American, and Norwegian coal mining took off. Only in 1920 was Svalbard's status confirmed by treaty. Norway became the sovereign power, but all signatory countries could fish, hunt, and exploit mineral resources on the islands.

The treaty also mandated that Svalbard be demilitarized. Norway's sovereignty is symbolic only, with Oslo having little power to police malevolent actors on the islands. The Norwegian Coast Guard even struggles to keep Spanish fishermen, let alone Russians, out of the islands' territorial waters.

Perhaps the biggest loophole is scientific. The Svalbard Treaty allows any nation to conduct non-military research on the archipelago. China has established a research station that seems far more concerned with surveillance than with knowledge, and that seems to repeat the scientific cover for military purposes it mastered along the reefs and rocks of the South China Sea. Russia likewise maintains a strong presence. North Korea could, in theory, establish a base on Spitsbergen should it desire. Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a Russian trawler apparently cut communication cables between Svalbard and Norway.

European diplomats may say the 1920 treaty ties their hands, but China and Russia's persistent grey-zone violations are the type of problem that alarms Trump and guides his national security policy to cast aside European niceties in favor of realistic security. Trump is vocal that the U.S. seeks control over Greenland to deny its territory to any future Chinese or Russian presence. That nightmare is already playing out in Svalbard, while China is already making inroads in Iceland.

TIMOTHY P. CARNEY: WHAT IS GERRYMANDERING AND CAN IT BE STOPPED?

European officials can continue to hand-wring over U.S. rhetoric and threats over Greenland, but if they wish to show Washington that they take continental and Arctic security seriously, they need to act on Svalbard now.

Lest Trump otherwise begin to question Norway's already dubious sovereignty over the strategic territory.

The congresswoman who once was rewarded with her own prime-time documentary on CNN and a town hall on MS Now's prime time descended on Munich recently in a clear signal she plans on running for president. And in a stunning-but-not-surprising moment to those who have been paying attention, the possible commander in chief was asked the following foreign policy question:

“Would and should the U.S. actually commit U.S. troops to defend Taiwan if China were to move?” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was asked.

Her answer, per the official transcript:

“Um, you know, I think that this is such a, you know, I think that this is a um — this is, of course, a, um, very long-standing, um, policy of the United States and I think what we are hoping for is that we want to make sure that we never get to that point, and we want to make sure that we are moving in all of our economic research and our global positions to avoid any such confrontation — and for that question to even arise,” she responded.

Needless to say, the U.S. would be in serious trouble if somehow this social media creation ascended to the Oval Office. This answer, which makes the installed 2024 Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, sound like Margaret Thatcher, is disqualifying. Watch it if you haven't: This answer is no different than an unprepared sophomore struggling to reach a minimum time requirement on an oral exam, and the word painful is the only thing that comes to mind.

But Ocasio-Cortez wasn't done there. Here she is mocking Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the origin of American cowboys.

“Our expansion into the interior followed the footsteps of French fur traders and explorers whose names, by the way, still adorn the street signs and towns' names all across the Mississippi Valley,” Rubio said. “Our horses, our ranches, our rodeos — the entire romance of the cowboy archetype that became synonymous with the American West — these were born in Spain. And our largest and most iconic city was named New Amsterdam before it was named New York.”

“My favorite part was when he said that American cowboys came from Spain,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And I believe the Mexicans and descendants of African enslaved peoples would like to have a word on that.”

Is her history correct? Of course not.

Per History.com and the Galicenos of Sawannee Horse Ranch, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés brought the first horses to Mexico in the 16th century in his conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Spanish also instituted breeding farms to produce more horses.

“The modern cowboy culture of the Americas can also trace its roots back to Spain, given that the Spanish settlers trained indigenous populations to wrangle cattle on horseback in order to maintain their ranches in places like Texas, Arizona and New Mexico,” History.com reads.

Whoops. And throw in the fact that Ocasio-Cortez accused Israel of genocide in Gaza — and made such a claim while on German soil, a country that once carried out an actual genocide during World War II — and it's safe to say this was a disastrous trip for the 34-year-old.

But then again, this is a legacy media darling we're talking about, so perhaps the damage won't be as extensive as it should be. Exhibit A is the New York Times:

“Ms. Ocasio-Cortez sounded strongest when drawing a direct contrast with Mr. Trump's vision of the world,” the outlet argued after calling the aforementioned verbal disasters simply “stumbles.”

Ocasio-Cortez “urged the United States to instead deepen its bonds with allies and recommit to global projects like the United States Agency for International Development, the aid agency Mr. Trump dismantled,” the outlet reads.

And it gets even more hilarious, unintentionally, of course.

“American voters have twice elected Mr. Trump, who is hardly a foreign or domestic policy expert and often stumbles far more than she did on Friday,” the story that isn't labeled an opinion piece asserts. “Her slips could ultimately be outweighed by the practice she is getting in speaking about tough international issues, and perhaps by her star power.”

Yes, her star power will outweigh everything. The New York Times will try to ensure that.

As for its dig on President Donald Trump's foreign policy prowess, perhaps the publication, which hasn't endorsed a Republican presidential candidate since Dwight Eisenhower, could also have noted Trump's numerous foreign policy victories. These include the Abraham Accords, essentially ending North Korea's nuclear testing, defeating the Islamic State caliphate, moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, bringing dozens of hostages home, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, better trade deals with dozens of countries through tariff leverage, a relative end to the Israel-Hamas conflict, and setting back Iran's nuclear capabilities for the foreseeable future via Operation Midnight Hammer.

Back to Ocasio-Cortez, this is the same lawmaker who cried on the House floor after congressional funding was approved for Israel's Iron Dome, which has saved countless lives and arguably has saved Israel itself from extinction. She was given a pass for that cheesy performance art by outlets such as Bloomberg, which continues to carry an ocean's worth of water for her to this day.

“It was Ocasio-Cortez who drew the most buzz,” Bloomberg's “report” on her Munich performance reads. “It was her first time at the annual conference, and she doesn't sit on the House foreign affairs or armed services committees. What foreign-policy work she's done has centered mostly on Latin America and her opposition to Israel's war in Gaza.

“Republican commentators back home declared her unprepared for primetime for what they called a flubbed answer to a question from Bloomberg's Francine Lacqua on whether the US would come to Taiwan's defense if China attacked. But she recovered with a cogent response. ‘The US should avoid any such confrontation and for that question to even arise,' she said.”

After portraying Ocasio-Cortez's horrific answer on China-Taiwan as a “Republicans pounce” moment, this “straight news” story went on to quote an Ocasio-Cortez foreign policy adviser who called her incoherent response on China-Taiwan a simple matter of being “careful” with her words.

You can't make this stuff up.

So can Ocasio-Cortez still somehow get elected to the highest office in the land? In 2028, it's doubtful, albeit not impossible, for that to happen. But the smarter money is on Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), who also attended the Munich conference to bash Trump and his administration, to make Ocasio-Cortez his running mate.

Not because she's the best qualified, of course, but for the same reason Harris was chosen in 2020 by Joe Biden: to check off boxes on race, gender, and in this case, age, to appeal to the kind of younger voters who support Zohran Mamdani, the socialist mayor in the process of destroying New York City.

In the 2020s, more than ever, clicks and likes and reposts and snark on social media are just as important as articulating U.S. policy on Taiwan and China and tacitly supporting Hamas as a political entity instead of as a terrorist organization.

THE GREAT BRITISH HOMESCHOOLING CRACKDOWN

Ocasio-Cortez is the poster child of this kind of political environment.

And based not just on her statements in Munich but eight years in Congress, God help us all if she ever ascends to a position of actual power.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Tech's elite are taking their talents to South Beach — again.

In January, David Sacks, the venture capitalist and crypto and AI czar, proclaimed that Miami will soon replace New York City as America's financial capital. Stripe's Patrick Collison has been marveling at the city's ""boomtown"" vibes. With California flirting with a one-time tax on billionaires, said billionaires like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg are buying oceanfront mansions. And on Tuesday, Palantir announced that it's moving its headquarters from Denver to Miami.

Is Miami the next Silicon Valley? We've been here before.

The pandemic sent waves of coastal workers to the city, turning it into a Zoomtown full of online venture capitalists like Keith Rabois and Delian Asparouhov, bitcoin bull runners, and purveyors of the finest NFTs. Billboards went up in San Francisco featuring a mock tweet from then-Miami mayor Francis Suarez: ""Thinking about moving to Miami? DM me.""

Here's the thing: It's easy to fall for Miami when a big chunk of the workforce is stuck at home and online. Five years later, it's a lot harder to build companies there.

""Miami is great three months out of the year,"" says one prominent venture capitalist who moved to the city during the pandemic but is now returning to an established hub.

While the Floridian tax benefits are real, the investor has found that the social scene hollows out in the summer as residents leave, making it ""hard to build roots or have reliable friends."" More critically for the startup ecosystem, the scene lacked the ""hustle"" of San Francisco or New York.

Silicon Valley practically runs on a conveyor belt from Stanford and Caltech to Y Combinator's Dogpatch offices. The machine turns students into founders, builders into companies, and companies into the next wave of founders. Miami, meanwhile, lacks a major university to pipe in tech talent. Instead, the investor says, the city tends to attract people who have already ""made it.""

The Miami market, while busy, significantly lags behind the major hubs. Startups in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metro raised about $3 billion in 2025, per PitchBook, down from $8.6 billion in 2022, when money and crypto sloshed about. The Bay Area, by contrast, still grabs 52% of the nation's venture funding, with $177 billion in capital pouring in last year.

Alligators may be all around in Miami, but unicorns are hard to find. In January, Cast AI, a startup that helps companies cut cloud costs, crossed the $1 billion valuation mark, becoming the region's first homegrown unicorn in years. Before that, Adam Neumann, the ousted WeWork cofounder, debuted his Miami residential real-estate venture, Flow, at a $1 billion valuation in 2022.

Even Garry Tan, the Y Combinator president and gadfly who's usually first in line to dunk on San Francisco's politics, has been blunt about where the breeding grounds are best. Tan recently said on X that the accelerator still hasn't opened offices outside the Bay Area because founders are simply more likely to build unicorns there. According to a Business Insider analysis of Crunchbase data, of the at least 97 new unicorns that investors minted in 2025, 43 of them were based in the Bay Area.

But those who dismiss the city entirely miss the point. Miami isn't the next San Francisco. It's establishing itself as something else.

Patrick Murphy, a former Florida congressman and entrepreneur, says that Miami's tech scene is growing, it's just being built in ""reverse order."" Silicon Valley, he says, emerged from an if you build it, they will come approach: Engineers built great companies first, which eventually created fortunes that cycled back into the community to fund the next generation of companies.

Miami, however, has a more if you come, they will build it tact. It's attracted the ""wealth achievers"" first — the family offices, private equity names, and already-successful founders who emigrated for lifestyle reasons. Finance heavyweights like Citadel and Thoma Bravo arrived early. Vanguard, one of the world's largest asset managers, is eyeing an expansion in Miami as it targets more Latin American wealth. The city is now importing the machinery that follows them. Legal, accounting, and consulting firms are opening local offices to stay close to clients — and scoop up star talent that no longer needs to live near HQ.

This dynamic has established Miami as a ""control center"" for decision-makers, Murphy argues, but not yet the ""factory floor"" where the actual work gets done. Murphy says that despite running a successful construction-tech startup, Togal.AI, his engineering team has been offshore from the beginning because the local talent pool simply ""didn't exist"" when he started in 2019.

""If you go to Miami, you're not going to see dozens of engineers at a Starbucks cranking away,"" he says. ""That's not here yet.""

Still, Miami's flood of wealth is creating demand for startups built on the city's local economy, especially in property tech and fintech, Murphy says. Togal.AI's annual recurring revenue has grown 1,000% over the past two years, Murphy says, and is now raising fresh venture funding in order to hire dozens of new employees this year.

Maya Bakhai, a Fort Lauderdale resident and founder of the early-stage venture firm Spice Capital, tells me that the city will flourish alongside ""net new"" industries that are still taking shape and where the center of gravity isn't locked in yet. Crypto firms like MoonPay and QuickNode still treat South Florida as a home base, she notes. A new space-tech accelerator backed by the state is trying to persuade founders to stick around by pairing them with funders.

Bakhai's bigger bet is that just as New York became the hub for e-commerce, Miami could become the place where creator businesses get built. Research out of the University of Hong Kong found Miami has more top influencers per capita than New York or Los Angeles.

And then there's Palantir, the strongest signal flare yet that tech is taking America's Playground seriously. It's hard to know what the data giant's HQ move will mean in practice — Palantir hasn't said how many employees it plans to relocate, or whether it will offer moving packages to lure talent south. The company did not respond to an email request for comment. If Palantir does move a meaningful slice of its workforce, it would give Miami something it's been short on: a marquee tech employer that can recruit and keep technical workers on the ground year-round.

On X, Palantir's move immediately became a kind of Rorschach test for Miami's future. ""Florida is the future,"" cheered Andreessen Horowitz investor Katherine Boyle. Others were less convinced. ""Florida is the new crypto,"" one user wrote. ""For the next 20 years, nothing will change, but they will always tell you 'big things are happening in Florida.'""

Turning Miami into Silicon Beach is a long game, Bakhai argues. It won't be built by the billionaires buying houses to snowbird in today, she argues, but by the young strivers arriving for their first serious jobs — the entry-level analysts heading to Citadel and the junior lawyers starting at firms like Orrick. For the first time, she says, ambitious graduates can launch careers in Miami instead of treating New York or San Francisco as the default. The payoff, she says, comes years later, when they eventually spin off to start their own companies.

Until then, Miami remains largely a playground for the ""made it"" crowd, waiting in the sun for the builders to come.

In this article

A judge on Wednesday threatened to hold anyone using AI smart glasses during Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony in contempt of court. 

""If you have done that, you must delete that, or you will be held in contempt of the court,"" the judge said. ""This is very serious.""

Members of the team escorting Zuckerberg into the building were pictured wearing the Meta Ray-Ban artificial intelligence glasses.

Recording is not allowed in the courtroom.

The tech CEO said during his testimony that some users lie about their age when signing up for Instagram.

Zuckerberg was responding to questions about documents from previous testimony before Congress, which stated that 4 million kids under 13 used the platform in the U.S. 

The Facebook founder said that the company removes all underage users identified and includes terms about age usage during the sign-up process. 

""You expect a 9-year-old to read all of the fine print,"" a lawyer for the plaintiff questioned. ""That's your basis for swearing under oath that children under 13 are not allowed?""

The comments came during testimony in a landmark trial about social media and safety that's being likened to the industry's ""Big Tobacco"" moment.

Lawyers also questioned whether Zuckerberg previously lied about the board's inability to fire him in a courtroom on Wednesday. 

If the board wants to fire me, I could elect a new board and reinstate myself,"" he said, in response to remarks he previously made on Joe Rogan's podcast.

During his interview with the podcaster last year, Zuckerberg had said he wasn't worried about losing his job because he holds voting power.

Zuckerger said he is ""very bad"" at media.

The CEO walked into Los Angeles Superior Court just before noon ET Wednesday.

The trial, which began in late January, centers on a young woman who alleged that she became addicted to social media and video streaming apps like Instagram and YouTube.

Lawyers representing the plaintiff contend that Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Snap misled the public about the safety of their services and knew that the design of their apps and certain features caused mental health harms to young users. 

Snap and TikTok settled with the plaintiff involved in the case before the trial began.

Meta has denied the allegations and a spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that ""The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff's mental health struggles.""

Last week, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri testified that while he thinks there can be problematic usage of social media, he doesn't believe that's the same as clinical addiction.

""So it's a personal thing, but yeah, I do think it's possible to use Instagram more than you feel good about,"" Mosseri said. ""Too much is relative, it's personal.""

The Los Angeles trial is one of several major court cases taking place this year that experts have described as the social media industry's ""Big Tobacco"" moment, because of the alleged harm caused by their products and the related company efforts to deceive the public.

Meta is also involved in a major trial in New Mexico, in which the state's attorney general, Raúl Torrez, alleged that the social media giant failed to ensure that children and young users are safe from online predators.

""What we are really alleging is that Meta has created a dangerous product, a product that enables not only the targeting of children, but the exploitation of children in virtual spaces and in the real world,"" Torrez told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" last week when opening arguments for the trial began.

This summer, another social media trial is expected to begin in the Northern District of California. That trial also involves companies like Meta and YouTube and allegations that their respective apps contained flaws that fostered detrimental mental health issues in young users.

PALM BEACH, Fla. — Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he owns ""very little, but some"" bitcoin, although he continues to follow the asset closely as part of a broader interest in how technology is reshaping finance.

“I'm an observer of bitcoin,” Solomon said at the World Liberty Forum on Wednesday, saying he's still trying to understand how it moves. 

While Goldman Sachs has taken a cautious approach to digital assets, the firm's leadership sees crypto as part of a longer-term shift in financial infrastructure, Solomon noted.

He dismissed the idea that traditional banks and crypto firms are locked in a zero-sum fight. “It's one system, it's our system,” he said. “We have to do it the right way … and there's going to be disagreements and that's OK.”

Solomon said the evolution of markets is being shaped by large-scale technology platforms, and tokenization will play a central role. 

“The evolution of those platforms … there's obvious impact,” he said. “Tokenization ... that I think is super important.”

While other banking giants such as JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have pushed deeper into the digital asset space, Goldman Sachs' involvement has been limited so far. The main reason, according to Solomon, is regulation. 

“Until 10 minutes ago, the regulatory structure was extremely prohibitive,” he jokingly said, but suggested that as regulators begin providing greater latitude for companies to get ""more involved"" in the sector, Goldman may take another look.

Solomon criticized the economic effects of overregulation. 

“When you burden this system with excessive regulation, you start to extract capital,” he said. “That absolutely happened in the last five years.”

He emphasized getting the approach right. “It's got to be done thoughtfully, and we've got to get it right.”

Solomon previously said that the banking giant is ramping up its research and internal discussions around crypto-adjacent technologies, including tokenization and prediction markets.

FutureBit launched the Apollo III today, a new home Bitcoin mining system combining a high-performance miner and a full Bitcoin node in a single desktop device.

FutureBit launched the Apollo III today, a new home Bitcoin mining system combining a high-performance miner and a full Bitcoin node in a single desktop device.

The system is built around next-generation 3nm American-designed ASICs and a custom in-house controller, marking the first U.S.-engineered Bitcoin ASIC paired with a domestically built hardware platform in a consumer desktop form factor, according to a note shared with Bitcoin Magazine.

The Apollo III continues FutureBit's mission to decentralize hash power through low-power, individual-focused systems.

Founder John Stefanopoulos highlighted the device's role in strengthening Bitcoin decentralization, referencing the company's 2024 milestone of mining a modern-era sovereign solo block.

“In 2024, our customers mined one of the first modern- era sovereign solo blocks, sending shockwaves through the industry and proving that industrial scale wasn't a prerequisite for meaningful participation in Bitcoin,” Stefanopoulos said. “Apollo III expands that possibility. Nearly 20 terahash of efficient, accessible hash power in the hands of individuals strengthens the decentralization that Bitcoin was built for.”

Key specifications include up to 18 TH/s in Turbo Mode, up to 15 J/TH efficiency in Eco Mode, an integrated full Bitcoin node with solo mining capability, and a desktop‑class controller featuring 8 ARM cores, 8 GB RAM, and a 2 TB SSD.

Designed for continuous operation in a home or office, Apollo III provides more than 10 TH/s while consuming power similar to standard household electronics. The company said the Apollo III is a personal computing solution for Bitcoin infrastructure, giving individuals the tools to run both a miner and a node without relying on industrial-scale operations.

FutureBit's Apollo line of home Bitcoin miners, including the Apollo II with 10 TH/s and a full Linux node, makes mining at home accessible while promoting network decentralization. 

The company aims to restore “full Bitcoin citizenship” by combining mining power with running a full node, echoing Satoshi's original vision. While home mining is no longer competitive for profit, it offers privacy, education, and the ability to verify balances without relying on third parties.

Home miners can contribute to decentralization both geographically and in block template diversity, reducing the influence of large industrial pools and potential regulatory capture. 

By empowering individuals to mine and run their own nodes, FutureBit seeks to foster a more resilient, distributed, and user-controlled Bitcoin network.

SWIFT announced a blockchain-based shared ledger at Sibos 2025, while HSBC quietly runs XRP-linked infrastructure. The TradFi-crypto line just blurred.

SWIFT announced it will add a blockchain-based shared ledger to its payment infrastructure. The announcement came at Sibos 2025 in Frankfurt. And the financial world has not stopped talking since.

SWIFT CEO Javier Pérez-Tasso confirmed the move in an official statement, saying the network will record, sequence, and validate transactions through smart contracts. He noted that banks had been asking SWIFT to take a bigger role in digital finance. Over 30 global financial institutions from 16 countries are already helping design the ledger. The first use case targets real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments.

“You may think, ‘Wow, aren't those opposites? Swift and blockchain,'” Pérez-Tasso said in the official announcement, adding that in the regulated system of the future, the two can work together. The prototype is being built with Consensys.

Then there's HSBC. Quiet. Deliberate. Already moving.

As ChartNerdTA noted on X, HSBC runs Ripple-acquired Metaco's Harmonize platform to deliver tokenized securities. That is not a rumor. That is confirmed infrastructure. ChartNerdTA also pointed out that HSBC sits inside the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Project Ensemble, a digital asset initiative where Ripple operates as a core technology provider for the e-HKD pilot.

“Smile and wave, boys,” ChartNerdTA posted on X. Short. But the weight of it lands differently when you trace the connections.

So HSBC uses Ripple's custody technology. HSBC is also part of a project where Ripple handles the digital currency layer. And XRP is Ripple's native asset. That chain of links isn't subtle; it's just not being announced with a press release.

The ledger will work alongside SWIFT's existing messaging rails and ISO 20022 standards. Pérez-Tasso described it as a layered approach, not a replacement. “In infrastructure strength comes through layered innovation,” he said at Sibos, noting the final result will be greater than its individual parts.

The system will cover more than 200 countries and territories. Compliance, risk controls, and governance rules will be embedded directly into transaction flows. That last part matters. It means regulators can be baked in from the start, not patched on later.

Consensys is building the prototype. That's an Ethereum infrastructure company. So this isn't even strictly an XRP story; it's a story about traditional finance moving fast toward tokenized rails, and multiple digital asset networks are positioned nearby.

Meanwhile, the Project Ensemble connection deserves more attention. HKMA's initiative is one of the most advanced central bank digital asset programs running today. Ripple sits inside it as technology infrastructure. HSBC sits inside it as a participating institution. Whether or not XRP moves value directly in that environment, the network effect around Ripple's tech keeps widening.

ChartNerdTA's X post framed it plainly. Metaco's Harmonize platform now sits inside one of the world's largest banks. And Ripple bought Metaco. Those two facts together are not coincidental.

SWIFT's blockchain move is the headline. But the deeper story is how institutional infrastructure is consolidating around a handful of blockchain-adjacent firms, and Ripple keeps showing up.

The 30-plus banks designing SWIFT's ledger have not disclosed their full list. What's known is that institutions from 16 countries are shaping governance and functionality. HSBC, given its existing Ripple exposure, would not be out of place in that group. That's speculation — but it's grounded speculation.

What isn't speculation: SWIFT is going blockchain. HSBC is already running Ripple's technology. And the same bank operates inside a Hong Kong digital currency program where Ripple is embedded at the infrastructure level. Three separate data points. One direction.

Written & Edited by Camila Grigera Naón

Retail brokerage Robinhood announced plans to launch a fund that would give individual investors access to a basket of private companies. The initiative is positioned as an effort to address persistent imbalances in access to capital markets.

However, the structure has drawn comparisons to the initial coin offering (ICO) era. Though the fund will be regulated, it carries several material risks.

Robinhood formally announced its Robinhood Ventures Fund I (RVI) on Tuesday, anticipating that it would go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the coming weeks under the symbol RVI.

The fund is set to offer exposure to a range of private companies, including Revolut, Oura, Ramp, Databricks, Airwallex, Mercor, and Boom. Robinhood also plans to broaden the portfolio over time, adding more private firms, including Stripe.

Historically, investing in private markets was limited to institutions and the elite, but not anymore. With Robinhood Ventures, you can now get exposure to private companies like the ones listed below 👇 pic.twitter.com/vLwiKCukIW

According to the press release, customers can request initial public offering (IPO) shares of RVI through Robinhood at $25 per share. 

Unlike many traditional private market vehicles, RVI is structured to be available to a broad range of investors without accreditation requirements or minimum investment thresholds. The fund charges a management fee but does not impose performance fees. Its shares are expected to provide daily trading liquidity, subject to market conditions.

“Opening up private markets will resolve one of the greatest longstanding inequities in capital markets today, and we're excited to bring these opportunities to all with Robinhood Ventures Fund I,” said Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev.

However, the move has generated skepticism about the underlying risks of indirectly investing in private companies. For crypto veterans, the structure echoes a familiar dynamic seen during the ICO boom.

RVI provides retail investors with exposure to private growth companies, a segment of the market historically dominated by institutional capital. The fund is an SEC-registered, exchange-listed vehicle operating within established securities laws. 

However, its underlying holdings are private companies whose valuations are based on infrequent funding rounds rather than being constantly priced by the public market. The companies' reported value may not fully reflect changing market conditions until a new funding event forces a reassessment.

RVI is also a closed-end fund, meaning investors cannot sell their shares back at a guaranteed price. Instead, shares trade on the stock exchange, where the price can rise above or fall below the actual value of the companies the fund owns. 

As a result, investors face two layers of uncertainty: the underlying private-company valuations and the market price of the fund. The use of leverage could amplify gains but also magnify losses during market stress.

Structural risks of this nature were most visible between 2017 and 2021, during the rapid expansion of ICOs.

During that boom, retail investors gained direct access to early-stage ventures, often driven by forward-looking narratives despite uncertain valuation frameworks and liquidity timelines.

By 2018, many ICO-funded projects failed to deliver viable products or sustainable revenue models. Token prices collapsed as speculative demand faded and regulators intensified scrutiny, wiping out billions and leaving retail investors with losses.



The episode exposed weaknesses, including limited disclosure, information asymmetry, and heavy reliance on optimistic growth assumptions. While some projects evolved into legitimate networks, the broader ICO cycle became associated with valuation excesses and uneven risk distribution.

This structure does not make RVI equivalent to an ICO, but it helps explain why comparisons have emerged.

In both cases, retail investors can access high-growth opportunities that were once largely restricted to institutions, even as transparency around valuations and exit timelines remains limited.

The key concern raised by critics is not regulatory oversight, but risk distribution. 

Robinhood Ventures $RVI, is a major red flag. $HOOD concentrates in firms that raised at inflated valuations like: – Stripe @ $140B  – Databricks @ $134B– Revolut @ $75BA real venture fund would look like:1. Lightmatter2. Cerebras3. SiFive4. Anduril5. Anthropic6.… pic.twitter.com/T2WXpNCHH1

When access expands without continuous price discovery or guaranteed liquidity events, investors may face prolonged capital lock-up, sudden valuation adjustments, or exposure to elevated entry prices.

Some skeptics have also pointed to the fund's specific composition. Several of RVI's highlighted holdings, including Stripe, Databricks, and Revolut, have recently raised capital at valuations of $140 billion, $134 billion, and $75 billion, respectively. 

Focusing on companies already valued very highly may leave less room for strong future gains. It could also increase the risk of price declines if private-market conditions weaken.

Others contend that traditional venture capital strategies often seek earlier-stage opportunities, where valuations are lower, but growth asymmetry is higher. 

In that framing, critics shift the debate from access to timing, arguing that retail investors are entering private markets after valuations have already climbed rather than before major growth takes places.

What we risk when we confuse AI and human intelligence

Putting humans and LLMs head-to-head in classic tests of judgment from human psychology underscores the differences between them

By Walter Quattrociocchi edited by Daisy Yuhas

Tom Werner/Getty Images

When you walk into a doctor's office, you assume something so basic that it barely needs articulation: your doctor has touched a body before. They have studied anatomy, seen organs and learned the difference between pain that radiates and pain that pulses. They have developed this knowledge, you assume, not only through reading but years of hands-on experience and training.

Now imagine discovering that this doctor has never encountered a body at all. Instead they have merely read millions of patient reports and learned, in exquisite detail, how a diagnosis typically “sounds.” Their explanations would still feel persuasive, even comforting. The cadence would be right, the vocabulary impeccable, the formulations reassuringly familiar. And yet the moment you learned what their knowledge was actually made of—patterns in text rather than contact with the world—something essential would dissolve.

Every day many of us turn to tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT for medical advice, legal guidance, psychological insight, educational tutoring or judgments about what is true and what is not. And on some level, we know that these large language models (LLMs) are imitating an understanding of the world that they don't actually have—even if their fluency can make that easy to forget.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

But is an LLM's reasoning anything like human judgment, or is it merely generating the linguistic silhouette of reasoning? As a scientist who studies human judgment and the dynamics of information, I recently set out with my colleagues to address this surprisingly underexplored question. We compared how LLMs and people responded when asked to make judgments across a handful of tests that have been studied for decades in psychology and neuroscience. We didn't expect these systems to “think” like people, but we believed it would be valuable to understand how they actually differ from humans to help people evaluate how and when to use these tools.

In one experiment, we presented 50 people and six LLMs with several news sources, then asked them to rate the source's credibility and justify their rating. Past research shows that when a person encounters a questionable headline, several things typically happen. First, the person checks the headline against what they already know about the world: whether it fits with basic facts, past events or personal experience. Second, the reader brings in expectations about the source itself, such as whether it comes from an outlet with a history of careful reporting or one known for exaggeration or bias. Third, the person considers whether the claim makes sense as part of a broader chain of events, whether it could realistically have happened and whether it aligns with how similar situations usually unfold.

Large language models cannot do the same thing. To see what they do instead, we asked leading models to evaluate the reliability of news headlines following a specific procedure. The LLMs were instructed to state the criteria they were using to judge credibility and to justify their final judgment. We observed that even when models reached similar conclusions to those of human participants, their justifications consistently reflected patterns drawn from language (such as how often a particular combination of words coincides and in what contexts) rather than references to external facts, prior events or experience, which were factors that humans drew upon.

In other experiments, we compared humans' and LLMs' reasoning around moral dilemmas. Humans draw on norms, social expectations, emotional responses and culturally shaped intuitions about harm and fairness to think about morality. As one example, when people evaluate morality, they often use causal reasoning. They consider how one event leads to another, why timing matters and how things might have turned out differently if something had changed along the way. People imagine various situations through counterfactuals in which they ask, “What if this had been different?”

We found that a language model reproduced this form of deliberation fairly well: The model provides statements that mirror the vocabulary of care, duty or rights. It will present causal language based on patterns in language, including “if-then” counterfactuals. But importantly, the model is not actually imagining anything or engaging in any deliberation, just reproducing patterns in how people talk or write about these counterfactuals. The result can sound like causal reasoning, but the process behind it is pattern completion, not an understanding of how events actually produce outcomes in the world.

Across all the tasks we have studied, a consistent pattern emerges. Large language models can often match human responses but for reasons that bear no resemblance to human reasoning. Where a human judges, a model correlates. Where a human evaluates, a model predicts. When a human engages with the world, a model engages with a distribution of words. Their architecture makes them extraordinarily good at reproducing patterns found in text. It does not give them access to the world those words refer to.

And yet, because human judgments are also expressed through language, the model's answers often end up resembling human answers on the surface. This gap between what models seem to be doing and what they actually are doing is what my colleagues and I call epistemia: when the simulation of knowledge becomes indistinguishable, to the observer, from knowledge itself. Epistemia is a name for a flaw in how people interpret these models, in which linguistic plausibility is taken as a surrogate for truth. This happens because the model is fluent, and fluency is something human readers are primed to trust.

The danger here is subtle. It is not primarily that models are often wrong—people can be, too. The deeper issue is that the model cannot know when it is hallucinating, because it cannot represent truth in the first place. It cannot form beliefs, revise them or check its output against the world. It cannot distinguish a reliable claim from an unreliable one except by analogy to prior linguistic patterns. In short, it cannot do what judgment is fundamentally for.

People are already using these systems in contexts in which it is necessary to distinguish between plausibility and truth, such as law, medicine and psychology. A model can generate a paragraph that sounds like a diagnosis, a legal analysis or a moral argument. But sound is not substance. The simulation is not the thing simulated.

None of this implies that large language models should be rejected. They are extraordinarily powerful tools when used for what they are: engines of linguistic automation, not engines of understanding. They excel at drafting, summarizing, recombining and exploring ideas. But when we ask them to judge, we quietly redefine what judgment becomes—shifting it from a relationship between a mind and the world to a relationship between a prompt and a probability distribution.

What should a reader do with this knowledge? Do not fear these systems, but seek a clearer understanding of what these systems can and cannot do. Remember that smoothness is not insight and eloquence is not evidence of understanding. Treat large language models as sophisticated linguistic instruments that require human oversight precisely because they lack access to the domain that judgment ultimately depends on: the world itself.

One of the most exploited properties of synthetic materials—and a limiting factor for the broader use of bio-based materials—is their durability and water stability, achieved through strong intermolecular interactions. However, this molecular stability also makes them persistent disruptors of ecological cycles, in contrast with biological structures, which undergo continuous molecular reconfigurations and use their environments to achieve both excellent mechanical properties and biodegradability. This study takes inspiration from chitinous cuticles to produce a biological material that uses water to gain strength and become waterproof. The process involves the vitrification of chitosan with small traces of nickel to create a dynamic network of intermolecular bonds using environmental water, resulting in a biomaterial that increases its strength when wet, an uncommon property previously observed in a few biological structures and never achieved artificially. The approach preserves the biomolecule's original chemistry and biodegradability while avoiding the strong organic solvents typically associated with bio-derived materials. The study describes the principle and demonstrates its application by manufacturing fully biodegradable and aquatically robust consumables and large objects made from Earth's second most abundant renewable molecule.

An essential enabling characteristic of synthetic polymers that explains their ubiquitous use in product manufacturing is their stability and persistence in water-based environments1,2, which is strongly linked to their biodegradability—or rather, the lack thereof. Polymeric materials are made suitable for manufacturing by increasing their crystallinity, crosslinking density, and molecular weights, simultaneously providing water stability and the mechanical characteristics to form standalone structures3,4. However, water plays a pivotal role in the metabolic processes that enable biodegradation5, and the stability of these polymers in the presence of water therefore comes at the expense of compostability. The result is materials that, even when they have bio-based origins, can only be biodegraded in specialized facilities—if at all—making their end of life as bad or worse than every other type of persistent synthetic polymer due to their limited recyclability6,7.

That the cost of adapting natural molecules to the current manufacturing paradigm is the loss of their integration with ecological cycles is not because of any limitation of the molecules themselves. Biological systems evolve to use their environment, not isolate themselves from it, producing structures that both develop and perform in water-rich environments by incorporating water as a central element in their designs8,9. The production of the chitinous cuticle of arthropods is an excellent example of this; it is secreted in a gel-like form into water, hardens to form solid exoskeletons for insects and crustaceans, and performs in humid or underwater environments throughout the animal's life10. The sclerotization process, in which the cuticle transitions from a soft hydrogel to a hard structure, is a complex amalgamation of intertwined processes that involve water transport, molecular reorganizations, and mechanical forces11. Special attention has recently been given to the role that transition metals (e.g., Zn, Cu, Ni) have in this process and the particularities of the complex relationships they have with the organic components of the cuticle (refer to12 for an insightful and extensive review of the use of metal ions in biological structures). The natural availability and biosynthesis rate of some of these structural molecules—specifically chitin polymers—are orders of magnitude greater than the world's demand for plastics, suggesting that if their industrial isolation were upscaled in an environmentally friendly manner, they could be strong candidates for sustainable manufacturing. However, even when the biomolecules that constitute biological structures are fully isolated, their artificial reassembly into solid materials does not recapitulate the creation process and principles they follow in natural systems13. As a result, despite identical chemistries, the differing molecular organizations of naturally and artificially assembled materials yield completely distinct properties. This chemistry/organization divide is evident in, for example, cellulose-based systems: although a few naturally organized cellulose fibers, such as cotton and linen, even display modest water-induced stiffening (typically <10%) arising from hierarchical structures formed during growth, this behavior does not survive disassembly14. When these biomaterials are disassembled and reconstituted without strong organic solvents, both the modest stiffening and even stability in liquid water are lost. In practice, reconstituted biomaterials are highly susceptible to water and require barrier coatings prior to use in manufacturing15,16.

Here, we report constructs created from an unmodified structural biopolymer formed in a water-based solvent and particularly suitable for use in contact with water. The constructs are made of nickel-doped chitosan (i.e., deacetylated chitin), which incorporates surrounding water into its intermolecular structure, creating a network of weak but highly dynamic water-mediated bonds that avoid failure through internal reconfiguration. The result is a material that almost doubles its strength in contact with water, achieving capacities well beyond those of commodity plastics. This result is particularly significant for two reasons. First, achieving this outcome with a biological material challenges the conventional view of water as an external stressor and instead establishes environmental water as a functional component of a load-bearing network. Second, it emerges in chitin-derived materials, the second-most abundant organic molecules on Earth—surpassed only by cellulose—allowing the proposed technology to potentially scale up to a level that will have a global impact. This result is also particularly timely because chitin-chitosan polymers are becoming central to the development of sustainable and regional manufacturing processes through their role in valorizing organic waste (e.g., food waste) and the local production of nutrients (Fig. 1a)17. Furthermore, the extensive and efficient production of chitin-chitosan in every ecological cycle—particularly by organisms that both produce food and decompose waste—suggests they will even play a key role in creating the efficient, self-sustaining human communities that will allow humanity to colonize other planets18.

a Conceptual schematic of regional circular production of chitin-derived polymers. Chitin and chitosan, typically byproducts of the shrimp and crab processing industry, are structural components in most heterotrophs used for the bioconversion of organic waste and the local production of nutrients. As part of any ecological cycle, chitin can be reincorporated into circular production cycles through waste management or, if unmanaged, into natural ecological cycles. b Photographs showing the color of vitrified chitosan films with increasing trapped Ni (quantified in Supplementary Fig. 1). Scale bar is 1 cm. c Schematic illustration of plausible Ni ion locations relative to a chitosan chain; the distribution depends on local degree of deacetylation, water content, and crystallinity, and is expected to comprise a mixture of these possibilities. d FTIR spectra of Ni-doped films at different Ni contents, showing that spectral changes associated with added water dominate over Ni-specific contributions. e FTIR region dominated by water's O-H bond vibrations and normalized to the carbohydrate skeletal vibrations (800–500 cm−1, inherent to the chitosan structure), showing increased Ni-associated intermolecular water content. f X-ray diffraction patterns: pristine vitrified chitosan shows peaks at 9.5° and 20° and a broad amorphous contribution (15–30°); at low Ni content, the peaks' shift is consistent with a doping process where small molecules take the interstitial space between the organized ones, whereas at higher Ni and water contents the amorphous regions come to dominate the structure. g Representative tensile stress–strain curves of dry Ni-doped films; Ni concentrations below 0.8 M have a limited effect on tensile strength, while at higher concentrations, they increase elasticity without loss of strength, simultaneously achieving strength and toughness, a characteristic functional versatility of structural biomaterials. h Tensile strength before (open bars) and after (filled bars) immersion in water for films prepared from initial Ni concentrations of 0.6–1.4 M; Cs (black) denotes pristine chitosan (no Ni).

Measurements include at least three points; data are presented as mean values +/- SD.

This study was inspired by the serendipitous observation that when zinc is removed from the fangs of the sandworm Nereis Virens, they become susceptible to hydration, softening when immersed in water19,20. While most studies on the role of metals in animals' cuticles center on the protein–metal interaction—specifically, the role of histidine—it is already known that the chitin that form the organic matrix in most cuticles also interact with metals. Indeed, one of the primary uses of chitinous waste from shrimp and crab processing is as a heavy metal flocculant in water treatment systems21. While the studies of the role of metals in arthropod cuticles and biomaterials have primarily focused on mechanical properties22,23, we hypothesized that transition metals might play an essential role in controlling water interactions within chitin-based materials. We specifically used nickel because, although it is not as common as other transition metals (e.g., zinc) in the cuticle, it is a ubiquitous micronutrient necessary for life, is water-soluble, and has shown ample versatility in interacting with chitin and chitosan in theoretical models24,25. However, while phenomena in metal-enriched arthropod cuticles inspired our work, our aim here is not to reproduce arthropod cuticle; we examine a reconstituted chitosan system in which environmental water and trace Ni govern mechanics. Determining whether the principles we uncover are related to processes operating in natural cuticle remains an open question for future research.

We began our exploration by entrapping varying amounts of nickel within a chitosan structure. Chitosan extracted from discarded shrimp (Penaeus monodon) shells was dispersed at a 3% concentration in a weak solution of acetic acid at the anaerobic limit (1% acetic acid in water; for comparison, table vinegar ranges from 5 to 8%), to which we added nickel chloride dissolved in water at concentrations from 0.6 to 1.4 M. The water was then evaporated, forcing the vitrification of the polymer into a solid film. The first noticeable change from the presence of nickel in the chitosan films was a green color (λ = 520 nm; films without nickel are yellowish), which is characteristic of nickel (II) compounds. This color became more intense as the concentration increased (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1).

Theoretically, and if no factor other than the nickel itself is considered, the most stable location for nickel ions in chitosan polymer chains is the space between the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups of consecutive pyranose rings (Position I in Fig. 1c), where it weakly interacts with the fully coordinated oxygen atom in the ring24. When external elements are also considered, the most stable position is between the primary amino and secondary hydroxyl groups (Position II in Fig. 1c), where the nickel ions can coordinate with water molecules and the sterically available groups of adjacent chitosan chains. It has also been theorized that nickel could take the position between the primary amino and the primary hydroxyl groups of consecutive rings26. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR; Fig. 1d) spectra of the films show a blue shift of the amide II band from 1542 to 1561 cm−1 due to the presence of nickel in the chitosan structure, consistent with interaction with the primary amines (Position II in Fig. 1c). However, a similar blue shift is also apparent in the band located at 1325 cm−1, corresponding to the bending of the -CH2 group, consistent with nickel in the inter-ring position (Position I in Fig. 1c). The direct contribution of nickel to the spectrum can be observed by the moderate modifications of the 500–700 cm−1 region, where the vibrations of the bond between the nickel ions and the hydroxyl groups appear. However, the impact of nickel on the chitosan spectra is not primarily due to its direct interactions, but rather to the changes introduced by the new water molecules associated with the nickel ions.

Nickel forms weak hydrogen bonds with water molecules—up to six when in solution—and while the new interactions with the chitosan chains replace some of those molecules, the nickel-doped films incorporate several times as many water molecules as the number of nickel ions introduced. The effect of this additional water is observable in the band at 1628 cm−1, which corresponds to the bending vibration of the hydroxyl groups in water molecules. While this vibration is overshadowed by the amide I band (1636 cm−1) in pristine chitosan films, it completely dominates the fingerprint region in nickel-doped films, even with the smallest amount of nickel, and grows rapidly as the concentration increases. A similar effect can also be clearly seen in the intensity of the broad band at 3250 cm−1 (Fig. 1e), where the intensity of the vibrations corresponding to the stretching of the O-H bond rapidly increases with the amount of nickel in the system.

The additional water also strongly impacts the crystal structure of the chitosan films (Fig. 1f). Regular chitosan films have a hydrated crystal structure, in which water molecules mediate many of the intermolecular interactions. It has recently been demonstrated that strain stiffening, which reorganizes chitosan films into a more crystalline structure using external forces, also results in closer packing by reducing the free volume and expelling water molecules from the material as new chain–chain direct interactions replace their binding sites27. A similar but opposite effect can be observed in the nickel-doped films, as the additional nickel and its associated water result in lower crystallinity. Considering only the changes in the chitosan organization, the inclusion of nickel and its associated water into the chitosan structure might be (wrongly) seen as plasticization; indeed, a common approach to increasing the flexibility or manufacturability of long polymers is to disrupt their intermolecular bonds, although this occurs at the cost of decreasing their tensile strength. However, in the nickel-doped films, the disruption of the intermolecular bonds by the additional water and the lower crystallinity does not have the expected negative impact on their mechanical characteristics, resonating with recent results on the importance of disorder in biological systems28.

All the samples—independent of their nickel content and therefore their crystallinity—have tensile strengths in the range of 30 to 40 MPa (Fig. 1g), which is similar to commodity plastics. Despite the additional water and lower crystallinity, using low concentrations (less than 0.8 M) of nickel has a minimal impact on the mechanical properties of the films, with insignificant changes in their strength or elasticity compared with pure chitosan films. Beyond 1 M concentrations, however, the strength of the material is preserved while its Young's modulus—a measure of stiffness—falls significantly, marking the material's increased ability to be stretched and, therefore, to absorb more energy before breaking—in other words, greater toughness. Introducing nickel into the chitosan structure, therefore, increases both the material's flexibility as a plasticizer and its strength as a crosslinker, properties that are usually considered incompatible. This result cannot be overstated: the ability of a material to be both tough and strong simultaneously has been a chimeric goal in the field of structural materials that, as a feature unique to biological composites, has been the leading motivation for research into bioinspired materials29. Furthermore, the ability to tune the properties of a biopolymer to different mechanical characteristics without sacrificing strength enables a single material and production process to be adapted to various functions. In biological systems, this phenomenon makes possible, for example, the insect cuticle, which is a continuous and multifunctional structure made of very stiff parts (e.g., wings) and very elastic parts (e.g., joints) with only minor compositional changes. This use in nature of few, but very versatile, materials is the result of intense evolutionary pressure toward efficiency—the so-called survival of the cheapest30. This principle is directly applicable to product design, optimizing both cost and environmental impact by minimizing the number of materials used, simplifying both production and end-of-life management.

While the creation of an unmodified biological material with tunable hardness and constant strength is already an exceptional result, the inclusion of nickel ions in the chitosan matrix provides an even more extraordinary effect: the material gets stronger when it is immersed in water (p = 0.0014, Fig. 1h, and Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Movie 1). The strengths of all the nickel-doped films, except the one with the lowest concentration of nickel, remained constant or increased when immersed in water. This is particularly notable in samples made with a 0.8 M nickel concentration, which showed an increase in strength of almost 50% upon immersion. We hypothesized that there is an optimal balance between the roles of nickel and water in simultaneously enhancing intermolecular bonds through new interactions and disrupting them by preventing direct chain–chain interactions. We therefore focused the rest of the study on the material produced using a 0.8 M concentration of nickel. Analogous experiments performed under identical conditions using Zn²⁺ or Cu²⁺ in place of Ni²⁺ did not produce a comparable water-strengthening response, indicating that the effect depends on the specific coordination chemistry rather than divalent charge alone, and motivating future systematic exploration of other coordination chemistries and material systems.

The nickel-doped films, which in dry conditions have a tensile strength of 36.12 ± 2.21 MPa—within the strength range of commodity plastics (e.g., polypropylene, polystyrene, polylactic acid)—show an increased tensile strength of 53.01 ± 1.68 MPa when immersed in water, placing them in the range of engineering plastics (e.g., polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate glycol, polyoxymethylene; Fig. 2a). Using a 0.8 M concentration for fabricating the nickel-doped films appears optimal for achieving this mechanical improvement in water, but at the cost of also incorporating significant amounts of nickel that are irrelevant to that enhancement. This can be observed at the macroscopic level through the leaching of nickel and the behavior of the nickel-doped films upon first immersion in water: freshly made films exhibit a permanent mechanical change relative to their initial state. Subsequently, nickel-doped films that are successively hydrated and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h transition between two mechanically distinct states, both different from that of a freshly made film (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 3). This macroscopic change after the first immersion is also observable in the accumulation of nickel on the surface of a freshly made film, which later disappears (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 4). Importantly, repeating the wet tests in 0.9% NaCl instead of water yielded indistinguishable strength (47.16 ± 5.16 MPa), indicating the effect is robust to electrolyte screening and not due to long-range electrostatics (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Scale bars are 10 micrometers. d C 1 s XPS spectra of a chitosan film without nickel (Cs) and a nickel-doped film before (fresh) and after (washed) first immersion in water. e Schematic of the proposed role of Ni and water in vitrified chitosan: Interchain interactions may be direct (solid lines) or water-mediated (dashed lines). Ni provides additional labile coordination links (blue lines). Among the possibilities is the complete or partial coordination of nickel ions with water, without significant bonds to the polymeric chains, and their release to the environment (This schematic is intended only to illustrate the interaction types in CsNi films; it does not depict chain amorphousness or bending, nor the full range of chitosan–nickel–water interactions). f Thermogravimetric analysis in the water-loss region shows higher water content in fresh nickel-doped chitosan (44%, blue line) than in the same film after its first immersion in water (20%, purple line), and the water content remains stable after 24 h of drying at 60 °C (red line). This is still higher water content than that of pure chitosan (black line) (see Supplementary Fig. 8 for an analysis of weight loss during the first immersion). g Colorimetric assay of Ni release during first immersion. ~13% of the nickel introduced contributes to intermolecular bonding (i.e., one nickel atom per eight saccharide rings), whereas the remaining 87% is released into the surrounding water. After 24 h, no further measurable nickel is released from the films, even when immersed in boiling water for several hours. Data are presented as mean values +/- SD.

At the molecular level, the C 1 s x-ray photoelectron spectrum of the surface of a nickel-doped film shows that three peaks (C-(C, H) (aliphatic), C-(N, O), and C = O/O-C-C) have higher binding energies than the same peaks in a pure chitosan film (Fig. 2d, and Supplementary Table 1). There is also a notable reduction of the area under the deconvoluted C-(N, O) peak (i.e., 286.37 eV), confirming that the primary interaction between nickel and chitosan occurs through the latter's side functional groups24,26. This observation is further supported by the shift in the peak positions of C3,5 and C2 in the ¹³C NMR (Supplementary Fig. 6), which correspond to the hydroxyl and amide groups. However, after the first immersion of a nickel-doped film in water, those differences disappear, leading to a surface analysis similar to that of pure chitosan films. The same effect is observed in the O 1 s, N 1 s, and Ni 2p spectra, which confirms the Ni +2 oxidation state and the stability of the Ni ions interacting with the side groups of the polymeric chains when the films are immersed in water for the first time (Supplementary Fig. 7), supporting the hypothesis that the permanent change in the material is because the loosely bound nickel and associated water is removed upon first immersion. This hypothesis is also substantiated by the weight loss of the nickel-doped films immediately after immersion, in contrast to the weight gain normally expected of a typically hydrophilic material (e.g., In neutralized chitosan films, their water content increases from 17% of their dry weight to 56% when they are submerged in water) due to water uptake (Supplementary Fig. 8).

In nature, chitinous materials are organized as hydrated crystals in which the relatively long-range interactions between the functional groups of adjacent polymer chains are enabled by intermediate water molecules31. The inclusion of nickel during the formation of the chitosan structure brings a new level of dynamism to the material. Nickel can form weak hydrogen bonds with multiple water molecules—whether dissociated or not—and with the oxygen and nitrogen in the functional groups of the chitosan chains. While some water is bound within the polymeric chains, large amounts are also introduced from the environment alongside the nickel (Fig. 2e). The result is a structure of stiff polymeric chains bound together by a combination of direct interchain bonds and weak, rapidly configurable bonds, mediated by highly motile particles (i.e., nickel and water) trapped within the structure (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). This versatility to bond in multiple ways also includes combinations that do not contribute to the structure, such as nickel and water molecules without significant bonds to the polymeric chains. We hypothesize that these nickel particles and associated water molecules that do not contribute to the structure are the ones released during the first immersion. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that 44% of the weight of a freshly made nickel-doped film is water, but this drops to 20% after the first immersion, which is still significantly higher than the water content in pure chitosan films (13%; Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 11). Similarly, even while the films keep their strength underwater, 87.18 ± 2.72% of the entrapped nickel is weakly bound to the chitosan and is released during the first immersion (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). This indicates that, despite the amount of nickel introduced, only 1 nickel ion per 7.91 pyran rings is required to produce the water-strengthening effect in chitosan. In a macroscopic context, this means that the nickel content of a discarded AAA battery (2.2 g) would be sufficient to manufacture more than a dozen typical drinking cups (4.7 g each) using nickel-doped chitosan.

The post-wash Ni content (~1 Ni²⁺ per eight pyranose rings) constrains site occupancy and argues against a dense lattice of permanent multidentate chelates. As discussed above, spectroscopy and structural data indicate that the residual Ni²⁺ engages primarily with side groups while retaining a substantial hydration shell, and that Ni/water incorporation reduces crystallinity. Together with the large initial loss of loosely bound Ni on first immersion ( ~ 87%) while wet strengthening persists, these observations support a water-mediated, dynamically reconfigurable network rather than a permanently cross-linked architecture. This was confirmed by chelating coordinated Ni²⁺ with 0.5 M EDTA for two hours, which collapses the films into a jelly-like material indistinguishable from chitosan (data not shown), indicating that removal of inner-sphere Ni abolishes the effect. Consistent with this picture, the wet tensile strength increases near neutral/alkaline pH (Supplementary Fig. 14), as deprotonation facilitates Ni²⁺-amine interactions. Together, these data support a mechanism in which Ni²⁺-amine interactions and water-mediated hydrogen-bond networks enable wet-state strengthening, rather than extensive, rigid Ni-polymer chelation.

The release of the inconsequential nickel during the first immersion could be seen as an optimization of the material, in which the arbitrary entrapment of the nickel needed to saturate the system is followed by a process that removes all but the nickel that contributes to the material's structure. This process is carried out in water, which is also the environment in which the films form. The resulting waste from the optimization process is therefore itself an ingredient (i.e., nickel and water) for producing the films. With this in mind, we developed a production cycle in which the water used to remove the inconsequential nickel is used as an input for fabricating films (Fig. 3a). Using this zero-waste process, we produced several objects with an approach similar to the use of chitosan in product manufacturing—that is, vitrifying it on a positive mold15. This approach enabled the production of common plasticware, such as containers and cups (Fig. 3b). Note that the purpose of these objects was to explore the material's malleability rather than its ability to replace products that might no longer be justifiable in a society that can use biological materials and regionalized production. Nevertheless, the nickel-doped chitosan containers showed that the biological molecule not only gains strength in aqueous environments but can also retain water as effectively as common plastics, demonstrating the material's suitability for such tasks (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Movie 2). The studies were extended to include the production of negative replicas, which involves maintaining contact between the material and the mold during the vitrification process to account for the inherent shrinking of the object as it forms. To overcome this limitation, we fabricated a random positioning machine (a two-axis clinostat; Fig. 3d, and Supplementary Movie 3) with two independently perpendicular frames and an attached negative mold. The continuous repositioning of the mold forced the polymeric solution to maintain contact during vitrification, enabling the molding of closed geometries and a qualitative improvement in the esthetics of the objects compared to those produced with positive molds (Fig. 3e).

a Diagram of zero-waste production of Ni-doped chitosan objects. The inconsequential nickel released during the optimization of one object is used as a primary component for the next by topping up the nickel content. The system ensures 100% utilization of nickel despite the need to saturate the material with large amounts of it during vitrification to achieve the water-strengthening effect (see Fig. 1h). The top-left corner shows the process's actual inputs and outputs, expressed as weights. As a reference, the drinking cup in the next panel weighs 4.7 g. b Replica of a drinking cup made of nickel-doped chitosan formed using a negative mold (i.e., the material vitrifies against the mold's outside walls). On the right is the same object after the inconsequential nickel has been removed by immersion in water—a process that has no apparent impact on its geometry. See Supplementary Fig. 13 for closer images of the color change due to the release of the inconsequential nickel. c Images of a nickel-doped chitosan cup filled with water, demonstrating the material's impermeability. A detailed recording of the first 24 h is in Supplementary Movie 2. d Picture of the clinostat used to replicate negative molds for the nickel-doped chitosan. The continuous movement forces the material to vitrify against the inner walls, enabling the fabrication of closed geometries and producing more accurate, high-quality objects (see Supplementary Movie 3 for more detailed information). e Comparison of the same objects fabricated using negative (i.e., with the clinostat in the previous panel) and positive molds. f An example of a three-square-meter film made of nickel-doped chitosan used to test the process's scalability. Detailed information on this construct is provided in Supplementary Movie 4.

In the last few decades, the materials proposed for ecologically integrated manufacturing have focused on recovery processes32 or uncommon biological components with limited scalability33. The approach here is based on the biomimetic coordination of a transitional metal with chitin, Earth's second-most abundant organic material, with an estimated renewable production rate of 1011 tonnes per year34—the equivalent of three centuries of plastic production. Such production is sustainable, seamlessly integrated into Earth's ecological cycles, and easily reproducible in urban environments through the bioconversion of food and other organic wastes17. This unparalleled bioavailability enables the potential scaling of the results presented here to unprecedented levels for a new technology by avoiding the need to develop an industrial biosynthesis but, more importantly, the theoretical upscaling of production to quantities with a global impact and the regionalization of that production. To explore the potential for upscaling—even within the limited confines of a research laboratory—we produced a 1 m2 chitosan-doped film and tested its ability to hold weight after 24 h of water immersion (Supplementary Movie 4). Building on the initial scale-up, we produced a film three times larger without notable processing challenges (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Movie 4); importantly, these large-area films remained mechanically robust during handling and exhibited similar macroscopic mechanical behavior to smaller-area samples, demonstrating an absence of scalability restrictions and highlighting the potential for rapid scaling of the results and principles presented here to ecologically relevant scales.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the interaction between a transition metal—specifically nickel—and chitosan creates unique material properties for the molecule in its native form, from the tunability of elastic properties without impacting material strength to improving mechanical performance underwater. Unlike the usual approach of fitting biological molecules into the synthetic polymers paradigm, the production process presented here applies the principles of bioinspired manufacturing by adapting biological strategies to use unmodified biological components, applying water-based and environmentally friendly chemistries, and minimizing waste production35,36. This strategy preserves the natural biodegradability of chitin-derived polymers (Supplementary Fig. 15), without relying on special conditions, human intervention, or recovery.

The results presented here represent an approach to manufacturing in biological environments and a departure from the current view that assumes inertness is unavoidably associated with resilience. In the case of polymer-based materials, resilience is achieved through heavily crosslinked long molecules that depend on strong and exhaustive internal links to produce materials that are unresponsive to the surrounding environment. Here, resilience is achieved in a biomimetic way, using the environment instead of fighting it, relying on water transport between the nickel-doped chitosan and the environment to create a dynamic structure of weak and long-range intermolecular bonds in continuous reconfiguration.

Because of the mechanical properties of the nickel-doped chitosan in water-based environments, the absence of a human immune response, and existing FDA approval for medical uses of both nickel37 and chitosan38 individually, we foresee applications of these results in the medical field and as a waterproof coating for biomaterials35 while the proposed shaping technologies are perfected and upscaled for general use (refer to the supplementary material for an additional discussion on health and environmental impact). However, in a world that generates 400 million tonnes of persistent solid waste every year, much of it specifically for its performance in water environments39, we believe the approach presented here and the principles and materials upon which it is based will have implications at an unprecedented scale. They mark the potential for a paradigm shift toward bioinspired manufacturing based on ubiquitous biological materials, regional production, and environmental integration, which can address the limitations of current manufacturing and curb humanity's persistent waste production40.

Chitosan was sourced from shrimp-processing factory byproducts in India, provided by iChess Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. Industrial-grade acetic acid and nickel chloride hexahydrate (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were obtained from local vendors and used as received.

Films were fabricated by dissolving chitosan flakes in 1% acetic acid under continuous stirring for 48 h at room temperature to prepare a 3 wt% chitosan solution. Nickel chloride solutions at concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 M were prepared separately in 10 mL of distilled water. Both solutions (i.e., chitosan and nickel) were mixed through continuous stirring for 6 h to ensure the uniform distribution of nickel ions in the chitosan solution. The solution was poured into a Petri dish to prepare the standard samples, which were then dried in an air oven at 40 °C for 24 h. However, similar results have been obtained with other molds and drying conditions (e.g., 3 m2 films dried at room temperature; see Supplementary Movies 3 and 4). The samples are coded as Cs, 0.6 M, 0.8 M, 1.0 M, 1.2 M, 1.4 M relative to the Molar concentration of Ni in the original solution. Depending on the state of the film, they are also labeled as fresh for chitosan and chitosan-nickel films or constructs after they are dried/vitrified from the original solution. Washed for nickel-doped constructs (e.g., films) that have been immersed in water for more than 24 h at least once, and the inconsequential Ni has been removed. Wet for constructs currently or recently immersed in water and still soaked, retaining large amounts of excess water. Dry for constructs that have been oven-dried and have had excess water removed. Appropriate safety equipment was used during reagent handling.

The chitosan films (i.e., without nickel) used to compare the underwater properties of pure chitosan with nickel-doped chitosan were neutralized with 1 M NaOH to prevent dissolution upon immersion. Freshly prepared films were washed five times in a beaker containing NaOH solution, then rinsed in double-distilled water in another container. For all other characterizations, the pure chitosan and nickel-doped chitosan films are prepared using the same procedure (i.e., without neutralization).

The crystallographic structures of the polymers were determined using an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., UK) with a Cu anode, generating Cu Kα radiation. The patterns were recorded at room temperature using continuous scanning between 5 and 60°.

UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1800, Shimadzu Corp., JP) was used to measure the light absorption of the films in the 200–800 nm wavelength range. Beer-Lambert's law was used to determine the concentration of nickel released. Samples with a fixed Ni concentration were used as references to determine the unknown Ni concentration in a solution. The standard data were obtained by plotting absorbance versus the known Ni concentrations (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 M). From this plot, the unknown concentration of Ni in water (falling in the range between 0 and 1.6 M) can be determined with absorbance values.

The morphology of the samples was characterized using Scanning electron microscopy (JSM-7600F, JEOL Ltd., Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Before imaging, samples were gold-coated to render the surface conductive.

Three-dimensional representations of the chitosan, nickel, and water molecules were created using 3D Studio (Autodesk Inc., San Francisco, USA). The atomic positions in the 3D space and atomic radii were sourced from PubChem (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA). In Fig. 2e, the polymer chains have been ‘flattened' (i.e., molecular bonds' out-of-plane twists have been removed) for illustrative purposes.

Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) using a spectrometer (VERTEX 70 FT-IR, Bruker Corp. USA) in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) between 4000–400 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Chitosan's degree of deacetylation (DD) was calculated by comparing the absorbance of the measured peak at 1650 cm−1 (which is proportional to the DA) with that of the reference peak at 3450 cm−1 (which is independent of the DA)10. The DD of 86.82 ± 2.86% was determined using the equation:

The orbital level information was obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Axis Supra Plus, Kratos Analytical, UK). The data were acquired using Al Kα as the X-ray source. The wide scan had a pass energy of 160 eV (1 eV step size), and the narrow scan was 20 eV (0.1 eV step size). The data obtained were analyzed using CasaXPS (Casa Software Ltd., GB). A standard carbon C1s peak (284.8 eV) was used for reference, and Shirley background was used to correct the spectrum. The data were deconvoluted using a Gaussian Lorentzian (GL-30) line shape function to determine the films' oxidation state and elemental composition.

The intrinsic viscosity and viscosity-average molecular weight were determined using an Ubbelohde capillary viscometer with a capillary diameter of 0.8 mm. We tested four concentrations of a chitosan solution in a solvent system composed of 0.3 M acetic acid and 0.2 M sodium acetate at a temperature of 25 °C11. The experimental results were then used in the Mark–Houwink equation to determine the molecular weights:

Where [η] is the intrinsic viscosity, K and α are Mark-Houwink constants. K and α were previously determined under identical conditions to be 0.74 × 10−3 and 0.76, respectively. The viscosity-average molecular weight of the chitosan used in these experiments was 189,520.5 ± 1,179.2 Da.

Mechanical strength was measured using a universal testing machine (UTM; Instron 5943) for both dry and wet samples. Dog-bone-shaped samples with a test dimension of 10 × 2 cm (L × W) were used for the tensile tests. The measurements were conducted at room temperature, with a RH of 70%. Wet samples were immersed in water for 24 h and then removed immediately prior to measurement. A customized setup consisting of a water container with a pass-through attachment to the tensile tester container was engineered to accurately measure the samples' underwater performance. Wet tensile testing was conducted with a gauge length submersion of 7 cm, a controlled strain rate of 1 mm/min, and grip forces of ~1.5 kN applied at an air pressure of 6–8 bar. This configuration ensured that the sample remained in water during the tensile test. The dry samples were tested in the empty container to avoid introducing variability between the dry and wet tests. See Supplementary Movie 1 for an example of a test.

To test the effects of solution acidity and alkalinity on mechanical performance, the tensile strength of the Cs-Ni samples was measured at pH 4, 7, and 10 using buffer solutions. A 0.9% NaCl solution was used to evaluate the effect of a saline environment.

The water transport and decomposition of the polymer matrix were studied using a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA Q50) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The data were recorded over the temperature ranges 30 to 600 °C (TGA) and 30 to 300 °C (DSC) at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen.

The changes in the chemical structure as a function of Ni content were studied using 400 MHz solid-state NMR (Bruker).

The polymer swelling behavior was studied using 5 cm × 3 cm films immersed in water, and the films were weighed every hour for 24 h. The swelling degree was determined using the relation.

Where WW and Wo are the weight of a wet sample at a given time point and its initial (dry) weight, respectively.

The Nickel released in water was reused for manufacturing new composite films, following the same procedure described in the methodology to prepare composite films, with the only difference that the same amount of nickel that remained in the washed construct is added to the wastewater to achieve the right concentration for the formation of new constructs.

A two-axis clinostat, a random positioning machine with two independently perpendicular frames usually utilized to simulate microgravity environments, was equipped with a positive mold to create a negative replica of CsNi composite-based objects. The frame, constructed with aluminum profiles, is powered by two stepper motors and controlled by an Arduino UNO microcontroller, which independently operates both motors. We used the AccelStepper library to program the system. The system produces a continuous movement between two positions or moves to random positions at a pre-determined rate.

A standard soil burial test was used to assess the biodegradation of the CsNi samples in environmental conditions. Individually weighed groups of samples were buried in garden soil, and degradation was monitored until the material's half-life (i.e., half of the material had degraded) was reached, which occurred after ~four months (128 days). The samples were collected from the soil at 20-day intervals, and mass loss was assessed by weighing them after washing and drying. The mass loss of various degraded samples was measured to assess the extent of degradation in the soil over time.

Chatbot-driven lab robots are automating methods such as protein synthesis.Credit: Du Yu/Xinhua via Alamy

Last year, synthetic biologist Meagan Olsen performed the biggest experimental campaign of her career.

The PhD student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, was trying to make proteins in a test tube more efficiently. Across more than 40 experiments over 4 months, she tested 1,231 combinations of sugars, amino acids and other ingredients, including cellular machinery, before landing on a cocktail that was at least six-times cheaper than existing cell-free protein-synthesis recipes1.

Now, an ‘autonomous laboratory' system made up of a large language model (LLM) ‘scientist', lab robotics that automate simple tasks such as liquid transfer and human overseers created by scientists at artificial-intelligence firm OpenAI in San Francisco, California, and Ginkgo Bioworks, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has eclipsed Olsen's record. It achieved a further 40% reduction in cost, after testing more than 30,000 experimental conditions over 6 months.

The findings — described in a paper2 posted on the bioRxiv preprint server on 5 February — have sparked discussion over the extent to which chatbot-controlled robots could replace humans.

‘Set it and forget it': automated lab uses AI and robotics to improve proteins

‘Set it and forget it': automated lab uses AI and robotics to improve proteins

“That is going to be the future of biology,” says Philip Romero, a protein engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

However, the technology has some way to go before it can gain wide usage. Existing lab robotics still struggle to perform tasks that require dexterous skills or conduct bespoke experiments, such as those involving tissue samples or animals. And achieving some complex research goals is beyond the grasp of existing AI tools. But, even as autonomous-lab systems grow more capable, scientists stress that human expertise will continue to be an essential ingredient for research.

Most efforts to apply autonomous labs to biology have focused on engineering proteins. Romero's team, for instance, paired a simple machine-learning model with liquid-handling lab robotics to improve a protein's heat tolerance3. Others have used more sophisticated ‘protein language models' to predict amino-acid changes — implemented by lab robotics — that can enhance an enzyme's activity4.

Cell-free protein synthesis — in which various combinations of chemicals are mixed with a bacterial cell lysate containing protein-making machinery and a protein-encoding DNA sequence — seemed like a suitable challenge for cutting-edge LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-5 that have excelled in mathematics, computer coding and theoretical physics, says Joy Jiao, who is the life-sciences research lead at OpenAI. “We really wanted to benchmark GPT-5's performance in real biology.”

Self-driving laboratories, advanced immunotherapies and five more technologies to watch in 2025

The Ginkgo-OpenAI set-up used GPT-5 to interpret results and design experiments that could be performed by Ginkgo's lab robotics. The researchers supplied reagents and implemented GPT-5's experimental designs. They also made protocol tweaks and, after three experimental rounds, gave GPT-5 access to a preprint paper describing Olson's work, as well as the ability to access other literature on the Internet. GPT-5 kept a lab notebook of data interpretations and hypotheses.

Before the model had access to the Internet or Olsen's preprint, one of its notebook entries hypothesized a cost-saving reagent swap that Olsen's team also used. “The model actually had pretty decent biochemical reasoning capabilities,” says Jiao.

Nonetheless, the biggest improvements to the efficiency of protein synthesis came from the experimental steps after GPT-5 had access to fresh information. “All of that allowed it to make a big leap forward and actually beat the human state of the art,” Jiao adds.

Michael Jewett, a synthetic biologist at Stanford University in California, who supervised Olsen's effort, says the Ginkgo–OpenAI recipe for cell-free protein synthesis is broadly similar to the one he, Olsen and their colleagues came up with. However, it's difficult to know how much of his lab's work helped GPT-5 to design its experiments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Burnt Hair and Soft Power: A Night Out With Evie Magazine","https://www.wired.com/story/burnt-hair-and-soft-power-a-night-out-with-evie-magazine/","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 16:00:00 GMT","

Just after 8:00 pm on Sunday night, Evie Magazine's first live event was finally getting started. The women's magazine, which was founded in 2019 and once described itself as a “conservative Cosmo,” welcomed eager fans to celebrate the publication, generally, and its new issue, specifically, during New York Fashion Week at the Standard Hotel's Boom in Chelsea.

Guests lined up outside, hugging fur coats around formal dresses, as hosts scanned a list for their names. One blonde woman begged for access to the VIP section; an event planner ran downstairs to tell her coworkers that someone's hair had caught on fire. Upstairs, women crowded the entrance for the chance to be photographed against a larger-than-life plastic Evie Magazine cover that declared, “Welcome to the Romantic Era.” (The other cover lines: “‘Your secret feminine power,” “12 ways to make him swoon,” and “Feminine fashion we love: corsets, dresses, & drama.”)

The party was hosted by Brittany Hugoboom, the editor in chief, and her cofounder and husband Gabriel Hugoboom. The invitation billed it as a “celebration of romance & beauty,” with attendees promised an “immersive night of live music, gorgeous visuals, captivating performances, delicious food and drinks, and a secret reveal.”

Aside from the lingering stench of burnt hair and the prominent “EVIE” projected above the wraparound gold bar, it was hard to distinguish the event from any other party, which certainly seemed like the point. There was virtually no overt mention of politics, and the kind of conservatism in the air had more to do with Sydney Sweeney than abstinence.

But Evie, which critics call “alt-right,” is inherently political. Evie has been soundly embraced by different corners of the Republican Party: Candace Owens, Steve Bannon, and Brett Cooper—a conservative commentator who attended the party—all champion Evie. The magazine itself, meanwhile, traffics in conspiracy theories, shares anti-vaccine content, dispenses tradwife inspo (remember Ballerina Farm?), rejects “modern” feminism, and pushes an app founded by the Hugobooms called 28, where users log information about their periods to calculate their menstrual cycle. Advertisements for the app, which was initially funded in part by Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel, run next to articles that criticize hormonal birth control and push women to get off the pill. (Brittany Hugoboom told The New York Times that she pitched Thiel, one of many conservatives concerned about declining US birthrates, on the “fertility crisis.”)

If you think all of this sounds more or less like what you'd get from any right-wing media enterprise these days, you'd be correct. What distinguishes Evie, aside from its unusual soft-focus photography of glamorously dressed women milking cows, is that this sort of content runs alongside listicles titled, for example, “7 Questions to Ask Early If You Want a Serious Relationship” or “How to Dress Like Olivia Dean on a Budget.” It's a classic example of soft power in action—just as the appeal of mid-century Hollywood films wasn't necessarily the anti-Communist messaging but the glitz and glamour, the strength of Evie's politics are in its pretense that it doesn't have any.

To many attendees, that is the goal not just of the party, but of Evie in general. “That's how we shift the culture,” said one attendee, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of her career. She credited Evie with the beginning of a Republican cultural revival. “We've been so policy-focused that we lost the culture, and we need to take that back if we want to win.” That's what made this party notable. Evie's conservatism-without-conservatism messaging has long drawn attention (including profiles by numerous publications). But now, going into a consequential midterm election in which the polls look grim for the GOP, that messaging seems less a curiosity than a necessity. Here at least was proof of the concept that Evie-ism can make a compelling backdrop for young women unsure about what the Republican movement means to them.

The anonymous attendee also told me Evie's content really just resonated with her. “Evie has done a great job of combining the fashion, the high fashion, the beautiful photography, and beautiful art that we as women know and love that we were getting from the Vogues, but we didn't want to be lectured about the values that we don't agree with,” she said.

For subscribers, there is no better messenger than the editor in chief, who introduced the print cover at the beginning of the party for the new, sex-themed issue. (While sex was the topic of the evening, Evie articles and even guests at the party were quick to assure me that it's an activity for married couples only.) “We started with a mission to embrace femininity,” Brittany Hugoboom announced. “I think we're ahead of the curve.”

“We want to officially declare tonight: Romance is back,” added Gabriel Hugoboom.

Photographs from the new issue were then physically unveiled around the room. For all the talk of the lost art of the feminine mystique, the photographs, featuring a woman clad in lace smoldering at the camera with her long hair tossed into the shadows, more than anything recalled the lost arts of the Victoria's Secret catalog circa 2002.

With Evie's emphasis on appealing to the young woman of the moment, you would be forgiven for thinking that not just the cover shoot but the party had taken place 15 years ago. While attendees appeared to be young women and men primarily under the age of 30, slow, jazzy covers of Lana Del Rey's “Summertime Sadness” and Britney Spears' “Hit Me Baby One More Time” played over the speakers. The event space, Boom—formerly known as the Boom Boom Room—used to be one of New York's most exclusive clubs; it's now for private events only and appears in the cultural zeitgeist periodically as a post–Met Gala party location.

At the peak of the club's fame in 2010, Gossip Girl, a teen soap opera about privileged students on Manhattan's Upper East Side, filmed an episode there, featuring a cameo from Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner in which they celebrated the New York Observer and its bachelor of the year award. (In real life, Kushner still owned the newspaper, before he sold it in 2017 amidst accusations of editorial interference.) It's difficult to imagine any members of the Trump family receiving a role on mainstream television these days, but in those days Donald Trump was not president, and the couple, who had not yet fled for Florida, was still enjoying their role as an enviable pair in the city's social hierarchy. In context, in fact, Kushner's was the bolder-faced name.

It felt extra fitting, then, for Boom, where a mainstream show had sanitized the Trumps years before, to be the site of yet another celebration where its hosts strove to make conservatism as palatable, envy-inducing, and glamorous as possible.

“I know some women who read Evie who aren't even conservative, and a lot of the content for Evie, it's just fun, it's just interesting. But for women who want to be into beauty and conservative, it's great that they ask for that type of thing,” said Lauren Chen, a conservative commentator from Canada. Chen cofounded Tenet Media, which US federal prosecutors alleged in 2024 was receiving funding and guidance from a covert Russian influence operation. In a post on X in September 2025, Chen denied the allegations.

Even the simply fun and interesting content from Evie often betrays, if not political leanings, at least a sensibility. One aspiring content creator, Camila Bronson, told me she wrote an article for Evie about “why personal alignment is the ultimate political act.” She basically posited the government as a bad boyfriend: “When you are sovereign in yourself, you don't need to be controlled by a government. So it's about becoming ungovernable, and finding ways to be more independent of the grid, such as regenerative agriculture, learning how to plant, or cooking … little ways, where you build sovereignty in your life, instead of, like, relying on, you know, someone else that doesn't really care about you.” Whether this was conservativism as relationship advice or the reverse was hard to say.

Many attendees, though, just seemed thrilled to be there, less concerned with any political underpinnings than with the photo booth in the corner and the DJ wearing Retrofête. At the VIP tables, red anthurium flowers—the very perennials that inspired numerous yonic Georgia O'Keefe paintings—drooped above cigarette cartons served on silver étagère trays. Women sporting Yves Saint Laurent and Prada bags sipped cocktails named “Wild at Heart,” “Decent Proposal,” and “French Kiss.” The mocktail was called “Sweet Nothing.” A former Miss New York beauty pageant winner walked around the room.

While on a smoke break, several tuxedo-suited men fawned over how much they liked Sydney Sweeney. Women were clad in Love Shack Fancy, Cult Gaia, and Reformation. I didn't see any of Evie's famous raw milkmaid dresses—a limited-edition fashion drop from the magazine that capitalized on tradwife content—but it was nighttime and also Fashion Week.

“The party was apolitical, that's how I felt,” said Pariah the Doll, a New York model and artist known for detransitioning. But, they added, “Everyone I knew there was from Republican circles. I saw people I knew from the Republican Club gala. I saw people that I know from church, but we didn't discuss politics.” Pariah just walked in conservative designer Elena Velez's New York Fashion Week show with Clavicular, a streamer popular on the right wing who has brought “looksmaxxing”—the singular focus on men increasing their physical attractiveness—to the mainstream. (The language that's come from the looksmaxxing or manosphere communities cropped up at the party: “We're definitely mogging on every other event happening tonight,” Gabriel Hugoboom said in his speech.)

Scrolling through the reposted photographs on Evie's Instagram the day after the party, the accounts started to blend. “I love God, my family, moving my body, optimizing my health,” read one Instagram bio. “Controversial woman of God,” “Jesus Christ - The Way, The Truth, and The Life,” and “Aspiring trophy wife, lover of Jesus” read more. Other partygoers, according to Instagram, had mainly been models.

Google on Wednesday introduced its latest entry-level Pixel smartphone. The $499 Pixel 10a launches with new AI software capabilities and minor hardware updates. The smartphone is available for preorder now with shipments starting March 5.  It comes in Lavender, Berry, Fog, and Obsidian.

The Pixel 10a features a completely flat back, which means the camera bar blends with the back of the phone and lies flat when you place it down on a surface.

Google notes that the smartphone's 6.3-inch Actua display is 11% brighter than the Pixel 9a. It also has faster charging than its predecessor, with more than 30 hours of battery life and up to 120 hours with the “Extreme Battery Saver” setting turned on.

The Pixel 10a comes with the same Tensor G4 chip that powered last year's Pixel 9a. It features a 48MP main camera, which Google says is the best camera on a phone under $500, along with a 13MP ultrawide camera.

After first debuting on the Pixel 10 series last summer, Google is bringing a set of AI-powered camera features to the A-series phone. The “Auto Best Take” feature captures multiple frames in one shutter press and automatically selects the best version so everyone looks good in a group photo, while the “Camera Coach” feature gives users step-by-step guidance on lighting and composition.

Additionally, Google is bringing Satellite SOS to the A-series for the first time, allowing users to connect with emergency services even when they don't have Wi-Fi or cellular service.

As with recent Pixel phones, the Pixel 10a will come with seven years of software and security updates.

It's worth noting that the Pixel 10a doesn't have the “PixelSnap” magnetic Qi charging feature on the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

The smartphone's arrival comes just ahead of Apple's upcoming new entry-level phone, the iPhone 17e. The device is expected to cost $599, like last year's iPhone 16e.

Google also announced that it's launching Pixel Buds 2a in two new colors, Berry and Fog, to go with the Pixel 10a.

Snap's direct revenue business has reached a $1 billion annualized revenue run rate, the company announced on Wednesday. Annualized revenue refers to a business's current revenue rate projected over a full year. The social media giant says the milestone is driven by its Snapchat+ offering, which has now surpassed 25 million subscribers.

Launched in 2022, Snapchat+ gives subscribers access to exclusive and pre-release features for $3.99 per month. Following a successful launch, Snap introduced additional paid tiers beyond the core Snapchat+ subscription over the past year to further diversify its revenue streams.

“Snapchat+ has become one of the fastest-growing consumer subscription services globally, with subscriber growth every quarter,” the company wrote in a blog post. “What started as an early-access program for our most engaged Snapchatters has quickly scaled into a meaningful business—one that now represents a strong and growing revenue stream alongside our ads business.”

Last June, Snapchat launched Lens+, which gives users access to exclusive Lenses and AR experiences, along with the perks in the standard Snapchat+ tier, for $8.99 per month. 

In early 2025, the company launched an ad-free Snapchat+ subscription tier called Platinum for $15.99 per month. And, in a controversial move in September, Snapchat announced plans to cap free storage for its Memories feature and launched a paid storage plan that costs $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ subscribers will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB.

Moving beyond Snapchat+, the company announced yesterday that it's launching creator subscriptions in alpha with select people in the U.S. Users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscriptions, which will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator's public Stories, and an ad-free experience for that creator's Stories.

In terms of the future, Snap says it's going to continue to grow Snapchat+ with a focus on customization and community-driven features. 

Snap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, and rival Meta is following suit, as the company told TechCrunch last month that it was going to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.

Creative company Canva ended 2025 on a high note with a 20% increase in monthly active users, growth that was partially propelled by adoption of its AI tools. 

Canva had more than 265 million monthly active users and over 31 million paid users in 2025, according to the company. That user base helped push its annual recurring revenue to $4 billion by the end of year, Canva co-founder and COO Cliff Obrecht told TechCrunch on the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar. The subscription-based company also saw its B2B business, which accounts for companies with more than 25 seats, grow by 100% with $500 million in ARR. 

The company still sees the majority of its business from North America, with continued growth in international markets. To increase paying users, Canva has introduced lower-priced subscriptions in countries like Pakistan, Uruguay, Morocco, and Jamaica.

Canva's AI investments are paying off, according to Obrecht. The company debuted a tool that lets users create mini apps and websites using AI last year. Obrecht noted the tool has more than 10 million monthly active users now. It's been successful enough that the company is thinking about putting AI at the center and acting like a “design agency in your pocket,” Obrecht said.

That shift to AI comes as Canva faces competition from the likes of Adobe, Freepik, and Apple, which has pushed to become a full-packaged creator suite by bundling apps like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage into a $12.99 per month Creator Studio.

“Where we started was… we got the Canva platform, and we're giving the Canva platform a bunch of AI tools. We're inverting that now. We're becoming an AI platform with a bunch of design tools. So you can think of it more like a cursor for design,” he said.

Canva is also actively integrating with chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude. It said that by October 2025, users had more than 26 million conversations with the Canva app on ChatGPT. It also claimed that Canva was one of the top 10 referred domains from ChatGPT.

Obrecht said that the company is allocating resources to work on having Canva surface in LLM search results, along with working on SEO.

“So we drove a lot of early days in Canva through Google, really understood people's search intent, and delivered them content that they could then go into our product and edit. And so we really see ChatGPT or any of the LLMs top of the funnel acquisition platforms,” he said. 

He noted that while search is a big driving factor, traffic through LLM referrals is in double-digit percentages. The company is also allocating resources to have Canva surface more in chatbots.

Canva was last valued at $42 billion in a share sell. Obrecht told Bloomberg last November that the company will go public in the next “couple of years.”

We do have some idea. Kimi K2 is a relatively high performing open source model. People have it running at 24 tokens/second on a pair of Mac Studios, which costs 20k. This setup requires less than a KW of power, so the $0.8-0.15 being spent there is negligible compared to a developer. This might be the cheapest setup to run locally, but it's almost certain that the cost per token is far cheaper with specialized hardware at scale.In other words, a near-frontier model is running at a cost that a (somewhat wealthy) hobbyist can afford. And it's hard to imagine that the hardware costs don't come down quite a bit. I don't doubt that tokens are heavily subsidized but I think this might be overblown [1].[1] training models is still extraordinarily expensive and that is certainly being subsidized, but you can amortize that cost over a lot of inference, especially once we reach a plateau for ideas and stop running training runs as frequently.

Is Kimi K2 near-frontier though? At least when run in an agent harness, and for general coding questions, it seems pretty far from it. I know what the benchmarks say, they always say it's great and close to frontier models, but is this other's impression in practice? Maybe my prompting style works best with GPT-type models, but I'm just not seeing that for the type of engineering work I do, which is fairly typical stuff.

reply

I've been pretty active in the open model space and 2 years ago you would have had to pay 20k to run models that were nowhere near as powerful. It wouldn't surprise me if in two more years we continue to see more powerful open models on even cheaper hardware.

Are you just using the API mode?

reply

So above and beyond frontier models? Because they certainly aren't ""flawless"" yet, or we have very different understanding of that word.

During the day I am working on building systems that move lots of data around where context and understanding of the business problem is everything. I largely use LLMs for assistance. This is because I need the system to be robust, scalable, maintainable by other people and adaptable to large range of future needs. LLMs will never be flawless in a meaningful sense in this space (at least in my opinion).When I'm using Kimi I'm using it for purely vibe coded projects where I don't look at the code (and if I do I consider this a sign I'm not thinking about the problem correctly). Are these programs robust, scalable, generalizable, adaptable to future use case? No, not at all. But they don't need to be, they need to serve a single user for exactly the purpose I have. There are tasks that used to take me hours that now run in the background while I'm at work.In this latter sense I say ""flawless"" because 90% of my requests solve the problem on the first pass, and the 10% of the time where there is some error, it is resolved in a single request, and I don't have to ever look at the code. For me that ""don't have to look at the code"" is a big part of my definition of ""flawless"".

This is what I've been increasingly understanding is the wrong way to understand how LLMs are changing things.I fully agree that LLMs are not suitable for creating production code. But the bigger question you need to ask is 'why do we need production code?' (and to be clear, there are and always will be cases where this is true, just increasingly less of them)The entire paradigm of modern software engineering is fairly new. I mean it wasn't until the invention of the programmable microprocessor that we even had the concept of software and that was less than 100 years ago. Even if you go back to the 80s, a lot of software doesn't need to be distributed or serve a endless variety of users. I've been reading a lot of old Common Lisp books recently and it's fascinating how often you're really programming lisp for you and your experiments. But since the advent of the web and scaling software to many users with diverse needs we've increasingly needed to maintain systems that have all the assumed properties of ""production"" software.Scalable, robust, adaptable software is only a requirement because it was previously infeasible for individuals to build non-trivial systems for solving any more than a one or two personal problems. Even software engineers couldn't write their own text editor and still have enough time to also write software.All of the standard requirements of good software exist for reasons that are increasingly becoming less relevant. You shouldn't rely on agents/LLMs to write production code, but you also should increasingly question ""do I need production code?""

Now, these models are a bit weaker, but they're in the realm of Claude Sonnet to Claude Opus 4. 6-12 months behind SOTA on something that's well within a personal hobby budget.

Same with unsloth/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF:F16 gets 25 tps and gpt-oss20b gets 195 tps!!!The advantage is that you can use the APU for booting, and pass through the GPU to a VM, and have nice safer VMs for agents at the same time while using DDR4 IMHO.

I won't use a public model for my secret sauce, no reason to help the foundation models on my secret sauce.Even an old 1080ti works well for FIM for IDEs.IMHO the above setup works well for boilerplate and even the sota models fail for the domain specific portions.While I lucked out and foresaw the huge price increases, you can still find some good deals. Old gaming computers work pretty well, especially if you have Claude code locally churn on the boring parts while you work on the hard parts.

I'm still not sold on the idea, but this allows me to experiment with it fully locally, without paying rent to some companies I find quite questionable, and I can know exactly how much power I'm drawing and the money is already spent, I'm not spendding hundreds a month on a subscription.And yes, the Strix Halo isn't the only way to run models locally for a relatively affordable price; it's just the one I happened to pick, mostly because I already needed a new laptop, and that 128 GiB of unified RAM is pretty nice even when I'm not using most of it for a model.

In the past 6 months, all my code has been written by claude code and gemini cli. I have written code backend, frontend, infrastructure and iOS. Considering my career trajectory all of this was impossible a couple of years ago.But the technical debt has been enormous. And I'll be honest, my understanding of these technologies hasn't been 'expert' level. I'm 100% sure any experienced dev could go through my code and may think it's a load of crap requiring serious re-architecture.It works (that's great!) but the 'software engineering' side of things is still subpar.

We've been trying to build well engineered, robust, scalable systems because software had to be written to serve other users.But LLMs change that. I have a bunch of vibe coded command lines tools that exactly solve my problems, but very likely would make terrible software. The thing is, this program only needs to run on my machine the way I like to use it.In a growing class of cases bespoke tools are superior to generalized software. This historically was not the case because it took too much time and energy to maintain these things. But today if my vibe coded solution breaks, I can rebuild it almost instantly (because I understand the architecture). It takes less time today to build a bespoke tool that solved your problem than it does to learn how to use existing software.There's still plenty of software that cannot be replaced with bespoke tools, but that list is shrinking.

The value proposition isn't really ""we'll help you write all the code for your company"" it's a world where the average user's computer is a dumb terminal that opens up to a ChatGPT interface.I didn't initially understand the value prop but have increasingly come to see it. The gamble is that LLMs will be your interface to everything the same way HTTP was for the last 20 years.The mid-90s had a similar mix of deep skepticism and hype-driven madness (and if you read my comments you'll see I've historically been much closer to the skeptic side, despite a lot of experience in this space). But even in the 90s the hyped-up bubble riders didn't really see the idea that http would be how everything happens. We've literally hacked a document format and document serving protocol to build the entire global application infrastructure.We saw a similar transformation with mobile devices where most of your world lives on a phone and the phone maker gets a nice piece of that revenue.People thought Zuck was insane for his metaverse obsession, but what he was chasing was that next platform. He was wrong of course, but what his hope was was that VR would be the way people did everything.Now this is what the LLM providers are really after. Claude/ChatGPT/Grok will be your world. You won't have to buy SaaS subscriptions for most things because you can just build it yourself. Why use Hubspot when you can just have AI do all your marketting, then you just need Hubspot for their message sending infrastructure. Why pay for a budgeting app when you can just build a custom one that lives on OpenAIs server (today your computer, but tomorrow theirs). Companies like banks will maintain interfaces to LLMs but you won't be doing your banking in their web app. Even social media will ultimately be replaced by an endless stream of bespoke images video and content made just for you (and of course it will be much easier to inject advertising into this space you don't even recognize as advertising).The value prop is that these large, well funded, AI companies will just eat large chunks of industry.

There are a ton of recipe management apps out there, and all of them are more complex than I really need. They have to be, because other people looking for recipe management software have different needs and priorities. So I just vibe coded my own recipe management app in an afternoon that does exactly what I want and nothing more. I'm sure it would crash and burn if I ever tried to launch it at scale, but I don't have to care about that.If I was in the SaaS business I would be extremely worried about the democratization of bespoke software.

Claude Code is producing working useful GUIs for me using Qt via pyside6.  They work well but I have no doubt that a dev with real experience with Qt would shudder.  Nonetheless, because it does work, I am content to accept that this code isn't meant to be maintained by people so I don't really care if it's ugly.

reply

FOSS meant that the cost of building on reusable components was nearly zero.  Large public clouds meant the cost of running code was negligible.  And now the model providers (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI) means that the cost of producing the code is relatively small.  When the marginal cost of producing code approaches zero, we start optimizing for all the things around it.  Code is now like steel.  It's somewhat valuable by itself, but we don't need the town blacksmith to make us things anymore.What is still valuable is the intuition to know what to build, and when to build it.  That's the je ne sais quoi still left in our profession.

Expert generalists are also almost impossible to distinguish from bullshitters. It's why we get along so well with LLMs. ;)

reply

The generalist capability boost is real. I'm shipping things that would have required frontend, backend, and devops specialists two years ago. But a new specialization is quietly emerging alongside that: people who understand how LLM pipelines behave in production.This is genuinely hard knowledge that doesn't transfer from traditional engineering. Multi-step agent pipelines fail in ways that look nothing like normal software bugs - context contamination between model calls, confidence-correlated hallucinations that vary by model family, retry logic that creates feedback loops in agentic chains. Debugging this requires understanding the statistical behavior of models as much as the code.My guess: the profession splits more than it unifies. Most developers will use LLMs to be faster generalists on standard work. A smaller group will specialize in building the infrastructure those LLMs run on - model routing, context management, failure isolation, eval pipelines. That second group isn't really a generalist or a traditional specialist. It's something new.The Fowler article's 'supervisory middle loop' concept hints at this - someone has to monitor what the agents are doing, and that role requires both breadth and a very specific kind of depth.

If you want to get/stay good at debugging--again IMO--it's more important to be involved in operations, where shit goes wrong in the real world because you're dealing with real invalid data that causes problems like poison pill messages stuck in a message queue, real hardware failures causing services to crash, real network problems like latency and timeouts that cause services which work in the happy path to crumble under pressure. Not only does this instil a more methodical mentality in you, it also makes you a better developer because you think about more classes of potential problems and how to handle them.

A useful complement is the programmer-level shift: agents are great at narrow, reversible work when verification is cheap.
Concretely, think small refactors behind golden tests, API adapters behind contract tests, and mechanical migrations with clear invariants. They fail fast in codebases with implicit coupling, fuzzy boundaries, or weak feedback loops, and they tend to amplify whatever hygiene you already have.So the job moves from typing to making constraints explicit and building fast verification, while humans stay accountable for semantics and risk.If useful, I expanded this “delegation + constraints + verification” angle here: https://thomasvilhena.com/2026/02/craftsmanship-coding-five-...

When we have solid tests, the agent output is useful and we can trust it. When tests are thin or missing, the agents still ship a lot of code, but we spend way more time debugging and fixing subtle bugs.

We've experimented with rolling open source models on local hardware, but it's so easy to inject things into them that it's not really going anywhere. It's going to be a massive challenge, because if we don't provide the tools, employees are going to figure out how to do it on their own.

reply

Yes, but some are mitigated when discoverd, and some more critical areas need to be isolated from the LLM so taking their time to provision LLM into their lifecycle is important, and they're happy to spend the time doing it right, rather than just throwing the latest edge tech into their system.

Token costs are also non-trivial.  Claude can exhaust a $20/month session limit with one difficult problem (didn't even write code, just planned).   Each engineer needs at least the $200/mo plan - I have multiple plans from multiple providers.

He gives one the best pieces of advice I've ever heard: if you are going to do something for a living, make sure it is NOT scalable.If you do something that isn't really scalable, like being a welder or a tailor, then you only have to compete against the tailors in your neighborhood, and you can easily find a neighborhood that doesn't have a tailor. If you're building a scalable product, you'll always be competing against the best, most well funded, smartest people in the room.Everyone here has grown up in the birth of the internet -- a once in ever event -- where building something scalable was just there for the taking. That's never going to exist again basically.

In the case of OpenClaw I think you're looking at a fairly pure iteration of luck there, too. It isn't even a case of ""I prepared for years until luck finally knocked"" or any variant like that. It was just luck.If that is the only counterexample I'd say it doesn't disprove the point, if anything it just strengthens it. Nobody can build a business plan based on ""I plan to be as lucky as OpenClaw"".

I don't find a single counter-example compelling. I guess as evidence that ""only moat"" is somewhat hyperbolic?But to counter the counter-example, what would have happened if he did not join? OpenAI can just write and release their own version. They can then do the typical loss-leader and advertising tricks that OpenClaw cannot.The ""simply write and release"" is what used to be a barrier.

Correct me if I'm wrong but, you may be thinking of restaurants where their defining factor is ""having a very creative atmosphere"", which will not suit all customers. However it is a differentiating factor which will serve a big audience that is under served in a location filled with ""boring well maintained and staffed restaurant"".In my view the creativity comes in in finding solutions to a problem, in a oversaturated market the problem may be ""how do I persuade customers to come to my restaurant instead of my competitor?"". And following that question may be (in the restaurant example) ""what can I offer that is under served in the current market?"" The solution to that may be ""a biker cafe"" or ""an overpriced ""creative"" restaurant where the waiters are terrible and the chef is even worse"" (perhaps even rude on purpose).Additionally I assume you want the restaurant to grow. If you want the restaurant to just survive the bar is lower and you may be able to do that by doing the same everyone else is doing as long as you meet the minimum.

I am a firm believer of ""limitation breeds creativity"" and being able to make what you want with immediate result will lead to less diverse solutions. In a world of in-diverse products you need more creativity to stand out as it will become harder to conceive of something ""outside of the box"".Similarly to how anyone can basically create any image they desire in Photoshop (with some limited training). Leading to a lot of images of a similar style instead of a lot of different styles (ai slop anyone?). This is because between the idea and the result the roadblocks are reduced, the process is smooth (tools aim for 1:1 conversion). In the creative process these roadblocks are usually where you will find interesting new directions or ideas. And very often the original idea was not that interesting to begin with (and perhaps not as original as we would like to believe).

However, I've gotten doubts about the value of creativity and having a vision. Plenty of people have great creativity and a fantastic vision, and we can see already how AI allows people to churn out interesting and useful projects at much faster pace than just a few years ago. The problem is that it seems more and more impossible to actually make a living of that.Anybody with the money to have access to enough AI will be able to create a clone of software X. We might not be there quite yet but it's just a matter of time. That seems to be a death sentence for any small software business.

Today, the money-making side has staged a hostile takeover.The attention conundrum is just a symptom of a deeper financialization. Multi-billion dollar companies have turned profit into a data-driven science – analytically turning the screws on every script, product, and interaction to optimize for extraction. This is the destruction of the art of making things.The real issue is that you cannot compete with an entity that has no respect for the art. When a platform replaces the integrity of the work with the logic of a metric, the independent creator is no longer an underdog – they are functionally excluded. You can be the best at any art, but in a system that prioritizes sheer extraction over excellence, your craft effectively ceases to exist.

People are flooded by new projects and assume (rightly) that most are low-signal, so they don't engage. Because there's low engagement, new projects get even less visibility.

This may have been obvious to most but it was but to me at the time.2) I made a product for Medicare/Medicaid but it was hard to get my foot in the door to even be considered for any of the Gov. contracts, so following the same model again I found that if I used politicians that had made promises during their campaign that my product could help them to fulfill then I could use them as  distribution channels.One thing I disagree with or don't understand is>  ship earlier now (often free and open source) to learn faster, but it doesn't change the attention dynamics much.I have found the opposite, it seems like the bar is much higher now and not even the boost in productivity that I have gotten from using AI has allowed me to ship secure/high quality products as fast as I would like to; perhaps I am just too insecure about my work but its all new I guess.

Building a static HTML page was “hard” in the 90's. It took actual skills.Any piece that gets easier automatically opens up more hard avenues to tackle.no one is willing to pay you for easy.

Making a dynamic page was harder. Integrating with a payment system was almost magical; there's a reason PayPal became big.But what was truly hard, and continues to be hard, is building a page, either static or dynamic, that people actually want to visit.

To answer your question. Yes to a player already in a market with lack of funding, a billion dolars could be the necessary moat to win.Money was, is and likely will be a moat for a while. But as a proxy, it may not be enough as a moat. Scarce resources may require more than money— e.g. IP classes or, if you're China, ASML machines.

This seems like an incredibly niche product that only a handful of people are interested in to begin with. It isn't an notable or surprising result that building it resulted in little interest from general audiences.

Then when I raised from a16z and had some money in the bank it didn't get any easier. The money didn't help (maybe it wasn't enough). Ad spend or content marketing or paid channels were all hard regardless of the free vs paid.Maybe I just wasn't good at it.That was before AI and you had to manually pound the bits into place.Now with AI yes there are a lot of people shipping a lot of things but humans can tell when someone's put effort into something vs not and the time to traction is still as high as it always was.Someone should do some analysis on number of things that go ""viral"" or gain adoption quickly today vs 5 / 10 years ago.Getting traction has always been hard. Thats just business.

And let's be honest that's not a new thing. It's been already a long time since you had a revolutionary idea in the shower only to google it(or use an LLM nowadays) and discover that there are already eight different apps that do what you were thinking.

Another conclusion could be that as building software gets easier (like it did for ex in the 90s and again in the 2010s), opportunities are created for new entrants to displace Bad Old Software.Those expensive Enterprise apps that everybody hates? Are absolutely begging to be replaced by something better for half the money.We still live in a world where most individuals own more compute power than most universities did in the '80s, yet the only sign of automation is useless push notifications.Data behind one pane of glass can't easily be moved to data behind a second pane of glass. Simple stuff like ""move my Instacart shopping cart to Costco.com same-day"" is a manual affair. This is a subset of the general problem that more apps has resulted in more data silos that are generally isolated, without APIs, without automation.There are zillions of problems out there for which people will pay money, but money chases the same 4-5 problems at a time. Just work on one of the other ones.

The hype machine currently pushing for agents is selling agents ability to do automated marketing. However the bigger companies know better than to create giant security holes and the small players are either not technically skilled, or will balk at the huge per-use fees for the good models, or will be drowned out because of low quality cheap model output.

I'm a novelist and software engineer. The value of one of those skills is trending to zero. I'm not seeing much to suggest, in the face of the hockey stick of doom, that the other isn't.

reply

I don't know what you wrote and I agree that it is very sad that the skill of writing is very undervalued at this moment. But I think that trend is not new and in reality not created by AI (just accelerated). But I think value of writing was never in the writing itself but the knowledge and ideas behind the writing. Because mechanics of writing sped up (handwritten, typewriter, word processor). But the process of writing a novel did not speed up significantly as the bottleneck is the ideas and iteration on those ideas not the delivery of the output. Similar to how programming is more then typing code.So I think the real crisis right now is that people equate typing speed with programming speed (or writing speed) and due to advances in the former undervalue the later.Sadly the reality is that it won't pay for the bills anymore.Perhaps in a while people will realize how important the quality of ideas (and the iteration to arrive at them) is.

No! I fundamentally reject this.The value of unoriginal thinking has gone down. Thinking which is quotidian and pedestrian has become  even more worthless than it already was.The value of true, original human thinking has gone up even higher than it ever has been.Do we think no new companies will ever succeed now? Of course not. Who, then, will succeed? It will be innovators and original thinkers and those with excellent taste.Why did stripe make big inroads in developer spaces even if they are in an ultra competitive low margin market? They had excellent taste in developer ergonomics. They won big not because they coded well or fast (though I know pc thinks their speed is a big factor, I think he is mostly incorrect on that) but because they had an actual sense of originality and propriety to their approach! And it resonated.So many other products are similar. You can massively disrupt a space simply by having an original angle on it that nobody else has had. Look at video games! Perhaps the best example of this is how utterly horribly AAA games have been doing, while indie hits produce instantly timeless entries.And soon this will be the ONLY thing that still differentiates. Artistic propriety, originality, and taste.(And, of course, the ever-elusive ability to actually execute that I also don't think LLMs will help with.)

There are people who are sick of social media and will never be convinced to join up again. They've already left the building and aren't looking for anything else. I'm not quite there, but almost.Other people are using established social media simply because that's where their people and orgs publish. I am eternally frustrated when my local cafe uses Insta or FB for their ""web presence"", but I'm not going to be the one to convince them to use something else. I hate that my local rock climbing partner finder group is located on FB, but what can I do about it? I also think it sucks that there are thousands of people in that group - I soon realized that this group simply doesn't work for me, since rock climbing requires high trust and I can't trust thousands of people.Many people resist the idea of signing up for yet another social media account, esp when none of their people/orgs are already there. For example, I've sometimes thought of starting a Heylo group for local rock climbers to find partners - this might actually help me find more climbing partners. But I've never tried it. I just don't think people will join. The barrier to entry is (1) install app (2) create login (3) use app. SFAICT no one wants to do this if they're already on FB and already are a member of the group there. Even people that I know manage finding partners with email lists (gag). Can you imagine how much higher the barrier to entry would be if adding (4) you have to pay a monthly fee?I do like the idea of ""only allowed to invite someone that you know in meatspace"" but how is this enforced? I also recognize that requiring payment could help increase the trust level, and I recognize that members have to pay in some way (ads, fees, sponsors, privacy violations) in order to support the platform.

I'm old (52) and a bit AI hysterical despite being well aware of the reasons I supposedly shouldn't be (variations of Jevon's Paradox, the fact that we've had similar disruptions before, etc).I can't help but think that both the speed and massive breadth of the AI disruption across so many industries all at once makes this a very different risk than anything we've experienced before, in my lifetime or before it.It also doesn't help that at least here in the US this is all occurring when our government is both openly corrupt and particularly dysfunctional at solving any of the real-world problems facing its own citizens.

the gravitational threshold thing is real ngl.

AI has certainly made it so much simpler to just pump ""something"" out (slop), but did it actually make building something that went through hundreds and thousands of iterations significantly cheaper?I also like to think AI is really raising the bar for everybody. In the past, you could easily get away launching a product with a crappy landing page and a couple of bugs here and there, is that still the case? Don't people just expect a perfect landing page at this point (when's the last time anybody specifically talked/ thought about responsiveness?) paired with a flawless onboarding etc.?

Is the purpose of a computer program to use processing, network and memory? Or is it to handle and manipulate information to give results which are useful to people?Now the moat of having memorized intentionally convoluted and complicated programming languages has been taken away. Exactly like the printing press removed the monopoly on information which was held exclusively by priests and monks.When tools make a job easier, they open up new markets for people to do and sell things which were too costly to offer before. AI translation alone means that small businesses can open up several markets they didn't have any access to, broadening the number of potential customers immensely.

Current examples: esoteric calculations that are not public knowledge; historical data that you collected and someone else didn't; valuable proprietary data; having good taste; having insider knowledge of a niche industry; making physical things; attracting an audience.Some things that were recently difficult are now easy, but general perception has not caught up. That means there's arbitrage—you can charge the old prices for creating a web app, but execute it in a day. But this arbitrage will not last forever; we will see downward price pressure on anything that is newly easy. So my advice is: take advantage now.

Software to most of this discussion is a web app with a landing page, a pricing tier, and MRR. That's it. The frame is ""product,"" the metric is ""traction,"" and the canvas is ""things people pay $9/month for.""But software is instructions that make matter and energy do things they wouldn't otherwise do. It's the most general-purpose tool humans have ever built. So let's actually think about what's underbuilt:The whole damn physical world is barely instrumented. Agricultural systems, water infrastructure, building envelopes, soil health, local microclimates. There are farmers making irrigation decisions on vibes. Municipal water systems with no real-time leak detection. Buildings hemorrhaging energy because nobody's modeled their thermal behavior. These aren't apps. They're control systems, and they're mostly missing.Fabrication and manufacturing are being transformed by CNC/3D printing but the software for designing things to be manufactured is still terrible (and inaccessible!). Generative design that accounts for material properties, toolpath constraints, assembly sequences. CAM software is where word processors were in 1985.Scientific instruments. A spectrometer is mostly software now. So is a radio telescope. So is a seismograph. Every goddamn thing can be a thermometer (accidentaly!) The gap between ""data sensor exists"" and ""useful scientific instrument"" is almost entirely software, and most of that software is written by grad students in unmaintained Python.Preservation. Some people are doing this with datamuseum.dk. But expand it: there are entire musical traditions, oral histories, craft techniques, ecological knowledge systems that exist in living memory and nowhere else. Software for capturing, encoding, and transmitting that knowledge barely exists. Not ""an app for recording grandma,"" but formal knowledge representation of, say, how a master boatbuilder in Kerala selects wood by sound and flex.Prosthetics and rehabilitation. This one is big for me personally! The gap between what a modern prosthetic limb could do with good software and what it actually does is enormous. Why are my eyeballs still chunks of plastic? Same for cognitive rehabilitation tools, speech therapy systems, physical therapy feedback loops.Governance and collective decision-making. Every organization above 20 people is making decisions with tools that are basically ""email plus meetings plus a shared doc."" Formal deliberation systems, preference aggregation, transparent resource allocation. These are hard computer science problems that nobody's building because they don't have obvious MRR.Tools for thought that aren't note-taking apps with backlinks. Actual reasoning aids. Argument mapping. Assumption tracking. Decision support that makes your thinking better rather than your typing faster.The entire domain of formal verification applied to things that matter. Bridges, medical devices, voting systems, financial settlement. We have figured out how to prove some? software correct. We almost never do it for the software where correctness actually matters.And that's me, one person, in five minutes. Every domain expert in the world is sitting on a pile of unsolved problems that software could address, and most of them have never talked to a programmer because programmers are busy building the next task management app.Go talk to a nurse, a farmer, a building inspector, a food bank logistics coordinator. Ask them what's broken. I promise the answer isn't ""nothing"" and I promise nobody on ProductHunt is solving it.PG wrote essays about this ffs! ""Make something people want."" ""Live in the future and build what's missing."" That advice didn't stop being true because AI made the building part cheaper. If anything it's more true now, because the building is almost free, which means the noticing is almost the entire game. You are skipping the noticing and going straight to the building, then wondering why nobody cares.The number of hard things isn't going down. This thread can't see them because it's not looking at the world. It's looking at ProductHunt.To make things concrete, in the last week I have been working on my open source speech synthesizer, rebuilding Klatt's ideas from the 1980 paper up to modern emotion/prosody work. Did you know the whole field went nuts for neural approaches in ~2018 and there's a whole shitload of interesting papers just sitting out there that nobody has ever implemented in a real system? Did you know that a bunch of people did research into what different human emotions sound like and now I can make a depressed speech synthesizer, or, scarily, one which sounds more honest to people?

The whole damn physical world is barely instrumented. Agricultural systems, water infrastructure, building envelopes, soil health, local microclimates. There are farmers making irrigation decisions on vibes. Municipal water systems with no real-time leak detection. Buildings hemorrhaging energy because nobody's modeled their thermal behavior. These aren't apps. They're control systems, and they're mostly missing.Fabrication and manufacturing are being transformed by CNC/3D printing but the software for designing things to be manufactured is still terrible (and inaccessible!). Generative design that accounts for material properties, toolpath constraints, assembly sequences. CAM software is where word processors were in 1985.Scientific instruments. A spectrometer is mostly software now. So is a radio telescope. So is a seismograph. Every goddamn thing can be a thermometer (accidentaly!) The gap between ""data sensor exists"" and ""useful scientific instrument"" is almost entirely software, and most of that software is written by grad students in unmaintained Python.Preservation. Some people are doing this with datamuseum.dk. But expand it: there are entire musical traditions, oral histories, craft techniques, ecological knowledge systems that exist in living memory and nowhere else. Software for capturing, encoding, and transmitting that knowledge barely exists. Not ""an app for recording grandma,"" but formal knowledge representation of, say, how a master boatbuilder in Kerala selects wood by sound and flex.Prosthetics and rehabilitation. This one is big for me personally! The gap between what a modern prosthetic limb could do with good software and what it actually does is enormous. Why are my eyeballs still chunks of plastic? Same for cognitive rehabilitation tools, speech therapy systems, physical therapy feedback loops.Governance and collective decision-making.

If you look at the history of the US, for instance, railroad regulation was brought forth largely by the railroads because they found it impossible to form a cartel to keep up prices (due to ""secret"" discounting) so instead they created regulation that outlawed the kind of discounting that breaks cartels apart.  A similar thing happened in banking where the banks asked for a central bank to cartelize the interest ranks to stabilize their oligopoly.  And the same in pharma industry -- big pharma loves high regulatory barriers because it keeps competitors out.A large portion of the regulation in the US was brought about as regulatory capture by corporations to increase the monopolizing effects and destroy the free market.

That's patently false. AT&T was a monopoly and they were broken up by antitrust regulation. The absolute most you can say is that some regulations enable monopoly. I contend that we simply should pass the good kind of regulations instead.> big pharma loves high regulatory barriers because it keeps competitors outThe FDA, for all the flaws of its current incarnation, is the archetype of necessary regulation. Pre-FDA, the free market did nothing whatsoever to prevent nauseating practices like the adulteration of milk with powdered plaster, lead, and cow brains. The history there is fun but quite gross.> SomaliaWhat is notable about Somalia is not its lack of regulation, but the fact that it is perhaps THE least stable country on the planet. It is not the basis for any useful comparison here.

One should understand the phenomenon as a common pattern of dynamics in unregulated markets. Not every snapshot will showcase an end state of monopolist dominated markets.You bring up a valid point though. Regulatory capture is a indeed a weapon in the hands of anti-competitive players to prevent incumbents. Good policy usually applies differently to different strata: the small players are exempt from certain rules, or have to deal with less stringent ones than big players do, to prevent killing the market. At the risk of sounding like an llm: it is not just about policy, it is about  good policy.

I read it as a pretty straightforward acknowledgment that we've reached a point in public discourse where people pay at least as much attention to who is making a point as we do to the actual point being made.I wonder if finding common ground is even possible as long as that kind of tacit ad hominem remains baked into the way we think about public discourse.

    Nonsense world when a comedian doing a late night show is the person willing to say something
    
    It's not his job I'm glad he's doing it, but this is like watching the McDonald's workers Narcan people as part of their daily tasks

For reference she worked as a manager at McDonald's and would regularly have to deal with people ODing in the drive through and there was a ""serious"" discussion between managers, corporate, etc. about it they should be doing this or if they should be instructing everyone to stay indoors and let them die.Corporate had to say that they must stay inside and eventually it became grounds for suspending employees that didn't want to sit and watch people die.Contact me if you want her information for journalism purposes we have the receipts.

The EMT would show up and drag them out of the car then a tow truck would come and get the car.Most ""regular"" employees are happy to see the drive through disabled it makes their job much easier. Most restaurants place a small construction cone out to block one of the lanes to reduce customers as it's too much work.The franchise owners are in a strange spot. I have some compassion and understanding for them, but also have helped build bots they use to submit fake reports to corporate to make their numbers go up or keep their numbers from going down too much. It's fascinating to be paid by a company to perform work they had to be hidden from other layers and that is fundamentally against the interest long term to any of them. I required a contract signed by them to ensure this bullshit isn't my problem. Again, I got the receipts if anyone wants!

For example, I've been pretty impressed by the extent to which the Chinese government is able to influence public discourse within its borders when they want to. But China is also home to over 90% of the world's Chinese speakers, and it has its own domestic social media industry with very few users from outside the country, the Great Firewall, less of a culture of anti-authoritarianism, etc.I'm not sure how feasible it would be for the US to get to a comparable position. The US is nowhere close to being a supermajority of the world's English speakers, and it might be hard for the government to impose an isolationist policy on the country's tech industry without inciting a revolt by its tech oligarchs.

U.S.-based Almeida Law Group, which specializes in class-action litigation, has filed a lawsuit against Lenovo, alleging that Lenovo transferred large amounts of data to China. According to the lawsuit [PDF], the company's actions violate the U.S. Department of Justice's Data Security Program, which prevents the transfer of large amounts of sensitive personal data to “countries of concern” or “covered persons.” Lenovo has denied the allegations.

“The DOJ Rule was thus implemented to prevent adversarial countries from acquiring large quantities of behavioral data which could be used to surveil, analyze, or exploit American citizens' behavior,” the lawsuit said. It also added, “In direct violation of the DOJ Rule, Lenovo—through its automated advertising infrastructure and associated databases—transmits Plaintiff's and potentially millions of other American consumers' data to China.”

The Plaintiff here refers to one Spencer Christy of San Francisco, California, and “all other similarly situated,” with the case alleging that Lenovo and its Chinese parent company linked his “browsing activity to his identity, track his behaviors, and build detailed profiles reflecting his interests, locations, habits and other private attributes.” It further said that the data is more than just an invasion of privacy, but “a direct threat to national security as it greatly increases the potential for coercion, reputational harm, and/or blackmail.”

Lenovo is far from the only company gathering such data, but the U.S. entity's parent, Lenovo Group Limited, is incorporated in Hong Kong, with its headquarters located in Beijing, China. Furthermore, its largest shareholder is Legend Holdings Corporation, a Beijing-based investment firm established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a state institution of the People's Republic of China.

So, aside from being based in one of the “countries of concern,” it also falls squarely under the “covered persons” provision of the DOJ regulation which include “individuals who either reside in ‘countries of concern' or are controlled by entities in those countries or (ii) entities that are organized or chartered under the laws of, or have their principal place of business in, a country of concern, or are owned 50% or more by such entities.” More than that, the lawsuit asserts that Lenovo Group is subject to Chinese regulations like the National Intelligence Law, Cybersecurity Law, and Data Security Law, which compel individuals and institutions to cooperate with the authorities when asked for data.

When asked for comment, Lenovo told The Register, “Any suggestion that Lenovo improperly shares customer data is false. We take data privacy and security seriously and comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations globally, including stringent U.S. requirements. Our data practices are transparent, lawful, and designed to protect our customers.”

A simple combination of daily physical exercise and protein-rich nutritional drinks appears to offer significant health benefits for people with dementia. In a new study from Karolinska Institutet, not only did the participants' physical ability improve, but after three months the researchers also saw signs that they were able to manage more everyday tasks themselves. The study is published in the journal Alzheimer's and Dementia.

Older people living in special housing often have an increased risk of malnutrition, muscle weakness, and frailty, which are factors that affect both health and quality of life. The OPEN study has previously shown that the program improves physical function and has positive effects on muscle mass and nutritional status. The new article analyzes retrospectively how the program can be linked to the participants' need for support in everyday life.

A total of 102 people from eight nursing homes in the Stockholm area participated. For twelve weeks, the intervention group was asked to do standing exercises several times a day and drink one to two nutritional drinks with extra protein. Among other things, the researchers monitored how much support the participants needed with tasks such as hygiene, dressing, and moving around.

When the researchers analyzed all the residents together, no clear differences were apparent. However, when the results were broken down by ward type, a different pattern emerged. In the dementia wards, participants who had followed the program had improved their abilities to such an extent that they required less care time compared to the control group.

One possible explanation is that people in dementia units had better physical conditions for improving their functional ability and were therefore able to do more things themselves after the intervention.""

Anders Wimo, researcher at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet

The researchers also point out that interviews from previous sub-studies indicate that improved function can affect how much support a person needs in different situations. At the same time, they emphasize that the results should be interpreted with some caution, as the analyses are secondary.

""More studies are needed where care time is a primary outcome and where organizational factors, such as staffing levels and work routines, are closely monitored,"" says Anders Wimo.

The study was conducted by an interprofessional research group affiliated with Karolinska Institutet and Stockholms Sjukhem. It was funded by the Gamla Tjänarinnor Foundation and Danone Nutricia Research, which provided the nutritional drinks but did not participate in the data collection or final analyses. The researchers report no competing interests other than that one of the authors is the copyright holder of the measuring instrument used.

Dr. Vadim Jucaud's lab at the Terasaki Institute has developed a vascularized liver tissueoid-on-a-chip (LToC) platform that recapitulates key structural, functional, and immunological features of human liver tissue, enabling the study of liver regeneration and immune-mediated allograft rejection in a physiologically relevant human system.

Liver transplantation remains the primary therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver disease, yet progress in understanding transplant rejection and tissue regeneration has been limited by the lack of experimental models that accurately reflect human liver architecture and immune interactions. Conventional culture systems fail to capture the multicellular organization, vascular complexity, and dynamic immune responses that govern transplant outcomes, limiting their relevance for translational research.

To address these limitations, researchers in Dr. Vadim Jucaud's laboratory (VJLabs) engineered a vascularized liver tissueoid composed of donor-matched human hepatic progenitor cells and intrahepatic portal vein endothelial cells. Within the first week of dynamic perfusion culture, the tissueoid self-assembled into a perfusable microvascular network, followed by progressive maturation into a functional liver-like tissueoid over a 49-day culture period.

Using this platform, the research team demonstrated sustained tissue viability, preserved vascular integrity, and active hepatic function, including the secretion of albumin, urea, complement factors, and hepatocyte growth factor. The mature liver tissueoid contained multiple liver-relevant cell populations, including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and endothelial cells, closely reflecting the cellular diversity of native human liver tissue.

The LToC platform was further tested to model immune-mediated allograft rejection by perfusing the mature tissueoid with allogeneic T cells. This exposure induced hallmark features of cellular rejection, including reduced tissue viability, endothelial disruption, loss of hepatic markers, increased HLA-I expression, and a pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Elevated levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, granzyme A and B, and perforin mirrored immune activation patterns observed during clinical transplant rejection.

This liver tissueoid-on-a-chip enables us to recreate key aspects of liver regeneration and immune-mediated rejection within a human-relevant, vascularized tissue architecture.""

Dr. Abdul Rahim Chethikkattuveli Salih, first author of the publication

""By integrating functional vasculature, multiple liver cell types, and immune responsiveness into a single platform, this system allows us to study transplant biology in a more physiologically meaningful way,"" added Dr. Vadim Jucaud, Principal Investigator and Assistant Professor at the Terasaki Institute. ""This approach has the potential to support immunosuppressive drug evaluation and advance more personalized strategies for liver transplantation.""

This work contributes to the legacy of Dr. Paul I. Terasaki in organ transplantation research, with the overarching goal of improving the quality of life for transplant patients.

""Dr. Terasaki believed that meaningful innovation in transplantation must always be driven by its potential to improve patients' lives,"" said Dr. Jucaud. ""As one of the last doctoral scholars trained by Dr. Paul I. Terasaki, carrying forward his vision, through innovative, translational science that bridges engineering, immunology, and transplantation, holds deep personal significance to me.""

This commitment continues at the Terasaki Institute, where advancing patient-centered, translational technologies remains a guiding principle and a tribute to Dr. Terasaki's lasting impact on the field.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Ancient mind body practice matches walking for hypertension control","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260218/Ancient-mind-body-practice-matches-walking-for-hypertension-control.aspx","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 18:15:00 GMT","

A traditional Chinese mind-body practice that combines slow, structured movement, deep breathing and meditative focus lowered blood pressure as effectively as brisk walking in a large randomized clinical trial published in JACC, the flagship journal of the American College of Cardiology. Blood pressure reductions were seen after three months and sustained for one year.

High blood pressure is one of the leading preventable risk factors for heart disease. Clinical guidelines recommend regular physical activity, yet long-term adherence to exercise programs is challenging for many people, particularly when routines require equipment, dedicated space, gym memberships or ongoing supervision.

Baduanjin is a widely practiced, standardized eight-movement sequence that integrates aerobic, isometric, flexibility and mind–body components. Practiced for centuries and commonly performed in community settings across China, the routine typically takes 10–15 minutes and requires no equipment and only minimal initial instruction, allowing it to be performed in a wide range of settings. Because it is low- to moderate-intensity, it is considered safe and accessible for many adults.

Given its simplicity, safety and ease at which one can maintain long-term adherence, baduanjin can be implemented as an effective, accessible and scalable lifestyle intervention for individuals trying to reduce their blood pressure.""

Jing Li, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director, Department of Preventive Medicine, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases in Beijing, China

In the first large, multicenter randomized trial to look at the impact of baduanjin on blood pressure, researchers followed 216 participants across seven communities to determine changes in 24-hour systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 and 52 weeks. Participants were 40 years old or older and had a systolic blood pressure of 130-139 mm Hg, which according to the ACC/AHA High Blood Pressure Guideline is considered stage 1 hypertension. They were randomly assigned to one of three arms: baduanjin, self-directed exercise alone, or brisk walking for the 52-week intervention.

Compared to self-directed exercise, practicing baduanjin five days a week reduced 24-hour systolic blood pressure approximately 3 mg Hg and office systolic blood pressure by 5 mg Hg at both three months and one year, which is comparable to reductions seen with some first-line medications. Baduanjin showed comparable results and safety profile to brisk walking at one year.

Notably, the benefits were sustained even without ongoing monitoring, a key challenge for many lifestyle interventions that struggle to maintain long-term adherence outside structured programs.

""Baduanjin has been practiced in China for over 800 years, and this study demonstrates how ancient, accessible, low-cost approaches can be validated through high-quality randomized research,"" said Harlan M. Krumholz, MD, FACC, Editor-in-Chief of JACC and the Harold H. Hines, Jr Professor at the Yale School of Medicine. ""The blood pressure effect size is similar to that seen in landmark drug trials, but achieved without medication, cost or side effects. This makes it highly scalable for community-based prevention, including in resource-limited settings.""

Backing a sign of improved relations between presidents

Tournament expected not to be held every two years

Uefa is ready to back Fifa's proposed expansion of the Club World Cup to 48 teams for the next edition in 2029 in a sign of improving relations between their respective presidents, Aleksander Ceferin and Gianni Infantino.

The European football governing body had opposed plans to grow the Club World Cup over concerns an expanded tournament could threaten the status of the Champions League, but Uefa is now willing to back Fifa in return for an undertaking that the competition will not be held every two years.

Real Madrid proposed a two-year cycle for the Club World Cup during talks with Fifa in Miami in June last year, although given the opposition from Uefa and all the domestic European leagues that idea has not progressed. In a related development, last week Real ended their five‑year legal battle with Uefa by withdrawing formally from the European Super League. They appear ready to fall in line with the global football establishment led by Infantino, Ceferin and Nasser al-Khelaifi, the Paris Saint‑Germain president who chairs European Football Clubs.

The Guardian revealed before the Club World Cup in the US last summer that Fifa was open to expanding the tournament from 32 teams, primarily to guarantee the participation of more of the biggest European clubs after Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United failed to qualify.

Infantino then said in a speech at the general assembly of European Football Clubs in Rome last October that expansion was on the agenda, saying Fifa was working “to see how we can make this event bigger, even better, even more impactful”.

Uefa's opposition was a potentially significant obstacle, but another remains with Fifa subject to legal action from the lobby group European Leagues that has been taken to the European Commission. That relates to the international match calendar, including decisions concerning the Club World Cup.

While some at Uefa remain concerned that the huge financial rewards of the Club World Cup will have a destabilising effect on European football, an expansion to 48 clubs is regarded as less disruptive than making it a biennial event.

Although the fine detail has yet to be agreed, European clubs would be among the main beneficiaries of the expansion, with the number of Uefa qualifiers likely to increase from 12 last year to 16 in 2029. Chelsea won £85m from the competition's £774m prize pot for winning it last year and adding more European teams would have implications for the competitive balance of the Champions League.

Uefa's position is the latest sign of improved relations with Fifa, which reached a nadir when Ceferin and a group of European delegates including the Football Association chair, Debbie Hewitt, staged a walkout at Fifa congress in Paraguay last May in protest at the late arrival of Infantino, who had been on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East involving Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman. With Ceferin and Infantino likely to seek re-election for fourth terms next year, sources close to both men have indicated that a period of calm is in both their interests.

Spain and Morocco are favourites to host the next Club World Cup, which will take place in the summer of 2029, before their co‑hosting of the 2030 World Cup.

Morocco is poisoning, shooting and burning stray dogs alive to clean the streets ahead of the 2030 World Cup, animal rights activists have alleged. They have shared photos of the atrocities with FIFA and are hoping action will be taken to protect the dogs. 

Warning: Some content might be disturbing to readers. Discretion is advised

Morocco has started killing stray dogs as part of a campaign linked to preparation for the 2030 World Cup. Weeks ago, reports emerged that the North African nation would cull more than three million dogs ahead of the sporting extravaganza. Animal rights activists alleged that this was being done to make the country appealing to tourists, fans and media during the World Cup, and dispel any negative image that is associated with strays. Now they claim that Morocco has started killing the dogs using brutal means. The country was named co-hosts for the 2023 World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal in 2023. Animal welfare organisations are sharing images showing the brutality being committed against the dogs. They allege the dogs are being caught through horrific means. They are being clamped by the neck and loaded in trucks before being poisoned or shot by a firing squad. Their bodies are then disposed of in mass graves.

Marrakech has reportedly become the designated ""kill centre"" where dogs are being killed in warehouses. A local report published last month suggested that the dogs are taken to the facility, which has meat hooks and washable flooring, in vans where they are ""processed"". Some witnesses also alleged that in a few places, the dogs are being starved and then burned alive. The International Animal Welfare and Protection Coalition (IAWPC) claims Morocco has committed similar atrocities ahead of big events in the past. The organisation also blamed FIFA for indirectly enabling the practice.

The organisations have gathered all evidence of the brutalities and compiled them in a 91-page dossier. They have submitted the same to FIFA to prove how the stray dogs are being poisoned, shot and burned. However, they are concerned that their pleas are falling on deaf ears. ""After the [World Cup confirmation], the extermination of the dogs has increased dramatically. As a result, the fear is that Morocco will now go ahead with their plan for the mass slaughter of three million dogs,"" IAWPC said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail quoted a FIFA spokesperson as saying that at the time of the confirmation, Morocco stated that it was committed to animal welfare. ""With the bidding process now completed, FIFA is following up with its local counterparts to ensure commitments are upheld,"" the FIFA spokesperson said.

US News Reporter

The last few weeks have seen multiple people speaking out on social media, amid reports that Morocco is carrying out a mass cull of stray dogs in preparation to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup. 

Newsweek has broken down what we know.

The allegations raise concerns about animal welfare issues, and the responsibilities of sports bodies when host nations face human rights and animal care scrutiny.

The issue could affect Morocco's image as a co-host and test FIFA's stated commitments on ethical standards for tournament organizers.

Animal welfare group International Animal Welfare and Protection Coalition (IAWPC) last January accused the country of increasing the killing of dogs after it was announced in October 2023 that Morocco would co-host the FIFA World Cup 2030 with Spain and Portugal.

IAWPC said in its report that the North African nation had a plan to kill up to three million dogs before the World Cup tournament starts. 

Morocco's Embassy in London said last year that it “categorically” denies any culling campaign, saying that it is committed to “humane and sustainable animal management.”

FIFA previously said in its evaluation report that Morocco's bid has “outlined its commitment to the protection of animal rights and has highlighted that since August 2024 the culling of animals is prohibited in the country, and governmental resources are being allocated to expand clinics and support programmes for stray dogs.”

The IAWPC slammed this as “nonsense,” adding: “The Coalition has concrete proof that the daily slaughter of dogs continues relentlessly and without mercy in the streets of would be host cities for the tournament, as well as in other areas of Morocco.”

Morocco launched a national Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Return (TNVR) strategy in 2019, which is supposed to introduce a humane stray dog population manager, but the country's Ministry of Interior has acknowledged that not all municipalities use the same strategies.

The ministry's head of the Public Health and Green Spaces Division Mohammed Roudani previously told CNN: “There's a legal vacuum. Some cities still rely on traditional methods, and there's currently no law against killing stray dogs.”

FIFA told Telegraph Sport last year that it had contacted the Moroccan Football Federation to “alert them alert them to the issue.”

“We have received confirmation that a number of measures have been implemented over the last five years and a new law is being drafted to try and address the current situation with a balanced approach that meets the needs of public health and safety and animal welfare,” it said.

The topic triggered outrage again this year, after The Athletic published a report about an alleged kill center on the edge of Marrakech and said it had seen documentation that showed another city's local authority ordered 1,000 rounds of ammunition in September 2025 for its stray dog population.

American actor Mark Ruffalo was one of many who spoke out about the piece on X recently, calling it a “moral failure.”

A 2025 draft law would criminalize killing and cruelty towards strays in Morocco but it would also fine people for feeding or treating strays in public without authorization, according to Middle East Eye.

Newsweek has contacted FIFA and the Moroccan embassy in Washington D.C., via email, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, via online contact form, for comment.

FIFA previously told Telegraph Sport: “Fifa is in contact with the animal welfare organisation IAWPC on this important matter. In this context, an expert panel with senior legal and animal welfare experts from across the globe was formed by IAWPC to provide input on the draft regulations and the result of its work has now been submitted to the Moroccan authorities.”

American actor Mark Ruffalo said in a post on X: “Killing millions of dogs to prepare for a global sporting event is not progress, it's a moral failure. The World Cup should unite the world, not be built on suffering that happens behind closed doors. Humane solutions exist, and choosing compassion over violence is a responsibility we all share.”

Mohammed Roudani previously told CNN: “Stray dogs pose a serious public health risk, particularly as carriers of rabies...“We must deal with the issue in a different way. No more slaughter. No more strychnine. We need an ethical solution.”

Morocco's draft legislation will move through parliamentary review, though timelines remain unclear.

Advocacy groups will likely maintain pressure on FIFA and Morocco, and it is yet to be seen how they will respond.

Outrage is spreading in the US as reports claim a 2030 World Cup host nation plans to kill roughly three million stray dogs, prompting boycott calls.

Morocco was confirmed in 2023 as a co-host alongside Spain and Portugal, a decision that animal rights groups say has coincided with an alleged campaign to cull stray dogs in several cities.

Activists argue the effort is intended to make urban areas and tourist hotspots appear cleaner and safer ahead of the 2030 tournament, as the country seeks to attract international visitors, fans and media attention.

In Defense of Animals, a US-based advocacy group, said: 'These wounded, terrified animals are hauled off to remote sites, where they are poisoned or shot and dumped in mass graves, many still alive. 

'For months now, between 60 and 70 dogs have been disposed of every other day in cities like Marrakech and Agadir.'

Images showing dogs bleeding, butchered and dying from gunshot wounds in the streets have circulated widely on social media, fueling calls among Americans for a boycott of the 2030 World Cup.

'If Morocco is really killing dogs to prepare for the World Cup 2030, the US, should boycott the World Cup and wage all-out economic war,' one user wrote on X.

Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator, called the allegations 'animal abuse,' adding: 'Every dog lover should BOYCOTT FIFA! The fact that FIFA is allowing Morocco to host the World Cup when Morocco is murdering three million dogs should be disqualifying.'

A FIFA spokesperson told Daily Mail that during its bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup, Morocco emphasized its commitment to animal welfare, noting government efforts to expand clinics and support programs for stray dogs.

'With the bidding process now completed, FIFA is following up with its local counterparts with the aim of ensuring commitments are upheld,' the FIFA spokesperson continued.

FIFA also said it is working with the animal welfare group International Animal Welfare and Protection Coalition (IAWPC), which convened a global panel of senior legal and animal welfare experts to review Morocco's draft regulations; their recommendations have now been submitted to Moroccan authorities.

Morocco's Embassy in London has denied the claims, insisting there is no cull of stray dogs and citing what it described as the country's commitment to humane and sustainable animal management.

A spokesman said last year that Morocco launched a Trap, Neuter, Vaccinate, Release program in 2019 and is investing in clinics, veterinary services, and municipal hygiene systems, adding: 'It is entirely untrue that Morocco is planning to cull stray dogs ahead of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.'

However, the IAWPC said it 'has documented widespread and systematic killings of both stray and owned dogs across Morocco, which it says are being carried out by so-called “death squads” in preparation for the country's role as co-host of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.' 

Les Ward MBE, Chairman of the IAWPC, said in a statement: 'These killings are taking place every single day, in full view of children, tourists, and local communities.

'It is relentless, merciless and utterly inhumane. Since the IAWPC campaign began, it has become clear to us and everyone else, that we are dealing with a slippery and untrustworthy government. 

An estimated three million stray dogs live on Morocco's streets

Images of dogs dead in the streets of Morocco have sparked cries for a boycott of the 2026 World Cup

Animal activist groups claimed to have seen documentation recording the dog killings

'They make claims that have no basis in reality, including that the killing has ended, when every Moroccan knows it is happening every single day.' 

The IAWPC has offered to help Morocco implement large-scale, humane dog population control strategies such as Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (TNVR), but says its repeated offers have been ignored. 

While the 2030 World Cup will not be hosted in the US, many Americans have vowed to not watch the games after hearing the disturbing reports about Morocco.

One X user shared: 'Boycott the World Cup. I won't ever watch it.' 

'The cull and massacre of street dogs, with hideous painful poison and brutal beating to death has already started. People need to boycott this FIFA World Cup in Morocco,' another X user posted.

Hollywood actor Mark Ruffalo has also thrown his support behind the IAWPC campaign to stop the killings in an X post that reads: 'Killing millions of dogs to prepare for a global sporting event is not progress, it's a moral failure.

'The World Cup should unite the world, not be built on suffering that happens behind closed doors. Humane solutions exist, and choosing compassion over violence is a responsibility we all share.'

FOXBOROUGH — The Town of Foxborough still can't get an answer to where its $7 million-plus in security outlays for this summer's World Cup games planned for Gillette Stadium is going to come from.

Or when it's going to come.

And until they get their answer, the town's select board members made it quite clear at a Tuesday night meeting that their answer is a flat “no” to granting the entertainment license FIFA, the Kraft Group, and the Boston 26 host committee need to stage seven games over 39 days.

“I've got to be honest with you, it baffles my mind that you guys are sitting here in front of me right now and we still have no idea where this money is coming from,” said select board member Mark Elfman to two FIFA representatives in attendance and Boston 26 host committee CEO Mike Loynd. “I'm shocked you're not sitting right here in front of us right now, saying, ‘We've got the money for you.' Shocked.”

The pass-the-buck game was a lively one.

Kevin Clark, FIFA's head of venue operations for the Boston games, said his organization's role is to “work operationally with the stadium” and is “not in a position to comment on the financial requirements. That's an agreement between the stadium and the host city.”

A representative of the Kraft Group, which owns the stadium, was not there to speak on its behalf.

Loynd pointed out the uniqueness of the arrangement, including having to wait for the White House Task Force and FEMA, the federal agency that will ultimately dole out the money, to do so.

“The thing that's very different about this is that FIFA is the applicant on the license and normally it would be the stadium, so there are a lot of things to work on. We recognize that,” he said.

The stadium and FIFA want to sign the lease that will allow their temporary landlord-tenant arrangement to activate. But that lease requires the town's issuance of an entertainment license.



“You guys are still looking at us saying, ‘We don't know where it's coming from,' and we have townspeople who are saying, ‘There's two billion-dollar organizations that are running this, the Krafts and FIFA — what's the problem?' ” said Elfman. “And now we're coming around to where we've got to wait on grant money from the federal government. Flabbergasted.”

Stephanie McGowan, the vice chair of the select board, was not pleased with the slow pace and unsettled state of affairs.

“We're not prepared to issue this license unless everything is in place,” said McGowan. “I've seen people saying, ‘Oh, there's no way, they won't [issue the license].' I'm going to tell you, this board will not issue this license.”

Select board member Debbie Giardino pointed out the obvious.

“It just makes me a little concerned when the question was asked on where the money was going to come from, and both you guys are almost pointing at each other,” she said. “Nobody wanted to answer the question, and I think that speaks volumes to the frustration and the concern.”

Bill Yukna, chair of the select board, said the dispute could be over swiftly if somebody stepped up and took responsibility for getting the money to the town.

“All we're asking for is a collaboration that gets us the answer as to ‘Who?' and if the only way we're going to get that is to get the license in front of FIFA with that cost on it — that's going to have to be kicked out — then that's going to be our highest priority to get done and get to you as quickly as possible,” said Yukna.

The next select board meeting is scheduled for March 3, with the license issuance deadline set for March 17.

Ex-Premier League striker finally reveals true identity","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/secret-footballer-unmasked-ex-premier-league-striker-reveals-true-identity/bltdf43a80613671b69","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 16:50:13 GMT","

Former Premier League striker Dave Kitson has revealed he was the 'Secret Footballer', a pseudonym he used to pen articles and books during his playing career without revealing his identity. The series focused on what goes on behind the scenes in elite-level football, with topics ranging from matchdays to transfers and contracts. Many punters attempted to unmask the author while he was still playing, but Kitson has now confirmed he was behind the phenomenon.

'The Secret Footballer' series created plenty of intrigue during its run, with fans fascinated by the insights provided in a weekly newspaper column which often shedded light on the more frustrating aspects of professional football. Five books were also published under the pseudonym, some of which were written as memoirs, but the secrecy of the author often prompted debate among supporters. Groups were even formed online as people attempted to solve the mystery of his identity, but that has now come to an end with Kitson revealing he is the former Premier League striker who penned the books and newspaper columns.

Kitson first made his name at Cambridge United and Reading, playing for the latter in the Premier League after the Royals broke the record for the most points in a single Championship season with 106 during the 2005-06 campaign. He would later turn out for the likes of Stoke City, Portsmouth, Sheffield United and Oxford United before retiring in 2015 after a brief spell with Arlesey Town.

Speaking on the Liberty Rock Sport Podcast, Kitson revealed: ""I am The Secret Footballer. I've never said that out loud before. It was an idea that came to me when I wasn't happy with where football was going and I needed an outlet to express it for my own mental health.

""I've been writing since I was a kid. It's a passion. As I said, I wanted to be a travel writer. The writing was cathartic. It helped me process what was going on in football.

""It started as something that wasn't about naming names. It was about explaining what happens in the industry and why.

""I would write and leave people to form their own opinions. It was fun for a while, then it bred huge anxiety. I had a career and a big contract. If I'd been outed, I would have been sacked and ostracised. Now everyone has a podcast and an outlet. Back then, it was genuinely new.

""It changed football in this country and led to overhauls at the highest levels, which I'm proud of. But the stress and anxiety were immense.""

Kitson also spoke about how the death of Gary Speed in 2011 played a role in his decision to end his career as 'The Secret Footballer'. Speed, a former midfielder for Leeds United, Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers among others, was found dead at his home at the age of 42.

Kitson said: ""The worst thing that happened was when I wrote a column about mental health called 'Sometimes There's Darkness Behind the Light.'

""Nobody talked about mental health in football then. If you spoke about it, you were seen as weak. I said there was a mental health epidemic and I predicted it was only a matter of time before someone took their own life.

""I submitted it on Friday. It went out Saturday. On Sunday, Gary Speed was found dead. That's when the Secret Footballer stopped being fun.""

Kitson has tried his hand at punditry since retiring as a player but now predominantly works as a motivational speaker in the mental health sphere.

In 2020, the former striker apologised to Raheem Sterling having appeared to suggest the former Manchester City star had ""made himself a target"" for racism two years earlier.

He said: ""Perhaps I used clumsy language and for that I apologise. But I never have and never will condone any form of racism.

""I admire Raheem for taking up the fight and saying: 'No, I'm not having this'. And I agree with him. More needs to be done. And I'm prepared to do it.

""And if he, or anyone, wants to discuss that matter with me, and what I intend to do, I'm more than happy to have that chat and put his mind – and that of other players - to rest.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Thierry Henry has called on Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni to tell the truth about his altercation with Vinicius Junior during Tuesday's Champions League match against Real Madrid at the Estadio da Luz. Vinicius has alleged that Prestianni directed a racial slur at him during the game, which led to the match being halted for 10 minutes. Henry has now responded with an emotional speech regarding the continued prevalence of racism in football.

Vinicius Junior posted a statement on Instagram saying ""racists are cowards"" after the game on Tuesday, while Real Madrid team-mate Kylian Mbappe has called on Prestianni to be banned from the Champions League. The France international has said he heard the Benfica player call Vinicius a monkey five times at the Estadio da Luz in a game which ended in a 1-0 win for Los Blancos.

Prestianni has responded and said he did not racially abuse Vinicius. He posted on social media: ""I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults to Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard. I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.""

Henry does not believe Prestianni has been truthful about the incident. The former Arsenal and Barcelona striker said on CBS Sports: ""I can relate to what Vinicius is going through. That happened to me so many times on the pitch. I talked about it so many times after games. I've also been accused of looking for excuses after games when that happened to me. At times, you feel lonely, because it's going to be your word against his word.

“We don't know what Prestianni has said, because he was very courageous by putting his shirt over his mouth to make sure that we weren't going to see what he said, so clearly, already, you look suspicious. Because you didn't want people to see or read what you said. Then, the reaction of Vinicius is telling me that something not right happened. We still don't know what was said. Vinicus can tell us his side, and Prestianni, I'm sure, will not tell us what he actually said, because I saw at one point Kylian Mbappe confront him, and he said, ‘I didn't say anything'.

“Well, he must have said something at the very least. You feel like you don't know what to do anymore. We're in 2026 and still after a game like that, where we're supposed to talk about his brilliant goal, we shouldn't be having to deal with the referee telling you to not go to the corner flag, because that will incite the crowd. It's a corner, can he not take a corner? He can't go there to take a corner just because people are thinking whatever they're thinking. Suddenly he becomes a victim. I can relate. I can assure you, when that happens, you don't know what to do anymore.

“He tried to walk out in Spain one time, and another time, he tried to kick someone back because he'd had enough. Now he went to see the referee to tell him what happened. I've been there. The referee also told me he couldn't do anything about it.” Let's see how big of a man Prestianni is. Tell us what you said. You must have said something, because you can't go to Mbappe and say, ‘I didn't say anything'. What do you mean, you covered your nose for what, you have a cold?""

Henry also revealed his frustrations at the fact racism is still so prevalent in football in 2026. He added: ""People did fight, way before my time, for us to be able to perform and to entertain people. And to still be in 2026 dealing with the same thing, it's tiring. Obviously, I can relate, not only I can relate by the color of my skin, I can relate because I've been there. I've been lonely.""

F1 Bahrain Testing Week 2 2026: Day 1 Highlights

Bearman: 'We haven't unlocked the full potential of the car'

Red Bull Technical Director Pierre Wache has given his assessment of the team's pre-season so far, as well as what he makes of their rivals.

Red Bull have estimated that they are sitting behind Mercedes, McLaren and Ferrari in terms of outright performance after the opening pre-season test in Bahrain, despite the “remarkable job” done by the team's new power unit division.

Red Bull head into the 2026 campaign – and F1's new era of regulations – having designed both their car and engine in-house for the first time, with Max Verstappen and Isack Hadjar talking up the powertrain's performance and reliability.

Reflecting on Red Bull's first three days in the Sakhir desert, Technical Director Pierre Wache said: “It has been a positive week, running a full day with Max, with plenty of testing time as we worked on understanding the car and the direction to go in with the power unit.

“Unfortunately, on day two we had some problems with the hydraulics on the chassis side, which compromised Isack's running in the morning, but we were able to recover this in the afternoon.

“[On Friday] morning with Max we evaluated set-ups and saw some good direction and this was similar with Isack [in the] afternoon, so it's been quite positive with the mileage done.

“We need to make sure the car continues to develop a lot more to improve the issue on the balance side, and we know that there is a lot of room for improvement. Our drivers are very motivated and have given us a lot of feedback on where we can improve the car and how we can change the direction of development.

“In general, Red Bull Ford Powertrains has done a remarkable job as a start-up; in three-and-a-half years we have created a power unit and have it out running on track, which is fantastic.”

Wache then offered some thoughts on the early 2026 pecking order, putting Red Bull fourth overall at this point – even if it follows a trend of teams pointing to their rivals.

“The second step is to see where we are sitting compared to others and improve,” he continued. “There were a few teams which were clearly very quick [on Friday] and it looks like we are behind, so there is still a lot to improve. Mercedes, McLaren and Ferrari are there at the top.

“It is a massive learning curve, there are plenty of unknowns and a lot to do. We have been evaluating our weaknesses and strengths and are just focusing on improving the car. We go into [the second test] looking at what we can bring to the car to make it better and solve the issues we have identified.”

Bahrain plays host to the final 2026 pre-season test from Wednesday to Friday this week.

Iconoclastic German veteran Ulrike Ottinger mines macabre humor from a fictionalized portrait of notorious real-life Hungarian noblewoman Elizabeth Báthory.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	If you ever looked at the ageless face of Isabelle Huppert onscreen — the alabaster skin, the enigmatic smile, the eyes that seem to have a default setting of disdainful superiority — and thought all that was missing were a glistening pair of fangs and a tiny trickle of blood from the corner of her mouth, this is the movie for you. Likewise, if you ever wondered what kind of bizarro Mittel European mutant baby would result from the marriage of Robert Eggers' Nosferatu and Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel. Perhaps it would look something like Ulrike Ottinger's Viennese waltz of grotesquerie, The Blood Countess (Die Blutgräfin).

	A painter and photographer as well as a cult filmmaker, Ottinger understands the power of a striking image. She opens with a mesmerizing sequence in which a barge upholstered in plush vermillion velvet cruises ever so slowly through an underground cave system and grotto in Vienna. Standing with regal stillness on the front of the boat, like a carved figurehead on a prow, is Huppert as Countess Elizabeth, a commanding vision in blood-red gown, gloves and jewels to match her copper-colored hair. She alights with a dramatic billowing cape behind her and steps out into the modern-day Austrian capital.

The Bottom Line

	
	If only everyone else were on Huppert's level.
	



Venue: Berlin Film Festival (Berlinale Special)Cast: Isabelle Huppert, Birgit Minichmayr, Thomas Schubert, Lars Eidinger, André Jung, Marco Lorenzini, Tom Neuwirth, Karl Markovics, Felix OitzingerDirector: Ulrike OttingerScreenwriters: Ulrike Ottinger, Elfriede Jelinek

								1 hour 59 minutes			






	Elizabeth has barely hit town when she exchanges a come-hither glance with a pretty young woman whose creamy neck is soon punctured by teeth marks. The life drains from her body on the floor of a ladies' restroom. But the glamorous noblewoman has not emerged from decades of slumber in a glass coffin at the Kremlin just to feast. She is troubled by talk of a legendary book that can turn vampires back into mortals should they shed tears on its pages.

	











	That's probably the first clue that the screenplay by Ottinger — with additional dialogue by Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek, no less — will not be overly worried about the finer points of plot logic. Weeping vampires are relatively rare and yet Elizabeth and the devoted servant with whom she's reunited, Hermione (Birgit Minichmayr, looking like a demonic Louise Brooks), seem to think this ancient volume poses a major threat to the existence of their kind.


	Mostly, the book serves to set them on a daffy quest through Vienna's historical sites and libraries in order to find and destroy it. But before they get started on that there's a vampire ball to attend, at which the Countess makes her grand entrance while being exalted as “a woman untouched by virtue.” (Love that for Huppert.) There's a buffet of human corpses, a vampire string quartet and a soprano celebrating the qualities of Viennese blood. Then there's the real entertainment. A row of handsome young men in formalwear is ushered onto the stage and seated, followed by the same number of women who are blindfolded and given straight razors to shave the gentlemen before slitting their throats. “Dinner is served!”


	This probably sounds a lot more entertaining than it is. I could watch Huppert queening it up until the cows come home, and it's likely she hasn't had this much self-satirizing fun since her hilarious Call My Agent! episode. But Ottinger doesn't do much with her beyond putting her in a series of bejeweled outfits (designer Jorge Jara Guarda did the fabulous costumes), untethering her and letting her float majestically above a whole bunch of increasingly tiresome people on her tail, all of them mugging up a storm.

	











	They include one of the neo-Báthorys from Transylvania, Baron Rudi Bubi (Thomas Schubert, so good in Christian Petzold's Afire), a dandy in green who has shamed the family by going vegetarian; his psychotherapist Theobold Tandem (Lars Eidinger); dithering vampirologists Theobastus Bombastus (André Jung) and Nepomuk Afterbite (Marco Lorenzini); and two cops, Chief Inspector Unbelief (Karl Markovics) and Assistant Guido Doppler (Felix Oitzinger). The names alone should give an accurate indication of the unrelenting level of quirk, with everyone dialing up the eccentricities to 11.


	It all becomes too self-consciously arch to be clever. There's an additional quest element in Elizabeth seeking documents about her family lineage to fight her erasure from the history books. But that doesn't add much beyond three crusty Báthory ancestors carousing drunkenly in their coffins. Super-annoying.


	There are stops at a monastery in Leipzig, its catacombs decorated with human skulls and bones, policed by a Mother Superior who's handy with a crucifix; a Funeral Museum with a Café Mortuary; a queer cabaret, where Austria's Conchita Wurst (Tom Neuwirth) performs “Rise Like a Phoenix,” the power ballad that won the Eurovision Song Contest; and a final act back in Vienna at the Prater, with scenes on the historic Wiener Riesenrad, the giant Ferris wheel that inevitably brings up associations with noir classic The Third Man.


	Queer feminist filmmaker Ottinger's work is known for its rejection of conventional linear narratives, but would a little coherence be too much to ask? The Blood Countess devolves into such haphazard, nonsensical plotting (with a resolution far more rushed than satisfying) that it's a challenge to stay with it for the protracted two-hour duration.

	











	At least there's Huppert in gloriously aloof form, plus the overripe lusciousness of Martin Gschlacht's cinematography; with an edible and/or a cocktail or three, that might be enough. 


	There have been numerous films made about Elizabeth Báthory, who was convicted of torturing and murdering hundreds of women between 1590 and 1610; according to legend, she bathed in their blood to maintain her youthful looks. As sublime as Huppert is, if I'm in the mood for a campy retelling of the Báthory story, I'll stick with the trashtastic 1971 Hammer horror production with Ingrid Pitt as the busty bloodsucker, Countess Dracula.

					By Rosy Cordero 

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Multihyphenate and 34-time Grammy and Latin Grammy Award-winning rapper René “Residente” Pérez Joglar has set his feature directorial debut with a love letter to his native island of Puerto Rico.


	The film, titled Porto Rico, is an epic Caribbean western and historical drama led by Benito “Bad Bunny” Martínez Ocasio (Bullet Train, Caught Stealing) in his first leading film role. The main cast also includes Viggo Mortensen (Eastern Promises, Captain Fantastic), Edward Norton (American History X, Birdman) and Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men). Multi-Oscar-winning director and producer Alejandro G. Iñárritu executive produces.

	











As Deadline announced in 2023, when Porto Rico was in development, Residente and Oscar-winning screenwriter Alexander Dinelaris (Birdman) co-wrote the screenplay, which at the time was described as a historical drama based on the life of Puerto Rican revolutionary José Maldonado Román, known as Águila Blanca (White Eagle), set on the island in the late 19th century. Maldonado Román fought against colonialism by leading a gang of ex-convicts to vindicate Puerto Rico as it sought its identity as a country.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Whether the film will follow the original storyline above is as yet unknown. A release for the movie touts that the project “blends historical scope with a visceral, lyrical approach and a gripping narrative inspired by true events.”


	“I have dreamed of making a film about my country since I was a child. Puerto Rico's true history has always been surrounded by controversy,” Residente said. “This film is a reaffirmation of who we are — told with the intensity and honesty that our history deserves.”

	











	The project reveal arrives following Bad Bunny's smash hit Super Bowl halftime show performance earlier this month, February 8, with his own tribute to Puerto Rico, where he was born in 1994. Every layer of his performance was intimately woven with the fabric, food, and festive spirit of the Boricua people. The show, which was watched by 128.2 million viewers, has spiked flight searches to the island by 245% from February 8-11 in comparison to the same dates last year, according to Expedia.


	Although Residente and Bad Bunny are generations apart, they're kindred spirits in their love of country, community, and their passion to protect both through activism.


	Although details are scant at this time, there are plenty of clues within the official announcement.


	A quick history lesson: Puerto Rico (translation: Rich Port) was named by the Spaniards, who colonized the Caribbean island, originally known as Borikén by the indigenous Taino people who preceded the Spanish, in 1493. Spain ceded sovereignty in 1898 after losing the Spanish-American War, with the Caribbean island becoming a U.S. territory on December 10, 1898. Its citizens were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917 via the Jones Act, albeit without the will of the people.


	Under U.S. rule, Puerto Rico was known as Porto Rico, an anglicized spelling of the island's name, from 1900 to 1932, when Congress passed an act officially reverting its name to the Spanish spelling.


	Bardem, a native of Spain, and American actors Norton and Mortensen are playing roles connected to their respective origin countries, we hear. It's worth noting that Norton and Mortensen, the latter of whom spent many years living in Argentina, are fluent in Spanish.


	“This film sits in a tradition of films we deeply love, from The Godfather to Gangs of New York, that both thrill us with visceral drama and iconic characters and eras while also forcing us to face up to the shadow story under the American narrative of idealism,” Norton said. “Everybody knows what a poet of language and rhythm René is. Now they're going to see what a visual visionary he is as well. And bringing him and Bad Bunny together to tell the true story of Puerto Rico's roots is going to be like a flame finding the stick of dynamite that's been waiting for it.”


	Residente and Erick Douât produce the pic for 1868 Studios, launched by the former through a multi-year joint venture with Sony Music Latin-Iberia and Sony Music Vision. The production company develops, produces, and globally distributes original content centered on authentic, culturally driven storytelling with a commitment to elevating Latin culture and bringing Latin stories to global audiences.


	Norton and Bill Migliore, alongside Michael Bederman, produce for Class 5 Films. The production banner has produced features and documentaries, including The Painted Veil and Motherless Brooklyn, as well as the Emmy-winning By the People: The Election of Barack Obama.


Porto Rico is backed by Live Nation Studios, Class 5 Films and strategic partners including the Kwanza Jones & José E. Feliciano Initiative, Mike and Sukey Novogratz, and Noah Assad. Iñárritu executive produces alongside Scott Budnick through his shingle 1Community (Just Mercy, Respect), Mike Novogratz, Sukey Novogratz, José E. Feliciano, Kwanza Jones, Henry R. Muñoz III and Assad. UTA Independent Film Group is representing sales.


	Residente is represented by Erick Douat. Bad Bunny is represented by UTA and his manager, Assad. Mortensen is represented by UTA and Goodman, Genow, and Schenkman. Norton is represented by UTA and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. Bardem is represented by WME and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman.

Looks like a hot one already. Great casting.

Oh man, this one is going to be worth keeping an eye on. Loads of potential. Great talent, both behind and in front of the camera.

This is Viggo Mortensen's first film in years…

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Epstein Files have smashed Jimmy Fallon's spaghetti sauce dreams","https://www.avclub.com/jimmy-fallon-tommy-mottola-epstein-files-spaghetti-sauce","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:06:00 GMT","

Talk show host Jimmy Fallon has reportedly stepped back from plans to start a pasta sauce brand, after his long-time friend and partner in the venture, former Sony Music Entertainment CEO Tommy Mottola, was found to appear more than 600 times in the Epstein Files. This is reality, and that is a thing that happened within it: Jimmy Fallon isn't selling spaghetti sauce anymore because his (extremely powerful and influential) pasta buddy was also friends with the world's most notorious pedophile.

This is per THR, which notes that Fallon and Mottola's pasta sauce line was in the “early development phase,” with plans to possibly launch in 2027. But, no more: The fact that Mottola—whose current Mottola Media Group is a well-known producer in theater, television, and music—appears in the recently released files so many times, and as recently as the summer of 2018, has caused the venture to be killed. (Moments like this sometimes produce absolutely fascinating sentences; in this case, we have THR‘s “Representatives for both Fallon and Mottola declined to speak on the record with The Hollywood Reporter regarding the status of their sauce brand.”)

And it's not that we're fixated on Jimmy Fallon's tomato sauce specifically—although, if we're being honest, we are kind of stuck trying to figure out what the name would have been. But it's simply been interesting to see the ways various public figures have been reacting in the wake of their various power broker buddies, associates, or employers being revealed to have been sending little “Hey, thinking of you” emails to Epstein more than a decade after he was first registered as a sex offender. Chappell Roan, for instance, recently made headlines when she announced that she was no longer being represented by the talent agency run by Casey Wasserman, who appears more than 80 times in the Files. (Wasserman is now reportedly selling the agency—although he apparently intends to stay on the board of Los Angeles' 2028 Olympic Games Committee.)

All of which is happening in a strange kind of slow motion: The sheer volume of the Epstein Files had made them impossible to process simultaneously, instead causing these odd little (and so far, very minor) consequences to shake out; a pasta sauce there, an apology from the executive producer of Bones there. It's not clear yet how the reaction to the Files, both in the world generally, and Hollywood—where Epstein was clearly pretty aggressive about cultivating friendships—specifically, will end up shaking out: Whether it's all just going to be smashed pasta sauces and notes on people's Wikipedia pages, or something more robust.

The following contains spoilers for Wuthering Heights.

The debate over Emerald Fennell's Wuthering Heights has splintered into two factions that ultimately agree on the facts. Fans of the movie think it delivers style over substance in a good way, while detractors think it prioritizes style over substance in a bad one. But while it's fair to say that Fennell favors flashy sensuality over meaty storytelling, it's not entirely fair to say there's no substance to her candy-colored, Charli xcx-soundtracked riff on Emily Brontë's classic novel. In fact, there's actually an underappreciated core to Fennell's loose adaptation. Her Wuthering Heights may market itself as a dark and steamy Valentine's Day romance, but at its heart it's actually a story of childhood trauma bonds run amok. 

It's a theme that emerges thanks to one of the bigger changes Fennell makes to her exploration of the doomed love story between Cathy Earnshaw (Margot Robbie) and Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi). In the novel, Cathy's father is a minor supporting character who adopts an orphaned Heathcliff as his favorite child but then dies relatively early into the story. It's then Cathy's older brother Hindley (a character the film cuts entirely) who inherits the Wuthering Heights estate and proceeds to jealously mistreat Heathcliff—forcing him to live and work as a servant, thus setting up the class/social stratification that keeps Cathy and Heathcliff apart. 

In the movie, however, we simply have Cathy's alcoholic father Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes), who brings Heathcliff home to save him, but then proceeds to mistreat him as well. That simple act of character condensing shifts the entire story. While Brontë's Wuthering Heights begins with a stable family that's slowly corrupted by jealousy and grief, Fennell begins with a version that's hollow from the start. Instead of a big house with characters coming and going, Wuthering Heights is more like an island prison lorded over by a capricious man who seems to be collecting children he can keep under his thumb—including Cathy's servant-companion Nelly (Hong Chau), whom Fennell reimagines as the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman.

From the first moments we meet young Cathy (Charlotte Mellington) and Nelly (Vy Nguyen), it's clear that Wuthering Heights isn't a safe place to grow up. Both girls know they have to carefully manage their emotions so as not to set off Mr. Earnshaw's temper. And without any kind of positive parental figure in their life, they've both developed maladaptive personalities. Cathy is self-centered and melodramatic, while Nelly is tumultuously infatuated with her impulsive mistress, who has all the privilege Nelly's been denied access to. Both girls build their emotional worlds around Cathy, forging a codependent bond that helps them weather the storm of Mr. Earnshaw's drunken fits of rage.

Once young Heathcliff (Owen Cooper) enters the story, however, that bond gets upended. Cathy shifts her melodramatic yearning to a more conventionally romantic figure, while young Heathcliff is inspired to take his protective instincts to self-sacrificial levels because it so clearly fuels Cathy's love of drama and angst. Nelly, meanwhile, is left seething with jealousy over how Heathcliff has supplanted her role in Cathy's life. All the love they're denied from their father figure gets transposed onto one another in increasingly thorny, complex, psychosexual ways. Or, as grown-up Cathy screams at her dad when he complains about being ill, “We are all ill because of you!”

It's a sentiment Fennell captures with equal parts satire and horror. While Fennell has sympathy for Cathy as a victim, she also has a keen eye for how hilariously petulant and annoying she can be. Her arrested development is cause for a whole lot of unnecessary drama in its own way. Meanwhile, horror touches—like a scene where Heathcliff yanks Cathy under a bed like a 1980s horror villain—subvert the film's romantic tone. Though there is something sweet and genuine going on between Heathcliff and Cathy, it stems from a place of survival as much as anything else. They have no one around to save them but themselves.

This fuels Fennell's pointed critique of the patriarchal forces that undergird upper-class British nobility in the 18th century. Because a landed man is considered the highest authority, there's no social or child protective services to call when he's misusing that power. Instead, his staff and family must simply bend to his various whims and power plays. Wuthering Heights deploys a lot of dollhouse imagery, and Cathy, Heathcliff, and Nelly might as well be dolls Mr. Earnshaw is playing with as he shouts “I am the kindest man alive!” into the void. 

It's an idea Brontë explores too, although in a very different place in the novel. In Brontë's original story, the saga continues on after Cathy's death with a second generation of characters who find themselves living under Heathcliff's isolated, abusive thumb. Hindley's strapping heir, Cathy's strong-willed daughter, and Heathcliff's own sickly son are left to build complicated bonds with one another while Heathcliff lures them all to Wuthering Heights and tries his best to emotionally destroy their lives as revenge for his own suffering.

While Fennell—like most Wuthering Heights adaptors—cuts that part of the story, she intentionally folds some of its themes into her streamlined adaptation. Though she reimagines Heathcliff as a far kinder, more sympathetic figure than he is in the novel, her dark take on Mr. Earnshaw gets at some of the patriarchal abuse that Brontë is interested in too. It's like Fennell has collapsed the two generations into her Cathy/Heathcliff/Nelly dynamic, which is a clever way to engage with the novel's core ideas without adapting its plot beat-for-beat. 

It's a shame, then, that after such a strong start, Fennell's ideas lose steam in the film's second half. More than anything, Wuthering Heights is a movie about three codependent people who are absolutely terrified of the idea of getting left behind. And Fennell's exploration of Cathy, Heathcliff, and Nelly's fraught bond reaches its climax in a scene where Nelly actively manipulates a miscommunication between her “siblings.” In the novel, Heathcliff accidentally overhears Cathy say she could never marry him. In the movie, however, Nelly intentionally provokes Cathy's confession once she realizes Heathcliff is listening outside the door. She blows up Cathy and Heathcliff's love, just as she felt her love for Cathy was blown up by Heathcliff. 

After that, Fennell seems less sure what to do with the themes she's set up. Once Cathy marries her neighbor Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif) and Heathcliff disappears and returns a rich, dashing man, Wuthering Heights devolves into a style-over-substance fantasia. There are fun montages showing off the over-the-top production design of the Linton family home and some “provocative” adaptation changes—like making Heathcliff's relationship with Isabella Linton (Alison Oliver) a consensual BDSM one, rather than an abusive marriage. But because Fennell has frontloaded all the interesting emotional drama into the first half of the movie, there's nowhere for her characters to go as Cathy and Heathcliff finally start consummating their relationship.

There are still sharp moments here and there, like when Cathy tells Nelly, “You like to see me cry,” and Nelly counters, “Not half as much as you like crying.” Or the way Cathy responds to her father's eventual death with both grief and violent relief. Fennell effectively renders her central trio as people too stunted by their childhood traumas to ever really mature into adulthood. But in the rush to make Wuthering Heights a sexy, smutty, earnest romance, Fennell's spikier themes fall by the wayside. Nelly is positioned as the ultimate tragic antihero, given that her vengeful meddling in Cathy's life results in Cathy's death. But the film doesn't care about the character enough to make that twist land. Instead, Wuthering Heights devolves into a more basic Romeo And Juliet-style tragedy. 

Still, there's something to Fennell's adaptation. In some ways, it's a soft choice to make Heathcliff a more sympathetic romantic lead rather than the complicated, cruel figure he is in the novel. But given that Brontë ultimately ends with a sense of hope about children being able to break the cycles of abuse set by their parents, amping up Mr. Earnshaw as an antagonist and giving that hopeful arc to Heathcliff instead still (sort of) tracks with what the novel is trying to explore. That alone won't please the Brontë purists, but it does prove that Fennell's flexible reimagining is more than its quotation marks.

Editor's Note: The following story contains spoilers for “Wuthering Heights.”

Whatever else you might think of it, there's no denying writer and director Emerald Fennell designed her adaptation of “Wuthering Heights” to be gleefully jarring. Maybe no moment exemplifies this better than the near jumpscare of Cathy (Margot Robbie) returning to her not-so-homey childhood abode to find her father, Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes), dead on the ground in basically Peter Griffin pose, surrounded by piles of gin bottles rising to the rafters. 

 










The two gin monoliths, like so much of the visual design of the film, gave production designer Suzie Davies and her team the chance to reach the apex of a feeling — whether anger, sadness, despair, or desire. Fennell wrote into the script that Earnshaw would meet his end surrounded by mountains of empty bottles, but it was on Davies to translate that into a reality — or at least as much of a reality for the world of the often unreal, dreamlike, and deliberately artificial-looking “Wuthering Heights.”

“Oh my God, that was such fun to do!” Davies told IndieWire. “We had a fantastic team of model makers doing all sorts of wonderful things [to make] these giant bottles of booze. I think I'd made it about five-foot high, up to the windows. I thought, ‘That's a lot of gin.' We'd been practicing it because, obviously, on a schedule, you can't just dress those in. They're actually on a rig, and we wanted to get light behind them so it's hollow behind. [And] Emerald just said, ‘I think we need more.'” 

The twin peaks ended up over seven feet tall, made of a collage of mostly lightweight plastic bottles, with the odd real glass bottle here and there to create a bit of shine against DP Linus Sandgren's ghoulish, slightly greenish lights. On the rig, they could be quickly lifted in and out of the Earnshaw sitting room, such as it is, for the scene of Cathy and Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi) confronting the body of the man who both brought them together and tormented them for years. 

Davies said that the monstrous nature of those sky-high bottle piles is not only a visual match for Earnshaw and the horror of what a drunk he was. It's also part of the way that the Wuthering Heights house disintegrates into wreck and ruin. “We wanted the omnipresence of nature taking over in all forms. It's coming from the mountain, it's coming from all sides, it's coming from the ground. Everything was just the heaviness and pressure of that building and the uncomfortable nature of what's going on in that world,” Davies said. 

 










By this point in the film, Davies and her team had already done a lot of work, giving the space an emotional trajectory similar to Cathy and Heathcliff's self-destruction over their feelings for each other. Freed from any sort of period accuracy, Davies tried to start the house in a spartan, memory-like state, as Cathy and Heathcliff would remember it from childhood. “There's not really an oven. There's not the usual accoutrements of a kitchen. It's very bare,” Davies said. “But I love that when Heathcliff and Isabella [Alison Oliver] take over, it's just layers upon layers of dead animals and food and drink and shapes. It was great to do.” 

Whether working with the brooding ruin of the Wuthering Heights house or the glossy red corridors in Thrushcross Grange, Davies was guided by the same principles, which Fennell laid out in a phone call to Davies before she sent the production designer the script. “The idea that it was gonna be about a feeling more than anything. It's like the architecture of feeling that we needed to design, rather than the architecture of the period,” Davies said.

Davies translated that into all sorts of wet surfaces, with water dripping down the rocks of Wuthering Heights and the rock gradually pushing in over the course of the movie. The fireplace was designed as if it had been built out of that rock, and then it too starts to sweat — those who've seen Isabella and Heathcliff's scenes as a married couple know why. 

 










“You're just given this opportunity to safely make crazy decisions,” Davies said. “Although it's [Emerald's] story, she's happy [for everyone to have], and expects everyone to have an opinion, and suggestions. So it's not, like, ‘Do it this way.' It's like, ‘This is what I'm after. What can you do?' You end up building this visual language that, luckily, over two films [including ‘Saltburn'], I feel like I sort of know her groove,” Davies said. “She pushes me in a direction I would not normally go, and it's just brilliant for a creative role to have that freedom to just go a little bit crazy.” 

“Wuthering Heights” is now playing in theaters.

What constitutes an independent spirit nowadays? 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Just days after this year's Film Independent Spirit Awards (which, in the past, operated like IndieWire's very own Super Bowl), a question lingers: what are award shows that are meant to honor independent films actually in service of? And, if a winter awards show doesn't present itself as a bellwether for the Oscars, does it even count?

 








Related Stories What's Up with Those Gin Bottle Mountains in ‘Wuthering Heights'? The Film's Production Designer Explains ‘Alien: Earth' Antagonist Babou Ceesay Talks Finding the Humanity in a Morally ‘Horrendous' Character 

While I write that as a joke, I do think that part of the reason why this year's Indie Spirits telecast fell flat was due to some unfortunate no-shows. Film Independent, which organizes the ceremony, has long maintained a budget cap on the entrants in the film categories (the maximum is less than what it costs to cast Robert Downey Jr. in your film).

 










While that does not mean there's been a dearth of genuine movie stars who have been nominated over the years, as many will happily take a pay cut if they're convinced an independent film will earn them acclaim and/or awards recognition, the way Film Independent has compensated for the shallower pool of talent that would draw attention to the ceremony is by adding television categories to the show — without any budget cap.

In practice, this adds big names like Ethan Hawke, Seth Rogen, Michelle Williams, and Noah Wyle to a ceremony already spotlighting stars like Rose Byrne, Joel Edgerton, Tessa Thompson, and Kirsten Dunst in the film categories. But while the film stars I mentioned all came to the awards show, the TV stars skipped. 

Netflix limited series “Adolescence” ended up being the big TV winner of the night, yet of its three Emmy-winning actors — Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper, and Erin Doherty — only the latter was present to accept her award for Best Supporting Performance in a New Scripted Series.

The Gotham Awards, which share a similar ethos of trying to spotlight independent film, might have had the better approach to attracting star power, by getting rid of its budget cap. Both it and the Film Independent Spirit Awards have worked as bookends to awards season, with the Gothams taking place in early December and the Indie Spirits having long taken place the day before the Oscars (that has since changed post-pandemic).

 










For a short period of time, the Gotham Awards were also giving out film and TV awards on the same night, but the Gotham Institute has since spun out its TV categories into their own awards show that falls more in line with the Emmys cycle.

For added star power, the Gothams give out a handful of honorary awards to films like “Frankenstein,” “Song Sung Blue,” and “Sinners” that would either fall out of line with what the budget cap once was, or just outside of voters' tastes. Because they are guaranteed those wins, the stars of those films, which are all viable awards players in the greater scheme of things, still show up to the event to accept, meaning the Gotham Awards get to boast that the likes of Jacob Elordi, Kate Hudson, and Michael B. Jordan all attended their celebration.

If you look at what was nominated for the Gotham Awards last year, the lack of budget cap didn't exactly change what got nominated, as Indie Spirit winners like “Train Dreams,” “Sorry, Baby,” and “Lurker” were all nominated for Best Feature at the end-of-the-year awards show. But the winner at the Gotham Awards was “One Battle After Another,” which is famously the most expensive film director Paul Thomas Anderson has ever made.

 










In an earlier edition of IndieWire's The Lead Up, I quoted “Sinners” star Jordan as I wrote about how the ideal Best Picture Oscar winner is a “commercial film with an independent heart.” It's not like the Gotham Awards got rid of the budget cap and started nominating IP plays like “Wicked” or “Avatar” in its main categories. “One Battle After Another” was certainly made with an independent spirit.

It is a fascinating predicament: in order to continue existing, these awards shows that are geared toward independent film are trying to become more commercial, yet this is during a time in which commercial films are becoming more indie in their sensibilities.

While opening the door to Independent Spirit Award for Best Film winner “Train Dreams” being nominated against Best Picture frontrunner “One Battle After Another,” or giving a blockbuster like “Sinners” an honorary award is probably not the ultimate answer for how to make sure the Film Independent Spirit Awards liven up next year, an increase on the budget cap (which, this year, could allow for films like “Marty Supreme,” “Hamnet,” or “Bugonia” to become eligible) does seem like a solution that would encourage better attendance at future shows —without endangering its independent-mindedness.

With her 2021 debut, The Blue of Distance, Elori Saxl introduced herself as something like the Steve Reich of seasonal affective disorder. The experimental electronic composer wrote half that album during a joyous Adirondack summer; then, during a bleak Wisconsin winter, she wrote the second half, seeking to recapture the warmth she previously felt but experiencing only longing instead. Eventually, Saxl says, she “made friends with the longing.” And while that process may sound as much like an academic experiment as a compositional method, you needn't have any knowledge of Saxl's conceptual framework to appreciate her strangely beautiful music, woodwinds and synthesizer and nature samples all arranged in bucolic bliss. To my ears, it sounded like the arrival of an uncommonly inventive composer, one operating in some mysterious place where ambient and modern minimalism meet.

Saxl used The Blue of Distance to document, in her words, “attempts to access the feeling of being in a place and time that you are not in currently”—but on her latest album, Seeing Is Forgetting, she exists purely in the moment. It's a collaboration between Saxl and the saxophonist and composer Henry Solomon. Though he's performed with mainstream pop names like Miley Cyrus and Haim, Solomon is rooted in the L.A. jazz scene, and at ease with the roiling chaos of live improvisation. Saxl, by contrast, is accustomed to a more methodological style, plotting out every note ahead of time. Here, using analog synths while Solomon flits between baritone saxophone and bass clarinet, she shakes off the conceptual rigors of her previous work in favor of a looser, jazzier approach, and the results are airily sublime.

The album opens with the slow drift of “Reverence,” Saxl's bleary-eyed synth pads providing a simmering base for Solomon's mournful sax laments. Not until the final moments of the six-minute piece does Solomon reach into the higher registers of his instrument, but when he does, you can feel ambient and spiritual jazz locking into a new kind of communion. “Reno Silver” subverts this soloist vs. accompanist dichotomy as Solomon lays down looped sax textures before Saxl plinks out the song's ascending melody on a Juno-106. Elsewhere, on the dense, glacial mood pieces “Heart” and “Seeing Is Forgetting,” Solomon uses a bass clarinet as his vehicle of melodic transcendence. One of the exciting things about this record, though, is that you can't always tell where the synths end and the woodwinds begin.

The duo recorded this music over the course of a few nights in Los Angeles, without writing songs beforehand. For Saxl, it was a revolutionary approach; in the album's liner notes, she says the process changed her “sense of where ideas come from, where music comes from.” That sense of improvisational rapture is palpable in Solomon's soloing on looser tracks like “A Thousand Steps” and “Hiding Place.” The album's best song, “Symmetries,” unlocks a mesmerizing counterpoint between celestial clouds of synth and Solomon's deep, exploratory sax refrains. It carries a sense of melodic structure and inevitability that doesn't always arise from improvisational passages.

Seeing Is Forgetting takes its title from a 1982 book by the writer Lawrence Weschler, itself named after a quote from the French poet Paul Valéry. (The Blue of Distance was named after a literary source, too.) For Saxl, the phrase tapped into a “sheer sense of physicality and presence,” a creation process unburdened by past and future obligations. The music thrives on that sense of ephemeral chemistry, but for a listener, its transportive effect lingers long after the album has finished playing.

“I feel like M.I.A./I got the freedom to create,” the adolescent boy chirped, pacing in circles and staring out at distant cityscapes, not looking very free. A little over a year ago, when Feng's “M.I.A.” video came out, his songs were moody sketches of youth and yearning, custom-made for Instagram Reels. The boasts sounded more like coping mechanisms: Affirmations arising in lonely hotel suites, the kinds of places where people are sadder than they seem on Instagram. Maybe, when M.I.A. sees a certain name pop up on her phone, she, too, paces in circles, pinching her forehead. “Ok, who is Feng?” she recently asked. “Feng is always hitting me up. Why is everyone obsessed with Feng?”

Feng is a 19 year-old rapper who resides in London, but spends lots of time in Los Angeles, where the laid-back swagger of last decade still lingers. It was in L.A., last year, that the subject of “Left for USA,” from his slight debut mixtape, found a new, appealing life: “Hollywood Boulevard, he must be living great/I'm stuck in London, that's why everything look gray.” Not for long. Feng—who recently struck a major-label deal—makes coast-hopping music, and will soon be making coast-hopping money, too. (Another “M.I.A.” lyric: “Gettin' fly like planes/I went from London to L.A.”)

No score yet, be the first to add.

But somewhere beneath his swag-era escapist pastiche lies a latent longing. This is partly why everyone is obsessed with Feng: not only is he constantly between two continents, but two competing sensibilities, a clouted optimist who's mastered the moment before the comedown. His strongest songs are sometimes his briefest, and squeeze youthful extremes—love and lack, ecstasy and ennui—into YouTube Shorts for slack-jawed screenagers. He is, at best, a conflicted rapper for a conflicted generation, giggling through short-form loops, grunting through this long-ass life.

Few Feng songs articulate this quite like “Left for USA,” which looks across the Atlantic, dreaming unattainable dreams. Unfortunately, “Left for USA” is also uniquely self-fulfilling: On his dull debut album, the rapper indeed ditches dreary London, and with it, the nuance that made him interesting. Weekend Rockstar bludgeons its beloved 2010s indie dance-rap to death: brute-forcing the sunwashed sound, stuffing in belabored references, and all the while sounding surprisingly uncurious, as if last decade should be paying him royalties for the exposure. No longer slouching on lonely rooftops or suspended between inchoate feelings, Feng would like to re-introduce himself: “I'm young and I'm lit and I'm cruisin' in the whip,” he drawls on “Teenage Famous,” a half-assed L.A. anthem too profane for the high school DJs in Radio Rebel, but perfectly on par with the movie's third-grade audience. (Begins the chorus: “How do I say this? I'm teenage famous.”) It is one-dimensional music at odds with a precociously worldly teenager, whose rapidly changing life yields confusingly little growth.

As a “positive punk” who “wears colors,” Feng seeks to subvert—spiritually and sonically—the “gray” London he's left behind. Like a Crayola set melting in the Los Angeles sun, Weekend Rockstar bleeds with garish pastels: consider the gauzy stomp-clap of “Cali Crazy,” or the corn-syrup stupor of “F'd Up,” or, if you're having trouble sleeping, the cerulean slow-dance of “Superstar.” There is a fine line between “color” and oversaturation, and an even finer one between oversaturation and shitty HDR. By blowing past them all, Feng has proven, ironically, that the murkiest grays are no worse than the gaudiest hues—and if his native underground is any indication, those murky, uncertain grays are often much more interesting. London rap, circa 2026, is a patchwork of young, conflicted characters: sleepwalking through half-remembered swag eras, hoisting camcorders at bloghouse bile, scoring splintered identities with splintered musical palettes. The coolest hip-hop coming out of the UK is complicated. Unfortunately, Feng is too cool for that.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","U2 Release New EP Days of Ash","https://pitchfork.com/news/u2-release-new-ep-days-of-ash/","Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:11:34 GMT","

To coincide with Ash Wednesday, U2 have surprise-released a new EP titled Days of Ash. The six-track EP includes one poem by Yehuda Amichai and five new songs by the band, one of which features Ed Sheeran and Taras Topolia, the Ukrainian singer who they performed with in a Kyiv bomb shelter in 2022. You can listen to it below.

U2 got back together over the past year to record what would become Days of Ash. Most of the EP's songs are about real individuals whose lives were cut short, including Minneapolis mother Renée Good, Iranian schoolgirl Sarina Esmailzadeh, and Palestinian father and No Other Land documentary consultant Awdah Hathaleen. “Yours Eternally” will also get a short documentary directed by Ukrainian filmmaker Ilya Mikhaylus, which will be released next week on the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

“The songs on Days of Ash are very different in mood and theme to the ones we're going to put on our album later in the year,” Bono said in a press release. “These EP tracks couldn't wait; these songs were impatient to be out in the world. They are songs of defiance and dismay, of lamentation. Songs of celebration will follow, we're working on those now… because for all the awfulness we see normalized daily on our small screens, there's nothing normal about these mad and maddening times and we need to stand up to them before we can go back to having faith in the future. And each other.”

U2 are also releasing a new Propaganda zine, the band's long-running print series that they started back in 1986. The new issue, U2 - Days of Ash: Six Postcards From The Present… Wish We Weren't Here, is a 52-page publication that includes song lyrics, notes from each member of U2, a Q&A with Bono, and exclusive interviews with ‘Yours Eternally' film director Ilya Mikhaylus, film producer Pyotr Verzilov, and musician and soldier Taras Topolia. The Propaganda zine is available digitally and as a limited-edition print run.

U2's as-yet-untitled new album will follow their 2023 full-length Songs of Surrender and is slated for release in late 2026. Last year, Bono, the Edge, Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen Jr. each published their own statement on Israel's ongoing starvation of the Gaza Strip. “Everyone has long been horrified by what is unfolding in Gaza - but the blocking of humanitarian aid and now plans for a military takeover of Gaza City has taken the conflict into uncharted territory,” they also wrote in a joint statement. “We are not experts in the politics of the region, but we want our audience to know where we each stand.”

							By 

	Alison Weinflash



Phish bassist Mike Gordon was always in awe of Bob Weir, from seeing him perform onstage as a kid to decades later staying at his home in Hawaii with Bob's family. As the youngest member of his own band, Gordon often felt a kinship with Weir, “the Kid” in the Grateful Dead. He spoke to Rolling Stone while in Woodstock preparing for his spring solo tour, and recalls their time together at TRI Studios working on flow-state experiments, the time he almost joined Dead & Company, and Bob sitting in with his band. 


	Honestly, everything about Bob Weir was dichotomies. Interesting dichotomies for me, from my perspective. Watching him as a kid, he seemed to be the one [in the Grateful Dead] that was the real rock star type. Just a bit self-conscious, and sometimes the hair flicking and all that. His playing, on the other hand, seems really selfless, because it just weaves into the music almost unnoticeably, and yet it's so eloquent. But his personality had that combination of those kinds of things, like seeming super-cold because he didn't smile that much. He was actually one of the warmest people ever. 

	











	I mean, it's not often that I meet a hero of mine, some rock star, and then just have him write his phone number down for me, not really knowing me. And then staying in touch over the years and always responding. And yet, playing in different groups with him, he's also never the one that would give out compliments. Like, “Nice drum solo” or “Nice bass line.” Ever.

	He could be stoic, and then he would say something that was really funny. And the fact that he really lived life hard, but then later in life [was very healthy] — one of those last experiences was going to his beach house, where he had me do his meditation with him, guided meditation, and going for a run and doing other workout parts, eating all vegan food. Everything about him was a daily routine of health, after daily routines of raging, probably. So I don't know if he always had these splits or if I just noticed them as time went on.

	I worked out with him. He did it with a lot of people. We did a guided meditation, based on what I do, Transcendental Meditation, but a little different. And then he goes running barefoot. He would run barefoot on pavement or rocky mountains or the beach or anywhere, and his feet were kind of calloused, and I wasn't going to do that. He kind of combined the meditation with the run. It was like a brisk walk or slow run, and he kind of repeated his mantra. In his backyard at his beach house there was a sandbox with 100 different kinds of fun workout things. He had the TRX straps, had these little videos of us doing push-ups into the air, leaning over the TRX straps. We had this twisting move. It looks like a samurai or something, where the legs and arms are all twisting one way and then all the way around the other way. He tried to show me and I just couldn't do it, after about 10 minutes of trying to videotape everything, he's like, “How about I'll just do it and you videotape me.” So we did that. He had this heavy leather ball, and he wanted to do this thing where we just threw it back and forth, hard to launch and hard to catch, all in that sandbox with really nice tropical plants around it. Then he made me some vegan sausages. I know he's always done yoga, over the years, and just seemed really healthy.


	The reason we went to the beach house together is because we were at a studio doing this brainwave experiment. I read an article where he said dreams informed his whole life. His creativity, and the music that he writes, all informed by dreams. And I thought, “Oh, well, me too.”  I had this team of neurologists, and one neurologist from MIT could get people in half-awake, half-dreaming, half-asleep. Bobby started coming on those Zooms [with the neurologists] and told us this one dream that he'd had. In it he said he saw his own band, he's playing, but from 20 feet behind the stage and there's someone younger that's replaced him. Like a ghost. And he's behind the drum set and he sees the new younger him. That was the middle of just a Zoom about neurological stuff, and then he offers up that dream. We were in his studio and we were wired up with the brain wave  and body metrics  and we had these two little buttons that we could push to indicate when one of us thought we were in or just had been in a flow state. Three other people in the room were also wired up and also had the button to push, and we wanted to see if we were pushing the button at the same time. And sometimes we were.

	All of that was done. I had had a little bit of gummy something or chocolate, something with THC, maybe a little bit of mushrooms. I was really kind of out of my head, floating a little bit, because I don't do much of that stuff. Then he and [his wife] Natascha invited me up for a vegan meal, and after he invited me to go to the beach house. They warned me that no one gets in the car, his kids don't get in the car with him. He's taking these switchbacks at 60 miles an hour in his Tesla going to Stinson Beach. I get motion-sick real easily, and I'm out of my mind a little bit because I'm floaty, and he starts telling stories. He just loved telling these funny stories from back in the day. So many stories. So that made up for the nausea. And I'm just being a good listener and I'm a little scared. We get to the top of the switchbacks, top of the mountain, he's like, “Oh, I left my laptop back at home.” So then we repeat the whole thing, we get the laptop, we go back. One of the stories was about beating Ramblin' Jack Elliott. I bet he's told it before, but just in case… 


	So he's underage, maybe he's like 17 years old. It's a club where you have to be of drinking age to get in, and he wants to meet Ramblin' Jack Elliott. He goes around the back and there's a ladder where you can climb up to the roof. He's going to sneak in the club, and now he's on the roof and there's a skylight and he's sort of investigating the skylight and he just crashes through all the way, falling down, and landing on a couch, which happens to be the green room, where he's sitting next to Ramblin' Jack Elliott. And he says, “Oh hi, I'm Bobby.” And from that point on, they're best friends for the rest of their lives. Those kinds of stories are priceless. And I don't care if I'm a little nauseous and a little scared and a little floaty.


	He believed that digital music was ruining music, that it was unlistenable and made it so people couldn't discover as many kinds of music. So in his little lair there, he had this tube stereo, turntable, speakers, and a big, huge daybed for listening to music. He put on some records, a country singer I had never heard of. It was a whole different experience listening to all that analog sound. Then he had all these guitars sprinkled about, and he was able to just work on his next album all by himself with this little recording station and some effects pedals and wireless thing on his guitar. He was like a one-man show. He could cook what he needed. I mean, being that level of rock star, you could easily have some chefs around, but he didn't need any of it. He didn't have a trainer, at that moment anyway. He didn't have a chef and he didn't have someone recording him for his album. He was very excited to show it off, how he could do it all by himself. My daughter and I went back to the beach house to visit him last year, which would've been two years later, and he was still working on the same album.

	











	Our relationship was incredibly special, because I was a huge fan. There's some friends that preferred the Jerry Garcia-written songs. I leaned toward the Bobby ones. I really liked the way he delivered a song, and he talked about that. In groups of people, a bunch of people that are doing a gig together, he would stop them and he would say, “Look, the singing is the face of the song. Everything serves that.” And he really delivered a story with his voice, and it's so inspiring. I know he told Trey [Anastasio] when they were reviewing every Grateful Dead song ever before the Fare Thee Well concerts, they spent a week in their pajamas in that beach house, and he told Trey, “I know that we're known for our jamming and everything, but really it's mostly about the soulfulness of these songs.”


	I was with the Rhythm Devils with Grateful Dead drummers, and all the other people playing at this festival, maybe Gathering of the Vibes. Bobby was there with one of his bands, maybe RatDog. The way that it worked is there were two stages so the bands could go back and forth. Bob had this idea, since I had been singing “The Other One” with that group, a few songs like that — maybe he would sit in with us, and I would sing the first [verse] or two, and their band would start and he would just continue where we left off, and he would sing the next verse with his band.


	We're on the tour bus and we're trying to do a practice of this, and I've got my little practice bass and everyone's looking at me. They're all looking at me, and Bobby's right there, my hero, looking at me, and I can't for the life of me remember, after singing it all tour, the first or second verse to “The Other One.” Like “‘Spanish lady….' What is it?” And Bobby's looking at me with his deadpan face, not offering a smile or “It's funny that you can't remember this.” This is after being a kid and going to see him, and there I am singing it to him and unable to remember more than the first two words. Then to make it more awkward, one of the other singers is Googling for me, and they're like, “Here, I'm finding it online.” And Bobby's just not flinching. He is like, “I'm not going to help him. I'm not going to laugh at him, but I'm not going to help him either. I'm just going to stare at him.” It's so embarrassing, but funny.


	Bob did ask me to be a part of Dead & Co. He gave me a call and he said he has got something going with John Mayer. When he first was calling he had some other ideas, which morphed back to being more normal. He was imagining this show that would start all-acoustic every night, and then would go electric, and then would turn over to rave. Where it was just like beats and Grateful Dead songs, which I've heard people do before. That eventually turned into a [more] normal situation.  I went out for one week of practice, I learned really interesting things from that experience. We were talking about having grooves that are swung and straight, half swung and half straight. And he said, “That's what rock & roll is. Rock means the straight, and roll means the swung.”

	











	Bob wanted to do more and different things. That was cool, but then I started to realize it was going to be a longer-term thing. I had my own album and I was making a Phish album, and they were starting to talk about doing some writing and making an album, too. I started to realize that getting to play with my heroes here is not going to match seeing through my own album.


	Bob was one of the few guests Phish has had onstage. We had already played with Phil Lesh at Shoreline the year earlier. I remember I got this feeling from the band, or a message from the rest of Phish, that we weren't going to have him play, because we just don't have guests. As legendary as they are, it changes the flow that we get into. And so he called and he said, “Well, I'm just going to get a ride in. My driver will bring me in and I'm just going to bring a little amp and guitar, and what time is soundcheck?” It's like, “Well,” I said, “I'm not really sure if the guys want to have any guests, but this sound check's at 3:30.” And then more talking backstage of, “I don't know. He's great, but we don't really have guests and there's a reason for that. It's really hard and tender to get our flow going that we have.” And Page [McConnell]is sitting backstage with him in one of the dressing rooms explaining that. And he's like, “That's OK.” And I ran into Trey outside of the dressing room and he's like, “Oh, my God, I just talked to him. He's friggin Bob Weir.” So I went back and so they figured it all out. I got to choose the songs. I remember there was “El Paso” and we did “West L.A. Fadeaway,” and then he played on “Chalkdust Torture.” He was nervous about that, like he didn't really want to do it because he didn't know it so well. It's fast and frenetic and he's slow sometimes. The guys, Jon Fishman describes it as the best sit-in ever. That even though he was a fish out of water, that he went for it. He just dug his soul into it and raged in the situation, even being out of his comfort zone.

	Bob was so mysterious. I just thought it was incredible the way his rhythm guitar playing ebbed and flowed. When people heard Jerry Garcia's guitar playing, it sounds like a bird fluttering. It's so humble and so beautiful. With Bob, it's not so obvious because it just swims inside the music. That's, for me, what's so incredible about it. If the playing was more predictable, it wouldn't have been so enchanting in terms of his playing. With the singing, I feel the same way. I feel like he sings in this sort of almost like a plain voice, and he cuts off the words at the end of the phrase. But his range is incredible — his vocal range, but also his emotional range.

	











	For me, it was kind of like Jerry Garcia was like a grandfather when he was young. He's like this kind of Santa Claus type, or even almost a feminine kind of energy. Nurturing. Bob was the opposite. This sort of punk kid with an almost plain-sounding voice trying to just go for it. I loved that juxtaposition. I don't think, for me, it could have worked without Bob's contribution of just that, almost like a kid or a wannabe cowboy wanting to be on this adventure. He went on so many adventures in life, and I just think he totally succeeded.

﻿

Lara Trump revealed her father-in-law President Donald Trump has a speech he's ready to give at the “right time” on extraterrestrial life.

Trump shared that intel during a podcast interview with New York Post reporter Miranda Devine on Wednesday, less than a week after ex-President Barack Obama caused a stir when he said UFOs are “real.” Based on what Lara Trump said, the commander-in-chief is itching to make his own big announcements on aliens too.

“Do you think he's about to make an announcement on UFOs? Because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president.

“What's funny is, we've kind of asked my father-in-law about this because we're like, ‘Well, what do you know?' Miranda, we all want to know!” Trump said. “And he played a little coy with us. and so that of course led us to believe — Eric [Trump] and I were like ‘Oh my gosh, if he won't even like fully tell us, maybe there's more to it.'”

She continued:

And then I have just heard just kind of around — I think he's actually said it, I think my father-in-law actually said it — that there is some speech that I guess at the right time, and I don't know when the right time is, he's gonna break out and talk about [it]. And it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak.

Trump said on a personal level she believes it would be “pretty wild” if humans were the only living creatures, considering the “vastness” of the universe. She also told Devine that the president has talked “a little different” about the topic of UFOs than others, which leads her to believe there's more President Trump knows about it than he's letting on.

“I don't have any information, I feel like there might be information out there, and hopefully it's going to be able to be told to us very soon, we'll see,” Lara Trump added.

Her answer comes after Obama said last weekend that ETs aren't just Stephen Spielberg characters.

“They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,” Obama told progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen.

“There's no underground facility,” he continued, adding, “unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States.”

That got a fair amount of attention on X and elsewhere online.  And the topic of aliens has been in the news more in recent years, even before Obama and Lara Trump spoke out.

Retired Maj. David Grusch told the House Oversight Committee's national security subcommittee in 2023 “that he had been denied access to some government UFO programs but that he knows the ‘exact locations' of UAPs in U.S. possession,” NPR reported. 

“Grusch also alleged that the U.S. has retrieved ‘non-human' biological matter from the pilots of the crafts,” the report said.

And just last summer, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) told Joe Rogan that she has seen evidence of “interdimensional beings.”

This new show falls under Federle's recently-renewed deal with Disney Branded Television. He is also executive producing the live-action comedy series “Vampirina: Teenage Vampire,” which premieres on Sept. 12 on Disney Channel.

“Coven Academy” stars Malina Pauli Weissman (“A Series of Unfortunate Events”) as Briar, Malachi Barton (“ZOMBIES 4: Dawn of the Vampires”) as Jake, Jordan Leftwich (“Family Switch”) as Sasha, Ora Duplass (“Their Town”) as Tegan, Louis Thresher (“Boarders”) as Ollie and Tiffani Thiessen (“Saved by the Bell,” “90210”) as Miss Graves.

Prime Minister Mark Carney and MP Matt Jeneroux in Edmonton on Wednesday after Mr. Jeneroux joined the Liberal caucus.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

Alberta MP Matt Jeneroux is joining the Liberal caucus, the third Conservative MP to break with his party in a move that brings the Carney government on the cusp of a majority.

Speculation that Mr. Jeneroux was joining the Liberals first surfaced last year, prompting him to announce that instead, he had decided to leave politics altogether. 

But on Wednesday, he reversed course, saying he had reflected on the gravity of the moment Canada is facing.

Sitting next to Prime Minister Mark Carney in Edmonton – Mr. Jeneroux represents Edmonton Riverbend – he linked his decision to the Prime Minister's recent speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 

In the speech, Mr. Carney spoke of a rupture to global relations, and urged middle powers to build coalitions in order to survive in an era where great powers have turned into predators. 

“And I think for me, that's where a lot of the world changed. I think it opened a lot [of] eyes for Canadians, Albertans, Edmontonians,” Mr. Jeneroux said, adding that he felt it was “quite simply wrong to be sitting on the sidelines anymore so I reached out to the Prime Minister's Office.”

Andrew Coyne: The post-Poilievre leadership race has begun

Mr. Jeneroux was first elected in 2015. He won his seat in the 2025 election with 50.2 per cent of the vote. 

His decision gives the Liberals a third seat in Alberta, and 169 seats in the House of Commons. 

Though there are 343 seats overall, three are currently vacant. 

Two – the ridings formerly represented by Chrystia Freeland and Bill Blair – are considered safe Liberal seats. 

A third is the Quebec riding of Terrebonne, where the Supreme Court recently annulled the 2025 election result. The Liberals won the seat by one vote. 

If the Liberals hold all three seats in the eventual by-elections, they will have a majority government. 

Mr. Carney first announced Mr. Jeneroux's move in a statement on social media Wednesday morning. 

“Building a stronger, more resilient, and more independent country will require ambition, collaboration, and occasionally, sacrifice,” Mr. Carney said. 

“I am grateful to Matt and his family that he will continue his service as a strong voice for Edmonton Riverbend in Parliament.”

I am honoured to welcome Matt Jeneroux to our caucus as the newest member of Canada's new government. Building a stronger, more resilient, and more independent country will require ambition, collaboration, and occasionally, sacrifice. I am grateful to Matt and his family that…

Mr. Carney and Mr. Jeneroux's meeting in Edmonton Wednesday was added to the prime minister's public agenda minutes after the announcement. 

Mr. Carney has also has appointed him as a “special adviser on economic and security partnerships.”

At the meeting, Mr. Carney spoke of Mr. Jeneroux's work on international relations, including his role on parliamentary associations linked Canada with other countries, and said the MP had direct relationships with other global lawmakers. 

He said Mr. Jeneroux's ties will key to putting trade deals into action. 

Neither man took questions.

Mr. Jeneroux had said in November he intended to resign his seat in the new year. In the months since, however, he remained in contact with Liberals who continued to try and get him to cross the floor, three sources told The Globe and Mail.

The Globe is not identifying the sources as they were not authorized to discuss negotiations.

At the time of his November announcement, Mr. Jeneroux also moved to tamp down speculation he was being bullied by fellow Conservatives to remain on their side. 

He said his decision was motivated by a desire to spend more time with family, and said he wished party leader Pierre Poilievre all the best. 

Mr. Poilievre also had kind words for the long-time MP, but on Wednesday took a different approach. 

“Mark Carney is trying to seize a costly Liberal majority government that Canadians voted against in the last election through dirty backroom deals,” he said in a statement.

“Matt Jeneroux has betrayed the people of Edmonton Riverbend who voted for affordable food and homes, safe streets, and a strong resource sector. Conservatives will continue our fight for a Canada that's affordable, safe, and self-reliant.”

Mr. Poilievre has also framed the departures of two other MPs as betrayals. Nova Scotia's Chris d'Entremont crossed the floor in November, and Ontario's Michael Ma joined the government in December. 

Mr. Jeneroux did not attend the Conservative Party's recent convention in Calgary, where delegates voted 87.4 per cent in favour of Mr. Poilievre remaining on as leader. 

But Mr. Jeneroux's choice is the latest challenge to Mr. Poilievre's control over his caucus. On Tuesday, he was forced to distance himself from MP Jamil Jivani's remarks on Canada-U.S. relations. 

Last week, one of his other MPs, Mike Dawson, sparked an internal fight by declaring he didn't want to accept the scheduled pay raise for MPs. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney says Edmonton MP Matt Jeneroux has crossed the floor and joined the Liberal caucus. He is the third Conservative to join the government in recent months.

Mr Kennedy posted the 90-second clip, which shows him working out with Kid Rock, the musician, on social media on Tuesday.

The 72-year-old, who has declared that his mission is to “Make America Healthy Again”, said he wanted to “deliver two simple messages to the American people: get active [and] eat real food”.

The clip is set to Kid Rock's “Bawitdaba”, the rap-metal song which the musician once claimed “makes people want to drink whisky and throw things”.

Mr Kennedy has often been filmed exercising in jeans, and in the video he keeps them on even while submerging himself in what appears to be an ice bath and jumping into a swimming pool.

The “Rock Out Work Out” clip begins with the two men posing by a stuffed bear.

They lift weights in a gym, and Mr Kennedy is shown holding down Kid Rock's feet as he does sit-ups.

The health secretary strips off his shirt and pedals on an exercise bike while Kid Rock does press-ups in what looks like a sauna.

When they swap, Kid Rock, who embraced a hard-drinking, hard-partying image before finding religion, flicks a middle finger to the camera as he pedals.

While Mr Kennedy submerses himself in the ice bath, the musician is seen relaxing in a swimming pool.

The health secretary goes to find him and, suddenly wearing a shirt, shakes his head in disapproval while Kid Rock flexes his biceps.

The final shots in the video show the pair playing paddleball, and relaxing in the pool together drinking glasses of whole milk.

Donald Trump, the US president, signed legislation in January allowing schools to serve students whole milk, relaxing restrictions brought in by Barack Obama.

The Trump administration declared “whole milk is back” on social media, and the department of agriculture posted the hashtag “#DrinkWholeMilk.”

Mr Kennedy applauded the move at the time, calling it “exactly the kind of practical change that will Make America Healthy Again”.

Oil prices rose more than 4% on Wednesday, after Vice President JD Vance said Iran did not address U.S. red lines in nuclear talks this week and President Donald Trump reserves the right to use military force.

U.S. crude oil rose $2.86, or 4.59%, to close at $65.19 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent was up $2.93, or 4.35%, to settle at $70.35 per barrel. 

U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held nuclear talks with Iran in Geneva on Tuesday. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, described the discussions as ""constructive,"" according to Iranian media.  Araghchi said the talks yielded a general agreement on guiding principles.

Oil prices closed lower Tuesday as traders interpreted the foreign minister's comments as a sign that the U.S. and Iran could still reach a settlement. 

But Vance said Tehran had failed to address core U.S. demands. 

""In some ways it went well, they agreed to meet afterwards,"" the vice president told Fox News on Tuesday evening. ""But in other ways it is very clear that the president has set some red lines that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through.""

Trump reserves the right to use force if diplomacy does not succeed in stopping Iran's nuclear program, Vance said. ""We do have a very powerful military — the president has shown a willingness to use it,"" the vice president told Fox News. 

Sources told Axios, meanwhile, that a U.S. military campaign against Iran would likely be massive, last weeks and look more like a full-fledged war than the raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in January. 

Iran's Revolutionary Guard conducted war games this week in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital trade choke point for global oil flows. About one-third of all waterborne crude exports pass through the narrow waterway, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. 

The market is worried those oil flows would be disrupted if the U.S. and Iran go to war. Iranian state media said traffic in part of the strait was closed Tuesday due to the military exercises. 

Kpler did not observe any halt in traffic in the strait on Tuesday, said Matt Smith, an oil analyst at the firm.

Trump has stationed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Middle East. The USS Gerald Ford is en route to the region.

Trump said Friday he deployed the second aircraft carrier in case negotiations fail. ""If we don't have a deal, we'll need it,"" the president told reporters outside the White House. 

The Iranian government did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

FDA agrees to review Moderna mRNA flu vaccine in dramatic reversal

After initially rejecting Moderna's application for review, the FDA will now consider the company's mRNA flu shot

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will review a messenger RNA (mRNA) flu vaccine for approval, according to its maker, Moderna. The decision is a dramatic U-turn for the agency, which, only about a week ago, had publicly rejected Moderna's application to get the shot reviewed.

When it initially rejected the application, the FDA had said Moderna's clinical trials were lacking. On Wednesday, Moderna said it had made modifications to its application. While the reversal has been welcomed by the vaccine maker and public health experts alike, the incident has been the latest instance of the Trump administration undermining vaccine science. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whose department has jurisdiction over the FDA, is a noted vaccine skeptic who has repeatedly criticized mRNA COVID vaccines.

HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that the FDA had held discussions with the company, leading to “a revised regulatory approach and an amended application, which FDA accepted.”

“FDA will maintain its high standards during review and potential licensure stages as it does with all products,” Nixon said.

William Schaffner, an infectious disease physician and a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says the FDA's decision to backtrack is “good news.”

“It is important to give all candidate new vaccines a fair equitable assessment. This is especially true for new mRNA-based vaccines as this technology currently is being applied to create vaccines against a variety of illnesses, including cancers,"" he says.

Modern's mRNA flu shot is based on the same technology as its COVID vaccine. The mRNA COVID shots have been credited with saving millions of lives. “With these mRNA vaccines, the benefits outweigh the risk,” says Angie Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.

In these kinds of shots, mRNA—essentially the instruction manual for genes to make proteins—is injected into the body, where it teaches cells to recognize and attack viral proteins. Vaccines that use mRNA are attractive prospects for protecting against flu and a host of other diseases, including cancer. They are easy to manufacture quickly and highly flexible, meaning new vaccines can be made rapidly to respond to emerging viral variants.

Having such a vaccine available for flu would “potentially be a major step forward in efforts to protect the health of individuals from severe influenza,” says Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

AI optimists envision a future where artificial general intelligence (AGI) surpasses human intelligence, but the path remains riddled with scientific and logistical hurdles.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Once upon a time, the world seemed like it was made of larger building blocks. Rain fell from what looked like opaque, puffy masses that also blocked the Sun. The human body seemed self-contained and solid, and there wasn't a way to prove otherwise. Even when alchemists were melting pieces of ore, they thought mercury must be related to silver. How could it not be? They looked the same, after all.

We know that the universe itself moves toward disorder, but our knowledge of the universe moves toward the minuscule. Higher resolutions, more powerful zoom, electron microscopes, particle accelerators, nuclear energy. For technology, powering these levels of detail has fallen into the broad purview of computer chips—and computer chips have also gotten higher-resolution, in a sense.

On a basic level, computers use circuitry—carefully mapped series of connections between different conductive or semiconductive parts—to do tons of arithmetic. Early punchcards (predecessors to the chips we have now) had openings so that portions of circuitry could literally form a connection, like playing certain notes on the piano using certain fingers, or connecting phone lines on an old switchboard. But our knowledge of electronics has grown so minuscule that it's almost hard to fathom.

In the 1960s, in the midst of a global semiconductor boom, engineer Gordon Moore gave a presentation in which he made an observation. Moore was a cofounder of computer chip pioneer Intel, and it was there that he noticed that transistors—switches used to direct the current within electrical devices—were shrinking at a pretty consistent rate. This led to the 1958 invention of the integrated circuit, which could be installed in devices that were previously built one transistor at a time.

Moore showed a now-iconic graph of the number of components on an integrated circuit over time, which predicted an overall rate of growth of doubling about every two years between 1962 and his extrapolated 1970. In the accompanying lecture, he suggested this trend could actually last for the next ten years (until 1975). But Moore's Law, as it was later called, has held for decades past this initial forecast. It's been taught as canon in computer science programs around the world (even though it has never been, nor was it ever intended to be, a hard and fast rule).

But for the last several years, those in the computing industry (and those who study it) have started to discuss the “end of Moore's Law.” There's a point at which transistors simply can't get any smaller because of the basics of physics itself—these tiny transistors must still be able to communicate with the rest of what's required to build an integrated circuit, be widely manufacturable, and stay cost effective.

The slowdown of Moore's Law has been notable for a while. From MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL):

But that reality, and the reality of physics itself, is somewhat at odds with the widely promoted corporate technologies of 2026. Companies like OpenAI make opaque promises about how generative AI will change all of our lives, save us hours a week, and make many sectors of human labor obsolete. Venture capitalists have leveraged these promises to attract investors, while companies like Microsoft have started to require their employees to use generative AI in the workplace.

You can counter the slowing shrinkage of transistor design by simply making larger and larger computers. Manufacturers and generative AI companies are already doing this. They're also designing all other elements of these machines to be as efficient as possible. But that's not a long-term solution to the growing demand for this amount of computing. Like leadership of the late Roman Empire or the icing on a dry cake, our computing components can't be spread too thin.

However, if you don't like the idea of a limit on computing, you can turn to futurism, longtermism, or “AI optimism,” depending on your favorite flavor. People in these camps believe in developing AI as fast as possible so we can (they claim) keep guardrails in place that will prevent AI from going rogue or becoming evil.

The goal of these AI boosters is known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. They theorize, or even hope for, an AI so powerful that it thinks like... well... a human mind whose ability is enhanced by a billion computers. If someone ever does develop an AGI that surpasses human intelligence, that moment is known as the AI singularity. (There are other, unrelated singularities in physics.) AI optimists want to accelerate the singularity and usher in this “godlike” AGI.

One of the key facts of computer logic is that, if you can slow the processes down enough and look at it in enough detail, you can track and predict every single thing that a program will do. Algorithms (and not the opaque AI kind) guide everything within a computer. Over the decades, experts have written the exact ways information can be sent, one bit—one minuscule electrical zap—at a time through a central processing unit (CPU).

From there, those bits are assembled into a slightly more concrete format as another type of code. That code becomes another layer, and another, until a solitaire game or streaming video or Microsoft Word document comes out. Networks work the same way, with your video or document broken into pieces, then broken down further and further until tiny packets of data can be carted back and forth as electrical zaps over lengths of wire.

The human brain is, in some ways, another piece of electrical machinery. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) quantifies it as an exaflop caliber computer: “a billion-billion (1 followed by 18 zeros) mathematical operations per second—with just 20 watts of power.” By this standard, you power dozens of human brains by plugging them into a single U.S. household outlet. NIST cites the world-class Oak Ridge Frontier supercomputer as requiring “a million times more power” to do the same level of computing.

It's possible that the human brain is also predictable when you understand all of its parts and influences enough. But our brains have little in common with the abstracted, mathematical way our computers are designed. The earliest computers were mechanical, with physical parts that visibly connected with and moved each other. And despite an iconic, massively influential paper stating otherwise, the cell is not like a machine. (Mitochondria, you can still be the “powerhouse!”)

The California Institute of Technology, Caltech, has a primer on how the brain works:

There are countless ways the human brain could be boosted or hindered by factors we can't even measure yet. We don't even know why many common antidepressants and other medications work in the brain—just that they do. We can't predict when a particular turn of phrase or “certain slant of light“ will remind us of childhood, a popular TV show, what we had for dinner the other day, or a pair of shoes we used to wear. We are many years away from a diagrammatic understanding of the brain the way we understand manufactured computer parts.

Because of that gap in understanding, there's no guarantee that a certain amount of computing power comparable to a human brain (or even a million human brains) would become sentient or have consciousness. That seems especially true when aspiring “AI caretaker” engineers want their AIs to know everything from all of human history.

But let's say that efficiency or quantity of information isn't an issue. Let's say we can build one-million-exaflop computers to run advanced AIs that will mimic human think tanks. How does the end of Moore's Law affect scientists who work toward that technological singularity?

The answer is simple: size. That's both the size of electrical energy required and the physical size associated with storage, processing, cooling, and everything else required to keep a computer running. There are a few directions we could go to solve the size problem, but none of them are easy to achieve.AI boosters push nuclear fusion (another technology that is still far away) as a cure-all for the energy problems associated with large AI computing. But no one knows for sure when (or if) nuclear fusion will produce more energy than what is required to run nuclear fusion facilities. That has not happened yet. It will not happen for years and years.

There's also space-based possibilities. The Kardashev scale is a thought exercise about Solar System- or galaxy-scale civilizations. As humankind advances, the next step on the Kardashev scale would be for us to start to turn entire planets into data farms or harvest the energy of entire stars using Dyson spheres. But while Moore's Law was a forecast based on expertise in both technology and global supply chains, the Kardashev scale and Dyson spheres are thought exercises with no real-life analog at all. They are science fiction dreams.

On a more grounded level, quantum computing has been touted as an advance toward the realm of AI, ultimately leading into the singularity. But quantum computing is in its infancy, to say the least. It currently requires extreme cooling unlike anything in today's traditional computer realm. There is no usable consumer version of a quantum computer, and we're not even close to one. They must be painstakingly assembled by hand by engineers and physicists with things like atomic tweezers.

All of that means we have a lot of options that are at least 10 years away—or even as much as 100 or 1,000 years away. Venture capitalists today are selling a vision of the future. Today, there is no nuclear fusion energy, there is no efficient quantum computing, and there is no Dyson sphere.

“In this head the all-baffling brain,In it and below it the makings of heroes.”—Walt Whitman

In the huge field of artificial intelligence, there are countless ways to define and work toward goals like finding new prescription drugs or faraway galaxies. AGI is a separate, specific idea, but even within that there are variations. The public discourse has grown very muddled because of the ambiguity of terms like “artificial intelligence” outside of their intended engineering contexts.

I personally believe that AGI is very far away—though some very smart people, like Google DeepMind and Imperial College London computer scientist Murray Shanahan, believe it's closer than I think. (Shanahan's book for MIT Press about the technological singularity is a great introduction.)

Then there's OpenAI's Sam Altman, who has suggested a Dyson Sphere that encloses our Solar System, for example, as a back-of-the-napkin solution to the rising energy costs of AI. In 2019, over 750 million people on Earth still didn't have access to electricity, an additional over 400 million aren't able to use local available electricity, and both numbers are subject to stagnation or even worsening in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

A Dyson sphere is a science fiction invention with no stable version anywhere near Earth or our stellar neighborhood. We would need to drain the entire Solar System (and more!) of certain elements to even build what Altman suggests. While Moore's Law is real, many factors of the singularity are not—at least, not this decade. Climate change and the global energy crisis, though, are very, very real.

A lot of claims of “artificial intelligence” come down to highly developed algorithms combined with the ability of computers to test millions or billions of configurations at a time. This is one of its best use cases, because the human mind is just not good at this kind of work. The same way we can look around a room and categorize and remember many details at a glance, computers can plug away at enormous lists of ingredients without missing a beat or losing their place.

In 2024, Oregon State University chemist Mas Subramanian (the creator of the novel pigment YInMn Blue) told Popular Mechanics that algorithms to discover new molecules are difficult to work with because of factors that the public doesn't really understand. It's just not that easy to find a new pigment, for example—YInMn blue has an unusual crystal structure. The chemical reaction that makes the color is found in a bipyramidal shape, Subramanian explains, rather than a tetrahedral or octohedral network. (Bipyramidal is like two tetrahedrons, or “D4” shapes, glued together. The octohedron has eight faces in a different form.)

As a layperson, it's hard to understand how crystal structures like this can make a huge difference in the outcome of a substance. But take carbon, for example. Graphite and diamond are different crystalline forms of the same element.

That need for context is a major limitation of algorithms as we know them. Machine learning might tell you to put diamond in your innovative new pencil or graphite in your engagement ring.

So, Subramanian explains, the machine learning algorithm suggests a long list that must be vetted by a human, and many suggestions don't work in real life right off the bat. And because these models are trained on what already exists, they can't innovate, in the most literal sense. “The breakthrough discovery comes from unknowns,” Subramanian said. “If you don't have that in the starting point, how will you predict?”

The end of Moore's Law as an engineering benchmark is as helpful to us today as Moore's original presentation was in the 1960s. Concrete observations based on data and logistics can help manufacturers around the world adjust their planned products, research and development, and even marketing. Indeed, as the transistor industry approaches the limits of physics itself, they highlight a gap we're about to encounter as the human species—there is nothing that can start to replace and surpass our existing computer paradigm in the near future.

Today, people like Altman will tell you they're selling you the building blocks of the singularity. But as the people of Gary, Indiana, found out in The Music Man, someone selling you your first trombone shouldn't tell you it comes with a first-chair position in the New York Philharmonic. The landmarks of expert-level artificial intelligence studies don't sound like sales pitches or soundbytes—they sound more like Shanahan's clarifying note, written after he used some imprecise language in a paper that escaped containment and entered the mainstream press:

Indeed, in a context where large language models (LLMs) are used to “summarize,” Shanahan's care means a great deal. His precision and corrections give others in his field somewhere to start—whether they agree or disagree with his positions. He concludes: “The aim, rather, was to remind readers of how unlike humans LLM-based systems are, how very differently they operate at a fundamental, mechanistic level, and to urge caution when using anthropomorphic language to talk about them.”

It's very different than Altman's public comment that he might need to Dyson-Shere the entire Solar System. The point stands: we don't even know how we'd build a computer big enough to need it.

Feed algorithms are widely suspected to influence political attitudes. However, previous evidence from switching off the algorithm on Meta platforms found no political effects1. Here we present results from a 2023 field experiment on Elon Musk's platform X shedding light on this puzzle. We assigned active US-based users randomly to either an algorithmic or a chronological feed for 7 weeks, measuring political attitudes and online behaviour. Switching from a chronological to an algorithmic feed increased engagement and shifted political opinion towards more conservative positions, particularly regarding policy priorities, perceptions of criminal investigations into Donald Trump and views on the war in Ukraine. In contrast, switching from the algorithmic to the chronological feed had no comparable effects. Neither switching the algorithm on nor switching it off significantly affected affective polarization or self-reported partisanship. To investigate the mechanism, we analysed users' feed content and behaviour. We found that the algorithm promotes conservative content and demotes posts by traditional media. Exposure to algorithmic content leads users to follow conservative political activist accounts, which they continue to follow even after switching off the algorithm, helping explain the asymmetry in effects. These results suggest that initial exposure to X's algorithm has persistent effects on users' current political attitudes and account-following behaviour, even in the absence of a detectable effect on partisanship.

Social media platforms have fundamentally transformed human lives: a large and growing share of the global population connects with others, gets entertained and learns about the world through social media2. These platforms have also become increasingly important for political news consumption. A quarter of US adults report social media as their primary news source, and one half say they at least sometimes get news from these platforms3. Typically, platforms use feed algorithms to select and order content in personalized feeds for each user4. Before algorithms were introduced, users saw a simple chronological feed that displayed posts from followed accounts, with the most recent posts appearing at the top.

Public intellectuals and scholars have raised concerns about the potential adverse effects of social media, particularly feed algorithms, on social cohesion, trust and democracy5,6,7,8. These concerns arise from the spread of misinformation9,10,11, the promotion of toxic and inflammatory content12,13,14 and the creation of ‘filter bubbles' with increasingly polarized content15,16,17,18. There is substantial rigorous quantitative evidence that internet access and social media indeed have important negative effects19,20,21,22. Research on search engine rankings also shows that the order in which information is presented can influence user behaviour and political beliefs23. However, previous literature on the effects of social media feed algorithms reports zero political effects. A large study of Facebook and Instagram, conducted by academics in cooperation with Meta during the 2020 US election, found that experimentally replacing the algorithmically curated feed with a chronological feed did not lead to any detectable effects on users' polarization or political attitudes, despite causing a substantial change in political content and lowering user engagement with the platforms1. Similarly, studies on Google's search engine and YouTube algorithms found little evidence of filter bubbles24,25,26,27. Studies of Meta platforms linking content to user behaviour and attitudes also found no impact, despite prevalent like-minded content and amplified political news28,29,30.

Yet, the fact that switching off a feed algorithm does not affect users' political attitudes does not mean that algorithms have no political impact. If the initial exposure to the algorithm has a persistent effect on political outcomes, switching off the algorithm might show no effects despite its importance. For instance, this could happen because people start following accounts suggested by the algorithm and continue following them when the algorithm is switched off. In addition, different platforms may have different effects, for instance, due to different informational environments or the different objectives of their owners31,32,33,34.

We study the effects of X's feed algorithm and find that switching the algorithm on substantially shifts attitudes on policies and current political news towards more conservative opinions without significantly affecting polarization or partisanship. We conducted a randomized experiment involving actual X users in the United States over a 7-week period in the summer of 2023.

Our study departs from the previous literature in several ways. First, we leverage the feature on X that allowed users in 2023 to choose between a chronological feed (the ‘Following' tab) and an algorithmic feed (the ‘For you' tab), where content was both added (showing posts from accounts not followed by the user) and reordered (prioritizing some posts while hiding others), compared with the chronological feed setting (as confirmed by our data). This feature enabled us to conduct two experiments simultaneously: examining the effects of switching the feed algorithm on for users who previously used the chronological feed and of turning it off for those who were on the algorithmic feed before the experiment.

Second, this feature allowed us to conduct the experiment independently, without cooperation from X. Hence, we avoid potential concerns specific to studies conducted in partnership with platforms35,36. Recently, another independent study used a browser extension to show that re-ranking content within X's algorithmic feed by moving up or down posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity influenced affective polarization37. In contrast, we randomize users' exposure to X's algorithmic feed as designed and implemented by X or to a chronological feed. We then quantify which posts the algorithm promotes and demotes, estimate its causal effects on users' attitudes and behaviour, and leverage behavioural responses to provide evidence on the mechanism.

Finally, in addition to affective polarization and partisanship, we also study outcomes such as policy priorities and attitudes towards current political events, which may be less rigid and, therefore, more easily influenced by exposure to different social media content.

Our experiment took place more than 6 months after Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, a few months following the publication of the platform's source code and shortly after Linda Yaccarino assumed the role of CEO, yet about 1 year before Musk's public endorsement of Donald Trump in July 2024. An earlier study examined changes in the content of users' feeds on Twitter, when the platform introduced the feed algorithm in 2016, well before Musk's takeover, and found that the algorithm already prioritized right-wing content38, despite different platform ownership. In addition to content analysis, our study focuses on the effects on real users' behaviour and political attitudes38.

We conducted an experiment with X users during July and September of 2023. This research resulted from a collaboration of academics independent of X. We obtained ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland (see Supplementary Information section 1.1 for a detailed discussion of ethical considerations and the measures we implemented to uphold ethical integrity). We pre-registered the experiment with the American Economic Association's registry for randomized controlled trials (AEARCTR-0011464).

The experiment had several phases: recruitment, a pre-treatment survey (collecting baseline characteristics), randomization into feed settings, a treatment phase (with participants using their assigned feed setting) and a post-treatment survey to gather self-reported outcomes. We also collected data on the content of users' feeds and data on users' online behaviour. Participants were recruited through the survey company YouGov, drawing from US-based registered members of the YouGov panel. Participation was voluntary and compensated.

YouGov contacted 13,265 participants to enter the pre-treatment survey. Of these, 3,434 were screened out as they were not active X users. By design, we only admitted participants who self-reported being active on X at least ‘several times a month'. A total of 8,363 participants provided informed consent and 6,043 completed the entire pre-treatment survey. During the survey, each participant was assigned randomly to a feed setting, which they were paid to stay on until completing the post-treatment survey. Admission to the pre-treatment survey occurred on a rolling basis in July 2023. At the end of August 2023, all participants were invited for the post-treatment survey, completed by the third week of September. The treatment phase duration varied slightly among participants, with the average time between entering and leaving the study being 7 weeks and 1 day, with s.d. of 3 days. During the treatment phase, participants received two reminders to stick to their assigned feed setting. A total of 4,965 participants completed the post-treatment survey, forming our main sample. Extended Data Fig. 1 presents the flowchart for the experiment, describing its structure and sample size at each stage. Supplementary Information sections 1.2–1.8 provide further details about the structure of the experiment, all collected data, compliance and attrition at each stage.

In the pre-treatment survey, we inquired about which feed setting the participants used before the experiment. Initially, 76% of participants were using the algorithmic feed, the default on X; and 24% were using the chronological feed. For the duration of the study, participants were assigned randomly with equal probability to either the algorithmic or the chronological feed.

The pre-treatment survey included questions about X usage, including purpose and frequency, as well as questions on life satisfaction, partisanship and feeling thermometers for Democrats and Republicans, which we use to calculate affective polarization. YouGov provided data on participants' socio-economic backgrounds. All pre-treatment characteristics were fully balanced, except for a slight imbalance in the initial feed setting. The share of participants initially on the algorithmic feed setting was two percentage points higher among those assigned randomly to the algorithmic feed (77% versus 75%; two-sided t-test: P = 0.08; Supplementary Information section 1.7). In our analysis, we always control for the initial feed setting. Participants who had to switch their settings in either direction as a result of the experiment were more likely to drop out (22.7% versus 20.9%; two-sided t-test: P = 0.077). As demonstrated in Methods, selective attrition during the treatment phase does not drive our results.

In the post-treatment survey, we collected several groups of outcomes. First, we repeated questions about X usage, partisanship, affective polarization and life satisfaction. Furthermore, we asked participants to rank policy areas by priority and to express their views on current political events, specifically their assessments of the criminal investigations into Donald Trump and the war in Ukraine, using a series of questions. For the baseline analysis, we aggregate these outcomes into seven composite measures by topic: user engagement, partisanship and affective polarization, conservative policy priorities, belief that the investigations into Trump are unacceptable, pro-Kremlin attitudes towards the war in Ukraine and life dissatisfaction. We also construct an overall measure that combines all questions related to policy attitudes and current political news. In the Supplementary Information, we present results for each individual outcome.

At the end of both surveys, we offered participants the option to install and run a Google Chrome extension on their desktop computer for additional compensation. This extension, designed for the experiment, captured the first 100 posts seen under each feed setting and saved them to a file on the participant's device, which they were asked to upload. A total of 784 participants ran the extension at the end of the pre-treatment survey, and 599 did so during the post-treatment survey.

For participants using the Google Chrome extension, we observed their actual X feed setting directly and, hence, their compliance with the assigned setting. The observed compliance rate in this sample was 89.15%. In addition, we asked all participants in the post-treatment survey whether they complied with the assigned feed setting during the study period. The self-reported compliance rate, that is, the share responding that they complied most of the time or always with the assigned setting, was 85.38% in the full sample (Extended Data Fig. 2).

We asked participants whether they agreed to share their X handles with us and grant permission to scrape their publicly available data, specifically, the names of the accounts they followed. All participants were informed about the purpose of our use of their X handles, and their decision to participate did not affect their compensation. We scraped the list of accounts followed by 2,387 participants after the post-treatment survey. Supplementary Information section 1.3 describes the construction of all variables and reports summary statistics.

Our experimental design allows us to evaluate the impact of switching the feed algorithm on and off. Intuitively, for respondents who were initially on the chronological feed, we compare the outcomes between those randomized to remain on the chronological feed and those randomized to switch to the algorithmic feed. Similarly, for respondents who were initially on the algorithmic feed, we compare the outcomes between those who remained randomly on the algorithmic feed and those who switched randomly to the chronological one. Our empirical strategy for baseline results is detailed in Methods, which also summarizes our analyses of attrition and compliance (discussed in detail in Supplementary Information section 1.8).

Figure 1 illustrates the main results by summarizing raw data means by treatment status for selected individual outcomes in a series of bar charts (all tests are two-sided, similar graphs for all individual outcomes are presented in Supplementary Information section 2.1). The top row presents data for participants who were initially on the chronological feed. Among these participants, those assigned to switch to the algorithmic feed were 5.2 percentage points less likely to reduce their X usage than those who remained on the chronological feed (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7, 9.7; P = 0.024). They were 4.7 percentage points more likely to prioritize policy issues considered important by Republicans, such as inflation, immigration and crime (95% CI: 0.7, 8.7; P = 0.023). They were also 5.5 percentage points more likely to believe that the investigations into Trump are unacceptable, describing them as contrary to the rule of law, undermining democracy, an attempt to stop the campaign and an attack on people like themselves (95% CI: 0.8, 10.2; P = 0.022). They were 7.4 percentage points less likely to hold a positive view of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (95% CI: 1.8, 13.0; P = 0.009). Finally, they were 3.7 and 2.3 percentage points more likely to follow any conservative account (95% CI: 0.5, 7.0; P = 0.025) and any political activist account (95% CI: −0.1, 4.8; P = 0.061) on X, respectively. The bottom row of Fig. 1 presents the data summaries of the same outcomes for participants who were initially on the algorithmic feed. In sharp contrast to the top row, the outcome means in this group were not significantly affected by treatment assignment. 

Means for selected outcomes by assigned treatment feed in the two samples: top, summarized outcomes for the sample of users initially on the chronological feed; bottom, summarized outcomes for the sample of participants initially on the algorithmic feed. The difference in the height of the two bars in each chart represents the unconditional ITT effect. Error bars, 95% CI for the ITT effect relative to the control mean (Control mean + ITT ± 1.96 × s.e.). The title of each chart presents the treatment-effect magnitude in percentage points (pp) and its P value (all tests are two-sided). The unit of observation is respondent. Sample sizes for each subgroup are reported below the bars. All outcomes are indicator variables except ‘Shares Republican priorities', for which the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum are: 0, 0, 0.33, 0.67, 1 for initial-Chronological to Chronological subsample; 0, 0, 0.33, 0.67, 1 for initial-Chronological to Algorithmic; 0, 0, 0.33, 0.67, 1 for initial-Algorithmic to Algorithmic; and 0, 0.33, 0.33, 0.67, 1 for initial-Algorithmic to Chronological. Supplementary Information section 2.1 presents similar bar charts for all individual outcome variables. Supplementary Information section 2.4 presents regression results for all outcome variables.

Regression results using aggregate outcomes are presented in Fig. 2, which displays the results of regression analysis for the composite survey outcomes. Average intention-to-treat (ITT) effects are reported (Methods). On the left, we show the standardized effects of switching the algorithm on for participants initially using the chronological feed; on the right are shown the effects of switching it off for those initially using the algorithmic feed. For each outcome, we report two sets of regression estimates: unconditional, controlling only for the initial feed setting and the pre-treatment value of the outcome variable when available; and conditional, controlling for all collected pre-treatment covariates, with the specification chosen using generalized random forests (GRFs)39.

ITT effect estimates of switching the algorithm on and off (in s.d.). Left, effect of moving from the chronological to the algorithmic feed for users initially on the chronological feed. Right, effect of moving in the opposite direction for users initially on the algorithmic feed. For each outcome, the results of two specifications are reported. Blue, unconditional estimates with robust s.e., controlling only for the initial feed setting and, where applicable, pre-treatment outcome levels. Orange: conditional estimates, controlling for pre-treatment covariates using GRFs; 90% and 95% CIs are reported. Numerical effect sizes and P values correspond to the conditional estimates (all tests are two-sided). The unit of observation is respondent. From top to bottom, sample sizes are n = 4,965, n = 3,337, n = 4,965, n = 4,965, n = 4,596, n = 4,596 and n = 4,850. Tests are described in Methods. Supplementary Information Table 2.16 reports the exact numerical point estimates, s.e., CIs and sample sizes for every specification. All outcomes are standardized. Additional results are presented in Supplementary Information section 2. PCA, first principal component from principal component analysis.

First, we confirmed that the algorithmic feed is more engaging. Among participants initially on the chronological feed, the first principal component of the user engagement measures increased by 0.14 s.d. for those assigned to the algorithmic feed, compared with those who remained on the chronological feed (95% CI: 0.03, 0.25; P = 0.014). For participants initially on the algorithmic feed, engagement declined by 0.06 s.d. for those assigned to the chronological feed, but this effect is not significant at the 5% level (95% CI: −0.12, 0.01; P = 0.081). Second, we find precisely estimated null effects of the algorithm on partisanship and affective polarization, whether the algorithm was switched on or off.

Outcomes related to attitudes towards policies and current political events were affected significantly by turning the algorithm on. Participants who switched from the chronological to the algorithmic feed prioritized a conservative policy agenda over a liberal one by 0.11 s.d., compared with those who remained on the chronological feed (95% CI: 0.02, 0.20; P = 0.016). The experiment also influenced views on the criminal investigations into Trump: those who switched to the algorithmic feed were 0.08 s.d. more likely to consider them completely unacceptable (95% CI: 0.01, 0.16; P = 0.026). This effect is larger and more precisely estimated for aspects of this belief held by a smaller share of participants in the control group (as shown in Supplementary Information Fig. 2.4), indicating that the effect is concentrated among more loyal Trump supporters. Regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for participants initially on the chronological feed, exposure to the algorithmic feed increased pro-Kremlin attitudes by 0.12 s.d. (95% CI: 0.03, 0.21; P = 0.007). Finally, we address multiple hypothesis testing concerns by aggregating all questions concerning policies and current political news into a single index. We find that this index is also 0.12 s.d. higher for those who were randomized to switch from the chronological to the algorithmic feed, compared with those who stayed on the chronological feed (95% CI: 0.04, 0.21; P = 0.004).

Remarkably, none of the political attitudes were affected by the reverse switch from the algorithmic to the chronological feed, that is, by switching the algorithm off. This is consistent with the earlier findings of the Meta study1. We also found no significant impact of the experimental treatments on subjective wellbeing. As demonstrated by the similarity between the two specifications, unconditional versus conditional on pre-treatment covariates, the significant impact of switching the algorithm on, and the absence of any effect from switching it off, are robust to the choice of covariates and model specification. Supplementary Information Fig. 2.9 presents results for all individual outcomes in the same format as in Fig. 2. We also verify that the ITT estimates are very similar to the local average treatment effects (LATE) on self-reported compliers, presented in Extended Data Fig. 3 and discussed in detail in Methods.

The sample size is insufficient to reliably test for heterogeneities in these effects. However, the split of the sample by self-reported pre-treatment partisanship into Democrats versus Republicans and Independents (or other political parties) indicates strongly that the results are driven by Republicans and Independents, whereas Democrats' views are largely unaffected by the experiment (Extended Data Fig. 4).

The initial feed setting is correlated with participants' socio-demographic characteristics, as it may reflect individual preferences and because selecting the chronological feed requires an active choice: those on the chronological feed are more likely (based on two-sided t-tests; Extended Data Table 1) to be female (50% versus 48%; P = 0.15), older (51.6 versus 50.1 years; P < 0.001) and white (82% versus 77%, P < 0.001); to have a college education (63% versus 56%; P < 0.001); to use X more frequently (5.04 versus 4.85 on an ordinal frequency scale; P < 0.001) and to use it more for hard news consumption (73% versus 68%, P < 0.001). We verify that the difference in effects between switching the algorithm on and off is not driven by these socio-demographic differences. First, we show that the results are robust to re-weighting observations so that the socio-demographic characteristics of participants initially on the chronological feed match those of participants initially on the algorithmic feed, and vice versa (Extended Data Fig. 5). Second, we predict the probability of initially using the chronological feed based on pre-treatment covariates and show that there is no significant treatment heterogeneity with respect to the predicted initial feed setting, in contrast to the actual feed setting (details of these exercises are provided in Supplementary Information section 2.5). We also verified that the results are not driven by selective attrition by presenting Lee bounds on our estimates (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Information section 1.8.2).

Although it is reassuring that the asymmetry between the political effects of turning the algorithm on and off is not explained by selection into the initial feed setting predicted by socio-demographic characteristics, selection on unobserved factors may contribute to this asymmetry. For example, conditional on socio-demographics, users with different traits—such as autonomy or desire for control—could both choose different initial feed settings and react differently to similar content changes.

Alternatively, the asymmetry of the effects could arise directly from an asymmetry in the changes to the content shown when feed settings are altered. In what follows, we examine how changes in feed settings affect the content shown to users and, in turn, how users adjust their online behaviour, while acknowledging that unobserved confounders, such as personality traits, cannot be ruled out.

To study the content, we used data from a Google Chrome extension capturing the first 100 posts each participant would see under both feed settings. We used natural language processing to annotate political leanings and content type (Supplementary Information section 1.5 describes the annotation process and human validation). Figure 3 presents raw summaries of the content shown to users under the two feed settings and reports estimates of the average content difference (\(\Delta \)) from Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood and ordinary least squares regressions with individual and survey-wave fixed effects, together with P values from two-sided t-tests (Supplementary Information section 2.6 presents specifications and robustness to an alternative machine-learning classifier). First, the algorithm promotes more engaging content. On average, posts shown in the algorithmic feed receive 13,212 likes, 1,836 reposts and 722 comments, compared with 2,781 likes, 453 reposts and 145 comments for posts in the chronological feed. The conditional estimates of \(\Delta \) indicate increases of 480%, 408% and 508% in likes, reposts, and comments, respectively (all P < 0.001).

Average content shown to users in each feed setting: grey, chronological feed, red, algorithmic feed; 95% CIs around subsample means (mean ± 1.96 × s.e.) are reported. The unit of observation is X post. The number of observations for each feed setting is n = 268,532 for all variables, except for ‘Conservative' among ‘Political content', for which n = 129,790 X posts in each feed setting. All variables are indicator variables except Likes, Reposts and Comments, which are heavily right-skewed. For the algorithmic feed, the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum are 0, 174, 933, 8,197 and 1,000,000 for Likes; 0, 9, 137, 1,363 and 316,700 for Reposts and 0, 5, 56, 384 and 247,200 for Comments. For the chronological feed, the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum are 0, 4, 40, 342 and 1,700,000 for Likes; 0, 1, 8, 66 and 572,000 for Reposts and 0, 0, 3, 21 and 256,100 for Comments. Corresponding summary statistics are presented in Supplementary Information Table 1.8. On the left, for each outcome, \(\Delta \) (the estimated difference in content between the algorithmic and chronological feed from regressions with user and survey-wave fixed effects) and the corresponding P value are reported. For Likes, Reposts and Comments, \(\Delta \) is expressed in percent and estimated using a Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood model; for all other outcomes, \(\Delta \) is in percentage points and estimated using linear ordinary least squares. Because fixed effects are included, \(\Delta \) does not exactly match the raw ratio or difference in means across feed settings shown in the bar chart. See Supplementary Information section 2.6 for the specification, full regression results and robustness; all tests are two-sided with s.e. values clustered at the respondent level.

Second, the algorithm promotes political content and, within that category, prioritizes conservative content. Regression results yield that posts annotated as conservative are 2.9 percentage points (19.9%) more likely to appear in the algorithmic feed (P < 0.001), whereas posts annotated as liberal are 1.0 percentage point (3.1%) more likely (P = 0.043). Restricting to political posts, conservative content is 2.5 percentage points (8%) more likely in the algorithmic feed (P < 0.001).

Third, the algorithm demotes accounts of traditional news media and promotes those of political activists. Posts from news organizations appear 15.5 percentage points (58.1%) less often in the algorithmic feed (P < 0.001), whereas posts from political activists appear 5.9 percentage points more often (27.4%; P < 0.001). Fourth, posts from entertainment accounts are 9.1 percentage points (21.5%) more likely in the algorithmic feed (P < 0.001).

Supplementary Information Fig. 2.21 summarizes feed content separately for self-declared Democrats and for self-declared Republicans and Independents. As expected, partisans see substantially less cross-partisan than co-partisan content in their feeds. However, the overall share of conservative content among political content is significantly higher under the algorithmic feed than under the chronological feed for both groups (9.3% versus 5.4%, P < 0.001 for Democrats; 54.2% versus 52.4%, P = 0.004 for Republicans and Independents). This pattern does not hold for content generated by political activists: the algorithm promotes co-partisan activist content more strongly for both groups (Supplementary Information section 2.6).

Next, we use data collected from participants' accounts to analyse the effect of the feed setting on user behaviour. Figure 4 presents the regression results; raw data summaries are presented in Supplementary Information Fig. 2.7. Consistent with the results on political attitudes, switching the algorithm off did not lead to significant differences in the types of account users follow. In contrast, switching the algorithm on did affect the typology of followed accounts among participants initially on the chronological feed. Those exposed to the algorithmic feed as a result of the experiment were more likely to follow conservative accounts (by 0.17 s.d.; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.31; P = 0.015), political activist accounts (by 0.13 s.d.; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.25; P = 0.036) and, especially, conservative political activist accounts (by 0.18 s.d.; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.32; P = 0.010). The entire effect on political activist accounts was driven by conservative political activists. There are no significant differences in the likelihood of following liberal accounts between treatment groups. Following news outlet accounts was also unaffected by the experimental change in the feed setting.

ITT effect estimates of switching the algorithm on and off (in s.d.). Left, effect of moving from the chronological to the algorithmic feed for users initially on the chronological feed. Right, effect of moving in the opposite direction for users initially on the algorithmic feed. For each outcome, the results of two specifications are reported. Blue, unconditional estimates with robust s.e. values, controlling only for the initial feed setting and, where applicable, pre-treatment outcome levels. Orange, conditional estimates, controlling for pre-treatment covariates using GRFs. Point estimates and 90% and 95% CIs are reported. Numerical effect sizes and P values correspond to conditional estimates (all tests are two-sided). The unit of observation is respondent. The sample size is n = 2,387 for all estimates. Tests are described in Methods. Supplementary Information Table 2.16 reports the exact numerical point estimates, s.e. values, CIs and sample sizes for every specification. All outcomes are standardized. Additional results are presented in Supplementary Information section 2.

Finally, we provide suggestive evidence on how changes to the feed setting, and the resulting choices of which accounts to follow, shape the content shown to users. Extended Data Fig. 7 reports ITT estimates for the average feed characteristics of the 599 participants who ran the Chrome extension during the post-treatment survey; these results should be interpreted with caution given the small sample. The share of conservative content rose by 0.35 s.d. (95% CI: 0.06, 0.64; P = 0.018) when the algorithm was switched on, but did not change significantly when it was switched off, whereas liberal content was unaffected by either switch. This pattern reflected shifts in both activist and news posts. Switching the algorithm on increased posts by conservative activists (0.37 s.d.; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.68; P = 0.024) and reduced posts from liberal news outlets (−0.43 s.d., 95% CI: −0.71, −0.16; P = 0.002), whereas turning the algorithm off reduced liberal activists' posts (−0.23 s.d.; 95% CI: −0.38, −0.08; P = 0.004) and increased posts from both liberal (0.50 s.d.; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.67; P < 0.001) and conservative news outlets (0.28 s.d.; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.46; P = 0.002).

These treatment effects on feed content reflect both what the algorithm promotes (Fig. 3) and changes in the accounts users follow (Fig. 4). Users may be particularly responsive to the latter because these changes arise from their own preferences and behaviour. To isolate the effect of followings, we compare the content users saw, or would have seen, on their chronological feeds depending on treatment assignment in Extended Data Table 2 (methodological details in Supplementary Information section 2.7). Controlling for the intensity of X use before the experiment, the chronological feeds of those exposed to the algorithmic feed setting as a result of the experiment contain 9.0 percentage points (60%) more posts by conservative accounts (95% CI: 2.6, 15.5; P = 0.006) and 6.1 percentage points (28%) more posts by conservative political activists (95% CI: 1.0, 11.3; P = 0.020) compared with the chronological feeds of those participants who were randomized to stay on the chronological feed. Meanwhile, we found no significant effects on these content characteristics of chronological feeds after switching the algorithm off. We also ran a placebo test, verifying that, in the pre-treatment survey before users were exposed to new content or could follow new accounts, there was no relationship between chronological feed content and treatment assignment (Supplementary Information section 2.7).

In addition to promoting entertainment, X's feed algorithm tends to push more conservative content to users' feeds. Seven weeks of exposure to such content in 2023 shifted users' political opinions in a more conservative direction, particularly with regard to policy priorities, perceptions of the criminal investigations into Trump and views on the war in Ukraine. The effect is asymmetric: switching the algorithm on influenced political views, but switching it off did not reverse users' perspectives on policy priorities or current political issues.

We show that exposure to algorithmically curated content led users to follow conservative activist accounts. In contrast, when the algorithmic feed was switched off, users continued to follow the accounts they had engaged with previously. This indicates that exposure to feed algorithms has a lasting impact on users' feeds and their political attitudes.

This mechanism helps explain why previous research found no political effects of switching the algorithm off on Meta platforms, even though it altered political content1. Once users follow accounts promoted by the algorithm that they find engaging and persuasive—such as those of conservative political activists—they continue to see posts from these accounts after turning the algorithm off. Hence, users' political attitudes may remain unchanged, as the content they engage with most persists despite observed shifts in overall political content. Earlier work also showed that users' feeds are shaped largely by the accounts they follow, even under algorithmic curation40. Our findings demonstrate that the algorithm significantly influences whom users choose to follow, indicating that algorithms shape content exposure more than believed previously.

This mechanism may also help to explain why social media deactivation experiments, which completely disconnect users from such content, produce political effects, unlike merely switching off the algorithm while keeping users active on the platform. Facebook deactivation in 2018 reduced political polarization41, whereas deactivation during the 2020 US elections reduced self-reported net votes for Trump, although the effect did not meet the authors' pre-registered significance threshold42. The latter finding aligns with the political effects observed in our experiment. It is important to note that potential treatment heterogeneity between respondents who initially selected different feed settings may also contribute to the asymmetry in switching the algorithm on and off. Although we control for observed socio-demographics, these groups may still differ along unobserved dimensions.

Additional considerations help clarify the broader implications of our findings. In contrast to policy attitudes and views on current events, partisanship and affective polarization were unaffected by our experimental treatments, consistent with the Meta Study1. This may reflect the rigidity and salience of these measures, as they are less susceptible to change over short periods43. Despite this rigidity, researcher-designed re-ranking of feeds can affect affective polarization37.

Politicized content was a large part of the public conversation on Twitter even before it became X38 and, in 2024, X stood out among social media platforms as a place people turn to for politics44. Further evidence is needed on the effects of algorithm activation on other platforms. Our study has limitations common to research on social media and feed algorithms. The effects are specific to the platform and the time period. For example, they depend on the platform owner's preferences. We find that, relative to the chronological feed, X's algorithm promotes conservative content to both Democrats and to Republicans and Independents, with suggestive evidence that persuasion is stronger for Republicans and Independents, who are more positively predisposed to conservative messages. This indicates that, within the context studied, X's algorithm affects users mainly on one side of the political spectrum—a result that may not hold for algorithms that amplify content from both ideological sides. Another limitation, common to most studies, is that platforms can modify their algorithms at any time, including during the study, without researchers being aware of such changes33,38,45. Finally, because we focus on active X users, effect sizes may not generalize to the broader user base, as they are probably smaller for irregular or inactive users, who experience lower treatment intensity.

We conducted the experiment independently of the platform, which helps address additional external validity concerns35. However, relative to what could be achieved with the platform's cooperation, our study's independence came at the cost of relying on self-reported compliance for most of the sample, which limited our ability to measure treatment intensity directly, and of working with a smaller sample, which constrained our ability to test finer-grained treatment heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the sample was sufficiently large to detect significant and robust political effects from switching the algorithm on.

Overall, we conclude that social media feed algorithms can play an important role in shaping political opinions and online behaviour.

Participants in our experiment were recruited by YouGov—a professional online polling firm with a large panel of respondents in the United States. All study participants gave their informed consent to participate. Participants were included in the study only if they self-reported using X at least several times a month. The sample is 78% white, 52% male and relatively well educated, with 58% having completed at least 4 years of university. In terms of political affiliation, 46% identify as Democrats and 21% as Republicans. Among the participants, 66% use X at least once a day and 94% at least once a week. As for posting activity, 27% post at least once a day and 53% at least once a week. See Supplementary Information section 1.4 for detailed summary statistics and the comparison of our sample with Twitter users from the nationally representative Social Media Study by the American National Election Studies.

Participants were randomized into an algorithmic or chronological feed for the duration of the experiment in exchange for compensation. Supplementary Information section 1.2 provides information on the compensation scheme and on how different elements of the experiment appeared on the X platform.

The randomization procedure was effective: participants assigned to different feed conditions exhibited no systematic differences in demographic characteristics or social media usage beyond what would be expected by chance. The only notable imbalance relates to the initial feed setting. The proportion of participants who were already using the algorithmic feed at baseline was two percentage points higher among those assigned to the algorithmic group (77% compared with 75%). All analyses account for the initial feed setting. Supplementary Information section 1.7 provides further details on balance and reports summary statistics by treatment group and initial feed setting.

Outcome data on attitudes come from the post-treatment survey. The coding of the survey-based outcome variables is presented in Supplementary Information section 1.3. To analyse the content of users' feeds and the accounts they follow, we applied natural language processing methods. The Llama 3-based classification of feed content, collected using a Google Chrome extension, categorizes posts by political leaning—either conservative or liberal—and by type, distinguishing between posts from political activists, entertainment accounts and news media outlets. Details are provided in Supplementary Information section 1.5. The Llama 3-based classification of followed accounts is based on data collected through users' X handles. This procedure is described in Supplementary Information section 1.6.

We conduct several validation exercises for the Llama 3 annotations in Supplementary Information sections 1.5 and 1.6. These include comparisons with machine-learning classifiers based on word frequencies, as well as evaluations conducted by human annotators.

Given the experimental design, the ITT effect estimates were obtained by comparing mean outcomes between respondents assigned randomly to the algorithmic feed and those assigned to the chronological feed, conditional on their initial feed setting. Our main specification estimates the effect of switching the algorithm on for users who initially had it off, and switching it off for users who initially had it on. Specifically, we estimate the following model:

where i indexes respondents. Yi represents outcome variables (for example, post-treatment political attitudes of respondents). Initial Algoi is a dummy variable for the initial feed setting; it equals one for respondents who had been using the algorithmic feed before our intervention and zero for those who had been using the chronological feed. Treatment Algoi is a dummy variable for being assigned to the algorithmic feed setting during the treatment phase; it equals 1 for respondents assigned to the algorithmic feed and 0 for those assigned to the chronological feed. Note that, by construction, Initial Chronoi = 1 − Initial Algoi and Treatment Chronoi = 1 − Treatment Algoi. Xi is a vector of control variables discussed below.

The coefficients of interest are β1 and β2, which estimate the ITT effects of switching the algorithm on and switching it off, respectively. Because we control for Initial Algo, those switching from the chronological to the algorithmic feed are compared with users who initially had the chronological feed and remained on it, whereas those switching from the algorithmic to the chronological feed are compared with users who initially had the algorithmic feed and remained on it.

We consistently report two sets of estimates. First, we report unconditional estimates, namely, controlling only for the initial feed setting and, when available, the pre-treatment value of the outcome variable. The unconditional model is justified by the balance in observables across treatment groups. Second, we also report estimates that flexibly control for pre-treatment covariates. Our baseline approach relies on GRFs—a machine-learning method that identifies the most relevant covariates and adjusts for them non-parametrically39. This approach limits the researcher's discretion in selecting covariates and functional form, including mitigating concerns about model misspecification46. We use the full set of available pre-treatment covariates as input to the GRFs. The covariates include initial feed setting, gender, age, indicators of X use, all categories of educational attainment and race, frequency of X use and posting, political affiliation, the device used to complete the pre-treatment survey (such as a laptop or smartphone), life satisfaction, happiness and affective polarization. Technical details are provided in Supplementary Information section 2.2.1. Baseline ITT estimates are reported in Fig. 2.

Throughout the analysis (in the main text and Extended Data Figs. 4, 5 and 7 and Supplementary Information), we present ITT estimates in graphical form using coefficient plots. Estimates from the unconditional specification are shown in blue, whereas those from the specification controlling for pre-treatment covariates are shown in orange. For clarity, we refer to β1 estimates as ‘Chrono to Algorithm' and β2 estimates as ‘Algorithm to Chrono' in these coefficient plot figures.

In Supplementary Information section 2.4, we report results for all outcome variables using a range of linear specifications, progressively adding the following controls to equation (1): demographic characteristics (gender, age, indicators for being white and for high educational attainment), pre-treatment X use (frequency of use, frequency of posting and self-reported purpose of using X), and political affiliation (Republican, Independent, Democrat or other). We also present results from a specification that includes the predicted probability of having an algorithmic initial feed, obtained using LASSO on all pre-treatment characteristics. In addition, we report results from a specification that controls for post-treatment X use. Although post-treatment use is endogenous, robustness to including this control indicates that the estimated effects are not solely driven by changes in X usage.

In Supplementary Information section 2.4, we also present tests for the symmetry of the effects of switching the algorithm on and off. Specifically, we test whether β1 = − β2, and whether 7 weeks of algorithm exposure, induced by treatment assignment for users initially on the chronological feed, leads to outcome levels similar to those of users who were initially on the algorithmic feed and remained on it, that is, whether β1 = β3.

Due to minimal non-compliance with assigned treatments (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information section 1.8.1), the ITT estimates do not strictly represent average treatment effects. We estimate LATE for compliers, that is, for respondents who adhered to their assigned feed setting, using instrumental variables regressions, with the assigned feed setting used as an instrument for the feed setting actually used.

We define ‘actual' feed use during the treatment phase using treatment assignments and respondents' self-reported compliance from the post-treatment survey. Respondents are classified as compliant if they answered ‘always' or ‘most of the time' to the question, ‘Did you stick to the assigned feed?' Based on this, we construct two variables: Actual Algoi and Actual Chronoi.

Actual Algoi equals 1 if respondent i was compliant and assigned to the algorithmic feed, or non-compliant and assigned to the chronological feed, implying they used the algorithmic feed. Conversely, Actual Chronoi equals 1 if the respondent was compliant and assigned to the chronological feed, or non-compliant and assigned to the algorithmic feed. By construction, Actual Chronoi = 1 − Actual Algoi.

We estimate two-stage least squares regressions, with the second stage specified as follows:

Hat() denotes the fitted value from the corresponding first-stage regression. The two first-stage regressions predict the following:

Hat(Initial Chronoi × Actual Algoi) with Initial Chronoi × Treatment Algoi and Hat(Initial Algoi × Actual Chronoi) with Initial Algoi × Treatment Chronoi. With a compliance rate of 85.38%, the instruments are extremely strong: in all specifications, the F-statistics for the excluded instruments in the first stage exceed 1,000.

In equation (2), γ1 represents the LATE estimate of the effect of switching the algorithm on, and γ2 the corresponding effect of switching it off. The main LATE estimates are reported in Extended Data Fig. 3. Given the high compliance rate, the ITT and LATE estimates are very similar.

In Supplementary Information Fig. 2.13, we also report LATE estimates using a more conservative definition of self-reported compliance, in which a respondent is considered compliant only if they answered ‘always' to the question ‘Did you stick to the assigned feed?' For those who answered ‘almost always', we assume that they complied with the assigned setting at any moment only with probability 0.5. In this case, the instruments remain very strong and the results are very similar.

The results are also robust to restricting the analysis to respondents whose compliance was confirmed through observation, that is, those who installed the Google Chrome extension and remained on their assigned feed setting (Supplementary Fig. 2.12).

Significant attrition was observed between the pre-treatment and post-treatment surveys, common to studies like ours. Attrition rates did not differ across treatment groups. We formally assess whether selective attrition could bias our results using Lee bounds and conclude that attrition does not meaningfully affect our findings. Details are provided in Supplementary Information section 1.8.2, and results are reported in Extended Data Fig. 6.

Ethical approval for this research was granted by the Ethics Committee of the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland. All procedures involving human participants were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was obtained from all participants at the time of their enrolment. Participants received compensation for their time: they were compensated in points—a currency used within our implementation partner's (YouGov) platform, with an exchange rate of 1,000 points equalling US$1.00. For the pre-treatment survey, they received 500 points (US$0.50), with clear information that they would earn 2,500 points (US$2.50) for using the assigned feed setting between the two surveys and returning for the post-treatment survey. Furthermore, participants could earn an extra 2,000 points (US$2.00) for using the Chrome extension during the pre-treatment survey. After completing the post-treatment survey, they were paid the 2,500 points (US$2.50) that had been announced during the pre-treatment survey. Again, they could earn additional compensation for running the Chrome extension, this time 2,500 points (US$2.50). Therefore, participants could earn up to 10,000 points (US$10.00) if they completed both surveys and used the Chrome extension both pre- and post-treatment. Sharing the X handle was not incentivized.

The experimental interventions were limited to the choice of feed setting, which is freely available to every user on the X platform. No artificial manipulation of users' content was introduced. Additional information on ethical safeguards and considerations is provided in Supplementary Information section 1.1.

Flow Diagram for the Experiment.

On the left, mean compliance by measure of observed and self-reported compliance. Observed compliance is based on the Chrome extension, which provides information on which feed setting respondents are on when using the extension. Self-reported compliance is based on a question in the post-treatment survey asking the respondents whether they complied with the assigned treatment. On the right, distribution of values for self-reported compliance. Sample size indicated on the figure. The unit of observation is respondent.

Acral melanoma, which is not ultraviolet-associated, is the type of melanoma reported most commonly in several non-European-descent populations1,2,3, including in Mexican people4. Latin American samples are substantially under-represented in global cancer genomics studies5, which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures6,7,8. To address this, we characterized the genome and transcriptome of 123 acral melanoma tumours from 92 Mexican patients—a population notable because of its genetic admixture9. Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF, NRAS or NF1. Although most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations. The tumours with activating BRAF mutations had a transcriptional profile more similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, indicating that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared with other tumours arising in these locations. Transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with recurrence-free and overall survival. Our study enhances knowledge of this understudied disease and underscores the importance of including samples from diverse ancestries in cancer genomics studies.

Melanoma is classified into several clinicopathological subtypes on the basis of tumour site of presentation and histopathological features. Acral melanoma is an understudied melanoma subtype due to its low incidence globally, and because it represents a small proportion of melanoma cases in European-descent populations2,10; however, acral melanoma represents the vast majority of melanoma cases in some Latin American, African and Asian countries due to the lower incidences of ultraviolet-induced melanoma subtypes11. Furthermore, the causes of this type of disease are unknown, with patients managed in a similar way to ultraviolet-associated cutaneous melanoma. However, its site of presentation and genomic characteristics are vastly different12.

Acral melanoma arises on the glabrous (non-haired) skin of soles, palms and in the nail unit (subungual location), and its genome differs substantially from other cutaneous melanoma subtypes13. In contrast to ultraviolet-linked subtypes, acral melanoma has a lower burden of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), a higher burden of structural variants and a low prevalence of mutational signatures SBS7a/b/c/d, which are associated with ultraviolet irradiation14,15,16,17,18. Genes that are mutated frequently in cutaneous melanoma such as BRAF, the RAS genes and NF1, are reported to be altered at a significantly lower frequency in acral melanoma. This, coupled with the comparatively lower number of studies of acral melanoma when compared with other cutaneous melanoma subtypes, has translated into limited available therapies for acral melanoma management.

It is known that cancer risk and incidence, as well as tumour genomic profiles, vary with ancestry and geographical location6,19,20. As most genomic studies on acral melanoma have been performed on patients of European or Asian ancestry, we considered it necessary to examine the genomics of this subtype of melanoma in Latin American people. Specifically, Latin American populations have been substantially under-represented in cancer genomic studies, with only about 1% of all samples in cohorts such as the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other repositories, and those contributing to cancer genome-wide association studies, being of Latin American origin5,21,22. Identification of differences in the genomic profile among populations can potentially aid the discovery of germline/inherited or environmental factors related to acral melanoma aetiology, as well as identify optimal therapeutic strategies for all patients.

In this study, we analysed 123 acral melanoma samples from 92 Mexican patients through genotyping, exome sequencing, SNV and insertion/deletion (indel) variant calling, copy number estimation and gene expression profiling, and examined the correlation of these molecular characteristics with clinical variables. We reveal a significant correlation between genetic ancestry and BRAF somatic mutations, as well as a distinct transcriptomic profile in tumours with BRAF-activating mutations compared with samples without activating mutations in BRAF. We also identify significant differences in recurrence-free and overall survival among patients with tumours with distinct gene expression profiles.

A total of 123 uniformly ascertained samples from 92 patients from a large Mexican tertiary referral hospital were analysed in this study (Supplementary Table 1; Methods). Of these tumours, 89 were primaries, 27 were metastases, five were recurrences, one was a lesion in transit and one was unknown (Supplementary Table 1). Latin American genomes are generally a mixture of European, African and Amerindian ancestry. Of note, 90% of genotyped samples (n = 80) in this study had predominantly Amerindian ancestry (median 81%) (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2) with European and African ancestries contributing a median of 13.6% and 2.5%, respectively. The median age of the patients in this cohort was 60, with 59% of the patients being female. Most patients were stage III (American Joint Committee on Cancer, 8th edn)23 at diagnosis, and the most common primary site was the foot—most frequently the sole. The median Breslow thickness was 4.0 mm and most primary tumours were ulcerated (68%) (Table 1). It should be noted that only four patients received immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapy, due to lack of access.

Considering all 123 samples, acral melanoma tumours showed a SNV+indel (hereafter referred to as tumour mutational burden (TMB)) mean of 0.95 mutations per megabase and a median of 0.87 mutations per megabase (range, 0–3.49 mutations per megabase). When including only one sample per patient, with primaries being selected preferentially, the most frequently mutated genes were NRAS (14% of samples; Q-value < 4.97 × 10−10), KIT (14% of samples not counting deletions, as they are unlikely to be activating; Q-value = 4.97 × 10−10), BRAF (13%, Q-value = 3.86 × 10−7) and NF1 (9%, Q-value = 0.0001) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). Two of these samples had homozygous NF1 deletions, in addition to a further two secondary samples from other patients (Extended Data Fig. 1a). For BRAF, all mutations except one were V600E, with one L597R (Fig. 1b). These genes, which represent known drivers, were identified as being under positive selection (Methods) and exhibit mutual exclusivity (only one patient has tumours with mutations in more than one of these genes), which reflects their functional redundancy in activating the MAPK pathway. Separate capillary sequencing of the TERT promoter in 76 samples belonging to 64 patients identified that six carry the −124 promoter mutation (9.3%) and two out of 59 patients for which the −146 position was amplified successfully carry a mutation in this position (3.4%) (Supplementary Table 4). In total, we estimate that about 10.5% of patients have an activating TERT promoter mutation, which is similar to estimates in other studies15,24. All samples from all patients that had several samples sequenced and that could be assessed had a concordant TERT genotype, in agreement with an early emergence of this mutation during tumour evolution24. Other genes reported previously as mutated in other melanoma subtypes, as well as other cancer types are also mutated in this cohort, such as TP53, HRAS and KRAS (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2). In summary, the ‘classic' melanoma driver genes (N/H/KRAS, BRAF and NF1) are mutated in 40% of Mexican acral melanoma samples, with most of the samples in this cohort therefore being classified as ‘triple wild-type' melanomas. Apart from the known HRAS, SPRED1, TP53 and KRAS driver genes, we also find mutations in PTPRJ, ATM, NF2 and RDH5 (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Specifically, in those tumours without mutations in any of the abovementioned four driver genes (BRAF, NRAS, KIT, NF1, ‘quadruple wild type' (QWT)), we find two tumours each from different patients with deleterious mutations in ATM and RDH5 (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The mutations in these genes are all protein-changing and deleterious. All these genes have been linked previously to tumour suppressor activities in either acral or mucosal melanomas25,26,27,28,29,30, as well as other cancer types, and may represent low-frequency drivers. We also observe a significantly higher proportion of women versus men carrying mutations in driver genes (two-tailed Fisher's test P value = 0.003) (Supplementary Table 5). After adjusting for date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, ancestry and tumour stage, the odds ratio of having a mutation in a driver gene in female patients (compared with men) was estimated to be 3.83 (95% confidence interval, 1.32, 11.03) (multivariate logistic regression, P value = 0.013).

The estimate and its two-sided P value were obtained from the summary of the model. d, Barplot depicting the number and mutational classification of samples in different acral and cutaneous melanoma studies14,15,18,31,32,33,34.

When examining the relationship between ancestry and somatic profile, we identified significantly higher odds (P value = 0.02) of carrying a BRAF somatic mutation with increasing European ancestry in a linear model controlling for age at diagnosis, sex and total TMB (Fig. 1c). Patients with mutations in KIT showed a tendency for higher Amerindian ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 2). We also found that patients with NRAS mutations were younger at diagnosis (median and mean age of diagnosis for patients with NRAS mutations was 49 years and 50.84 years versus 63 years and 62.9 years without, respectively), but this effect is probably mediated by ulceration status, as patients with NRAS mutations have a significantly lower rate of ulceration (two-tailed Fisher's exact test P value = 0.016).

Out of 22 patients for whom we sequenced at least two different samples (for example, a primary and a metastasis), 13 were classified as NRAS/KIT/BRAF/NF1-mutated. For BRAF, all four patients have mutations across all samples and, for NRAS, three out of four patients have a NRAS mutation in both the primary and lymph node metastasis. These data indicate that these mutations appear as an early event in tumour evolution. For patients with KIT mutations, about half of the times the mutation is found in the primary and not in the metastasis. These data agree with those of Wang et al.24, and indicate that metastases are seeded before the appearance of these mutations (Supplementary Table 6).

Collectively, these results are similar to those reported in other acral melanoma studies14,15,18,31,32,33,34, with some important differences: first, the genetic composition of the patients in our study includes a high proportion of Native American ancestry, which is severely under-represented in already published cancer genomics studies and permits the identification of relationships of specific ancestries with somatic characteristics. In addition, the fraction of activating BRAF mutations is lower than in the studies with predominantly European-descent patients, and more similar to those with Asian patients, probably due to the positive relationship between BRAF mutation and European ancestry (Fig. 1d).

Somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) analysis across all samples showed a higher burden of amplifications than deletions (Fig. 2a). Examination of 47 samples, one per patient, that passed our stringent quality filtering for this type of analysis (Methods), showed that 18 regions were significantly amplified, and six regions were frequently deleted (Supplementary Table 7). About a quarter (11, 23%) of these 47 samples had whole genome duplication events (Supplementary Table 1). Potential driver genes in frequently amplified regions include TERT (43% of samples), CRKL (36%), GAB2 (30%) and CCND1 (28%) (Supplementary Tables 4 and 7–9). Regions that showed recurrent deletions contained genes such as CDKN2A, CDKN2B, ATM and TP53. Specifically, CDKN2A and CDKN2B had deletions in 59.6% of samples, with eight of them (out of 28) being homozygous deletions (Extended Data Fig. 1b; Methods), whereas ATM and TP53 both had deletions in 38% and 34% of samples, respectively. No association was found between ancestry and any of the significantly altered CNA regions.

SCNA profiles varied depending on whether samples had mutations in driver genes or were QWT. Specifically, samples with mutations in driver genes (n = 23) showed preferential amplification of NOTCH2 (P value = 0.036, two-tailed exact Fisher test) and 1q21.3, containing several genes (P value = 0.02), whereas CCND1 (P value = 0.049), and ARF6 and SOS2 (both in same amplification peak, P value = 0.048) were preferentially amplified in QWT tumours (n = 24). The 8p12 region, containing genes such as FGFR1 and TACC1, was found amplified only in five QWT samples, whereas several regions were found altered only in mutated tumours (Supplementary Tables 10–15 and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4).

When stratifying samples by mutational status (considering BRAF-, NRAS-, NF1-, KIT-mutated and multi-hit, which included one sample with mutations in more than one of these drivers), we did not observe any significant differences in SCNA among groups (measured by global copy number alteration score (GCS); Methods) (Fig. 2b,c). Considering all samples, those with NRAS, BRAF and NF1 mutations had the lowest median total TMB, whereas KIT-mutated and multi-hit tumours had the highest median total TMB (Supplementary Fig. 3). We found a significant correlation between GCS score and total TMB (Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient = 0.72; P value < 0.0001) (Fig. 2d). Tumours from the subungual region also had a higher median GCS score than those found on the feet (Fig. 2e).

Statistical significance was assessed using two-sided Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests.

Single-base substitution mutational signature analysis across 116 samples that carried at least one SNV revealed previously reported COSMICv.3.4 signatures SBS1, SBS5 and SBS40a (Extended Data Fig. 5). Apart from clock-like signatures SBS1 and SBS5 (ref. 35), SBS40a was also prevalent across the cohort, contributing 53.38% of mutations to the total (Supplementary Fig. 4). SBS40a is of unknown origin but was identified originally in kidney cancer and is present in many cancer types36. Copy number signature analysis identified a number of previously reported signatures across different samples (n = 60 samples; Methods)37,38. CN1, which has been associated with a diploid state and CN9, which is potentially caused by local loss of heterozygosity on a diploid background, dominated the copy number landscape (Extended Data Fig. 5; Methods). As expected, signatures related to chromothripsis (CN7, CN8) were also found in several samples across the cohort. The number of indels in the samples was too low to add meaningful information (average, 2.52 indels per sample), so signature analysis for indels was not performed. We similarly did not find any significant associations between ancestry and any mutational signature.

It has been postulated previously that BRAF-mutated acral melanomas might be more biologically similar to melanomas from non-acral sites than to other acral melanomas18,39; because of the observed correlation of European ancestry with BRAF mutation rate, we decided to investigate this hypothesis. We successfully extracted and sequenced RNA from 77 primary tumours from different patients (Supplementary Table 1; Methods). We then generated a gene signature-based score for identifying acral- versus cutaneous-derived melanomas. For this, we sourced a list of candidate genes from acral melanoma and cutaneous melanoma datasets (Supplementary Table 16; Methods) and identified 20 genes with high classification accuracy in a training cohort of ten primary acral melanomas (used to derive a v-mel score, or ‘A' for acral) and ten primary cutaneous melanomas (used to derive a c-mel score, or ‘C' for cutaneous) recruited at the University of Utah (Fig. 3a,b). We then obtained scores (v-mel/c-mel, or A:C) for samples in our dataset of acral melanomas, separating primary tumours with BRAF-activating mutations (n = 10) versus BRAF-wild-type (n = 67) tumours. We observed a difference between BRAF-activating and BRAF-wild-type tumours (P value = 0.045), with BRAF-activating tumours having a score closer to cutaneous melanomas (Fig. 3c, left panel). We then replicated this analysis in an independent cohort of 63 acral melanomas from Newell et al.15 (BRAF-activating n = 10, wild type n = 53), which further confirmed these results (P value = 0.039) (Fig. 3c, right panel). Therefore, we explored the possibility that this difference could be due to downstream mutated BRAF signalling. First, we replicated this analysis in the TCGA cutaneous melanoma data, finding no significant differences among BRAF and non-BRAF-mutated samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We then examined datasets in which mutant BRAF was introduced into primary melanocytes in a doxycycline-inducible manner40. We found that the c-mel signature genes were not activated downstream of mutant BRAF, further indicating that the classifier does not simply reflect BRAF-driven transcriptional changes (Fig. 3d). Using a recently developed method for assessing gene signature similarity41, we compared the c-mel gene signature from our classifier to a previously published set of genes directly activated by mutant BRAF in melanoma cells42. We found no significant correlation between these signatures (Extended Data Fig. 6b).

In conclusion, in these comparisons, BRAF-activating tumours expressed a more ‘cutaneous melanoma-like' transcriptional program. This result indicates that BRAF-mutated melanomas that occur at acral sites are transcriptionally closer to non-acral cutaneous melanomas, a transcriptional program that is not explained by BRAF downstream signalling, and are associated with increasing European genetic ancestry.

We then applied a more stringent quality filter, including coverage and alignment features, to primary tumours in this collection with 44 samples remaining for further analyses (Supplementary Table 1; Methods). Consensus clustering of gene expression identified three sample groups, expressing different gene modules (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 17; Methods). Cluster 1 was characterized by an epidermal/immune profile module, with high expression of keratin genes (for example, KRT1 and KRT9), cytokines (for example, CXCL16, IL7, IL4R, IL1R, IL15RA and CXCL14) and processes such as epidermis development, cell–cell junction organization and wound healing (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 18). Cluster 2 expressed higher levels of a mitotic/proliferative-related signature, with high expression of genes such as MITF and TYR, and processes such as chromosome segregation, nuclear division and mitochondrial translation (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 19). Cluster 3 showed expression of a gene module characterized by respiration and oxidative phosphorylation-related genes (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 20). Cluster 1 was associated with better prognostic clinical characteristics, such as a smaller proportion of ulcerated samples (53% versus 93% in cluster 2 and 57% in cluster 3), a tendency for earlier clinical stages and lower mitotic rates (Mann–Whitney U cluster 1 versus cluster 2 P-value: 0.041, cluster 1 versus cluster 3 P-value: 0.052) (Fig. 4c). Deconvolution of gene expression profiles also indicated differences in immune cell infiltration composition, with cluster 1 having a higher proportion of CD4+ T cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cluster 2 having a higher proportion of B cell infiltration (Fig. 4d–f, Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 21).

The central line within each box represents the median value, the box boundaries represent the IQR and the whiskers extend to the lowest or highest data point still within 1.5× IQR. Individual data points are plotted as dots. For c–f, two-sided Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney paired tests were performed. For c–f, 14 samples are included in cluster 1, 16 samples in cluster 2 and 14 in cluster 3.

Next, we evaluated whether the genomic and transcriptomic characteristics had any impact on patient overall or recurrence-free survival. We included in the analysis those participants whose primary could be analysed (n = 85; Methods). The mean time between diagnosis and recruitment was 2.01 years, including 21 participants recruited within 6 months; the range was from a few days to more than 10 years. Among these participants, 12 primary tumours had an NRAS mutation, 11 had a mutation in KIT, 11 had a BRAF mutation, seven had NF1 mutations, one had multiple hits and 43 were classified as QWT.

Carrying any driver mutation was not associated with age at diagnosis or tumour stage (data not shown). Having a tumour with a driver mutation was, however, associated with a reported recurrence, with 66.7% of mutated tumours having a recurrence as compared with 37.2% of QWT tumours (Pearson two-tailed Chi-squared test P value = 0.007). After adjusting for date of diagnosis, sex, age at diagnosis, ancestry and tumour stage (n = 73, primaries with ancestry information available), the odds ratio for a mutated tumour having a recurrence compared with QWT tumours was 5.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.56, 18.12), (multivariate logistic regression, P value = 0.008) (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 22). Notably, among the mutated tumours, for each different gene, tumour recurrence was increased over QWT tumours (Fig. 5a), most notably for NF1, where all seven of the mutated tumours recurred.

All reported P values are two-sided. NS, not significant.

Overall, 44 of the tumours could be classified transcriptomically into one of the three clusters. There was no association between tumour driver mutation and transcriptomic cluster (data not shown). There was, however, evidence of differences in recurrence frequency by cluster, with 35.7% of cluster 1 tumours, 81.2% of cluster 2 tumours and 57.1% of cluster 3 tumours having a recurrence (Fisher's exact test, P value = 0.04 for homogeneity). Logistic regression adjusting for age at diagnosis, sex, diagnosis date and stage at presentation showed that those tumours from cluster 2 had a higher rate of recurrence as compared with cluster 1 (odds ratio = 6.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.97, 46.27), multivariate logistic regression, P value = 0.054; Supplementary Table 23), whereas cluster 3 had intermediate rates of recurrence (Fig. 5b).

Fifteen participants (17.6%) died during the study period; 9% of participants with QWT tumours and 26.2% of participants with tumours with driver mutations died (P value = 0.042 for homogeneity). Log rank analysis of time to death from diagnosis showed a tendency for an increased risk of death among those with any mutation (P value = 0.077) (Supplementary Table 24), whereas similar analysis by specific mutation showed more extreme significance (P value = 0.0006) (Supplementary Table 25). Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusting for age, sex, tumour stage and ancestry indicated participants whose tumour had any mutation in a driver gene had a tendency for an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 3.19, 95% confidence interval, 0.8, 12.74; P value = 0.1), although this was not conventionally significant (Supplementary Table 26) (Fig. 5c).

Finally, survival analysis based on the 44 tumours with transcriptomic classification showed significant variation between the clusters, with 0% of cluster 1, 43.7% of cluster 2 and 21.4% of cluster 3 having died (log-rank P value = 0.011, Pearson two-tailed Chi-squared P value = 0.017), again in keeping with the analysis of recurrence, a known main risk factor for survival (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 27). Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusting for age at diagnosis, sex, stage at presentation and ancestry did not provide significant evidence of differences between the clusters in terms of mortality rates, in keeping with the limited sample size.

In this study, we report the analysis of the somatic and transcriptomic profile of 123 acral melanoma samples from Mexican patients—one of the largest cohorts reported for this type of cancer. In our view, this study helps address several research gaps: (1) the underrepresentation of samples of Latin American ancestry in cancer sample repositories5: as shown previously, genetic ancestry and environment influence the somatic profile of tumours, with potential impacts on patient management and treatment6,19,20; (2) the relative lack of studies of acral melanoma, when compared with other types of the disease, as this type of melanoma constitutes most reported cases in some non-European populations11, and (3) the relative paucity of genomic studies performed and directed from low- and middle-income countries such as Mexico.

Most patients in this study had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, which allowed us to perform an analysis of genetic ancestry correlates with somatic mutation profile. We identified a positive correlation between European ancestry and BRAF mutation rate (Fig. 1c). A possible link between European ancestry and BRAFV600E mutation had been described previously18, and this study provides further confirmatory evidence. Other similar correlations have been described recently for other types of cancer, such as a positive relationship between Native American ancestry and EGFR mutation rate in lung cancer20, and an increased rate of somatic FBXW7 in African patients compared with European patients6. In accordance with this observation, other cohorts of acral melanoma, which studied patients with predominantly European ancestry, have a higher BRAF mutation rate than that in this study (for example, 23% in Australian patients with predominantly European ancestry15). These observations should provide the basis for future studies exploring the relationships between ancestry and somatic mutation rate.

We were intrigued to discover that acral melanomas with BRAF-activating mutations exhibit a more ‘cutaneous melanoma-like' transcriptome than other genetic subtypes of acral melanoma. One possible explanation is that this gene signature is uniquely downstream of a BRAF missense mutation. However, in further analyses, we do not see evidence for this explanation (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6). An alternative explanation involves the distinct origins of acral melanomas with BRAF-activating mutations compared with other acral melanomas. In our previous work43, we identified distinct subclasses of human epidermal melanocytes: a common type enriched in limbs (c-type) and a rare type enriched in volar regions (v-type). We observed that most acral melanomas generally retained a transcriptional signature such as v-type melanocytes, whereas a subset seemed more akin to c-type melanocytes43. The current work indicates that these tumours are more likely to belong to the BRAF-activating genetic subtype, indicating that a subset of volar melanomas might be classified more accurately by cell of origin and/or genetic profile as non-acral cutaneous melanoma, rather than bona fide acral melanomas. It is important to clarify that the hypothesis that acral melanomas may arise from different cells of origin is not based solely on this study but is also supported by previous work. Our previous research has demonstrated transcriptional diversity among melanocytes in different anatomic locations, including distinct populations of epidermal melanocytes in the palms and soles43. Furthermore, our zebrafish model studies have shown that acral melanoma-associated drivers preferentially (although not exclusively) induce tumours in the limbs (fins), whereas cutaneous melanoma-associated BRAF mutations lead preferentially (but not exclusively) to tumours in the trunk44. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that BRAF mutations selectively drive hyperproliferation in less-pigmented primary human melanocytes40. Therefore, although our additional analyses do not strongly support an oncogene signature as the explanation for the differences in transcriptional scores, thus favouring the cell-of-origin hypothesis, it is possible that, in some cases, these two phenomena could be intertwined. For example, recent data have shown that some acral melanomas harbouring amplifications of the CRKL oncogene depend on HOX13 positional identity programs already present in the cell of origin, indicating that oncogenes and cell-of-origin programs can synergize44. Future studies could explore the diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma as acral versus non-acral based on molecular signatures rather than solely on anatomic location. The fact that BRAF-mutated tumours occur less frequently on patients of non-European ancestry highlights the need to study a diverse set of samples to maximize clinical benefit to all patients.

Patients with cluster 1 tumours showed better prognosis than other patients, which is not surprising given their associated clinical characteristics (lower Breslow thickness, a tendency for earlier stages at diagnosis and lower mitotic indexes). However, what may be surprising is the gene expression profile characteristic of this cluster. More CAFs and CD4+ T cells were found by deconvolution to be associated to cluster 1, signatures commonly associated with immunosuppression. A possible explanation is that early-stage tumours are associated with immunosuppressive microenvironments—a balance which, in later tumours, may have been tilted in favour of tumour cell growth. Another potential explanation may involve the recently described roles of CAFs in immunostimulation45. Patients with cluster 2 tumours, with a proliferative signature and expression of pigmentation genes showed the worst survival. It has been observed previously in a zebrafish model and in TCGA samples that a pigmentation signature also predicts worse survival46 and, in a recent report by Liu and collaborators31, acral melanoma tumours with a proliferative signature also were associated with worse survival than other tumours. This study both extends and replicates these findings in acral melanoma.

This study has several limitations, regarding the nature of the samples (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)), and the stringent mutation and copy calling methodology, selected to mitigate artefacts at the cost of sensitivity. This study was also done using whole-exome data, which limits our ability to call mutations in non-coding regions of the genome. There are other challenges of setting up such a study. For instance, the fact that the year of diagnosis preceded the date of recruitment by up to 10 years means that somatic mutations associated with higher mortality rates would be under-represented among those recruited, whereas survival is probably extended over a similarly sized cohort of prospectively recruited cases. To assess the impact of any biases on our interpretation of the impact of mutations, we performed an analysis with only those tumours diagnosed after mid-2016, that is, those closest to the time of recruitment (Methods), obtaining similar results.

All tumours included in this study were confirmed as melanomas arising from glabrous skin. Our data indicate that tumours harbouring BRAF mutations may constitute a distinct subtype, sharing characteristics with superficial spreading and acral melanoma. These findings would have implications for patient selection in clinical trials evaluating new therapies for acral melanoma. Overall, we were able to identify new associations of the germline and somatic profile in acral melanoma, genomic-clinical correlates of overall and recurrence-free survival, as well as transcriptional differences in BRAF-mutated acral melanomas. This study shows the value of studying diverse populations, allowing us to uncover previously unreported relationships and better understand tumour evolution.

A flowchart describing the analyses, steps and number of samples used in each individual section can be found in Supplementary Fig. 5.

The protocol for sample collection was approved by the Mexican National Cancer Institute's (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, INCan, México) Ethics and Research committees (017/041/PBI;CEI/1209/17) and the United Kingdom's National Health Service (18/EE/00076). Patient samples collected for the Utah cohort analysis were derived as described previously47.

Recruitment of patients and sample collection took place from 2017 to 2019. Patients attending follow-up appointments at INCan who had previously been diagnosed with acral melanoma were offered the chance to participate in this study and, upon signing a written consent form, were asked to provide access to a FFPE sample of their tumour tissue that had been kept at the INCan tumour bank, as well as a saliva or normal adjacent tissue sample. Patients provided samples and their clinical data in Excel format with written informed consent. FFPE samples underwent inspection by a medical pathologist to establish whether sufficient tumour tissue was available for exome sequencing. Saliva samples were collected using the oragene DNA kit (DNAGenotek, catalogue no. OG-500).

DNA extraction from all saliva samples was performed at the International Laboratory for Human Genome Research from the National Autonomous University of México (LIIGH-UNAM) using the reagent prepITL2P (DNAGenotek, catalogue no. PT-L2P) and the All-Prep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, catalogue no. 80224). DNA and RNA extraction from FFPE samples was performed at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (UK) using the All-prep DNA/RNA FFPE Qiagen kit. Samples with >0.1 ng μl−1 were sequenced through the Sanger Institute's standard pipeline. Saliva and adjacent tissue samples were used for whole-exome sequencing, and only saliva samples were used for genotyping.

Genotyping was performed using Illumina's Infinium Multi-Ethnic AMR/AFR-8 v.1.0 array at King's College London and Infinium Global Screening Array v.3.0 at University College London. Sufficient germline DNA was available for genotyping for 80 out of 92 samples (86.9%). Ancestry estimation was performed using PLINK v.1.9, and ADMIXTURE48 v.1.3.0 for unsupervised analysis together with the superpopulations of the 1000 Genomes dataset49. Five superpopulations were identified, corresponding to AFR (Q1), AMR (Q2), SAS (Q3), EAS (Q4) and EUR (Q5) (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

FFPE samples, saliva and normal adjacent tissue underwent whole-exome sequencing as follows: Exome capture was performed using Agilent SureSelect AllExon v.5 probes and paired-end sequencing was performed at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (UK) in Illumina HiSeq 4000 machines. Control and tumour samples were sequenced to a mean coverage of 43.72×. Alignment was done using BWA-mem50 v.0.7.17, using the GRCh38 reference genome. Sequencing quality filters were performed using Samtools v.1.9 stats51 and fastqc v.0.11.3 (ref. 52). Sample contamination was estimated using the GATK v.4.2.3.0 tool CalculateContamination53. Concordance between sample pairs was estimated using the Conpair v.0.2 tool54. Samples that had less than 90% similarity with their pair (tumour-normal) or showed a level of contamination above 5% were excluded from the study. After this step, 123 samples remained for further analysis.

The nature of our samples (FFPE) may introduce artefacts that affect our ability to identify SNVs and indels accurately. Therefore, to mitigate this risk and increase specificity, we used three different variant calling tools, albeit at the cost of reduced sensitivity. As formalin fixation can generate DNA fragmentation, this may also affect copy number estimation analyses and, consequently, copy number mutational signature analysis. To mitigate this, we stringently filtered the samples used for this analysis, which affected our statistical power due to a reduced sample size.

Somatic variant calling was done using three different tools (cgpCaVEMan55 v.1.15.2, Mutect2 (ref. 56) v.4.1.0.0 and Varscan2 (ref. 57) v.2.3.9), keeping only the variants identified by a minimum of two out of the three tools. SmartPhase v.1.2.1 (ref. 58) was used for variant pairs phasing. VCF handling was done using bcftools v.1.9 (ref. 59). For BRAFV600E mutations, we kept these variants even if they were identified by only one of the tools as its oncogenicity and relevance in melanoma is well known. When available within the variant calling tool, strand bias filters were applied. A minimum base quality score of 30 on the Phred scale was used. Indel calling was performed using cgpPindel60,61 v.1.15.2. When selecting one sample per patient, preference was given to primaries, and metastases or recurrences were chosen only when a primary had not been collected.

Significantly mutated genes were identified using the tool dNdScv62 v.0.0.1.0 with default parameters using SNVs identified by two of the three tools used for variant calling and indels identified by pindel as input data. Positive selection was considered for genes that had global Q values below 0.1 according to the dNdScv tool recommendations. Visualization of variants was done using Maftools v.2.2.10 (ref. 63).

Two lymph node metastasis samples (one from a patient that had a BRAFV600E mutation and another one with an NRAS mutation) and their primaries were annotated as having the same mutation for follow-up analysis after manual inspection using IGV64.

Statistical tests were performed to identify potential clinical and ancestry covariates that correlated with driver mutational status. For tumour stage, sex, ulceration status and tumour site, which are discrete variables, association was tested with contingency Chi-squared tests.

For each of the four driver genes, a logistic regression model was fitted to predict the presence or absence of a mutation on the acral melanoma samples using the inferred ADMIXTURE48 cluster related to the European ancestry component from the 1000 Genomes Project, correcting for age, sex and total TMB (total TMB, SNVs + indels), as such: driver gene status ~ EUR related cluster proportion + age + sex + total TMB. The log odds related to the EUR cluster were then plotted with their respective confidence intervals. The models were constructed using 80 samples out of the 92, which were those with available genotyping information and with all tested covariables available.

Sequenza65 v.3.0.0 and ASCAT66 v.3.1.2 were used to estimate ploidy and purity values for each sample. These values per sample were compared between the two tools, and samples that had a high discrepancy in their purity estimates (less than 0.15 versus 1, respectively) were filtered out (Supplementary Table 28). Samples with an estimated goodness of fit below 95 were also filtered out. Subsequently, copy number, cellularity and ploidy values estimated by ASCAT were used in follow-up analyses. Whole genome duplication events were assigned as reported by ASCAT. Regions significantly affected by CNAs were identified using GISTIC2 (ref. 67) v.2.0.23. Amplifications were classified as low-level amplifications when regions had a copy number gain above 0.25 and below 0.9, and as high-level amplifications when regions had a copy number gain above 0.9 according to GISTIC2 values; deletions were classified as low-level deletions when regions had a copy number change between −0.25 and −1.3 and as high-level deletions when regions had a copy number change lower than −1.3. Only peaks with residual Q values < 0.1 were considered as significantly altered. For the analyses of differences in CNA burden by sample group (mutational status or site of presentation), we used the CNApp tool68 to generate GCS, focal copy number alteration scores and broad copy number alteration scores, calculating segment means (seg.mean) as log2(cn/ploidy) and using default parameters. GCS is a number quantifying the copy number aberration level in each sample provided by the CNApp tool68. Higher GCS scores indicate a higher burden of copy number aberrations compared with all other samples in the cohort. GCS is the sum of the normalized broad copy number alteration score and focal copy number alteration score, which are calculated considering broad (chromosome and arm-level) and focal (weighted focal CNAs corrected by the amplitude and length of the segment) aberrations per sample. These values are calculated using as input the number of DNA copies normalized by sample ploidy. A more detailed explanation can be found in the original publication68. GCS values were used for comparisons between sample groups. All paired comparisons between groups were evaluated with a Mann–Whitney test.

To further scrutinise the presence of deletions in tumour suppressors NF1 and CDKN2A, we used CNVkit69 v.0.9.10. We called copy number alterations against a pooled reference generated from the highest quality normal samples, and generated bin-level and segmented level log2 ratios. We calculated the log2 ratio estimated for homozygous deletions for each sample based on ASCAT's estimation of ploidy and purity as published previously25. For NF1—a large gene—we considered homozygous focal deletions when at least two contiguous bins had log2 ratios at or below the calculated threshold for that sample, or at least one full exon has read coverage equal to zero. For CDKN2A—a small gene—we considered a sample as having a homozygous deletion if it had at least one bin below the threshold, at least two other bins close to the threshold and a noticeable difference in log2 ratios for bins falling in CDKN2A in comparison with its neighbours by manual scrutiny.

Mutational matrices were generated using SigProfilerMatrixGenerator70 v.1.2.20. These matrices, with single nucleotide mutations found by at least two of the three variant callers and all insertions and deletions identified by cgpPindel, were used as input for mutational signature extraction using SigProfilerExtractor71 v.1.1.23 and decomposition to COSMICv.3.4 (ref. 72) reference mutational signatures72. For single base substitutions, the standard SBS-96 mutational context was used, with default parameters and a minimum and maximum number of output signatures being set as one and five, respectively. A total of 116 samples with an SNV count > 0, were used for this analysis. For copy number signature analysis, all 60 samples with available copy number data were used with default parameters, and using the standard CN-48 context from COSMICv.3.4.

Total RNA library preparation followed by exome capture using Agilent SureSelect AllExon v.5 was performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000 machines. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome using the splice-aware aligner STAR73 v.2.5.0. Of these, we focused on the 77 samples that came from different patients, that had matching DNA and were primaries for the score analysis (see below). We then applied further quality control filters for the consensus clustering analysis: samples were excluded if total read counts were fewer than 25 million, or if the sum of ambiguous reads and no feature counts was greater than the sum of all gene read pair counts. Forty-four samples remained for downstream analysis. Counts were generated with HTSeq74 v.0.7.2. Transcripts per million normalization was performed and values were log2(transcripts per million + 1) transformed.

Patient samples collected for the Utah cohort analysis were derived as described previously47. Invasive acral and non-acral cutaneous melanomas were identified and collected as part of the University of Utah IRB umbrella protocol no. 76927, Project no. 60, and RNA was extracted and quantified as described previously47. A custom NanoString nCounter XT CodeSet (NanoString Technologies) was designed to include genes differentially expressed between glabrous and non-glabrous melanocytes43,44. Sample hybridization and processing were performed in the Molecular Diagnostics core facility at Huntsman Cancer Institute. Data were collected using the nCounter Digital Analyzer. Raw NanoString counts were normalized using the nSolver Analysis Software (NanoString Technologies). Normalization was carried out using the geometric mean of housekeeping genes included in the panel (Supplementary Table 16). Background thresholding was performed using a threshold count value of 20. Fold change estimation was calculated by partitioning by acral versus cutaneous melanoma. The log2 normalized gene expression data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) using the PCA function in Prism v.10.2.1 (GraphPad Software). PCA was performed to identify the main sources of variability in the data and to distinguish between acral and cutaneous samples.

To determine the top differentially expressed genes contributing to the variance between acral melanomas and cutaneous melanomas, the loadings of the second principal component (PC2) were examined. Genes with the highest positive and negative loadings on PC2 were selected as the top ten and bottom ten genes, respectively; log2 expression values of these genes were used to generate a multiplicative score, producing the ratio of acral to cutaneous melanocyte genes. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism v.10.2.1 (GraphPad Software). Differences in acral to cutaneous ratios were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U test.

The acral:cutaneous (A:C) ratio was calculated for each of the 77 primary acral tumours using the method described above after batch correction (limma v.3.64.1, ref. 75) on normalized and transformed expression data processed by the R package DESeq2 v.1.48.1 (ref. 76). Differences in the A:C gene expression ratio scores between BRAF-activating mutation-positive and BRAF-wild-type acral melanoma samples were assessed using a Mann–Whitney U test. The same normalization, scoring method and statistical testing was applied to the 63 transcriptomes from acral melanoma tumours considering BRAF-activating (n = 10) and wild type (n = 53) in Newell et al.15. All available samples in this cohort were used, as only one primary had a BRAF mutation. Only samples with BRAF-activating mutations (V600E and L597R for the Mexican acral melanoma set) were included in the BRAF group.

To determine whether the cutaneous melanoma classifier genes are induced by BRAFV600E signalling in melanocytes, we analysed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from McNeal et al.40, which consisted of bulk-RNA-seq of primary human melanocytes transduced with BRAFV600E and cultured under two conditions: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and endothelin-1 (ET1). We extracted normalized expression values for cutaneous melanoma classifier genes across four conditions: PMA, PMA + BRAFV600E, ET1 and ET1 + BRAFV600E. Normalized expression levels were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test in Prism v.10.2.1 (GraphPad Software).

We evaluated the A:C classifier in clinical melanoma samples using RNA-seq data from TCGA Skin Cutaneous Melanoma Firehose Legacy cohort. Normalized gene expression data were downloaded from cBioPortal77. Samples were classified as BRAF-activating or BRAF-wild type in the same way as for Fig. 3c. We calculated the product of the expression of cutaneous melanoma classifier genes for each category. Differences were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U test.

We used an interactive Shiny application, What Is My Melanocytic Signature (WIMMS; https://wimms.tanlab.org)41 to compare transcriptional programs associated with distinct melanocytic cell states. WIMMS classifies melanocytic gene expression profiles by aggregating previously published gene expression signatures and clusters them into seven principal cell state categories. We input our gene signature into WIMMS to assess correlation with these reference states. The resulting dendrogram (Extended Data Fig. 6b) represents the relationship between our classifier-derived cutaneous melanoma genes and known signatures.

To identify molecular subgroups based on transcriptome data, we performed consensus clustering using the Cola R v.2.10.1 package78. Standard preprocessing of the input matrix was performed, including removal of rows in which more than 25% of the samples had ‘NA' (not available) values, imputation of missing values, replacement of values higher than the 95th percentile or less than 5th by corresponding percentiles, removal of rows with zero variance and removal of rows with variance less than the 5th percentile of all row variances. Consensus clustering was performed using several algorithms (k-means, partitioning around medoids, hierarchical clustering) and feature selection methods (s.d., median absolute deviation, coefficient of variation) to ensure robust partition identification. The optimal number of clusters was determined using several stability metrics including 1-PAC (Proportion of Ambiguous Clustering) score, concordance and index, Jaccard index, coefficient and visual inspection of the consensus matrix through heatmaps visualizations. The best-performing method (s.d.:partitioning around medoids with k = 3) was selected based on highest consensus scores and biological interpretability.

Following sample clustering, we performed a two-level signature analysis to characterize both sample clusters and gene co-expression modules.

Characterization of sample clusters was performed by identifying genes with significantly different expression across the three identified sample groups using F-tests with false discovery rate correction (P < 0.05). For each differentially expressed gene, we determined the sample cluster with highest mean expression to characterize the molecular profiles of patient subgroups.

To understand co-expression patterns within signature genes, we applied k-means clustering (k = 3) to group signature genes based on their scaled expression profiles across the three sample clusters. This identified gene modules (M1, M2, M3) representing distinct biological programs that may be co-ordinately regulated across different sample subtypes (Supplementary Tables 17–20).

Functional enrichment was performed separately for each gene module using over-representation analysis with the clusterProfiler R package v.4.12.6 (ref. 79). Gene Ontology Biological Process terms were tested using the hypergeometric test with Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate correction (Q < 0.05). Ensembl gene identifiers were mapped to gene symbols using the org.Hs.eg.db v.3.19.1 (ref. 80) annotation package before enrichment analysis (Supplementary Tables 17–20).

The EPIC algorithm81 v.1.1.7 was used in the R programming environment to perform deconvolution to infer immune and stromal cell fractions within acral melanoma tumours. We used the TRef signature method with default parameters, which includes gene expression reference profiles from tumour-infiltrating cells. The algorithm generated an absolute score that could be interpreted as a cell fraction.

Consenting and recruitment of patients started in 2017 and ended in 2019. Because of the challenges of recruiting sufficient numbers of participants with acral melanoma, patients diagnosed in earlier years who were still attending follow-up clinics for primary or recurrent disease were recruited. To ensue data consistency, only participants with a primary available for analysis were the subject of focus on analyses of recurrence and/or death (n = 85 patients). In total, 73 participants were recruited whose primary and ancestry data were available for analysis on driver mutations. A total of 44 patients with primary and RNA cluster data available were used for analysis on clusters regardless of their ancestry data availability. Analyses were performed with Stata v.19.5 (ref. 82).

To compare the effect of distinct driver mutations and the RNA clusters, we examined two measures of disease severity: (1) the recurrence of the primary tumour and (2) overall survival. For recurrence, we examined time to recurrence using a life-table approach from date of primary diagnosis onwards as a descriptor, and based analyses of differences between mutations (and clusters) on logistical regression adjusting for date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, sex, stage at diagnosis (advanced/early), ancestry (only for mutations) and time from diagnosis through either death or last known to be alive. Primary tumours were either classified as QWT or mutated for known drivers; tumours with several driver mutations were classified as ‘multi-hit'. We also conducted analyses based on a binary exposure of ‘QWT' or ‘Mutated' tumour based on the existence of one or more mutations in a known driver gene.

For survival analysis, we also included a life-table approach, again as a descriptor, based on time from diagnosis through to date of death or date last known to be alive. Statistical assessment of the effect of each mutation and/or cluster were based on Cox proportional hazard analysis with follow-up starting from date of recruitment through to date of death (or last date alive) adjusting for date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, sex and ancestry (as a sensitivity analysis). Analysis of combined mutations were also conducted as for the recurrence analysis.

To assess the impact of any biases on our interpretation of the impact of mutations, we restricted attention to the 40 tumours diagnosed since the beginning of 2017, that is, those closest to the time of recruitment. Analysis of survival gave qualitatively and quantitatively similar results to those reported above; in total, 7 of 23 (30.4%) of cases with mutated tumours had died, as opposed to 1 of 17 among cases with QWT tumours (P value = 0.055). In the analysis of recurrence, again results matched with 70.0% of cases with mutated tumours recurring (16 of 23 cases) compared with 17.7% of QWT tumours (3 of 17; P value = 0.001). Results for the RNA clusters were similar to the results quoted above for both survival and recurrence.

Data formatting and handling were performed using Python and R.

Each row represents one sample, with the left panel displaying the whole chromosome and the right panel a close up view at the gene region. Each point represents a bin as calculated by the CNVkit algortihm, the x-axis represents chromosomal position and the y-axis the log2 ratio calculated with CNVkit. Red dots indicate bins falling in the gene region. The purple dotted line represents the expected log2 ratio for a homozygous deletion (Methods). The orange lines represent segmented data. a) NF1 gene. PD40986d and PD41020d are secondary samples and a different sample was selected as representative for these patients. b) CDKN2A region.

a) Oncoplot depicting the seven most mutated genes according to dNdScv and five selected genes based on mutational frequency and biological function. Mutational classification, sample type, tumour stage, sex, age at diagnosis, ulceration status, tumour site and mutational spectra are shown by sample. Primary samples were selected preferentially for this analysis. One sample where no mutations were detected is not depicted in the oncoplot. b) Mutations found in PTPRJ, ATM, NF2 and RDH5, for which all mutations are deleterious and are found altered each in two samples.

All depicted regions have been identified by GISTIC2 analysis per group of samples. Statistically significant differences are marked in colour, green = amplified in mutated tumours, red = amplified in QWT, yellow = deleted in mutated tumours, blue = deleted in QWT tumours. Differences are determined first by assessing the global GISTIC2 output and determining differences between groups by one-sided Fisher's exact test (P-value < 0.05). If a region is not found in the global GISTIC2 output, but it is found only in the analysis per group, we have indicated it as statistically different. Number of mutated tumours = 23, number of QWT tumours = 24.

Top panel. Number of significant regions altered by sample. Bottom panel. Binary heatmap showing the significantly altered regions identified by GISTIC2 per sample. One sample per patient is shown. Heatmap is ordered on the X axis by mutational classification and on the Y axis by frequency of alterations per region. As a note, sample PD41002a does not show a deletion in CDKN2A (Deletion peak 3) by GISTIC2 analysis, but a deletion was detected by CNVkit (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1).

a) The SNV component of tumour mutational burden per sample. b-c) Proportions of mutational signatures per sample are shown in stacked bars for single base substitutions (b), and copy-number aberrations (c). In b) and c), samples with a light gray background did not have data available. Genomic subtypes and clinical characteristics are plotted at the bottom. As a note, mutational signature CN48F in c) is a de novo mutational signature that was not successfully reconstructed by COSMIC reference mutational signatures, and was therefore considered as novel.

After years spent finding and investigating data breaches, Greg Pollock admits that when he comes across yet another exposed database full of passwords and Social Security numbers, “I come to it with some fatigue.” But Pollock, director of research at the cybersecurity company UpGuard, says he and his colleagues found an exposed, publicly accessible database online in January that appeared to contain a trove of Americans' sensitive personal data so massive that his weariness lifted and they sprang to action to validate the finding.

The UpGuard researchers point out that not all of the records represent unique, valid information, but the raw totals they found in the January exposure included roughly 3 billion email addresses and passwords as well as about 2.7 billion records that included Social Security numbers. It was unclear who had set up the database, but it seemed to contain personal details that may have been cobbled together from multiple historic data breaches—including, perhaps, the trove from the 2024 breach of the background-checking service National Public Data. It is common for data brokers and cybercriminals to combine and recombine old datasets, but the scale and the potential quantity of Social Security numbers—even if only a fraction of them were real—was striking.

“Every week, there's another finding where it looks big on paper, but it's probably not very novel,” Pollock says. “So I was surprised when I started digging into the specific cases here to validate the data. In some cases, the identities in this data breach are at risk because they have been exposed, but they have not yet been exploited.”

The data was hosted by the German cloud provider Hetzner. Since Pollock could not identify an owner of the database to contact, he notified Hetzner on January 16. The company, in turn, said it notified its customer, which removed the data on January 21.

Hetzner did not provide WIRED with comment ahead of publication.

The researchers did not download the entire dataset for analysis due to its size and sensitivity. Instead they worked with a sample of 2.8 million records—a tiny fraction of the total trove. By analyzing trends in the data, including the popularity of certain cultural references in passwords, they concluded that much of the data likely dates to the United States in roughly 2015. For example, passwords referencing One Direction, Fall Out Boy, and Taylor Swift were very common. Meanwhile, references to Blackpink, Katseye, and Btsarmy were just barely beginning to show up.

Old data is still valuable for two reasons. First, people often reuse the same email address and password, or a variation of the password, across many different websites and services. This means that cybercriminals can keep trying the same login credentials for the same people over time. The second reason is that people's Social Security numbers are often linked to their most sensitive and high-stakes data but almost never change during their lifetimes. As a result, valid SSNs are one of the crown jewels of identity theft for attackers.

In the sample of data the researchers reviewed, Pollock says that one in four Social Security numbers appeared to be valid and legitimate. The sample was too small to extrapolate to the entire dataset, but a quarter of all the records containing SSNs would be 675 million. A fraction of that would still represent a very significant set of Social Security numbers.

To verify the data, UpGuard researchers contacted a handful of people whose data appeared in the leaked trove. Pollock emphasizes that one of the most concerning findings from speaking to those individuals was that not all of them have had their identities stolen or suffered hacks. In other words, there was information in the database that has not been exploited by cybercriminals—and potential victims don't necessarily know that their information has been exposed.

The finding is a reminder, Pollock says, of how incidents like the 2015 US Office of Personnel Management breach or the 2017 breach of credit bureau Equifax create a long tail of uncertainty for anyone whose data was stolen. Similarly, he notes that recent erosion of safeguards that separated data within the US federal government creates privacy and security risks.

“I do not at all think this is the data the DOGE group mishandled, but I do think that's another example of how mistakes in how you handle data can have impacts for decades,” he says. “These are land mines that have been put down and then are dangerous forever.”

A parent's intuition about their child's condition is a significant medical indicator. A new study from the University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital shows that even comprehensive digital symptom questionnaires may not improve assessment if the parent's underlying concern is overlooked.

According to the study, a simple question about concern can help quickly identify most children with sudden and severe illness  -  supporting early clinical attention. Clear or strong concern from parents identified as many as 91 per cent of seriously ill children.

The study included 2,375 patients at the children's and adolescents' emergency department of Oulu University Hospital. Parents completed an extensive 36-item questionnaire before the professional assessment. Around one in four children was found to have a severe illness requiring intensive care, surgery or a prolonged hospital stay.

A key finding was that additional questions or more detailed medical information in the questionnaire did not improve the accuracy of parents' advance assessments.

“Parental concern is an important warning sign. If a parent is worried about the condition of their suddenly ill child, the child must have the opportunity to be assessed by a doctor. A worried parent should not be left alone to make a remote assessment of their child's condition,” emphasizes pediatrician and MD, PhD Hilla Pöyry.

The study examined whether reliable home-use tools could be developed for parents to assess the condition of a sick child. However, the extensive 36-item questionnaire did not produce a sufficiently sensitive or accurate method to replace an emergency department visit – especially in situations where the parent was already concerned about the child's condition.

The study provides an important perspective for the health and social care discussion at a time when digital and AI-based tools are being widely introduced in healthcare services.

“Our results show that such tools require careful validation, and they do not yet replace the assessment of a healthcare professional. Although a parent may not always be able to describe the child's symptoms in detail or accurately, they recognize a serious illness very well when asked a simple concern-based question,” Pöyry stresses.

F1 Bahrain Testing Week 2 2026: Day 1 Highlights

Bearman: 'We haven't unlocked the full potential of the car'

As he prepares for his second season at Ferrari, Lewis Hamilton has explained why he has a ""positive feeling"".

Lewis Hamilton has spoken of being “in the best place I've been in for a long time” ahead of the 2026 season, with the Briton also admitting to feeling “more connected” to Ferrari's new car as he enters his second year of racing for the team.

The 2025 campaign was one of ups and downs for Hamilton as he adapted to the Scuderia, having made the switch to the Italian outfit following 12 seasons as a Mercedes driver.

Following the end of last year, it has since been confirmed that the seven-time World Champion will work with a new race engineer going forwards after Riccardo Adami moved to a role within the squad's academy.

When asked during the second 2026 pre-season test in Bahrain how he has found the experience of settling in at the outfit, Hamilton reflected: “It's definitely been a challenge and one that I've enjoyed for the most part of it.

“Having had a year now with the team, everything is much more settled, the ins and outs of the working relationship. I'm really, really excited about this season – I think everyone's really showed up with really great positivity.

“Even at the end of the last year, the empathy within the team and the hunger, you could see as I travelled around the workshop to go and see people before Christmas, and then to see them show up this year, it's a really positive feeling so far.”

Ferrari appeared to have a solid outing during the first test at the Bahrain International Circuit, racking up 420 laps – a tally bettered only by McLaren and Williams – whilst also seeming to have good reliability.

Pushed on whether this is the most optimistic he has felt at the start of a season for the last five years, Hamilton answered: “I don't remember the last five years, but maybe, yeah.

“I think I always try to enter into a season with confidence, but of course you're faced with all sorts of different challenges along the way. I think this is definitely for me… I've obviously gone through quite a bit, and for me left everything – all of last year is behind me.

“I really felt like I spent a lot of time rebuilding over this winter, refocusing, really getting my body and my mind to a much better place. In general, just making sure that I'm able to arrive feeling better.

“I generally feel personally in the best place that I've been in a long, long time, with rearranging things within my team. And then the car, we've started off quite well so far. It's an exciting time with this new generation of car as well, because it's all brand new – we're all trying to figure it out on the go.

“Last year we were locked into a car that obviously I inherited – this is a car that I've been able to be a part of developing on the simulator for the last 10 months, eight months, so a bit of my DNA is within it so I'm more connected to this one, for sure.”

Hamilton also reiterated that he remains as confident in what Ferrari can achieve as he was when he first signed for the squad.

“My belief in the team is still absolutely the same,” the 41-year-old said. “[I have] 100% faith in this team and what they're capable of, and that's why I joined the team.

“I knew it wasn't going to be an overnight thing, that we'd have success immediately – that's why I signed a longer deal, because I knew it was… more often than not it is a process. I feel like we've also learned a huge amount from last year as a team, and there have been changes that we've made.

“Everyone's constantly keen to make improvements and be better, so I think we're working better together than ever before. I'm excited for that.”

The way I need Noah Reid to be Coach Wiebe in Heated Rivalry season 2 *fingers crossed*

I love this cast.  HBO, you know we want to see it, so you know what to do.  Do it before some other streamer does.

Lisa Rinna shared new details about her shocking exit from “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” in 2023.

In an excerpt from her upcoming tell-all, “You Better Believe I'm Gonna Talk About It,” the Bravo TV veteran, who most recently appeared on the Peacock's “The Traitors,” revealed that her social media opinions got her into trouble with the network, further fueling her decision to quit RHOBH after eight seasons.

“I've gotten into so much trouble for expressing myself,” Rinna, 62, stated in her memoir, via an audiobook clip posted by entertainment journalist Gibson Johns on TikTok. “I've literally been fined $50,000 by Bravo for opening my mouth and unleashing impulsive opinions on Instagram. That's one reason why, after eight years clawing my way to the top of RHOBH, I decided to leave the show,” she added.

Rinna previously told People magazine that she planned to tell her whole truth in her book. “I don't know if everyone is ready for all of the truth I am unloading in this book. But I was certainly ready to tell it,” she teased.

Part of her truth was about her decision to leave RHOBH.

“Listen, I had a great time,” she shared in her book. “It was really only the last year that sucked.  Before that there had been a lot of laughs, so many great stories, and many epic moments with these ladies. It was a good time, until it wasn't.”

In a February 2026 appearance on Sirius XM's “The Julia Cunningham Show,” Rinna noted that her alleged 2022 off-camera argument with co-star Kathy Hilton in Aspen contributed to her exit from the show.

After Hilton's publicist entered the mix, she knew trouble was brewing, so she decided to quit before she was fired. “Nobody fought to have me stay. So I think it was very mutual at the end of the day, Rinna said.

Who can forget when Rinna asked Dorit this?! #RHOBH #RealityTV #Hayu

Another reason Rinna's final RHOBH season was so difficult was because filming began while she was still processing the death of her mother.

“You know my mother had passed away, and you know, truth be told, I should have taken a moment and not maybe done that year and just done the grieving and not done the show,” she  admitted on Sirius XM's “Jeff Lewis Live.” “I think that was where I made a mistake. …I was not in a headspace to do it. …So, it was a really, really difficult ending to that chapter. I was in a lot of pain, and I'm totally different now.”

Oh please Lisa.  OWN IT
Stop with the damn excuses. Your behavior towards Denise really showed the snake that you are.  Who treats a friend of 20 YEARS that way?
And your baseless accusations regarding Kathy Hilton were vile and disgusting.  You kept repeating it over and over and over.  It was unnecessary and mean spirited.  As sad as it was to hear of your mothers passing it isn't a get out of jail card for rude behavior. Your exit was the best thing that happened on RHOBH
Good riddance

							By 

	Andy Greene



U2 have emerged from a long hiatus with a surprise six-song EP, Days of Ash, available now, in which they address political flashpoints around the world, including ICE raids in the U.S., the Iranian uprisings, the war in Ukraine, and Israeli settlements in the West Bank.


	The six songs — “American Obituary,” “The Tears of Things,” “Song of the Future,” “Wildpeace,” “One Life at a Time,” and “Yours Eternally” (featuring Ed Sheeran and Taras Topolia) — are all on streaming platforms. They've also created lyric videos for each one.


	“It's been a thrill having the four of us back together in the studio over the last year,” Bono says in a statement. “The songs on Days of Ash are very different in mood and theme to the ones we're going to put on our album later in the year. These EP tracks couldn't wait; these songs were impatient to be out in the world. They are songs of defiance and dismay, of lamentation. Songs of celebration will follow, we're working on those now … because for all the awfulness we see normalized daily on our small screens, there's nothing normal about these mad and maddening times and we need to stand up to them before we can go back to having faith in the future.”

	











	The EP kicks off with “American Obituary,” which is dedicated to Renee Good, who was killed by ICE officers in Minneapolis during a protest. “Renee Good born to die free,” Bono sings. “American mother of three/Seventh day January/A bullet for each child, you see.”


	In a new interview with the U2 fanzine Propaganda — which is being relaunched as a one-off digital zine and will also be available in print at select stores — Bono discusses the song. “The rhythm of the lyric is a nod to one of my favorite Bob Dylan songs, ‘It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),'” he says. “In his song the child is singing to the mother, and in ours the mother is singing to her children: ‘I love you more than hate loves war.'”


	“The Tears of Things” takes its title from the 2025 Richard Rohr book, The Tears of Things: Prophetic Wisdom for an Age of Outrage. It's an imaginary conversation between Michelangelo and his statue, David, reflecting the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza. “If you put a man into a cage and rattle it long enough,” Bono sings, “A man becomes the kind of rage that cannot be locked up … The tears of things/Let the desert be unfrozen.”

	In the Propaganda interview, Bono says that the band has become close to Richard Rohr, and finds deep meaning in his writings. “He's a mystic, a deep thinker,” Bono says. “[His book] suggests that the greatest of the Jewish prophets found a way to push through their rage and anger at the injustices of the day, until they ended up in tears.”


	“Song of the Future” is a tribute to 16-year-old Iranian Sarina Esmailzadeh, who was beaten to death by Iranian security forces after participating in the 2022 Women, Life, Freedom movement. “Here again, we have a priestly class of men whose subjective interpretation of sacred text becomes a club to beat the heads in of anyone who disagree,” Bono says. “We all remake God in our own image to some degree, but sadly, it's much more likely that we create a God of fire and brimstone than a God of ‘love and mercy,' to quote Brian Wilson.”


	“Wildpeace” is a poem by Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai read by Nigerian artist Adeola Fayehun, set to music written and arranged by producer Jacknife Lee. “I can hardly listen to [Fayehun]'s voice,” Bono says. “It cuts right through me and somehow suggests other conflicts on the African continent just by the lily of her achingly beautiful voice … Sudan, dead God.”

	“One Life at a Time” was inspired by the 2025 Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land. They wrote it for Palestinian Awdah Hathaleen, a consultant on the film, who was killed in his West Bank village by an Israeli settler. The title of the song comes from a line that No Other Land filmmaker Basel Adra said at his funeral. “One life at a time is kinda an existential suggestion,” Bono says. “We can change the world for the better or for the worse … one life at a time.”

Days of Ash wraps up with “Yours Eternally,” which features guest appearances by Ed Sheeran and Ukrainian singer Taras Topolia, whom Edge and Bono met when they traveled to Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion. The lyrics began as a letter to him. “When we told [Ed Sheeran] about this song in a shape of a letter wondering if he could be the voice replying to the letter, he jumped right on it, but with a caveat,” Bono says. “[He said], ‘I love the song, I love Ukraine. But I'd rather not be a part of any political polemic right now.… You're not going to get me involved in politics, are you?' ‘No, of course not, Ed.' I might have been bluffing there.”

	











	The songs are produced by the band's longtime collaborator Jacknife Lee. “Who needs to hear a new record from us?” U2 drummer Larry Mullen Jr. asks in a statement. “It just depends on whether we're making music we feel deserves to be heard. I believe these new songs stand up to our best work. We talk a lot about when to release new tracks. You don't always know … the way the world is now feels like the right moment. Going way back to our earliest days, working with Amnesty or Greenpeace, we've never shied away from taking a position, and sometimes that can get a bit messy, there's always some sort of blowback, but it's a big side of who we are and why we still exist.”
