Editor's Note: The following story contains spoilers for “Wuthering Heights.” Whatever else you might think of it, there's no denying writer and director Emerald Fennell designed her adaptation of “Wuthering Heights” to be gleefully jarring. Maybe no moment exemplifies this better than the near jumpscare of Cathy (Margot Robbie) returning to her not-so-homey childhood abode to find her father, Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes), dead on the ground in basically Peter Griffin pose, surrounded by piles of gin bottles rising to the rafters. Fennell wrote into the script that Earnshaw would meet his end surrounded by mountains of empty bottles, but it was on Davies to translate that into a reality — or at least as much of a reality for the world of the often unreal, dreamlike, and deliberately artificial-looking “Wuthering Heights.” Related Stories ‘Flies' Review: A 9-Year-Old Isn't the Only One Coming of Age in This Droll Mexico City Delight How ‘A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' Goes Under Dunk's Helmet — and Inside His Panic Attack “Oh my God, that was such fun to do!” Davies told IndieWire. I thought, ‘That's a lot of gin.' We'd been practicing it because, obviously, on a schedule, you can't just dress those in. [And] Emerald just said, ‘I think we need more. The twin peaks ended up over seven feet tall, made of a collage of mostly lightweight plastic bottles, with the odd real glass bottle here and there to create a bit of shine against DP Linus Sandgren's ghoulish, slightly greenish lights. Davies said that the monstrous nature of those sky-high bottle piles is not only a visual match for Earnshaw and the horror of what a drunk he was. “We wanted the omnipresence of nature taking over in all forms. Everything was just the heaviness and pressure of that building and the uncomfortable nature of what's going on in that world,” Davies said. By this point in the film, Davies and her team had already done a lot of work, giving the space an emotional trajectory similar to Cathy and Heathcliff's self-destruction over their feelings for each other. Freed from any sort of period accuracy, Davies tried to start the house in a spartan, memory-like state, as Cathy and Heathcliff would remember it from childhood. There's not the usual accoutrements of a kitchen. “The idea that it was gonna be about a feeling more than anything. The fireplace was designed as if it had been built out of that rock, and then it too starts to sweat — those who've seen Isabella and Heathcliff's scenes as a married couple know why. “You're just given this opportunity to safely make crazy decisions,” Davies said. “Although it's [Emerald's] story, she's happy [for everyone to have], and expects everyone to have an opinion, and suggestions. It's like, ‘This is what I'm after. You end up building this visual language that, luckily, over two films [including ‘Saltburn'], I feel like I sort of know her groove,” Davies said. “She pushes me in a direction I would not normally go, and it's just brilliant for a creative role to have that freedom to just go a little bit crazy.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

Ceesay opted for the more challenging Dark Roast questions and explained how he found the good in such a nefarious character.

I know he was doing some really horrendous things, morally speaking, but I thought ‘He's still a human being.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans of the movie think it delivers style over substance in a good way, while detractors think it prioritizes style over substance in a bad one. In fact, there's actually an underappreciated core to Fennell's loose adaptation. Her Wuthering Heights may market itself as a dark and steamy Valentine's Day romance, but at its heart it's actually a story of childhood trauma bonds run amok. It's a theme that emerges thanks to one of the bigger changes Fennell makes to her exploration of the doomed love story between Cathy Earnshaw (Margot Robbie) and Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi). In the novel, Cathy's father is a minor supporting character who adopts an orphaned Heathcliff as his favorite child but then dies relatively early into the story. It's then Cathy's older brother Hindley (a character the film cuts entirely) who inherits the Wuthering Heights estate and proceeds to jealously mistreat Heathcliff—forcing him to live and work as a servant, thus setting up the class/social stratification that keeps Cathy and Heathcliff apart. In the movie, however, we simply have Cathy's alcoholic father Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes), who brings Heathcliff home to save him, but then proceeds to mistreat him as well. That simple act of character condensing shifts the entire story. While Brontë's Wuthering Heights begins with a stable family that's slowly corrupted by jealousy and grief, Fennell begins with a version that's hollow from the start. Instead of a big house with characters coming and going, Wuthering Heights is more like an island prison lorded over by a capricious man who seems to be collecting children he can keep under his thumb—including Cathy's servant-companion Nelly (Hong Chau), whom Fennell reimagines as the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman. From the first moments we meet young Cathy (Charlotte Mellington) and Nelly (Vy Nguyen), it's clear that Wuthering Heights isn't a safe place to grow up. And without any kind of positive parental figure in their life, they've both developed maladaptive personalities. Once young Heathcliff (Owen Cooper) enters the story, however, that bond gets upended. Nelly, meanwhile, is left seething with jealousy over how Heathcliff has supplanted her role in Cathy's life. All the love they're denied from their father figure gets transposed onto one another in increasingly thorny, complex, psychosexual ways. It's a sentiment Fennell captures with equal parts satire and horror. While Fennell has sympathy for Cathy as a victim, she also has a keen eye for how hilariously petulant and annoying she can be. Her arrested development is cause for a whole lot of unnecessary drama in its own way. Though there is something sweet and genuine going on between Heathcliff and Cathy, it stems from a place of survival as much as anything else. They have no one around to save them but themselves. Because a landed man is considered the highest authority, there's no social or child protective services to call when he's misusing that power. Wuthering Heights deploys a lot of dollhouse imagery, and Cathy, Heathcliff, and Nelly might as well be dolls Mr. Earnshaw is playing with as he shouts “I am the kindest man alive!” into the void. In Brontë's original story, the saga continues on after Cathy's death with a second generation of characters who find themselves living under Heathcliff's isolated, abusive thumb. Hindley's strapping heir, Cathy's strong-willed daughter, and Heathcliff's own sickly son are left to build complicated bonds with one another while Heathcliff lures them all to Wuthering Heights and tries his best to emotionally destroy their lives as revenge for his own suffering. Though she reimagines Heathcliff as a far kinder, more sympathetic figure than he is in the novel, her dark take on Mr. Earnshaw gets at some of the patriarchal abuse that Brontë is interested in too. It's like Fennell has collapsed the two generations into her Cathy/Heathcliff/Nelly dynamic, which is a clever way to engage with the novel's core ideas without adapting its plot beat-for-beat. And Fennell's exploration of Cathy, Heathcliff, and Nelly's fraught bond reaches its climax in a scene where Nelly actively manipulates a miscommunication between her “siblings.” In the novel, Heathcliff accidentally overhears Cathy say she could never marry him. After that, Fennell seems less sure what to do with the themes she's set up. Once Cathy marries her neighbor Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif) and Heathcliff disappears and returns a rich, dashing man, Wuthering Heights devolves into a style-over-substance fantasia. There are fun montages showing off the over-the-top production design of the Linton family home and some “provocative” adaptation changes—like making Heathcliff's relationship with Isabella Linton (Alison Oliver) a consensual BDSM one, rather than an abusive marriage. There are still sharp moments here and there, like when Cathy tells Nelly, “You like to see me cry,” and Nelly counters, “Not half as much as you like crying.” Or the way Cathy responds to her father's eventual death with both grief and violent relief. Fennell effectively renders her central trio as people too stunted by their childhood traumas to ever really mature into adulthood. Instead, Wuthering Heights devolves into a more basic Romeo And Juliet-style tragedy. In some ways, it's a soft choice to make Heathcliff a more sympathetic romantic lead rather than the complicated, cruel figure he is in the novel. But given that Brontë ultimately ends with a sense of hope about children being able to break the cycles of abuse set by their parents, amping up Mr. Earnshaw as an antagonist and giving that hopeful arc to Heathcliff instead still (sort of) tracks with what the novel is trying to explore.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Talk show host Jimmy Fallon has reportedly stepped back from plans to start a pasta sauce brand, after his long-time friend and partner in the venture, former Sony Music Entertainment CEO Tommy Mottola, was found to appear more than 600 times in the Epstein Files. This is reality, and that is a thing that happened within it: Jimmy Fallon isn't selling spaghetti sauce anymore because his (extremely powerful and influential) pasta buddy was also friends with the world's most notorious pedophile. This is per THR, which notes that Fallon and Mottola's pasta sauce line was in the “early development phase,” with plans to possibly launch in 2027. (Moments like this sometimes produce absolutely fascinating sentences; in this case, we have THR‘s “Representatives for both Fallon and Mottola declined to speak on the record with The Hollywood Reporter regarding the status of their sauce brand.”) But it's simply been interesting to see the ways various public figures have been reacting in the wake of their various power broker buddies, associates, or employers being revealed to have been sending little “Hey, thinking of you” emails to Epstein more than a decade after he was first registered as a sex offender. Chappell Roan, for instance, recently made headlines when she announced that she was no longer being represented by the talent agency run by Casey Wasserman, who appears more than 80 times in the Files. (Wasserman is now reportedly selling the agency—although he apparently intends to stay on the board of Los Angeles' 2028 Olympic Games Committee.) All of which is happening in a strange kind of slow motion: The sheer volume of the Epstein Files had made them impossible to process simultaneously, instead causing these odd little (and so far, very minor) consequences to shake out; a pasta sauce there, an apology from the executive producer of Bones there. It's not clear yet how the reaction to the Files, both in the world generally, and Hollywood—where Epstein was clearly pretty aggressive about cultivating friendships—specifically, will end up shaking out: Whether it's all just going to be smashed pasta sauces and notes on people's Wikipedia pages, or something more robust.

They wrote it for Palestinian Awdah Hathaleen, a consultant on the film, who was killed in his West Bank village by an Israeli settler. “One life at a time is kinda an existential suggestion,” Bono says. ‘America's Next Top Model' Turned Her ‘Cheating Scandal' Into National News. Days of Ash wraps up with “Yours Eternally,” which features guest appearances by Ed Sheeran and Ukrainian singer Taras Topolia, whom Edge and Bono met when they traveled to Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion. “When we told [Ed Sheeran] about this song in a shape of a letter wondering if he could be the voice replying to the letter, he jumped right on it, but with a caveat,” Bono says. But I'd rather not be a part of any political polemic right now.… You're not going to get me involved in politics, are you?' I believe these new songs stand up to our best work. We talk a lot about when to release new tracks. Going way back to our earliest days, working with Amnesty or Greenpeace, we've never shied away from taking a position, and sometimes that can get a bit messy, there's always some sort of blowback, but it's a big side of who we are and why we still exist.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Phish bassist Mike Gordon was always in awe of Bob Weir, from seeing him perform onstage as a kid to decades later staying at his home in Hawaii with Bob's family. He spoke to Rolling Stone while in Woodstock preparing for his spring solo tour, and recalls their time together at TRI Studios working on flow-state experiments, the time he almost joined Dead & Company, and Bob sitting in with his band. Honestly, everything about Bob Weir was dichotomies. Interesting dichotomies for me, from my perspective. His playing, on the other hand, seems really selfless, because it just weaves into the music almost unnoticeably, and yet it's so eloquent. But his personality had that combination of those kinds of things, like seeming super-cold because he didn't smile that much. He was actually one of the warmest people ever. I mean, it's not often that I meet a hero of mine, some rock star, and then just have him write his phone number down for me, not really knowing me. And yet, playing in different groups with him, he's also never the one that would give out compliments. And the fact that he really lived life hard, but then later in life [was very healthy] — one of those last experiences was going to his beach house, where he had me do his meditation with him, guided meditation, and going for a run and doing other workout parts, eating all vegan food. So I don't know if he always had these splits or if I just noticed them as time went on. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time He did it with a lot of people. He would run barefoot on pavement or rocky mountains or the beach or anywhere, and his feet were kind of calloused, and I wasn't going to do that. It was like a brisk walk or slow run, and he kind of repeated his mantra. In his backyard at his beach house there was a sandbox with 100 different kinds of fun workout things. It looks like a samurai or something, where the legs and arms are all twisting one way and then all the way around the other way. He tried to show me and I just couldn't do it, after about 10 minutes of trying to videotape everything, he's like, “How about I'll just do it and you videotape me.” So we did that. He had this heavy leather ball, and he wanted to do this thing where we just threw it back and forth, hard to launch and hard to catch, all in that sandbox with really nice tropical plants around it. Then he made me some vegan sausages. I know he's always done yoga, over the years, and just seemed really healthy. The reason we went to the beach house together is because we were at a studio doing this brainwave experiment. I read an article where he said dreams informed his whole life. His creativity, and the music that he writes, all informed by dreams. And I thought, “Oh, well, me too.”  I had this team of neurologists, and one neurologist from MIT could get people in half-awake, half-dreaming, half-asleep. Bobby started coming on those Zooms [with the neurologists] and told us this one dream that he'd had. That was the middle of just a Zoom about neurological stuff, and then he offers up that dream. How I Learned to Love the Dead Playing in the Band: Mickey Hart Remembers Bob Weir I had had a little bit of gummy something or chocolate, something with THC, maybe a little bit of mushrooms. Then he and [his wife] Natascha invited me up for a vegan meal, and after he invited me to go to the beach house. They warned me that no one gets in the car, his kids don't get in the car with him. He's taking these switchbacks at 60 miles an hour in his Tesla going to Stinson Beach. He just loved telling these funny stories from back in the day. So that made up for the nausea. One of the stories was about beating Ramblin' Jack Elliott. I bet he's told it before, but just in case… He goes around the back and there's a ladder where you can climb up to the roof. He's going to sneak in the club, and now he's on the roof and there's a skylight and he's sort of investigating the skylight and he just crashes through all the way, falling down, and landing on a couch, which happens to be the green room, where he's sitting next to Ramblin' Jack Elliott. And he says, “Oh hi, I'm Bobby.” And from that point on, they're best friends for the rest of their lives. So in his little lair there, he had this tube stereo, turntable, speakers, and a big, huge daybed for listening to music. He put on some records, a country singer I had never heard of. It was a whole different experience listening to all that analog sound. Then he had all these guitars sprinkled about, and he was able to just work on his next album all by himself with this little recording station and some effects pedals and wireless thing on his guitar. I mean, being that level of rock star, you could easily have some chefs around, but he didn't need any of it. He didn't have a trainer, at that moment anyway. He didn't have a chef and he didn't have someone recording him for his album. My daughter and I went back to the beach house to visit him last year, which would've been two years later, and he was still working on the same album. There's some friends that preferred the Jerry Garcia-written songs. In groups of people, a bunch of people that are doing a gig together, he would stop them and he would say, “Look, the singing is the face of the song. I know he told Trey [Anastasio] when they were reviewing every Grateful Dead song ever before the Fare Thee Well concerts, they spent a week in their pajamas in that beach house, and he told Trey, “I know that we're known for our jamming and everything, but really it's mostly about the soulfulness of these songs.” Bobby was there with one of his bands, maybe RatDog. The way that it worked is there were two stages so the bands could go back and forth. Bob had this idea, since I had been singing “The Other One” with that group, a few songs like that — maybe he would sit in with us, and I would sing the first [verse] or two, and their band would start and he would just continue where we left off, and he would sing the next verse with his band. They're all looking at me, and Bobby's right there, my hero, looking at me, and I can't for the life of me remember, after singing it all tour, the first or second verse to “The Other One.” Like “‘Spanish lady….' What is it?” And Bobby's looking at me with his deadpan face, not offering a smile or “It's funny that you can't remember this.” This is after being a kid and going to see him, and there I am singing it to him and unable to remember more than the first two words. Then to make it more awkward, one of the other singers is Googling for me, and they're like, “Here, I'm finding it online.” And Bobby's just not flinching. He is like, “I'm not going to help him. I'm not going to laugh at him, but I'm not going to help him either. I'm just going to stare at him.” It's so embarrassing, but funny. Bob did ask me to be a part of Dead & Co. When he first was calling he had some other ideas, which morphed back to being more normal. Where it was just like beats and Grateful Dead songs, which I've heard people do before. That eventually turned into a [more] normal situation. We were talking about having grooves that are swung and straight, half swung and half straight. And he said, “That's what rock & roll is. Bob wanted to do more and different things. That was cool, but then I started to realize it was going to be a longer-term thing. I had my own album and I was making a Phish album, and they were starting to talk about doing some writing and making an album, too. Bob was one of the few guests Phish has had onstage. We had already played with Phil Lesh at Shoreline the year earlier. I remember I got this feeling from the band, or a message from the rest of Phish, that we weren't going to have him play, because we just don't have guests. My driver will bring me in and I'm just going to bring a little amp and guitar, and what time is soundcheck?” It's like, “Well,” I said, “I'm not really sure if the guys want to have any guests, but this sound check's at 3:30.” And then more talking backstage of, “I don't know. He's great, but we don't really have guests and there's a reason for that. It's really hard and tender to get our flow going that we have.” And Page [McConnell]is sitting backstage with him in one of the dressing rooms explaining that. I remember there was “El Paso” and we did “West L.A. Fadeaway,” and then he played on “Chalkdust Torture.” He was nervous about that, like he didn't really want to do it because he didn't know it so well. He just dug his soul into it and raged in the situation, even being out of his comfort zone. ‘America's Next Top Model' Turned Her ‘Cheating Scandal' Into National News. Forever Grateful: John Mayer Remembers Bob Weir I just thought it was incredible the way his rhythm guitar playing ebbed and flowed. When people heard Jerry Garcia's guitar playing, it sounds like a bird fluttering. That's, for me, what's so incredible about it. If the playing was more predictable, it wouldn't have been so enchanting in terms of his playing. I feel like he sings in this sort of almost like a plain voice, and he cuts off the words at the end of the phrase. This sort of punk kid with an almost plain-sounding voice trying to just go for it. I don't think, for me, it could have worked without Bob's contribution of just that, almost like a kid or a wannabe cowboy wanting to be on this adventure. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iconoclastic German veteran Ulrike Ottinger mines macabre humor from a fictionalized portrait of notorious real-life Hungarian noblewoman Elizabeth Báthory. Likewise, if you ever wondered what kind of bizarro Mittel European mutant baby would result from the marriage of Robert Eggers' Nosferatu and Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel. Perhaps it would look something like Ulrike Ottinger's Viennese waltz of grotesquerie, The Blood Countess (Die Blutgräfin). Serbian Filmmakers Call Out "State-Sponsored Censorship" in Open Letter Standing with regal stillness on the front of the boat, like a carved figurehead on a prow, is Huppert as Countess Elizabeth, a commanding vision in blood-red gown, gloves and jewels to match her copper-colored hair. She alights with a dramatic billowing cape behind her and steps out into the modern-day Austrian capital. Venue: Berlin Film Festival (Berlinale Special)Cast: Isabelle Huppert, Birgit Minichmayr, Thomas Schubert, Lars Eidinger, André Jung, Marco Lorenzini, Tom Neuwirth, Karl Markovics, Felix OitzingerDirector: Ulrike OttingerScreenwriters: Ulrike Ottinger, Elfriede Jelinek Elizabeth has barely hit town when she exchanges a come-hither glance with a pretty young woman whose creamy neck is soon punctured by teeth marks. She is troubled by talk of a legendary book that can turn vampires back into mortals should they shed tears on its pages. Weeping vampires are relatively rare and yet Elizabeth and the devoted servant with whom she's reunited, Hermione (Birgit Minichmayr, looking like a demonic Louise Brooks), seem to think this ancient volume poses a major threat to the existence of their kind. Mostly, the book serves to set them on a daffy quest through Vienna's historical sites and libraries in order to find and destroy it. But before they get started on that there's a vampire ball to attend, at which the Countess makes her grand entrance while being exalted as “a woman untouched by virtue.” (Love that for Huppert.) A row of handsome young men in formalwear is ushered onto the stage and seated, followed by the same number of women who are blindfolded and given straight razors to shave the gentlemen before slitting their throats. This probably sounds a lot more entertaining than it is. I could watch Huppert queening it up until the cows come home, and it's likely she hasn't had this much self-satirizing fun since her hilarious Call My Agent! They include one of the neo-Báthorys from Transylvania, Baron Rudi Bubi (Thomas Schubert, so good in Christian Petzold's Afire), a dandy in green who has shamed the family by going vegetarian; his psychotherapist Theobold Tandem (Lars Eidinger); dithering vampirologists Theobastus Bombastus (André Jung) and Nepomuk Afterbite (Marco Lorenzini); and two cops, Chief Inspector Unbelief (Karl Markovics) and Assistant Guido Doppler (Felix Oitzinger). But that doesn't add much beyond three crusty Báthory ancestors carousing drunkenly in their coffins. Queer feminist filmmaker Ottinger's work is known for its rejection of conventional linear narratives, but would a little coherence be too much to ask? The Blood Countess devolves into such haphazard, nonsensical plotting (with a resolution far more rushed than satisfying) that it's a challenge to stay with it for the protracted two-hour duration. At least there's Huppert in gloriously aloof form, plus the overripe lusciousness of Martin Gschlacht's cinematography; with an edible and/or a cocktail or three, that might be enough. There have been numerous films made about Elizabeth Báthory, who was convicted of torturing and murdering hundreds of women between 1590 and 1610; according to legend, she bathed in their blood to maintain her youthful looks.

Sophie Nélisse, coming off of a busy winter with the release of Heated Rivalry, is preparing to head back into the wilderness for the fourth and final season of Showtime's Yellowjackets. It's about a week out from when Nélisse is scheduled to return to the show that has, in her words, shaped her young adult life. Heated Rivalry and Yellowjackets seemingly have nothing in common, but the Montreal native doesn't feel like they have to. “I approach every role with a different purpose and idea of what it's going to bring me,” she explains. Connor Storrie in Talks for A24 High School Reunion Comedy 'Peaked' Francine Maisler's Wild Casting Ride: Chalamet, Erivo, 'Spider-Man,' Connor Storrie -- And the Chance to Make Oscar History With 'Sinners' “What's really important in selecting a character is the creative team attached, to make sure I work with people I feel really passionate about who are there for the right reasons,” Nélisse explains. She continues, “It's really easy in this industry to fall into the machine of Hollywood and doing content just for doing content. I definitely want to be very intentional when selecting my characters. That's also why I've gotten into producing, because there are books I've read that have moved me so much. Below, Nélisse breaks down her emotional Heated Rivalry scene, why the show means so much to her, what to expect from Yellowjackets season four — and why you might not see her in another horror project for a bit. What about Heated Rivalry drew you in? It's such a hook, and I'm such a sucker for rom-coms and that will they-won't they? I was hooked on the first episodes, but then I loved how it developed into something that felt so honest and raw and vulnerable. What I love the most is that it really gave me hope. With all the darkness and all the heaviness in the world right now, we needed a show that brought some levity, but in a way that feels achievable. Beyond that, it's not a story that I feel like I've seen on screen before, and it was really refreshing to see. It gave so much visibility to a community that doesn't have enough representation. Often when there is a queer couple, they don't make it or they get killed in the first 15 minutes of a show. To see them coming out as heroes was my takeaway. There's something so genuine about her, something so mesmerizing and captivating because of the way she has this self-confidence that's not obnoxious or condescending. She has that gravitas, but also knows when not to be in the spotlight. Her point in this entire story is to let Shane shine. To me, Rose is someone who everyone needs in their life. There's nothing as important for any human being than to have someone with whom you can be 100 percent yourself, completely stripped out of every wall and facet and still be loved unconditionally. Characters like Rose are one in a million that you come across. What were your talks with creator Jacob Tierney like to tackle the restaurant scene in particular? We didn't talk about it that much. Hudson and I actually never rehearsed it. We both wanted to leave it at that and see just how the first take runs out. Don't be scared of the awkwardness, don't be scared to make it slow.” There are a few beats after — once the show's edited, obviously you trim down — but there's not much to say. What about your character specifically in that scene? I didn't want her to outshine him. She was really in the passenger seat, and sometimes it's in the eye contact and the energy of being like, “I will be here whenever you're ready to talk and open up.” There's that beautiful moment when it cuts back to his flashbacks. I remember doing ADR after we'd shot the scene once the show was about to be released, and just knives straight to my heart. It's what really gets me in that scene. Rose is not saying anything, it's just him living his emotion and all of his duality, everything that's tearing him apart. We really wanted the scene to be quiet and intimate. On the very first take, just watching Hudson's inner monologue, you could see the battle in his eyes and it made me tear up instantly. What has the show's response been like for you? It seems like you all knew that you had something special, but sometimes the world doesn't always realize that right away. It hit at a great time for you guys. People love to ask that question, “Did you guys know it was going to blow up?” We knew what we were a part of was special, and we all care so deeply for the story. It was a story that needed to be told, especially in this day and age, and felt very of its time. There are so many elements that are out of our control that I don't think any of us could have predicted how overnight the success was going to be. Before the show coming out, I remember wrapping and being like, “This is one of the best sets I've ever been on in my entire life.” Everyone was so genuine and there's no sense of competition. The chemistry that everyone has is what it was like on set. And Jacob, I've never seen someone direct a set that felt so effortless. He makes directing look so easy when this guy literally is showrunning, writing, doing everything. I fell into this industry very randomly, but I do feel somewhat of a responsibility to be able to make somewhat of a change with my work. Cinema, TV is a great medium to be able to do that because I remember seeing characters on screen growing up that made me feel less alone because they made me feel so seen and understood. In moments that I was having the shittiest day, I would go to the movies and for an hour and a half, I would forget everything that was hard in my life. I'm getting emotional just thinking about it. I think of people who have been battling so many things that they've never been able to express or talk about, who feel so lonely and that there's no light for them at the end of the tunnel. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but especially for the gay community, I feel like there hasn't been the opportunity or chance to have this representation on screen, for some people to finally feel there's a character that they can relate to. To know my work has brought people closer together, that it's bonded people and helped them out of really hard times, that it's changed their lives to some extent, is really all I can ask for. I've been feeling very grateful and emotional of how well the show has resonated with people. When I started, it was all fun and games. I've never taken any acting classes to this day. You can always become a better version of yourself. I will forever be learning from my peers and can always improve. I randomly fell into acting because I needed a bit of money to be able to afford gymnastics that I was doing at the time and the traveling competitions. My first movie went to the Oscars and then I booked The Book Thief, which was a big movie. At first, I was taking whatever came my way that was fun without any second thought or trying to curate my career. When I graduated high school and wanted to apply for college, and I didn't really know what I wanted to do, that's when I started being a bit more selective and take it a bit more seriously and putting a bit more thought into the scripts I was reading. Then I quickly booked Yellowjackets and since then, it's opened some doors, for sure, and I've been able to be a bit more selective. I just want to have a great balance. Obviously with Yellowjackets, I've been offered a lot of horror driven-[roles]. I really don't want to pigeon-hole myself in that genre, especially because actually, horror is my least favorite genre. I think moving forward, it's about trying to create a career that feels really different with characters who are as far away from me as possible. But I really want to try comedy. I recently interviewed an actor and we talked about how rom-coms are harder. The idea of shooting an idea that comes out of my mind and it landing and everyone being like, “That's such a bad idea,” would traumatize me, but in a great way. I need to live through that embarrassment because, what is acting if not trying things? It's a classic process, but I would be really interested in doing comedy. People We Meet On Vacation is actually a role I'd really love, I think would be really fun. I leave in a week to go back. They're very secretive about what happens in this show. We literally get the scripts two weeks before shooting an episode, sometimes even a week. But I do think that obviously, there's a lot of pressure coming into this season knowing it's the last one. I think it'll be a really fun one. Luckily, the showrunners have had time to write it and I think are very committed to putting in their all, so it's very bittersweet. Every good show wraps at four, honestly. The time in the wilderness has been so interesting to see how, emotionally, they navigate all of these circumstances, but I think the back to reality is going to hit all of us hard. Then being confronted by all of their demons, all of them navigating the demons they had before going into the wilderness and the things they were dealing. Obviously, there were different issues to deal with out in the wilderness. [They didn't have to] deal with a lot of these things that are now all going to come back to the surface, whether that's previous relationships or their relationship with their parents. There's a lot of things that were broken before they even went out in the wilderness, so it's going to double down on them. What are you going to miss the most? Like you said, the show's really shaped a lot of your adult life and it is obviously going to be a bit of a change when it is no longer there. There's something very fun about being so established, that we know each other so well and we really operate as a group. I'll miss that we know each other's flaws and weaknesses and strengths from working season after season together. It'll be weird whenever I shoot on another project, when you are new to some actor and you don't know how they operate or their style or technique. And the friendships, it really does feel like you go home to one big family. Working with the crew as well, there's something so familiar and comforting, especially when you're not working in your hometown, it does feel a bit like home away from home when I get to go back with the same ADs and the same crews. You've established running jokes on set and we know this from season one. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Kunal Nayyar thinks about success, he does not start with awards or ratings. The former “Big Bang Theory” star recently revealed that he quietly pays medical bills for families in need by browsing campaigns on GoFundMe and covering expenses himself. The candid admission has resonated widely, offering a glimpse into how the actor chooses to use his wealth beyond Hollywood. He said he sometimes scrolls through GoFundMe pages at night and steps in to help families facing overwhelming medical costs. He described the practice as something deeply personal and meaningful, explaining that financial success has given him the freedom to positively change lives. He expressed gratitude for the career that allowed him to build financial security and said he feels fortunate that he can now extend that security to others during moments of crisis. According to Variety, Nayyar has used his own funds to pay off medical-related GoFundMe campaigns for families he does not personally know. Medical emergencies often arrive without warning, leaving families scrambling for resources. Through GoFundMe, many share their stories in hopes of easing the financial strain tied to surgeries, hospital stays, or long-term treatments. Nayyar's involvement underscores how one individual can make a direct and immediate difference. Page Six reported that Nayyar's net worth, built largely during his time on “The Big Bang Theory,” has afforded him the ability to give generously. Reports note that he and his wife, Neha Kapur, also support educational initiatives, including scholarships for students from underserved communities. The couple also backs animal welfare causes, reflecting their shared love for animals. In speaking about his philanthropic efforts, Nayyar emphasized gratitude and perspective. The story has sparked conversations about how celebrities can leverage their influence to address real-world challenges and uplift everyday families.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bad Bunny starts the week with a massive sweep across Billboard charts. He lands a record-breaking 29 simultaneous titles on the Hot Latin Songs chart (dated Feb. 21), as his track “DtMF” adds a 47th week at No. 1 spot on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100. Among his 29 titles on Hot Latin Songs is his 14-minute “Super Bowl LX Halftime Show (Live)” medley, which debuts at No. Following his halftime performance at Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8, Bad Bunny's songs experienced a massive surge as fans flocked to his catalog. On the Hot Latin Songs chart, he lands 29 concurrent songs, surpassing Peso Pluma's previous record of 25 titles set in 2023 — when songs from his album Génesis populated the tally. The Hot Latin Songs chart blends streaming, radio airplay and sales data into its formula. Starting with “DtMF,” the song adds a 47th week at No. 1 on Hot Latin Songs, inching closer to Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's “Despacito” (featuring Justin Bieber), which holds the record with 56 weeks at No. “DtMF” races at breakneck pace, with a 185% increase in streams during the week ending Feb. 12, generating 43 million official clicks in the United States, according to Luminate. 1 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, his second leader there.

The previous two-week champ registered 28.8 million clicks, up 141%, during the tracking week, rebounding to No. 18 on the overall Digital Songs Sales list with 4,000 downloads sold. “NUEVAYoL,” also on Benito's halftime setlist, is the Hot Latin Songs chart's biggest gainer in sales. It logged 5,000 in digital sales, up 238%, and holds at No. 9 debut on the overall Digital Song Sales chart. Plus, “Super Bowl LX Halftime Show (Live)” makes its first appearance, at No. Among them, 11 re-entries and one debut; he's the first artist to hold the entire top 25 in a single week, besting his takeover of the top 17 spots (Oct. 28, 2023): Lastly, Benito holds the entire 25-position Latin Streaming Songs chart (a first), including nine reentries. As mentioned, “DtMF” adds a 33rd week at No. All charts (dated Feb. 21, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Feb. 18 (one day later than usual due to the Presidents' Day holiday in the United States Feb. 16).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie & Keith are talking about who could helm next year's show -- and when country could take the reins. Bad Bunny‘s Super Bowl halftime show is still making waves more than a week later — including his song “DtMF” topping the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time — but that doesn't mean we can't start looking ahead to who might be up next for the 2027 halftime. On the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie & Keith are taking a closer look at the Billboard.com reader poll that went live last week asking who should headline next year's Super Bowl halftime show, Right now, BTS is leading by a landslide, with more than 85% of the vote. It would make sense for the newly reunited Korean superstars to cap their sure-to-be-active comeback year with potentially a big Grammys night — like Kendrick Lamar and Bad Bunny have done the last two years — followed by an epic performance on the Super Bowl stage. Of course, Taylor Swift is always in the Super Bowl conversation too, and we think Post Malone could be an overwhelmingly supported pick knowing how many genres he crosses. And speaking of genres, there hasn't been a country moment on the Super Bowl stage since the 1994 all-country halftime (Clint Black, Tanya Tucker, Travis Tritt and The Judds) or when Shania Twain was part of a show that also included No Doubt and Sting in 2003. Who could be the best country pick to take the massive stage? You can always count on a lively discussion about the latest pop news, fun chart stats and stories, new music, and guest interviews with music stars and folks from the world of pop. Casual pop fans and chart junkies can hear Billboard‘s executive digital director, West Coast, Katie Atkinson and Billboard's managing director, charts and data operations, Keith Caulfield every week on the podcast, which can be streamed on Billboard.com or downloaded in Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast provider.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kunal Nayyar of “Big Bang Theory” has been quietly paying medical bills for random families in need. “Money has given me greater freedom and the greatest gift is the ability to give back, to change people's lives,” Nayyar said in a December 2025 interview with the iPaper, which has been going viral on X. “But what I really love to do is go on GoFundMe at night and just pay random families' medical bills. So, no, money doesn't feel like a burden. Nayyar explained that his fortune does not “weigh heavy” on him, as he's able to donate to worthy causes anonymously. According to Fortune magazine, the actor — who played Raj Koothrappali on the beloved series during its entire 12-season run, from 2007 to 2019 — boasts a net worth of $45 million. “Right now people are not happy, because we are all expecting someone else to be kind,” he told the outlet. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. He added that there is “no world peace if your neighbor comes to your door wanting some sugar for their tea, and you lock it against them and say ‘get away. He also asserted that “no one is going to come and change the world for you. The “Dawson's Creek” star's wife Kimberly and their six kids found themselves “out of funds” after costly cancer treatments left them “facing an uncertain future” following his death, according to the GoFundMe page. Though Realtor.com later reported that the “Varsity Blues” star had purchased his rented Texas estate a month prior to his death, a rep explained to Page Six that he'd done so with the help of friends. Van Der Beek's fundraising effort was defended by celebrities including Donna Vivino, many of whom noted the high cost of medical care in social media comments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The search for 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie has taken an emotional toll on her family as each day passes without answers. Nancy, the mother of “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie, was last seen on January 31 after spending the evening with loved ones. Now more than two weeks into the investigation, her family is leaning on one another, trying to steady themselves through the uncertainty. With the case entering another critical phase, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos is sharing a sobering update. In a new interview with Fox10, Nanos addressed mounting questions about the investigation and whether authorities believe Nancy is still alive. “They ask me, do I have proof of life? I ask them, is there proof of death?” Nanos said. “I'm going to have that faith, and sometimes that faith, that hope, is all we have… My team, 400 people out there in the field today, woke up this morning and went out there with the hope and the belief that they're going to find Nancy.” Nancy was last seen entering her home in the Catalina Foothills of Tucson. Earlier this week, authorities revealed that DNA taken from a black nitrile glove discovered roughly two miles from Nancy's home did not match genetic material collected inside the residence or any profile in the national CODIS database. At first, the glove seemed like a potential breakthrough. It closely resembled one worn by a masked person seen on Nancy's doorbell camera shortly before she vanished. Still, Nanos cautioned against reading too much into the setback. “All of that will still be submitted for further analysis,” he said. Nanos added that investigators recovered DNA from multiple individuals inside the home. Forensic teams now must “hope” they can “separate that” as testing continues. With traditional database searches yielding no results, authorities are turning to a different tool. An FBI official told Fox News Digital that investigators have now turned to investigative genetic genealogy, known as IGG, in the case. IGG uses crime-scene DNA to search for potential relatives in public genealogy databases when traditional law enforcement systems, such as CODIS, return no matches. DNA collected inside her home also failed to match any profile in the national database. As the investigation moves forward, Nanos has drawn a firm line on one issue. Amid online rumors and mounting speculation, authorities formally cleared all immediate relatives. Speaking to Tucson's KOLD 13 News, Nanos said family members were ruled out “in the first few days” and have been “100 percent cooperative.” “Not one single person in the family is a suspect,” Nanos said. “So I am telling everyone, effective today, you guys [media] need to knock it off, quit. He later reiterated that position in a formal statement. “To be clear … the Guthrie family — to include all siblings and spouses — have been cleared as possible suspects in this case. The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple.” It will work out better for you in the long run, trust me.” Go here and check the boxnext to EntertainmentNow Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>
