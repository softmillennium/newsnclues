                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As he prepares for his second season at Ferrari, Lewis Hamilton has explained why he has a "positive feeling". Lewis Hamilton has spoken of being “in the best place I've been in for a long time” ahead of the 2026 season, with the Briton also admitting to feeling “more connected” to Ferrari's new car as he enters his second year of racing for the team. Following the end of last year, it has since been confirmed that the seven-time World Champion will work with a new race engineer going forwards after Riccardo Adami moved to a role within the squad's academy. Ferrari appeared to have a solid outing during the first test at the Bahrain International Circuit, racking up 420 laps – a tally bettered only by McLaren and Williams – whilst also seeming to have good reliability. “I think I always try to enter into a season with confidence, but of course you're faced with all sorts of different challenges along the way. I think this is definitely for me… I've obviously gone through quite a bit, and for me left everything – all of last year is behind me. “I really felt like I spent a lot of time rebuilding over this winter, refocusing, really getting my body and my mind to a much better place. In general, just making sure that I'm able to arrive feeling better. “I generally feel personally in the best place that I've been in a long, long time, with rearranging things within my team. And then the car, we've started off quite well so far. “Last year we were locked into a car that obviously I inherited – this is a car that I've been able to be a part of developing on the simulator for the last 10 months, eight months, so a bit of my DNA is within it so I'm more connected to this one, for sure.” “[I have] 100% faith in this team and what they're capable of, and that's why I joined the team. “I knew it wasn't going to be an overnight thing, that we'd have success immediately – that's why I signed a longer deal, because I knew it was… more often than not it is a process. I feel like we've also learned a huge amount from last year as a team, and there have been changes that we've made.</p>
