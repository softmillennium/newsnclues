                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Casper Ruud won't have to look far for extra motivation as he begins his debut campaign at the Delray Beach Open this week. Just weeks after he and his fiancée Maria welcomed the birth of their first child, a daughter, the Norwegian arrives in Florida carrying more than racquets and expectations. “It was an incredibly emotional moment,” Ruud said. “I think for anyone who has become a parent, it's an incredible feeling and hard to explain with words. It's fun and exciting, I will try to use it as motivation and try to remember that you've travelled this far and being away from her, you might as well try your best and play some good tennis while you're at it.” Ruud had already gathered momentum this season by reaching the fourth round of the Australian Open before he returned home to Norway, where he announced his daughter's arrival at the end of January. The early-season hard-court swing will test that balance. “It will be a tough trip, because it won't be that easy for them to come over here and I will miss them and at times feel homesick,” Ruud said. “I'll do my best and see if I can end the hard-court swing, for a while, on a good note before we head back to Europe and start the clay season. “That will be the goal for these couple of weeks and months coming up, [starting] here, then Acapulco, Indian Wells and Miami: To win some matches and see if I can play for more than myself.” Ruud begins that run in a strong Delray Beach field that features two-time champion Taylor Fritz and reigning Next Gen ATP Finals titlist Learner Tien. First up for the second-seeded Ruud is Giron on Wednesday, with their Lexus ATP Head2Head series locked at 2-2. “I haven't got an overuse of my arm yet. I haven't carried her too much yet!” Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

Tiafoe, laughing, asked what he was supposed to do about the rest of his shirts. The American is known for sweating heavily and going through multiple outfit changes during a match. He packed his spare shirts into a bag, sent it to his team along with the marker, and had them black out the Barclays logo on each one.According to the ATP rulebook: “If sleeveless, then two logo positions may be placed on the front, however neither shall exceed 6 sq in (3 sq cm).”It wasn't the first time a player has run afoul of logo rules before a match.
