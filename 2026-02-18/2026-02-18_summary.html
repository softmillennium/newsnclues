The polling found Christian nationalists are more likely to embrace authoritarian views than the rest of the population.

Roughly one in three Americans are Christian nationalists or sympathetic to the cause, according to a new survey.

The survey, conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, also found strong connections between support for Christian nationalism and support for the Republican Party and President Donald Trump in particular.

“I think the threat is (to) our democracy,” said Public Religion Research Institute CEO Melissa Deckman. “We found consistently that Christian nationalists tend to endorse more illiberal views in the sense that they're more likely to embrace more authoritarian views, which can essentially be used to justify limiting access to the ballot for some people, or it can be used to use undemocratic means to stay in power.”

Most Christian nationalists want America to be a theocracy ruled explicitly by biblical principles, often interpreted through a fundamentalist lens. Many also think only Christians should be able to hold political office.

While the vast majority of Americans do not support Christian nationalist ideals, the survey found that about 11% of Americans are active Christian nationalists while another 21% are sympathizers. Researchers categorized most Americans — 64% — as either skeptics or rejecters of Christian nationalism.

“Long story short, far more Americans reject it than endorse it,” Deckman said in an interview. “But politically, why it's so important to measure is that we now have a political party where you have prominent Christian nationalists in charge right within the Republican Party, whether it's in the Trump administration, and, the executive branch, that really have disproportionate influence and folks like the speaker of the House is someone that would endorse this currently in Congress.”

The findings were based on interviews with more than 22,000 adults conducted throughout 2025. 

The survey found that 56% of Republicans are adherents or supporters of Christian nationalism, compared to a quarter of independents and 17% of Democrats. It also found a correlation between support for Trump and support for Christian nationalism. Backers of the ideology were far more likely to express support for political violence than their fellow Americans.

The states that held the most Christian nationalist views are concentrated in the South. Arkansas, Mississippi, West Virginia and Oklahoma registered the highest support for the ideology. But ruby red Idaho has become a center for Christian nationalist thought, as the home of influential pastor Doug Wilson's, whose Christ Church and connected national education and church networks have helped shape a generation of far-right leaders. Wilson has called for America to be run as an explicitly Christian nation.

Idaho-based pastor and writer Ben Cremer said that school of thought should worry Americans.

“Every American would have their lives dictated by the set of beliefs by a single Christian sect, whether they aligned with those beliefs or not,” he said. “Given the patriarchy, supremacy, and racism intertwined with the current brand of Christian nationalism, you would see women losing the right to vote and ethnic and religious minorities sidelined and infringed upon.”

Cremer said it's incumbent on faith leaders to push back on what he sees as a perversion of Christianity.

“First, Jesus called us to love our neighbors as our selves — that is part of his greatest commandment to us,” he said. “My neighbor is every human being. Christian nationalism is actively harming and dehumanizing so many of my neighbors and our planet. That is simply unacceptable. Secondly, it is carrying this harm out in the name of my sacred faith.”

Christian nationalism, until recently a fringe ideology, has been in the spotlight in recent years, as Donald Trump has become receptive to the movement's ideas and even appointed some Christian nationalists to prominent positions. 

For example, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is a member of one of Christ Church's affiliates, sports Crusader tattoos and has broken down the separation of church and state in the military. Russ Vought, one of the architects of Project 2025 — a Christian nationalist blueprint for government — is Trump's Office of Management and Budget director.

Deckman said if Americans want to see Christian nationalism banished to the fringes again, demographics are on their side.

“I guess the answer is … voting,” she said. “I think that you know this is something that's not going to change overnight, necessarily. You know, younger Americans are more secular, they're less likely to be conservative Christians. I think it's just a matter of people voting right and getting enough people who are willing to challenge these kinds of viewpoints within the Republican Party.”

Correction: This story was updated at 9:45 a.m. Feb. 17, 2026, to correct the percentage of Americans who sympathize with Christian nationalist ideals. It's 21%.

Materials obtained in a FOIA request show ICE agents have grossly ignored their training this past year.

Use of force incidents reported to ICE spiked during the first two months of the second Trump administration despite agents receiving training on respecting individuals' constitutional rights, according to recently obtained documents.

American Oversight, a nonprofit government watchdog group, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request last year, seeking information on the Trump administration's plan to escalate immigrant enforcement.

After suing the administration for  failing to release the records, American Oversight obtained documents that were published in a report on the group's website earlier this week. The documents contradict several Trump administration talking points that sought to downplay violence committed by ICE agents over the past year.

The documents show that high-ranking ICE officials were aware of a surge in reporting of excessive violence by agents as far back as March. The training materials also indicate that agents were also trained to respect constitutional rights of those who observed and documented  their activities, and that “citizens and noncitizens” could not be“stopped or detained by law enforcement without cause and/or a warrant,” including in their own homes.

“Officers were advised that they must obtain a warrant before searching an individual or making an arrest, and that they are required to identify themselves as immigration enforcement ‘as soon as it is practicable and safe to do so' when making an arrest,” the report from American Oversight also noted.”The officers were told their badges should be ‘clearly displayed when making a stop for officer safety/liability,' but were advised they are not required to publicly identify themselves before making an arrest.”

ICE agents and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration officers have failed to observe these rights on multiple occasions, forcing their way into homes without the proper documentation. 

The training materials also advised ICE agents that they could use “necessary and reasonable” force to quell “disruptive protesters” — but it also said that agents had a duty to attempt to deescalate the situation and issue warnings of arrest before doing so.

Multiple videos of demonstrations against ICE and other immigration agencies show that agents have ignored this instruction, including in the shooting death of Alex Pretti.

The materials obtained by American Oversight also explicitly informed agents that they cannot enter into people's homes — including immigrants without documentation — without a judicial warrant, and advised that administrative warrants do not authorize agents to enter homes or businesses.

The materials obtained stated that, in the first two months of 2025, there was a 353 percent increase in the reporting of excessive use of force by ICE agents. Officers in these incidents shattered car windows, deployed chemical agents, used extreme physical force to detain people, and killed at least one individual.

Despite ICE's increased use of force, the agency tended to ignore its own faults, focusing instead on prosecuting those who allegedly committed violence against agents.

“Emails show 67 incidents of ICE officers' use of force were reported between Jan. 19 and March 20, 2025. During that same period, 28 assaults on ICE agents were reported,” the report from American Oversight noted, adding that, in response to that smaller number, “the head of ICE's Office of Firearms and Tactical Program Use of Force Analysis Unit…suggested ways to increase prosecutions [against residents] in these instances.” 

“Officials did not make any similar comments on addressing the use of force by ICE officers, though there were more than twice as many of such incidents reported,” the report stated.

In spite of the training provided to agents, immigration officers appear to blatantly disregard their training, with little to no repercussions for agents who have violated those rules.

For example, Aliya Rahman, a disabled Minneapolis resident who was not interfering with ICE activities, was still pulled out of her car and detained by agents while she was on her way to a medical appointment. The agents had demanded that Rahman move her vehicle, even though there was nowhere else for her to go at the time. After dragging her out of the vehicle, they brought her to a detention center, denying her medical care in the process. As a result, Rahman ended up losing consciousness while in custody.

“I'm disabled trying to go to the doctor up there, that's why I didn't move,” Rahman later said in an interview.

But according to training materials, ICE agents are told to engage in use of force during vehicle stops only “where probable cause can clearly be established and there is some element of danger or threat.” Force should be “minimal,” and the manual explicitly states that agents do not receive “qualified immunity” for targeting people with “no immediate threat,” the documents state.

In a section titled “Negative Media and Social Media Coverage,” ICE training materials recognize that the prevalence of smartphones and social media means their work will now be documented more widely. The materials also note that such actions — “copwatching” — is “protected by the First Amendment.”

“Be mindful of your words and actions when performing your duties in public as it is likely that bystanders are in possession of recording devices and generally have the right to record you,” the materials state. 

Yet there are several examples of ICE and other DHS agents retaliating against people who dare to record them, including wrongly telling those who are recording their actions that it is illegal to follow and document their on-the-job activities. 

Despite documented instances of ICE agents breaking the law and ignoring training materials, Trump administration officials have defended their actions as legal. 

“Our ICE agents are following the law and are running their operations according to training,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in January. 

Chioma Chukwu, the executive director of American Oversight, said the materials the group received from its FOIA request contradict Noem's claims, showing a “deeply troubling picture of the violent methods used by ICE.”

Residents have been subjected to unnecessary violence from agents, resulting in people being “hospitalized, bystanders swept up in operations, and even the death of a U.S. citizen,” Chukwu told Politico, adding: “These records demonstrate a stark disconnect between the constitutional standards on which ICE claims to train its officers and the abusive and deadly enforcement practices we see detailed in these incident reports and on the streets of American cities in places like Minneapolis.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

This year families are creating makeshift spaces for prayer and planning communal meals on the wreckage of our homes.

For the third consecutive year, Ramadan unfolds as Gazans continue to endure crushing living conditions that strip us of our most basic human rights and dignity. The war may have nominally stopped, but its suffering has not. More than 83 percent of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed, while Israeli forces still control more than half of the Gaza Strip. As a result, many Gazans now live in overcrowded camps, sheltering in flimsy tents that offer no protection from the bitter cold of winter nor the heat of summer. These tents have turned daily life into a living nightmare, depriving families of the ability to experience the spiritual essence of Ramadan as we once did before the war.

Before the war in Gaza began, Ramadan was always a month eagerly awaited, when streets and homes were decorated with colorful lanterns and golden crescents. Traditional markets were filled with an array of dates, nuts, coffee, desserts, and pickles. Islamic nasheeds (devotional songs) resonated through the streets, creating a special and sacred atmosphere. Families would patiently await the Maghrib adhan — the call to prayer that occurs at sunset — to break their long day of fasting, gathering around iftar tables filled with a variety of delicious and vibrant foods, special drinks, and desserts made only during Ramadan, such as kharoub (a sweet drink made by steeping carob) and qatayef (pancake-like dumplings stuffed with nuts or cream). Children would run into the streets after our fast-breaking evening iftar meal, playing on swings, enjoying fireworks, and sharing laughter. Most importantly, mosques were filled with worshippers performing the Taraweeh nightly prayers, sacred ritual that fostered a sense of peaceful togetherness.

Over the past two Ramadans, all of us in Gaza were deprived of nearly everything that once made the month special. Streets that had once remained crowded late into the night fell silent by the afternoon, resembling ghost towns — no decorations, no lights, only an overwhelming emptiness. We fasted for long hours, and if we were fortunate, we broke our fast with nothing more than canned food, lentil soup, or bread made from expired flour. Most of the time, we ended iftar still hungry, painfully remembering how abundant and diverse our iftar tables had once been, shared in the warm presence of our loved ones. Moreover, relentless bombardment and bloody massacres prevented us from performing Taraweeh prayers together in the few remaining mosques, most of which had been destroyed by Israeli forces. In those years, Ramadan was for the first time stripped of its spiritual beauty, transformed from a month of mercy and reflection into one marked by pain and suffering.

Despite the terrible living conditions that persist in the current moment, many in Gaza see this Ramadan as a chance to reclaim some of the joys of the holy month that were lost over the past two years.

We cannot celebrate Ramadan as we did before Israel's war on Gaza, however, because the genocide has left nothing in our lives intact — many families have lost their homes, their loved ones, or both, and some are still unable to return to the neighborhoods they once called home, which remain under Israeli control. Access to basic necessities has become a luxury we can no longer afford. Moreover, the reality of living in tents has forced many into a life reminiscent of the Nakba. Yet, despite all this, the people around me remain determined to observe Ramadan in a way that feels markedly different from the previous two Ramadans spent amid war, making the most of what little they have.

 People have begun decorating their tents with lanterns and crescents made from humanitarian aid boxes.

Signs of resilience and hope are visible in the ways people have begun decorating their tents with lanterns and crescents made from humanitarian aid boxes, painting murals, cleaning the streets of rubble, and stringing illuminated lights. Traditional markets, such as Al-Zawya Market, have reopened, offering a variety of Ramadan goods and decorations. Dessert shops have started preparing an array of Arabic sweets that Gazans love to enjoy after iftar, including qatayef, kunafa (a crunchy, buttery dessert made with shredded phyllo dough), and awameh (deep-fried dough balls soaked in fragrant syrup). Families plan to hold communal iftars beside the rubble of their homes and are making makeshift mosques for Taraweeh prayers. Musaharatis walk through neighborhoods, beating drums as a way of welcoming Ramadan.

Alham Al-Harazeen 43, told me that before the war, Ramadan in her Al-Zaytoun neighborhood carried a special warmth. “I clearly remember how my daughters and I used to clean and decorate our home,” she said. “We worked tirelessly to prepare the iftar table with different kinds of food — desserts, salads, cheese-stuffed sambosa, and roasted chicken. We would invite friends to share iftar with us in our garden, under the olive trees my husband planted.”

She added that her home has since been completely destroyed and that her neighborhood now lies under Israeli control. Al-Harazeen and her family are currently living in a tent in western Gaza City. “We dreamed that the implementation of the second phase of the ceasefire would allow us to spend this Ramadan in our destroyed neighborhood, but that did not happen,” she told me.

Families plan to hold communal iftars beside the rubble of their homes and are making makeshift mosques for Taraweeh prayers.

Despite the harsh living conditions in the tents and the distance from her neighborhood, Al-Harazeen said her family is trying to cope and preserve the spirit of Ramadan, especially for the sake of their children. “For my young children, I cleaned the tent, bought a new carpet, colorful decorations, and prayer clothes, and prepared an empty space in front of the tent where we could have iftar meals,” she said. “I just want them to feel that this Ramadan is different.”

Sojood Al-Khor, 23, told me that for her family, Ramadan this year will be entirely different from the two Ramadans experienced during the war, which were distorted by pain and suffering.

She explained that the spiritual beauty of the past two Ramadans was destroyed as fear and depression dominated people's lives, alongside the hardships of displacement, heavy bombardment, constant anxiety, and the bitterness of loss. She also pointed to the severe shortage of food and clean water, saying, “We used to fast knowing that our iftar would be nothing more than a bowl of lentil soup.”

She added, “Today, we are awaiting Ramadan with great enthusiasm. We long to hear the call to prayer echoing through the streets, to eat healthy and delicious food, followed by qatayef — sweets from which the occupation deprived us for years.”

Al-Khor continued, “We will eat maqluba [a layered dish of spiced rice, meat and vegetables], traditional maftoul [bulgur couscous], and Palestinian musakhan [roasted chicken with sumac]. We will drink juice and clean water. We will celebrate without rockets interrupting our joy and without the screams of loss.”

She concluded, “We thank God for this blessing and ask Him to preserve it, make it complete, and spare us from returning to suffering once again.”

Meanwhile, Ahmed Al-Bourdini, 43, told me that, like many Gazans, he had hoped to enjoy this Ramadan after two years of deprivation. However, the harsh reality surrounding him has made that impossible.

“I live in a torn tent that does not have enough space for my seven family members. I also lost my job as a carpenter as a result of the war. I see the markets filled with types of food we have been deprived of for years, but I cannot afford to buy any of them,” Al-Bourdini said. “The only food we have throughout the day is what my children receive from the charity kitchen — nothing more than lentils, rice, or beans — meals we have grown tired of eating.”

“We will gather around the iftar table, but we will still be missing many of our loved ones, including my aunt, my uncle, and my friends, who were killed in the war.”

“It breaks my heart that Ramadan is coming and I cannot afford to prepare a vibrant, delicious iftar table for my children,” he said.

Samar Alsindawi, 27, said that although she sees this Ramadan as an opportunity to reclaim some of the joys she and her family were deprived of, it remains a sad one.

“This Ramadan allows us to feel some of the spiritual essence of the holy month,” she told me. “I can see decorations, and markets resonating with Islamic nasheeds and filled with foods we were long deprived of, including vegetables, fruits, eggs, and chicken. However, we are still missing many things that made Ramadan special and can never be restored. We lost our home and our neighborhood — the very place that once gave Ramadan its meaning — and now most of us are living in tents in the streets.”

“We will gather around the iftar table, but we will still be missing many of our loved ones, including my aunt, my uncle, and my friends, who were killed in the war — the people we laughed with, shared iftar with, and prayed Taraweeh alongside,” she concluded. “Without them, every Ramadan will feel empty.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

Senate candidate says campaign saw boost in 24 hours since Colbert said CBS told him not to air segment for fear of triggering FCC equal-time rule

Following the decision by The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to air its interview with James Talarico on YouTube, the Texas Democratic Senate candidate said that his campaign raised $2.5m in the 24 hours since Colbert said that CBS told him not to air the segment, for fear of triggering the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) equal-time rule.

The Trump administration is working to block states and cities from offering free transportation to undocumented immigrants, according to reporting from Politico.

The outlet reported today that the Department of Transportation is drafting a law that would prohibit local jurisdictions from using federal transit money to assist undocumented migrants.

In some states and cities, officials have offered free buses to help migrants reach sources, including intake shelters or shelters.

“The change wouldn't stop undocumented immigrants from using public transportation,” Politico reports. “However, it would seek to prevent local agencies or towns from using public transportation to move unauthorized immigrants around the city or outside it to another state, a person familiar with the plan said.”

The transportation department's proposal is part of a package of measures that the White House is considering to include in the transportation reauthorization bill slated to go to Congress this year.

Democratic voters are still lacking optimism about their political party since President Donald Trump's 2024 win, a recent poll reveals.

Only around seven in 10 Democrats have a positive view of the Democratic party, the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found.

“While the overwhelming majority of Democrats still feel good about their party, they're much less positive than they've been in the past,” the AP reports.

The midterm elections are still months away. Increasing negative views of Trump and other Republicans may help their party later this year. Favorable views of the Democratic party plummeted after the 2024 election.

Several Democratic lawmakers will boycott Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday 24 February, and instead attend a rally on the National Mall.

So far, at least 12 Democratic members of Congress will skip the State of the Union. These include senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, as well as progressive representatives Pramila Jayapal and Greg Casar.

The event, dubbed the “People's State of the Union”, is being coordinated by progressive media network MeidasTouch and the liberal advocacy group MoveOn. Attorney and commentator Katie Phang and former anchor Joy Reid will co-host the rally. The event's organizers say it will spotlight federal workers, immigrants and Americans affected by the Trump administration's policies.

In a statement, Van Hollen said that he would not attend the joint address to Congress next week. “Trump is marching America towards fascism, and I refuse to normalize his shredding of our Constitution & democracy,” he said. “This cannot be business as usual.”

Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, said Les Wexner's deposition will be “very important” to the ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, in an interview with MSNOW on Tuesday.

“You don't pay a person the amount of money that Wexner was paying Epstein for just financial advice. They were very close for a long period of time,” Garcia said of the 88-year-old billionaire who employed Epstein as a personal money manager for 20 years. “We have a lot of questions about the finances, the relationship, what Wexner knew, who Jeffrey Epstein also received money from, what was actually Wexner's larger involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell, and we hope those questions will be answered.”

Garcia added that the questions from lawmakers to Wexner will be “pretty direct” during today's deposition. “We know he has significant information as to why he was providing so much money to Epstein,” he said. The lawmaker is also determined to understand why Wexner's name – along with those of other high profile men – were redacted in the justice department's latest release of documents.

“Why the cover-up? Why we protecting possible co conspirators? Why are we protecting Jeffrey Epstein's, essentially, benefactors?,” Garcia said.

Following the decision by The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to air its interview with James Talarico on YouTube, the Texas Democratic Senate candidate said that his campaign raised $2.5m in the 24 hours since Colbert said that CBS told him not to air the segment, for fear of triggering the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) equal-time rule.

In an interview with MSNOW, Democratic congresswoman Jasmine Crockett addressed the claims from Stephen Colbert that CBS told him not to air a television interview with James Talarico, the Texas state lawmaker running for US Senate. Colbert said the decision stemmed from a concern that it would trigger a legal requirement to provide equal access to Talarico's campaign rivals – which includes Crockett.

The congresswoman said that her team received a call from Paramount Skydance – CBS's parent company – who told her that Colbert could, in fact, move forward with airing the Talarico interview but would need to offer Crockett equal time.

“I did not get a request from the Colbert show to go on … I've been on Colbert multiple times, and frankly, if we would have gotten an offer that would have been great, but we're in the middle of early voting, so I'm kind of focused on being in Texas at this moment,” Crockett told MS Now.

In the end, the Talarico interview was instead broadcast on Colbert's YouTube page, which is out of the remit of the FCC. In a statement, CBS said that The Late Show was not prohibited from broadcasting the segment, instead the network “provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates”.

Speaking to MS Now, Crockett added that she had “no love” for CBS News editor Bari Weiss, nor for the FCC chair Brendan Carr. “It is important that we resist,” she said. “I think it probably gave my opponent the boost he was looking for so I think it's probably better than he didn't get on, and that they went straight to streaming.”

Today, congressional lawmakers on the House oversight committee continue their investigation into the handling of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes with a deposition of Les Wexner, the billionaire and former CEO of Victoria's Secret.

Wexner is facing scrutiny for his association with Epstein – who served as his personal money manager from the mid-1980s until 2007, when Epstein was under investigation for sex crimes. He then stepped away from managing Wexner's personal finances. The businessman, who also owned Bath & Body Works, later discovered that Epstein had been mismanaging funds, and severed ties with him.

While Wexner has vehemently denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, he is under renewed dissection after his name appeared in the latest tranche of documents released by the justice department, which showed a 2019 FBI document that listed Wexner as a co-conspirator of Epstein. The 88-year old has never been convicted of a crime, and maintains that he has cooperated with officials at each juncture of their investigations into Epstein, who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019.

Last week, congressman Ro Khanna, revealed that Wexner's name was one of six high-profile men whose names were redacted in the latest document drop by the Department of Justice.

Wexner will testify for lawmakers in New Albany, Ohio, and several Democratic members of the committee will hold a press conference after the deposition.

On a recent morning Eric Taylor, city manager for a small Georgia town of about 5,000 residents called Social Circle, was contacted by a staffer from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“They asked me to turn on the water,” he said of a 1m sq ft warehouse nearby that the federal government recently purchased for $128m, with plans to use it for locking up as many as 10,000 detainees as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation plan.

“I told them I'm not going to do it,” Taylor said. “Not until they come and talk to me.”

The local official, together with the town's mayor and police chief, have all publicly opposed the Department of Homeland Security's plans to open what could become one of the largest immigration detention centers in the US – in a rural town with 19th-century buildings downtown, and horse and cattle farms and hay for sale on the outskirts.

ICE's warehouse purchase in Social Circle is one of several dozen across the US in recent weeks. In a handful of locations – such as Ashland, Virginia and Kansas City, Kansas – local opposition appears to have thwarted such plans.

In the case of Social Circle, officials and residents alike only learned of the Trump administration's plans to buy the empty warehouse from a 24 December Washington Post report – and since then have been clamoring for the federal government's attention, to no avail. Taylor contacted Jon Ossoff, a Democratic senator who has also opposed ICE's plans for the town, and Mike Collins, a Republican congressman who has told Taylor that the federal government will be in touch.

Donald Trump is in Washington today. We'll hear from the president at 3pm ET, when he hosts a Black History Month reception in the East Room of the White House. This comes just weeks after Trump posted and deleted a racist video to social media that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama at apes. The White House ultimately blamed a staffer for the move, and distanced the president from the backlash.

Also today, we'll hear from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who hold a briefing for reporters at 1pm ET.

More than a dozen health and environmental justice non-profits have sued the Environmental Protection Agency over its revocation of the legal determination that underpins US federal climate regulations.

Filed in Washington DC circuit court, the lawsuit challenges the EPA's rollback of the “endangerment finding”, which states that the buildup of heat-trapping pollution in the atmosphere endangers public health and welfare and has allowed the EPA to limit those emissions from vehicles, power plants and other industrial sources since 2009. The rollback was widely seen as a major setback to US efforts to combat the climate crisis.

The suit was brought by the American Public Health Association, American Lung Association, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and 11 other public health and environmental organizations. The lawsuit was filed by green legal organizations Clean Air Task Force and Earthjustice and it names the EPA and the agency's administrator, Lee Zeldin, as defendants.

“EPA's repeal of the endangerment finding and safeguards to limit vehicle emissions marks a complete dereliction of the agency's mission to protect people's health and its legal obligation under the Clean Air Act,” said Gretchen Goldman, president and CEO at the Union of Concerned Scientists, another one of the groups behind the lawsuit. “This shameful and dangerous action by the Trump administration and EPA Administrator Zeldin is rooted in falsehoods not facts and is at complete odds with the public interest and the best available science.”

Fifteen members of Congress have written to Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, demanding to know what steps the United States has taken in response to the mistreatment of a Palestinian-American teenager who spent nine months in Israeli detention.

The letter, led by Senator Peter Welch and first seen by the Guardian, is centered around the case of Mohammed Ibrahim, a Florida resident who was 15 when Israeli soldiers arrested him during a raid on his family's West Bank home in February 2025. He was charged with throwing objects at moving vehicles before being released on 27 November following a guilty plea and suspended sentence, and was taken directly to hospital upon his return.

The then 16-year-old was severely underweight, having lost roughly a third of his body weight, and had suffered a scabies skin infection a few months into his detention, the state department told his family at the time, according to correspondences seen by the Guardian.

Mohammed told family members and US consular officers that he and other Palestinian minors held in the same cell were beaten, threatened, pepper-sprayed and denied adequate food and medical care over the course of his detention.

In an interview with the advocacy group Defense for Children International – Palestine while still detained, Mohammed described receiving three small pieces of bread and a spoonful of yogurt for breakfast, with no dinner provided.

“There has been case after case of Palestinians, including hundreds of children, swept up in the Israeli military justice system, where they are not only denied basic rights of due process but subjected to systematic physical and psychological abuse,” the lawmakers wrote in the 16 February letter. “While such abuses are never permissible, we are especially concerned that cases involving abuse of US citizens in the West Bank be thoroughly investigated and that those responsible are brought to justice.”

A judge in Florida has set a trial date in US president Donald Trump's $10bn defamation lawsuit against the BBC over a Panorama programme.

Court documents from the US District Court Southern District of Florida show judge Roy K Altman set a trial date of 15 February next year.

The order, made on 11 February, said:

This matter is set for trial during the Court's two-week trial calendar beginning February 15, 2027. Counsel for all parties shall also appear at a calendar call at 1:45 p.m. on February 9, 2027.

Unless instructed otherwise by subsequent order, the trial and all other proceedings in this case shall be conducted in Courtroom 12-4 at the Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. U.S. Courthouse, 400 N. Miami Avenue, Miami, Florida 33128.

A US immigration judge has blocked the deportation of a Palestinian graduate student who helped organize protests at Columbia University against Israel's war in Gaza, according to US media reports.

Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested by immigration agents last year as he was attending an interview to become a US citizen, AFP reported.

Mahdawi had been involved in a wave of demonstrations that gripped several major US university campuses since Israel began a massive military campaign in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas militants' deadly 7 October, 2023 attack.

A Palestinian born in the occupied West Bank, Mahdawi has been a legal US permanent resident since 2015 and graduated from the prestigious New York university in May. He has been free from federal custody since April.

In an order made public on Tuesday, Judge Nina Froes said that President Donald Trump's administration did not provide sufficient evidence that Mahdawi could be legally removed from the United States, multiple media outlets reported.

Americans believe that wealthy and powerful people are rarely held accountable, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found after the release of millions of records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's connections in elite US business and political circles.

Some 69% of respondents in the four-day poll, which concluded on Monday, said their views were captured “very well” or “extremely well” by a statement that the Epstein files “show that powerful people in the US are rarely held accountable for their actions.“

Another 17% said the statement described their views “somewhat well,” while 11% said it didn't reflect their thinking. Among both Republicans and Democrats, more than 80% said the statement described their thinking at least somewhat well.

CBS earlier this week attempted to address Stepen Colbert's allegations about a corporate mandate not to broadcast the James Talarico interview.

“The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,” the network said in a statement.

“The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.

“The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”

Colbert has accused the Trump administration of censoring critics and has been particularly critical of FCC chairman Brendan Carr.

“Let's just call this what it is,” he said on Monday. “Donald Trump's administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV.”

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I'm Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with FCC commissioner Anna M Gomez criticizing CBS for what she called “corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech”.

Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC, was appointed by former president Joe Biden to the five-person board in 2023. Her comments follow talkshow host Stephen Colbert accusing the Trump administration and CBS of censorship after he said the network told him not to air a television interview with a Texas Democrat running for Senate.

Gomez said in a statement:

This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech.

The FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes or to create a climate that chills free expression.

CBS is fully protected under the First Amendment to determine what interviews it airs, which makes its decision to yield to political pressure all the more disappointing.

On his show, Colbert told viewers of the Late Show that network lawyers told him he was also prohibited from talking about their refusal to air his interview with James Talarico, a Texas state representative seeking his party's nomination to challenge the Republican incumbent, John Cornyn, for a Senate seat in November.

“He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said, stemming from a concern that it would trigger a legal requirement to provide equal access to Talarico's campaign rivals.

In the end, the interview was instead broadcast on Colbert's YouTube page, which is out of the remit of the Federal Communications Commission. CBS has disputed Colbert's account, saying that the network only “provided legal guidance” that broadcasting the interview could violate the FCC directive.

            As the Florida Legislature ramps up efforts to rename the Palm Beach International Airport after President Donald Trump, a recent trademark filing has some state lawmakers wondering if the Trump family is looking to profit.
    


            The House bill to rename the south Florida hub the President Donald J. Trump International Airport passed the state's House of Representatives 81-30 on Tuesday. But some Democrats raised concerns about related trademark applications that were filed last week by the private entity that handles licenses and trademarks for the Trump Organization.
    


            Democratic Florida state Rep. Shevrin Jones was initially on board with the name change and supported it in a committee vote, saying he would have done the same for a Democratic president. But he said the trademark application was one of the two things that changed his mind (the other being the racist video recently posted and deleted on Trump's Truth Social account, which depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes).
    


            “No president, Democrat or Republican should be able to benefit” from an airport trademark license, Jones said.
    


            Jones quickly filed an amendment to explicitly prevent the Trump Organization from profiting off the trademark, but it failed. The companion Florida Senate bill has passed the required committees and is set to be considered by the full chamber soon before heading to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' desk.
    


            A spokesperson for the Trump Organization said that Trump and his family would not receive royalties or licensing fees from the renaming of the Palm Beach airport, and the House bill's text specifies that the branding would come at no cost.
    


            “To be clear, the President and his family will not receive any royalty, licensing fee, or financial consideration whatsoever from the proposed airport renaming,” said Kimberly Benza, Trump Organization director of executive operations. She stressed that the Florida bill requires a license agreement from The Trump Organization but that they are “willing to provide this right to his hometown county at no charge.”
    


            Still, the trademark applications for “DONALD J. TRUMP INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT,” “PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT” and “DJT” raised eyebrows, given Trump's known interest in renaming buildings, train stations or airports after himself, the broad scope of the applications and the potential for his family to profit.
    


            The trademark application is unusual — hubs named for leaders like Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy or Bill and Hillary Clinton were not protected with trademark filings by the former presidents or their families, trademark attorney Josh Gerben told CNN. For example, the trademark for Reagan National Airport is owned by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
    


            “Normally, the private individual who's being honored isn't protecting his or her name as a trademark,” Gerben said.
    


            Plus, the trademark includes a lengthy list of goods and services that would fall under its purview. It includes watches, clocks, jewelry, clothing, collectible coins, tie clips, belts, restaurants, airport baggage check-in, airport construction and “plastic slippers used in the airport environment when going through security to keep feet and socks clean.”
    


            “From a legal perspective, the attorney that drafted these did a really good job,” Gerben said. “There could be a whole market at the airport, or even off the airport premises. And again, Trump Org would own the trademark and be able to license that name to anybody that was making and selling that merchandise.”
    


            Benza did not respond when asked to clarify whether the Trump Organization would collect any royalties or licensing fees related to merchandise specifically.
    


            Other reasons exist for trademarking a name other than the potential to profit from licensing fees, Gerben noted. That includes preventing infringement on third-party platforms and setting quality standards in connection with the brand.
    


            Benza said the trademark would keep “bad actors from infringing upon or misusing the name.”
    


            Trump has also specifically pitched renaming Washington's Dulles International Airport after himself, as well as New York's Penn Station, CNN previously reported. And the Kennedy Center now bears his name, after a board stacked with Trump allies voted to change the institution's name to the “Trump Kennedy Center.”
    


            North Carolina GOP Rep. Addison McDowell introduced legislation to rename Dulles after Trump, which was cosponsored by a handful of Republicans and is still under discussion, according to a staffer of a member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. But those efforts could be complicated by the Palm Beach airport renaming, since two airports named after Trump could cause significant confusion.

A New York-based NGO has  launched a global initiative to rename the nation's overseas  missions, most of which operate under the name "Taipei," to  "Taiwan Representative Office (TRO)," according to a news  release.

Ming Chiang (江明信), CEO of Hello Taiwan,  announced the campaign at a news conference in Berlin on  Monday, coinciding with the World Forum held from  Monday through Wednesday, the institution stated in the  release.

Speaking at the event, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Huang Jie (黃捷) said she  believed this renaming campaign would enable the  international community to see Taiwan clearly without the  constraints of an ambiguous identity.

"The new generation is eager to engage with the world,"  she said.

Taipei City  Councilor Miao Po-ya (苗博雅) said the use of "Taipei" in the nation's overseas  missions is a lingering irony of history.

The "Taipei" label was once used to avoid political  sensitivity, and it is now time for a change amidst evolving  global geopolitics, said Miao, who was also in attendance.

"Taiwan is a de facto country," Miao said, adding it  deserves a name that can accurately reflect its national  standing and strength.

Most of Taiwan's overseas missions in countries without  formal diplomatic ties use the "Taipei" designation --  primarily as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office  (TECO).

There are, however, a few exceptions, notably in  Lithuania, where the mission is officially titled the  Taiwanese Representative Office. Earlier this month,  Lithuania's Prime Minister Inga Ruginien? described  allowing the name as comparable to having "jumped in  front of the train and lost."



                                                                                A total lunar eclipse coinciding with the Lantern Festival on March 3 would be Taiwan's most notable celestial event this year, the Taipei Astronomical Museum said, urging skywatchers not to miss it.
There would be four eclipses worldwide this year — two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses — the museum's Web site says. 
Taiwan would be able to observe one of the lunar eclipses in its entirety on March 3. 
The eclipse would be visible as the moon rises at 5:50pm, already partly shaded by the Earth's shadow, the museum said.
It would peak at about 7:30pm, when the moon would                                    



                                                                                The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) yesterday held a ceremony marking the delivery of its 11th Anping-class offshore patrol vessel Lanyu (蘭嶼艦), saying it would boost Taiwan's ability to respond to Beijing's “gray zone” tactics.
Ocean Affairs Council Deputy Minister Chang Chung-Lung (張忠龍) presided over the CGA event in the Port of Kaoshiung. Representatives of the National Security Council also attended the event.
Designed for long-range and protracted patrol operations at sea, the Lanyu is a 65.4m-long and 14.8m-wide ship with a top speed of 44 knots (81.5kph) and a cruising range of 2,000 nautical miles (3704km). 
The vessel is equipped with a

The two siblings, surnamed Hung (洪), had received the  parcel two days earlier but did not open it until yesterday,  the first day of the Lunar New Year holiday in Taiwan,  police said.
Chen Chin-cheng (陳金城), head of the Yilan County  Government Police Bureau, said the package  bore no postmark or names and was labeled only with the  siblings' address.

            A Delta Air Lines flight from Houston to Atlanta made an emergency landing early Wednesday after a passenger tried to access the cockpit, the pilot told air traffic controllers.
    


            Delta flight 2557, a Boeing 717 aircraft, had just taken off from Houston's Hobby Airport when the pilot declared an emergency.  Eight-five passengers and five crew members were on board, according to Delta.
    


            “We had a passenger get up and try to access the cockpit,” the pilot can be heard in a radio recording with air traffic control captured by Broadcastify. “Can you coordinate and have security standing by?”
    


            After confirming the cockpit was secure, he requested police and paramedics meet the plane when it landed.
    


            “(He is) in cuffs in the back of the aircraft, but he did assault another passenger, so we would like that other passenger checked out,” the pilot told air traffic control.
    


            In 2025, there were 1,621 unruly passengers reported to the Federal Aviation Administration. So far, in 2026, there have been 126.
    


            Wednesday, the plane signaled an emergency using its transponder and landed back at Hobby Airport about 17 minutes after taking off. Emergency vehicles accompanied the plane to the gate.
    


            “They are coming to the gate. The police are there waiting,” an air traffic controller told emergency responders. “Follow the aircraft to the ramp.”
    


            Delta later told CNN that the passenger “approached crew and customers but did not make contact with or attempt to access the flight deck.”
    


            “The safety of our customers and crew is paramount, and Delta has zero tolerance for unruly behavior,” the airline said in a statement. “We apologize to our customers for this experience and delay in their travels.”
    


            The flight later took off again and arrived in Atlanta about 90 minutes behind schedule.
    


            The FAA is investigating the incident.

Denmark's King Frederik arrived in Nuuk on Wednesday as he embarked on his second visit to Greenland within a year, underscoring unity with the Danish territory in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's push to acquire the Arctic island.

The visit comes after Greenland, Denmark and the U.S. late last month launched diplomatic talks to resolve the crisis between the parties, following months of tension within the NATO defence alliance over Trump's repeated comments.

Denmark's Prime Minister said on Friday that she and her Greenlandic counterpart held a constructive meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but warned that Trump's desire to acquire Greenland hadn't changed.

The King wore a black customized puffer jacket with the Danish and Greenlandic flag on the left side of his chest.

He hugged Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and the head of the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, Kim Kielsen, who received him on the tarmac.

King Frederik will later on Wednesday visit a school and the headquarters of Denmark's Joint Arctic Command in Nuuk, as well as Royal Greenland, the island's largest company and seafood producer. 

The Danish royal family traditionally makes annual visits to Greenland, often appearing in the island's national dress, which includes a white anorak for men and an elaborate beaded collar in bright colours for women, as well as sealskin boots.

King Frederik has spent extended periods of time in Greenland, including a four-month expedition on the island's ice sheet.

On Thursday, the King will visit Maniitsoq on the west coast, around 140 km north of Nuuk. On Friday he will visit the Arctic Basic Training program in the western town of Kangerlussuaq.

            A recent FCC inquiry to ABC about a possible “equal time” rule violation at “The View” raised concerns at CBS that “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” could be targeted next, according to people familiar with CBS's deliberations.
    


            The government pressure clearly had an impact. Lawyers for CBS contacted Colbert's show during his Monday taping. The unusual intervention became a national news story when Colbert told viewers all about it that evening.
    


            In a follow-up on Tuesday night, Colbert said of CBS parent company Paramount, “I'm just so surprised that this giant, global corporation would not stand up to these bullies.”
    


            The “bullies,” in Colbert's telling, are Trump administration appointees who are using antiquated FCC regulations to pressure Trump critics on broadcast TV.
    


            Many critics are now calling out CBS for flinching rather than forcefully standing up to politically motivated intimidation.
    


            “Just like the Jimmy Kimmel fiasco from last year, the FCC didn't have to actually do anything — just issue threats bold enough to scare those who control broadcast networks to obey in advance,” longtime media critic Eric Deggans wrote.
    


A late-night monologue, a shocking suspension – and a reinstatement. Jimmy Kimmel's still taking risks



            The threats have come from FCC chair Brendan Carr, who indicated last month that his Trump-aligned agency will enforce the “equal time” rule that previous agency heads downplayed.
    


            The rule states that if one candidate for public office gets free airtime on a local TV or radio station, the other candidates for that office have a right to airtime, too.
    


            FCC regulations do not apply to cable channels like CNN or streaming platforms like YouTube, which is why Colbert directed his fans to YouTube on Monday night.
    


            The CBS intervention stemmed from Colbert's interview with James Talarico, a Texas state representative and rising star in the Democratic Party, who is currently running in the Texas Senate primary.
    


            The other leading candidate in the race is Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who has also appeared on Colbert in the past, but not during this Senate primary campaign.
    


            A strict reading of the “equal time” rule indicates that the third candidate in the race, Ahmad Hassan, would also qualify for equal time.
    


            But the rule contains big exemptions for news coverage, and for the past two decades, that exemption has also been thought to apply to late-night and daytime talk shows.
    


            Carr is trying to eliminate those exemptions — and observers say it's no coincidence that those shows skew left. President Donald Trump frequently inveighs against Colbert and other late-night hosts.
    


            Carr “had not gotten rid of [the exemption] yet, but CBS generously did it for him,” Colbert asserted Tuesday night.
    


            Colbert said CBS “told me unilaterally that I had to abide by the equal time rules, something I have never been asked to do for an interview in the 21 years of this job.”
    


            CBS said in a statement that “The Late Show” was given “legal guidance” about how to abide by the FCC regulations.
    


            Talarico leaned into the controversy on Tuesday, incorrectly claiming that Trump's FCC “refused to air” the interview, when in fact CBS made that decision.
    


            “Trump is worried we're about to flip Texas,” Talarico wrote on X.
    


            His team also noted that the YouTube video registered millions of views. Curiosity about the controversy helped the interview attract a much larger audience than it would have on the traditional CBS platform.
    


            The attention was timely for Talarico — coming at the start of the primary's early voting window — and lucrative for his campaign.
    


            On Wednesday morning, the campaign said it raised $2.5 million, a single-day record for Talarico, in the 24 hours after the “censored” “Late Show” visit.
    


            Colbert predicted something like this would happen.
    


            As soon as Carr came out in January and foreshadowed a more aggressive approach to “equal time,” Colbert talked about it on “The Late Show.”
    


            “I've got to watch what I say about Trump because Johnny Law is once again coming after yours truly here,” he quipped.
    


            Colbert cited a New York Times headline about a looming late-night “crackdown” by the FCC and said, “So, let's talk about these new crackdown rules that my lawyer warned me not to talk about.”
    


            A few weeks later, Colbert was back on the air saying lawyers had been in touch about the Talarico interview.
    


            The CBS decision-making was informed by the FCC's action against ABC.
    


            As Reuters first reported on February 7, Carr opened an investigation into “The View” after Talarico was interviewed on that show. (Crockett has previously appeared on “The View,” too.)
    


            The FCC did indeed send a “letter of inquiry” to ABC about “The View,” a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.
    


            A letter is the FCC's first step in assessing whether a violation has occurred. There has been a back-and-forth with ABC since then, the source added.
    


            The FCC's enforcement powers are limited. Despite the president's repeated calls for station licenses to be revoked, any such action is exceedingly unlikely and would trigger lengthy legal challenges.
    


            Still, the recent scrutiny of ABC weighed on CBS management, because it signaled an uncertain regulatory environment.
    


            ABC declined to comment on the FCC inquiry about “The View.” But a network source told CNN that the program “regularly hosts sitting leaders and political candidates to discuss differing viewpoints. The format is consistent with how the show has operated for years.”
    


            That's likely what the FCC was told, as well.
    


            When CBS cancelled Colbert's show last summer, in a change that takes effect this May, Trump celebrated the decision and said he thought ABC's Jimmy Kimmel would be canned next.
    


            ABC briefly suspended Kimmel's show last September amid public pressure from Carr, highlighting both the FCC chair's use of his platform to browbeat broadcasters, as well as the public backlash to the government intimidation of broadcasters.
    


            Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said on Tuesday that Carr has been wielding FCC power “in new and laughable ways.”
    


            “By putting pressure on late-night talk shows critical of the Trump administration while openly admitting that conservative talk radio is immune from the FCC's ire, he's making himself the poster boy for big government putting its thumb on the scale of political debate,” Corn-Revere said.
    


            Carr did not respond to requests for comment on the Colbert matter.

            The US Food and Drug Administration has reversed course and will review a new mRNA flu vaccine from Moderna, the pharmaceutical company said Wednesday.
    


            About two weeks ago, the FDA sent Moderna a letter in which it refused to accept the application to review its first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine — a rare move by the federal agency that raised concern about another setback for the technology that's been a target of some Trump administration health officials.
    


The FDA told Moderna that its application didn't contain an “adequate and well-controlled” trial because the control arm didn't reflect the “best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study,” according to the letter, that Moderna posted online. It didn't identify any safety or efficacy concerns, the company said.
    


            But Moderna has since met with the FDA and “proposed a revised regulatory approach” with different pathways by age, according to a news release from the company.
    


            Moderna is now “seeking full approval for adults 50 to 64 years of age and accelerated approval for adults 65 and older, along with a post-marketing requirement to conduct an additional study in older adults,” the news release said.
    


            “Discussions with the company led to a revised regulatory approach and an amended application, which FDA accepted,” Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement. “FDA will maintain its high standards during review and potential licensure stages as it does with all products.”
    


            If the FDA approves the vaccine, it could be available for people ages 50 and older for the upcoming 2026-2027 flu season.
    


            Last week, Moderna said that the initial refusal from the FDA was inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency.
    


            “We appreciate the FDA's engagement in a constructive Type A meeting and its agreement to advance our application for review,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. “Pending FDA approval, we look forward to making our flu vaccine available later this year so that America's seniors have access to a new option to protect themselves against flu.”

MOSCOW, February 18. /TASS/. Moscow will consistently continue to support Havana in protecting its sovereignty and security, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, opening talks with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla. He also called Washington's actions against Havana unacceptable.

Parrilla said that his country is committed to joint projects and agreements with Moscow, despite all difficulties.

TASS has compiled the key statements by the foreign ministers.

Russia calls on the United States to "show common sense, a responsible approach, and ditch plans for a naval blockade" of Cuba, Lavrov said.

He called the US actions against Cuba and statements about Russian-Cuban relations unacceptable.

Moscow "categorically rejects" far-fetched accusations of cooperation between Russia and Cuba as allegedly posing threats to the United States or other countries, Lavrov said.

According to him, Russia will "consistently continue to support Cuba" in protecting its "sovereignty and security."

Cuba is concerned about the deterioration of the international situation and the United States' actions, which pose a threat to the sovereignty of all countries, the foreign minister said.

According to him, Cuba will continue to "resolutely move forward in protecting its independence and sovereignty," maintain its course, and seek effective solutions for the economy.

Cuba "will always be ready for a respectful dialogue on equal terms with any country," he said.

Parrilla said that Havana will stick to the joint projects and agreements with Moscow, despite the difficulties.

Mark Zuckerberg will testify in an unprecedented social-media trial that questions whether Meta's platforms deliberately addict and harm children.

Meta's CEO is expected to answer tough questions on Wednesday from attorneys representing a now 20-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, who claims her early use of social media addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Meta Platforms and Google's YouTube are the two remaining defendants in the case, which TikTok and Snap have settled. 

Zuckerberg has testified in other trials and answered questions from Congress about youth safety on Meta's platforms, and he apologized to families at that hearing whose lives had been upended by tragedies they believed were because of social media. This trial, though, marks the first time Zuckerberg will answer similar questions in front of a jury. And, again, bereaved parents are expected to be in the limited courtroom seats available to the public.

Social-media companies stand trial in pair of landmark cases starting this week

The case, along with two others, has been selected as a bellwether trial, meaning its outcome could impact how thousands of similar lawsuits against social media companies would play out.

A Meta spokesperson said the company strongly disagrees with the allegations in the lawsuit and said they are “confident the evidence will show our long-standing commitment to supporting young people.”

One of Meta's attorneys, Paul Schmidt, said in his opening statement that the company is not disputing that KGM experienced mental health struggles, but rather that Instagram played a substantial factor in those struggles. He pointed to medical records that showed a turbulent home life, and both he and an attorney representing YouTube argue she turned to their platforms as a coping mechanism or a means of escaping her mental health struggles.

Zuckerberg's testimony comes a week after that of Adam Mosseri, the head of Meta's Instagram, who said in the courtroom that he disagrees with the idea that people can be clinically addicted to social media platforms. Mosseri maintained that Instagram works hard to protect young people using the service, and said it's “not good for the company, over the long run, to make decisions that profit for us but are poor for people's well-being.”

Much of Mosseri's questioning from the plaintiff's lawyer, Mark Lanier, centred on cosmetic filters on Instagram that changed people's appearance – a topic that Lanier is sure to revisit with Zuckerberg. He is also expected to face questions about Instagram's algorithm, the infinite nature of Meta' feeds and other features the plaintiffs argue are designed to get users hooked.

Meta is also facing a separate trial in New Mexico that began last week.

Assistant to hard-left parliamentarian among those held over fatal attack on 23-year-old Quentin Deranque

Europe live – latest updates

Eleven suspects, including a parliamentary aide to France's hard-left party, have been arrested in connection with the killing last week of a far-right activist in an incident that has shocked the country and laid bare its deep political divisions.

Quentin Deranque, 23, died on Saturday after sustaining a severe brain injury. The Lyon prosecutor, Thierry Dran, said he had been “thrown to the ground and beaten by at least six individuals” during an incident last week.

The attack took place as Deranque, a mathematics student, was on the sidelines of a protest against a university conference attended by Rima Hassan, a European member of parliament for Jean-Luc Mélenchon's leftwing party, La France Insoumise (LFI).

The anti-immigration Némésis collective, which was protesting against the conference, said at the weekend that Deranque had been there to protect its members and was assaulted by anti-fascist activists. Hassan and other members of LFI have condemned the killing.

The incident has inflamed political tensions in France in the run-up to next month's municipal elections as well as the 2027 presidential race, in which polls suggest the far-right National Rally (RN) could achieve its best result to date.

The first wave of arrests was announced late on Tuesday, as Dran said nine suspects had been arrested. Those detained included people who were suspected of having participated in the violence and others who had provided support to them, sources told Agence France-Presse.

Hours later, two more suspects were arrested: a man who the prosecutor said was suspected of being directly linked to the violence as well as his partner, who was suspected of trying to help him evade justice.

The LFI politician Raphaël Arnault confirmed that his parliamentary assistant was among those detained, adding the aide had “ceased all parliamentary work”.

On Wednesday, as news of the arrests spread, the LFI said it had been forced to evacuate its national headquarters. “The national headquarters of LFI have just been evacuated following a bomb threat,” the party's coordinator, Manuel Bompard, said on social media. “Police services are on site. All employees and activists are safe.”

As videos of last week's deadly confrontation continued to circulate on social media, Mélenchon called for calm. “Let's not fuel the incitement to take the law into one's own hands,” the LFI leader said on social media.

Images broadcast by TF1 of the alleged attack showed several people hitting three others who were lying on the ground, two of whom managed to escape. One witness told AFP: “People were hitting each other with iron bars.”

Némésis, the anti-immigration collective linked to Deranque, has blamed the killing on La Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist youth group co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament. La Jeune Garde – which was dissolved in June – has denied any links to the “tragic events” and Arnault has called the killing “horrific”.

While the government has singled out LFI and La Jeune Garde, the Lyon prosecutor on Monday declined to comment on those claims, instead telling reporters that the investigation was looking into suspected “intentional homicide” and aggravated assault.

Politicians held a minute of silence on Tuesday afternoon at France's national assembly in memory of Deranque, while a march is expected to be held in Lyon next Saturday in his honour.

In a post this weekend, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, addressed the incident and called for calm. “It is essential that the perpetrators of this ignominy be prosecuted, brought to justice and convicted. Hatred that kills has no place among us,” he wrote on social media. “I call for calm, restraint and respect.”

Ukraine has imposed a new package of sanctions against Belarus's leader, Alexander Lukashenko, for helping Russia to sustain its war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 18.

"We will significantly step up efforts to counter all forms of his facilitation of the killing of Ukrainians. We will work with our partners so that this has a global effect," Zelensky said. 

Russia reportedly deployed a network of drone-control relay systems in Belarus in late 2025 that expanded its ability to strike northern Ukrainian oblasts, including Kyiv and Volyn. These systems enabled some attacks on energy and rail infrastructure that otherwise "would not have been possible," according to Zelensky. 

More than 3,000 Belarusian companies, Zelensky added, are supplying Russia with machinery and components, including parts used to manufacture missiles. 

Russia is also building infrastructure on Belarusian territory for the future deployment of its Oreshnik missile, which Zelensky noted was "an obvious threat not only to Ukrainians but to all Europeans."

"Lukashenko has for quite some time been trading Belarus's sovereignty for the continuation of his personal power, helping the Russians circumvent global sanctions over this aggression, actively justifying Russia's war, and now further increasing his own participation in scaling up and prolonging the war," Zelensky said.  "There will be special consequences for this."

The move to punish Lukashenko for aiding Russia's war effort has come amid U.S. President Donald Trump's easing of some U.S. sanctions against Belarus. The diplomatic thaw between the U.S. and Belarus led to the release of multiple political prisoners. 

Belarus was also invited to join Trump's so-called Gaza Peace Board, created to oversee a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas brokered by the U.S. last October.

Unresolved ‘sensitive' issues in peace talks are fate of occupied territories in east Ukraine and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant

Zelenskyy said there has been no agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the key issues at the US-mediated talks in Geneva.

“We can see that some groundwork has been done, but for now the positions differ, because the negotiations were not easy,” the Ukrainian president told reporters after the talks had finished, according to the AFP news agency.

He listed the fate of occupied territories in Ukraine's east and the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russia has taken control of, as the unresolved “sensitive” issues in the peace talks.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there has been no agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the key issues at the US-mediated talks in Geneva. “We can see that some groundwork has been done, but for now the positions differ, because the negotiations were not easy,” the Ukrainian president told reporters after the talks had finished, according to the AFP news agency.

The latest round of US-mediated peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Geneva on Wednesday ended without a major breakthrough, as fighting continues in a war that will enter its fifth year next week. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said no agreement had been reached on the thorniest questions at the negotiations in Switzerland, accusing Moscow of “trying to drag out” the process.

Ukraine has sanctioned the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko for providing military support to Russia and enabling “the killing of Ukrainians”, Zelenskyy has announced. Lukashenko, one of Russian president Vladimir Putin's closest allies, has allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory as a launchpad for its invasion of Ukraine.

Russia has demanded for evidence after five European countries accused Moscow of poisoning the outspoken Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a dart frog poison. The UK, France, Germany Sweden and the Netherlands said on Saturday that laboratory testing of samples from Navalny's body had confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.

Slovakia has threatened to cut emergency electricity supplies to Kyiv if it does not reopen a pipeline that brings Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary. Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico, who is a close ally of Putin's along with Hungary's Viktor Orbán, declared a state of emergency over oil supplies.

Four South African men who were lured into fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine landed at Johannesburg's main airport on Wednesday, public broadcaster the South African Broadcasting Corporation reported. Police were waiting at OR Tambo International Airport, the SABC said. A police spokesperson declined comment, directing enquiries to the foreign affairs ministry.

Ukraine's sports minister has condemned the decision to allow six Russians and four Belarusians to compete under their nation's flags at next month's Winter Paralympics as “disappointing and outrageous” and said Ukraine officials will not attend the opening ceremony or other official events as a result. “The flags of Russia and Belarus have no place at international sporting events that stand for fairness, integrity, and respect,” said Matvii Bidnyi in response to the International Paralympic Committee's decision on Monday.

Russia and Cuba on Wednesday criticised the US energy blockade of the Caribbean island in a show of solidarity in Moscow, where Havana's foreign minister was due to meet with president Vladimir Putin. Cuba's top diplomat Bruno Rodriguez travelled to traditional ally Russia seeking help as his country reels from a severe fuel crisis – intensified by Washington's de-facto oil blockade.

Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico, who is a close ally of Putin's along with Hungary's Viktor Orbán, declared a state of emergency over oil supplies.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was open to a social media ban for children. “If children today, at the age of 14, have up to five hours or more of screen time a day, if their entire socialisation takes place only through this medium, then we shouldn't be surprised by personality deficits and problems in the social behaviour of young people,” he said in an interview with the podcast Machtwechsel.

Heavy snow and rain across Romania left 200,000 homes without electricity on Wednesday, energy minister Bogdan Ivan said, with traffic blocked on motorways and national roads and dozens of trains delayed. Public transport in the capital, Bucharest, was struggling under 40 cm (16 inches) of snow, Reuters reported. Fallen trees halted road and rail traffic, schools closed in several towns and 10 ambulances in six counties were snowed in, the national emergency response agency said.

France has launched wide-ranging investigations into human trafficking and financial fraud among contacts of the late convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein following the release of a trove of files on his activities. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told France Info radio on Wednesday that the investigations will rely on publicly available material alongside complaints filed by child protection groups.

“The greatness of America,” wrote the 19th-century French diplomat, political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville, “lies not in her being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.”

For a brief moment at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) last weekend, European leaders half-thought that their most heartfelt wish – the return of the old US, that believed in the EU ideal and backed a rules-based world order – had been granted.

The previous year on this same stage, US vice-president JD Vance had delivered a gut punch: a brutal ideological assault accusing Europe of abandoning “fundamental values”, and questioning whether the US and EU still had a common agenda.

This year, secretary of state Marco Rubio gave a speech so markedly different in tone that the sheer relief at hearing something other than abuse saw the audience – led by Germany's defence and foreign ministers, plus 40-odd US officials – give him a standing ovation.

Rubio played a soothing tune. The US and Europe “belong together”, he said: if Americans came across as direct and urgent, it was because they know European and US destinies were forever intertwined. The US would “always be a child of Europe”.

Four South African men who were lured into fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine landed at Johannesburg's main airport on Wednesday, public broadcaster the South African Broadcasting Corporation reported.

Police were waiting at OR Tambo International Airport, the SABC said. A police spokesperson declined comment, directing enquiries to the foreign affairs ministry.

A foreign ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment, Reuters reported.

South Africa's government said in November that it would investigate how 17 of its citizens joined mercenary forces in the Russia-Ukraine conflict after the men sent distress calls for help to return home.

President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke to Russian president Vladimir Putin by telephone earlier this month, and Ramaphosa's office said after the call that the two leaders had “pledged their support to the process of returning South Africans fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine“.

Under South African law, it is illegal for citizens to provide military assistance to foreign governments or participate in foreign armies unless authorised by South Africa.

Heavy snow and rain across Romania left 200,000 homes without electricity on Wednesday, energy minister Bogdan Ivan said, with traffic blocked on motorways and national roads and dozens of trains delayed.

Public transport in the capital, Bucharest, was struggling under 40 cm (16 inches) of snow, Reuters reported. Fallen trees halted road and rail traffic, schools closed in several towns and 10 ambulances in six counties were snowed in, the national emergency response agency said.

“Of the 200,000 homes affected so far, roughly 86,000 were reconnected to power, there are ... 266 towns affected,” Ivan told reporters.

He added Romania's power consumption was 7.4GW on average, with surplus wind and hydro production being exported. Production and consumption were up 11% and 6% on the year, respectively, he said.

We have some images from the newswires of Denmark's King Frederik in Greenland. He is expected to attend a luncheon hosted by Greenland's prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and take a tour of a school in Nuuk and the headquarters of the Joint Arctic Command. He is also scheduled to visit a factory of Royal Greenland, the island's largest company.

The latest round of US-mediated peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Geneva on Wednesday ended without a major breakthrough, as fighting continues in a war that will enter its fifth year next week.

Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said no agreement had been reached on the thorniest questions at the negotiations in Switzerland, accusing Moscow of “trying to drag out” the process.

“We can see that some groundwork has been done, but for now the positions differ, because the negotiations were not easy,” he told reporters after the talks.

Zelenskyy said the status of Russian-occupied territories in eastern Ukraine and the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which remains under Moscow's control, were among the most contentious unresolved issues.

The second day of talks ended after just two hours, signalling scant progress and underscoring how distant a deal still appears, despite Donald Trump's promises to end the war on the first day of his presidency.

Read the full report by our Russian affairs reporter Pjotr Sauer here:

Back in Ukraine news, Slovakia has threatened to cut emergency electricity supplies to Kyiv if it does not reopen a pipeline that brings Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary. 

Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico, who is a close ally of Putin's along with Hungary's Viktor Orbán, declared a state of emergency over oil supplies. He said he had ordered the release of 250,000 tonnes of oil from emergency reserves in response to the interruption of oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline.

Ukraine said the pipeline, which runs from Russia through its territory to Slovakia and Hungary, was shut down after being damaged during a Russian attack near the western Ukrainian city of Brody.

Fico claimed the repair work had finished and accused Ukraine of blocking oil supplies in order to “blackmail” Hungary, which opposes Kyiv from joining the EU. Orbán repeated this accusation, saying on social media that Ukraine was “trying to pressure us to support their EU membership”.

“Thankfully, Hungary has a government that doesn't bow to blackmail,” he said.

Fico threatened to end electricity supplies to Ukraine, saying: “If the president (Zelenskyy) believes these supplies are not important, we can decide to withdraw from the electricity supply accord.”

Ukraine has been grappling with severe power outages in several cities including the capital Kyiv, which officials have blamed on delibate Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.

Denmark's King Frederik has arrived in Greenland for a three-day visit in show of support for the autonomous Danish territory after Trump repeatedly demanded control of the island.

AFP news agency reported that the king waved to well-wishers at Nuuk airport and was greeted by Greenland's prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

France has launched wide-ranging investigations into human trafficking and financial fraud among contacts of the late convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein following the release of a trove of files on his activities.

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told France Info radio on Wednesday that the investigations will rely on publicly available material alongside complaints filed by child protection groups.

One will focus on human trafficking, the other on crimes including money laundering, corruption and tax fraud.

Russia and Cuba on Wednesday criticised the US energy blockade of the Caribbean island in a show of solidarity in Moscow, where Havana's foreign minister was due to meet with president Vladimir Putin.

Cuba's top diplomat Bruno Rodriguez travelled to traditional ally Russia seeking help as his country reels from a severe fuel crisis – intensified by Washington's de-facto oil blockade.

US president Donald Trump cut off key supplies of Venezuelan oil to Cuba after ousting Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro and has threatened sanctions on states that sell oil to Havana.

Rodriguez met with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov ahead of seeing Putin, with the long-serving Russian diplomat using Soviet-era language to criticise Washington.

“We call on the US to show common sense and refrain from the military-maritime blockade of the island of freedom,” Lavrov said.

Ukraine officials to boycott Winter Paralympics opening ceremony over Russian athletes

Ukrainian officials will not attend the opening ceremony or other official events of the Winter Paralympics over the decision to allow six Russians and four Belarusians to compete under their nation's flags, Ukraine's sports minister said.

“We thank every official from the free world who will do the same. We will keep fighting,” Matvii Bidnyi said.

The Guardian's chief sports reporter, Sean Ingle, has more on this story here:

Russia has demanded for evidence after five European countries accused Moscow of poisoning the outspoken Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a dart frog poison.

The UK, France, Germany Sweden and the Netherlands said on Saturday that laboratory testing of samples from Navalny's body had confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia. In a joint statement, the five countries said Russia “had the means, motive and opportunity” to administer the poison to Navalny, who was in a remote Arctic penal colony serving a 19-year sentence. He died in February 2024 which the Kremlin said at the time was of natural causes.

Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: “All the accusations against Russia were of the ‘highly likely' variety. There were no specific details. It was purely a proclamation to become the opening act of the Munich (security) conference and to overshadow the Epstein files.

“We demand they hand over concrete data on this issue.”

In Germany, chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was open to a social media ban for children.

“If children today, at the age of 14, have up to five hours or more of screen time a day, if their entire socialisation takes place only through this medium, then we shouldn't be surprised by personality deficits and problems in the social behaviour of young people,” he said in an interview with the podcast Machtwechsel.

He said he was generally sceptical of bans but saw the consequences of mobile phone use. “I think the priority must be how to protect children at an age when they also need time to play, learn, and concentrate at school,” he added.

Merz said his government is considering “various ways of handling it in a more restrictive manner”, including an age limit and forcing platforms to verify users' ages.

It follows moves made by several countries to ban social media to children under the age of 16. The first to introduce such a measure was Australia, where platforms such as TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat were required to remove accounts held by under-16s or face heavy fines since December.

India said it was discussing age restrictions with social media firms, while France's National Assembly backed a bill that would ban social media access for under-15s.

Earlier this week Keir Starmer pledged action on young people's access to social media in “months, not years”, but said that it did not necessarily mean a complete ban on access for under-16s.

Outside of Ukraine, prosecutors in France have opened two new investigations linked to Jeffrey Epstein as they urged potential victims to come forward. 

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probes were launched to examine the alleged sexual offences and possible financial crimes connected to the convicted sex offender. The investigations are seeking to use the millions of files released by the US government related to Epstein, Beccuau added.

“All that data … some will shed light on others to be able to get a well-informed, very broad, panoramic view,” Beccuau told the French broadcaster France Info.

Beccuau called on all potential French victims to come forward, saying: “We want to stand with these victims. We will receive all statements they wish to make.”

Beccuau also said some material from old investigations is to be revisited in the light of new revelations. She was referring to the investigation into French modelling agency executive Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate of the US financier, who died in custody in 2022.

Brunel was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022 after having been charged with raping minors. The case against him was dropped in 2023 in the wake of his death, with no other person charged.

Zelenskyy said there has been no agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the key issues at the US-mediated talks in Geneva.

“We can see that some groundwork has been done, but for now the positions differ, because the negotiations were not easy,” the Ukrainian president told reporters after the talks had finished, according to the AFP news agency.

He listed the fate of occupied territories in Ukraine's east and the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russia has taken control of, as the unresolved “sensitive” issues in the peace talks.

Ukraine sports minister slams Russia's Winter Paralympics entry as ‘deeply outrageous'

Ukraine's sports minister has condemned the decision to allow six Russians and four Belarusians to compete under their nation's flags at next month's Winter Paralympics as “disappointing and outrageous”.

“The flags of Russia and Belarus have no place at international sporting events that stand for fairness, integrity, and respect,” said Matvii Bidnyi in response to the International Paralympic Committee's decision on Monday.

“These are the flags of regimes that have turned sport into a tool of war, lies, and contempt. In Russia, Paralympic sport has been made a pillar for those whom Putin sent to Ukraine to kill – and who returned from Ukraine with injuries and disabilities,” he added.

News agencies have reported some comments from Rustem Umerov, the head of the Ukrainian delegation.

He told reporters that the talks were “intensive and substantive” and that a number of issues were clarified, without providing further details.

“There is progress but no details can be disclosed at this stage,” he was quoted as saying.

Environment minister says Alcoa cleared known habitat of protected species to enable bauxite mining

The environment minister, Murray Watt, has handed a $55m penalty to the US mining giant Alcoa for unlawful land clearing for bauxite mining in Western Australia's northern jarrah forests, south of Perth.

As Watt announced the “unprecedented” remediation order, he said he had also granted the company an exemption to clear further habitat for 18 months while the government considered a proposal for an extension of the company's mining operations to 2045.

Watt said the penalty – known as an enforceable undertaking – was for clearing that occurred from 2019-2025 in known habitat for nationally protected species without an approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

WA's northern jarrah forests are habitat for species including the endangered carnaby's and baudin's black cockatoos.

The $55m penalty, which relates to more than 2,000 hectares of cleared land, requires Alcoa to fund environmental and research measures, including $40m to secure permanent ecological offsets to compensate for the habitat destruction.

“It's the largest conservation‑focused commitment of its kind,” Watt said.

A further $5m will go to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy for conservation programs for affected species, $6m to state government invasive species control projects, and $4m to the University of Western Australia for research into invasive fauna control in the northern jarrah forests.

Alcoa said in a statement that while it “maintains it has operated in accordance with the EPBC Act” it had agreed to pay for the measures.

“The funding supports the health of the Northern Jarrah Forest, including programs and research that improve habitat for threatened species and control invasive flora and fauna,” the company said in a statement.

Watt said he had used an existing national interest provision in Australia's nature laws to allow for further clearing for bauxite mining for 18 months.

It would appear that this is the first time the exemption has been used in a way that benefits the commercial interests of a mine.

The exemption is separate to a new power included in last year's overhaul of the EPBC Act, which allows the minister to approve projects in breach of nature laws.

Watt said the “time limited exemption” would allow Alcoa to continue clearing while the government used a strategic assessment process to consider the company's proposed expansion of its Huntly and Willowdale mining operations, about 100km south of Perth, until 2045.

He said the exemption “ensures the continued supply of bauxite and supports future gallium production, critical for renewable systems like solar panels and wind turbines”.

Watt said it would secure a “stable supply of minerals vital for our net zero transformation and defence industries, while strengthening partnerships with the United States and Japan”, and would allow Alcoa to sustain its operations which employed about 6,000 workers.

Alcoa's spokesperson said the company would limit clearing under the exemption to 800 hectares per year and would “increase annual rates of new rehabilitation to 1,000 hectares per year by 2027”.

The company's president and chief executive, William Oplinger, said: “We are committed to responsible operations and welcome this important step in transitioning our approvals to a contemporary assessment process that provides increased certainty for our operations and our people into the future.

“We appreciate the government's recognition of the important contributions of our operations to the Australian economy.”

Matt Roberts, the executive director of the Conservation Council of Western Australia, said while the significant penalty issued to Alcoa was welcome, “we're talking about a company that strip-mines the northern jarrah forest”.

“It cannot be rehabilitated to its original state after it's been strip-mined. Therefore rehabilitation is not equal to the damage they're doing to our forest,” he said.

“It's in our national interest to preserve the natural world that we have carriage of and in that sense there's a national interest to preserving a jarrah forest that exists nowhere else in the world.”

The Biodiversity Council, an expert group founded by 11 Australian universities, expressed concern that Watt's decision to issue a national interest exemption set a “dangerous precedent”.

“Having reviewed the EPBC Act exemptions register this appears to be the first time that a commercial activity has been given an exemption on economic grounds since the commencement of the Act in 2000,” said Lis Ashby, the Biodiversity Council's policy and innovation lead.
  “The national interest exemption was intended for matters of emergency response, defence and national security, not as a convenience for resource companies committing environmental offences.”
  She said the public did not want to see WA's environment “sacrificed for international profit”.

“The government must stop prioritising the ‘operational certainty' of a foreign corporation over the survival of our unique biodiversity.”

Tania Constable, the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, said the council was “encouraged that sensible and pragmatic collaboration between the government and a significant critical minerals producer has recognised the importance of Alcoa Australia's operations and the company's strategic role in the ongoing development of Australia as a minerals powerhouse”.

“This outcome will allow Alcoa to undergo a more rigorous method of assessment while guaranteeing operations, and thousands of jobs in the local WA community.”

WASHINGTON, February 18. /TASS/. US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff has announced significant progress in negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement on the social network X following the conclusion of the first day of trilateral discussions in Geneva.

According to Witkoff, the United States "moderated a third set of trilateral discussions with Ukraine and Russia." He also stated that the "success [of the current US administration] in bringing both sides of this war together has brought about meaningful progress." "Both parties agreed to update their respective leaders and continue working towards a deal," Witkoff declared.

A source in the Russian delegation told TASS earlier that the participants in the trilateral talks on Ukraine in Geneva had agreed to continue contacts tomorrow. According to the source, today's six-hour talks were very tense.

A new round of trilateral talks on Ukraine involving Russia, the United States, and Ukraine began in Geneva on Tuesday. The Russian delegation is led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Lawyer for defendants accused of terrorism at ICE protest decried by Trump appointee over shirt's potential for ‘bias'

A federal judge in Texas declared a mistrial on Tuesday after a defense lawyer wore a shirt in court with images from the civil rights movement, delaying a closely watched case in which the Trump administration is accusing a group of protesters of being terrorists and says they are part of a “North-Texas antifa cell”.

US district judge Mark Pittman, an appointee of Donald Trump, declared a mistrial only hours after jury selection began at the federal courthouse in downtown Fort Worth. He abruptly halted the proceedings after MarQuetta Clayton, an attorney for one of the defendants, had been questioning potential jurors for about 20 minutes, taking issue with a shirt she was wearing underneath a black blazer. The shirt contained images of civil rights movement leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr and Shirley Chisholm, as well as images of protests from that time.

Clayton was present in the courtroom all day with her shirt visible to Pittman, but the judge did not stop the proceedings until Clayton began questioning the approximately 75 potential jurors who had assembled.

Pittman claimed the shirt sent a political message that could bias jurors and equate the actions of the defendants in the case with that of the civil rights movement, adding that the decision to wear the shirt may have been intentional. Pittman also argued that the defense lawyers would be outraged if prosecutors were to wear shirts that showed pro-ICE or pro-Trump imagery in front of a jury.

The mistrial means the trial will start over with a completely new panel of potential jurors. The judge announced the trial would restart on Monday at 9am.

“I don't think I have any choice but to declare a mistrial,” said Pittman, who also admonished Clayton for showing a poster to potential jurors that had not been submitted to the court ahead of time. “This has to be a first in the history of American jurisprudence, I would think.”

Clayton is running for a county judge position in Texas, where early voting started on Tuesday. She declined to comment as she left the courthouse, only saying that she would continue to represent her client in the case.

The nine defendants whose trial began on Tuesday were part of a group of protesters who were criminally charged after a demonstration at an ICE detention facility near Fort Worth on 4 July.

Demonstrators set off fireworks outside in solidarity with people detained inside, and some of the protesters are accused of spraying graffiti on a guard shack and vehicles in the parking lot, slashing the tires on a government vehicle and destroying a security camera. In court papers, prosecutors described the incident as a coordinated attack, saying the protesters dressed in all black to conceal their identities and were armed. They also alleged one protester shot and wounded a police officer on the scene.

The case is the first time the government has filed terrorism charges against antifa, short for anti-fascist, which is not a defined entity but rather an umbrella of left-leaning ideologies. The Trump administration has vowed to crack down on antifa, and experts believe the case could set a dangerous precedent for prosecutors to bring criminal charges against protesters who demonstrate against ICE.

Lawyers for the nine defendants unanimously agreed they did not think a mistrial was necessary, questioning whether jurors had even seen Clayton's shirt and saying any potential bias could be rooted out during jury selection by questioning the jurors. Shawn Smith, the lead federal prosecutor in the case, did not take a position, simply saying he had not seen a similar situation before.

Harrison Stables, 23, one of the potential jurors who was dismissed after Pittman declared a mistrial, said in an interview he did not see Clayton's shirt, nor did he think it would have influenced his decision-making in the case at all.

Another dismissed juror who declined to give his name said he recognized the imagery on the shirt as saying something about “the fight”, but that it would not have biased his assessment of the case.

“I struggle to understand how this could be fair or reasonable in this judicial environment,” Lydia Koza, whose wife, Autumn Hill, is one of the defendants, said in an interview across the street from the courthouse where supporters had gathered with signs, coffee and food. A cadre of family members, attorneys, journalists, observers and supporters also crammed into an overflow room in the federal courthouse to watch jury selection through a simulcast on Tuesday.

Before the mistrial, questions to the potential jurors on Tuesday offered a glimpse into themes that are likely to be key to the strategy on both sides in the case. Smith, the prosecutor, asked potential jurors about bias against ICE and Trump, among other issues. Clayton asked jurors about the difference between a riot, a noise demonstration and a protest, and whether it was ever acceptable to bring a gun to a protest.

Pittman's decision on Tuesday came after a series of pretrial rulings penalizing lawyers for the defense. In December, he ordered three defense attorneys to each pay a $500 fine for filing aggressive motions for discovery. He also nearly blocked George Lobb, an attorney, from representing one of the defendants, saying he had not met the residency requirements to practice in the district. Lobb eventually withdrew from the federal case and Clayton replaced him.

After declaring the mistrial, Pittman gave a short speech decrying partisan division in the country, saying he was “absolutely disgusted” by it and that “we have to find a way to turn down the anger”.

Rescue crews on skis and snowcats battled blizzard conditions in an effort to reach six backcountry skiers still alive but trapped Tuesday after an avalanche high in the rugged Northern California mountains that left 10 other skiers missing as the danger of more slides remained high.

NEVADA CITY, Calif. (AP) — Eight backcountry skiers have been found dead and one remains missing after an avalanche near Lake Tahoe in California, officials said Wednesday, making it the deadliest avalanche in the U.S. in more than four decades.

Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said during a news conference that authorities have told the families the mission has moved from rescue to recovery. It is the deadliest avalanche in the U.S. since 1981, when 11 climbers were killed on Mount Rainier, Washington.

Crews have faced treacherous conditions in their search for the missing skiers since the avalanche struck Tuesday morning. Search and rescue crews were dispatched to the Castle Peak area of the Sierra Nevada after a 911 call reporting the avalanche had buried 15 skiers. 

Six of them have been found alive.

The group was on a three-day trek in Northern California's Sierra Nevada as a monster winter storm pummeled the West Coast.

Two of those rescued after several hours of searching were taken to a hospital for treatment, said Ashley Quadros, a spokesperson for the Nevada County Sheriff's Office. Heavy snow and the threat of additional avalanches slowed the rescue effort in the mountains near Castle Peak, northwest of Lake Tahoe. 

The area near Donner Summit is one of the snowiest places in the Western Hemisphere and until just a few years ago was closed to the public. It sees an average of nearly 35 feet (10 meters) of snow a year, according to the Truckee Donner Land Trust, which owns a cluster of huts where the group was staying near Frog Lake.




The Sierra Avalanche Center warned Wednesday that the risk of avalanche remains high and advised against travel in the area. Multiple feet of snowfall and gale force winds in recent days left the snowpack unstable and unpredictable, and more snow was predicted to fall, the center said.

Nevada County Sheriff Capt. Russell Greene said authorities were notified about the avalanche by Blackbird Mountain Guides, which was leading the expedition, and the skiers' emergency beacons. The sheriff's office said Tuesday night that 15 backcountry skiers had been on the trip, not 16 as initially believed.

The skiers were on the last day of a backcountry skiing trip and had spent two nights in the huts, said Steve Reynaud, an avalanche forecaster with the Sierra Avalanche Center. He said the area requires navigating rugged mountainous terrain. All food and supplies need to be carried to the huts.

Reaching the huts in winter takes several hours and requires backcountry skills, avalanche training and safety equipment, the land trust says on its website. 

Blackbird Mountain Guides said in a statement said the group, including four guides, was returning to the trailhead when the avalanche occurred. 

“Our thoughts are with the missing individuals, their families, and first responders in the field,” Blackbird said in a statement Wednesday. The company said it is helping authorities in the search.

Several Tahoe ski resorts had been fully or partially closed due to the weather. Resorts, which use controlled explosions and barriers to manage avalanche threats, were not expected to be at as high of a risk as the backcountry, the center said.

The area near Donner Summit was closed for nearly a century before the land trust and its partners in 2020 acquired Frog Lake, which is framed by 1,000-foot-high (300-meter-high) cliffs. Donner Summit is named for the infamous Donner Party, a group of pioneers who resorted to cannibalism after getting trapped there in the winter of 1846-1847.

In January, an avalanche in the region buried a snowmobiler and killed him, authorities said. Each winter, 25 to 30 people die in avalanches in the U.S., according to the National Avalanche Center.

GENEVA (AP) — The latest U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Moscow and Kyiv over Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine ended Wednesday with no sign of a breakthrough and with both sides saying the talks were “difficult,” as the war's fourth anniversary approaches next week.

The negotiations in Switzerland were the third round of direct talks organized by the U.S., after meetings earlier this year in Abu Dhabi that officials described as constructive but which also made no major headway. Expectations for significant progress in Geneva were low.

“The negotiations were not easy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the talks broke up and he spoke briefly by phone from Kyiv with his negotiating team. 

He earlier accused Russia of “trying to drag out negotiations” while it presses on with its invasion — an accusation he and European leaders have repeatedly made in the past.

Despite that, some progress was made on military issues although political differences remain deep, including over the future of land in eastern Ukraine that is occupied by the Russian army and that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to keep, Zelenskyy said.

The head of the Russian delegation, Putin adviser Vladimir Medinsky, told reporters that the two days of talks in Geneva “were difficult but businesslike.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that it's “too early” to speak about the outcome of the talks. Putin has been receiving reports about progress in Geneva, he said.

Both sides said a new round of talks is set to take place.




Zelenskyy described the military discussions as “constructive,” adding that the armed forces of both countries considered how any future ceasefire might be monitored.

“Monitoring will definitely be carried out with participation of the American side,” he said in a voice message shared in a media group chat on WhatsApp.

U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on social media that Washington's push for peace in Ukraine over the past year has “brought about meaningful progress,” without elaborating.

The two armies remain locked in battle on the roughly 1,250-kilometer (750-mile) front line, while Russia bombards civilian areas of Ukraine daily. 

Hours after the first day of talks ended on Tuesday, Russian drones killed a woman and injured a 6-year-old girl and 18-month-old toddler in the southern Ukraine city of Zaporizhzhia, officials said.

Overnight, Russia launched one ballistic missile and 126 long-range drones at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian air force.

Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian and American envoys in Geneva met with representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. 

Europe's participation in the process is “indispensable,” Zelenskyy said.

European leaders, mindful of Putin's wider ambitions, say their own security is at stake in Ukraine and have insisted on being consulted in peace efforts.

Russia and Ukraine appear to still be far apart on their demands for a settlement.

Zelenskyy has offered a ceasefire and a face-to-face meeting with Putin. But Moscow wants a comprehensive agreement before committing to a truce.

Putin's key goals remain what he declared when Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022: Ukraine must renounce joining NATO, sharply reduce the size of its army and protect Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow's orbit.

Additionally, Putin wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four eastern regions Moscow has occupied but doesn't fully control.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine won't surrender land to Russia.

Charlotte Drinkwater, 23, has been visiting Nantucket, Massachusetts, for more than 20 years and shared her ideal day on the island in a viral TikTok video.

Nantucket may be the perfect summer destination for coastal New England vibes, but new data shows that the famously picturesque island off the coast of Massachusetts is not without some flaws.

Recent wastewater surveillance reporting shows once again, as it has before, that cocaine levels in sewer water have been well above the national average from July 2025 to February 2026. 

In October, levels spiked to 2,948.70 nanograms per liter, while the national average remained under 1,000.

There was another spike of 2,815.50 nanograms per liter on Nantucket in December while the national average was just over 1,000, the same reporting shows.

Fox News Digital reached out to the town of Nantucket for comment, which noted its public dashboard with relevant data. "Nantucket, like communities across the country, is not immune to the growing public health crisis of substance misuse and overdose," the town's website acknowledged.

"With a seasonal population that can quadruple in the summer, the town faces the unique challenge of managing behavioral health risks with a limited yet consistent set of resources," it also said.

There were an average of 40,000 visitors on most days in July and August between 2021–2022 — with peak days welcoming above 60,000, according to Cape and Islands, a local publication.

"During COVID, a lot of these communities, and most communities, decided that it was important for them to start testing the water to see if there were any spikes in COVID in the region," Randolph Rice, a Maryland attorney and legal analyst, previously told Fox News Digital.

"But what Nantucket has now decided to do as of the beginning of the summer is to actually start testing for other types of substances, particularly drugs, nicotine and other items… within the system there. And what they're finding is that there is a high level of cocaine," added Rice.

Vice President JD Vance addresses home affordability, Tom Homan's role in immigration operations and more on 'The Story.'

It's all about the economy.

That was the message from top members of President Donald Trump's political team, as they huddled in a closed-door strategy session with Trump administration Cabinet members and their top aides on how best to sell the president's agenda to voters in this year's midterm elections.

The meeting, which was confirmed to Fox News by sources familiar with the gathering, was hosted by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff James Blair, who is steering Trump's political strategy.

According to sources, the message during a slide presentation by chief pollster and strategist Tony Fabrizio was that the economy will be the top issue on the minds of voters, and that the White House needs to spotlight its efforts on easing affordability.

The meeting was held as the GOP works to defend their control of the Senate and their razor-thin House majority in November's midterms. Republicans are facing traditional political headwinds in the midterms, when the party in power usually loses House and Senate seats.

Republicans are also dealing with the president's continued underwater approval ratings, and a slew of surveys, including the latest Fox News polling, that indicates Americans are pessimistic about the economy and say things have not improved in the year since Trump returned to the White House.

Meanwhile, Democrats have scored a series of ballot box victories and overperformances in off-year elections and special elections during Trump's second administration, thanks to their laser focus on affordability amid persistent inflation.

Trump wasn't at the meeting, according to sources. But he's expected to spotlight the economy and his administration's achievements when he holds a political event Thursday in battleground Georgia, which is holding key elections for the Senate and governor this year.

And the president will have an even bigger spotlight next week, when he delivers the annual State of the Union address.

Vice President JD Vance offered a taste of the messaging in an interview Tuesday on Fox News' "The Story."

Pointing to former President Joe Biden's administration, Vance argued, "We're still digging out of the hole the Democrats put us in. And I think the question we're going to put to the American people is, do you want to give the government back over to the people who, frankly, burned down the house and made most Americans much less wealthy and much less safe? Or do you want to double down on the president's leadership?"

The Tuesday evening meeting took place at the Capitol Hill Club, a private venue popular among political insiders that's located next to the Republican National Committee's headquarters, a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol.

Besides messaging, sources say the meeting also focused on polling and the 2026 electoral map, with top Trump political aides walking those attending the gathering through new data on key midterm battlegrounds. And they also emphasized the importance of Cabinet officials hitting the trail as key surrogates to sell the president's agenda.

What Brazil got right that America got wrong.

BRASÍLIA, Brazil — André Borges's aunt was pregnant when they took her.

Borges, now 50, grew up under Brazil's military dictatorship. In power from 1964–1985, the regime was violently censorial — banning any speech it deemed subversive or leftist. Borges's aunt was arrested simply for owning a book by a Marxist author. Unlike many others, her detention was brief; her father knew someone with pull in the regime, who made a phone call and got her released within a day.

Sitting in a left-wing bookshop in the capital city of Brasília, Borges tells me this story to underscore the fragility of Brazilian democracy. A political scientist who studies polarization and the Latin American right, he does not believe that Brazil has truly exorcised the demons of the past. The military is still uncomfortably involved in political life; as memory of the dictatorship recedes, citizens are increasingly oblivious to the danger.

But I had not come to Brazil to discuss its democracy's vulnerabilities. Quite the opposite; I wanted Borges, and others like him, to help me understand why the Brazilian system proved far more capable than its American cousin at a paramount task: protecting democracy from a civilian president who wished to be dictator.

In 2018, Brazilian voters elected Jair Bolsonaro — a former military captain and congressional backbencher — to the presidency. An open admirer of the military regime, Bolsonaro ran as an outsider against a political class that Brazilians widely (and correctly) regard as deeply corrupt. Once in office, he pushed aggressively to consolidate power in his own hands.

But while Bolsonaro's efforts resembled what Donald Trump has done in his second term in the United States, the response from other branches was markedly different.

While the US Congress and the Supreme Court have helped Trump build an imperial presidency, their Brazilian equivalents held the line. Center-right parties in Congress refused to rubber-stamp Bolsonaro's power grabs. Brazil's Supreme Court repeatedly blocked the president's authoritarian moves, and led aggressive probes into crimes against democracy.

Unable to accrue power through legal channels, Bolsonaro turned to the military, convening top generals in 2022 to discuss a coup. Yet the heads of the Air Force and the Army rebuffed him. When Bolsonaro's hardcore supporters attempted a putsch on January 8, 2023 — an insurrection in Brasília deeply influenced by January 6, 2021 — the military did not join the uprising. After an extensive inquiry and trial, Bolsonaro and several key allies were sentenced to lengthy prison stints for the coup plot and subsequent riot.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

On paper, the outcomes in the United States and Brazil should have been reversed. Democratic strength tends to track a democracy's wealth and age — and the United States is both the world's richest country and its oldest democracy. Brazil is a middle-income country that was governed by a military regime so recently that middle-aged citizens remember living under it.

And yet, when the test came, Brazil's core democratic institutions — the legislature, courts, and federal agencies — defended democracy far better than their American peers.

Why?

To find out, I spoke with all sorts of different Brazilians during my travels: from politicians and bureaucrats to journalists and political scientists, and even one of Bolsonaro's longtime neighbors.

What I found was a paradox: that some of the biggest problems in Brazil's democracy, issues that fueled Bolsonaro's rise in 2018, also made the system almost uniquely resistant to the tactics Trump is using in America today.

“We certainly have weaker institutions than the US does,” said Pedro Doria, editor-in-chief of the Brazilian news outlet Meio. “But in a certain sense, our strength comes from the fact that our institutions are weak.”

To learn Brazilian democracy's lessons, we need to first sit with this tension. And we need to understand Brazil as it is: not as an idealized foil for America, but a real place in all its complexity. Only then can we identify how we can make America's institutions as willing to fight for democracy as Brazil's.

In Rio de Janeiro, I climbed a set of hilly, narrow streets to meet another well-known political scientist named Carlos Pereira for a drink.

He had described our destination as a music bar, but that did the place a disservice: It was more like a gigantic party that snaked across at least two blocks, with a small building housing the band stage at the center of it. It was hot in Rio, the peak of the mid-January summer, but people packed in anyway. A vegan brownie salesperson dressed up as a cannabis leaf roamed the crowd.

The ambience made talking tricky, but Pereira wanted me to experience “the real Brazil” while I was visiting. I think, though, he may also just have been in a partying mood — and I could see why. Brazil's emergence from democratic crisis seems to have vindicated the argument he had staked his career on: that its constitution works.

Many people had pointed out the striking difference between how Brazil responded to the January 8 riots versus how the United States responded to January 6. But what no one had done, at least in any depth, is look at the period before that — when Bolsonaro was president — and compared it to Trump's second term so far.

How is it that, when faced with an openly undemocratic leader, Brazil's Congress and Supreme Court performed so much better than their twins in the United States?

When Brazil's military dictatorship fell in 1985, the country elected a constitutional congress to build a new system from scratch. What they came up with, called the Citizen Constitution of 1988, was heavily modeled on the United States: a president, a bicameral Congress, and a federal system with 26 states and a federal district.

But the Chamber of Deputies, Brazil's lower legislative body, is different from the US House. The US has local districts that elect representatives by a winner-take-all system: whoever gets the most votes wins. Brazil, by contrast, has proportional representation: Each state has a set number of seats, allocated to different parties based on their percentage of the state popular vote.

While the US system encouraged consolidation into two parties, the Brazilian system allowed for many parties to win a slice of national power. All it took was a relatively small fraction of the vote in one state. There are currently 20 parties in the chamber, making it one of the most fragmented legislative bodies in the world.

At the time, many American experts (and some prominent Brazilians) predicted disaster. With so many parties splitting seats, no president could hope to have a partisan majority in Congress. Instead, presidents would have to build coalitions and strike deals with out-parties, a system that seemed prone to legislative gridlock and even collapse.

“The combination of presidentialism and multipartism makes stable democracy difficult to sustain,” Scott Mainwaring, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame, wrote in an influential 1993 article. “Not one of the world's 31 stable democracies has this institutional configuration.”

But for the next 20 years, Brazil's system flourished. Two historically successful presidencies — center-right Fernando Henrique Cardoso, followed by the first two terms of the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — tamed the country's hyperinflation crisis and significantly expanded its welfare state. Between 1990 and 2010, Brazil's GDP per capita grew by over 40 percent. By 2013, the country had formally eradicated extreme poverty.

Pereira was part of a generation of Brazilian political scientists who began their careers during Brazil's stratospheric rise. In his view, the policy accomplishments under Cardoso and Lula were not in spite of its system but because of it.

In a 2012 article co-authored with Marcus André Melo, Pereira argued the key to Brazil's system lay in the relationship between the president and Congress. Unlike in two-party systems, where presidents count on partisan loyalty to pass bills, presidents in multiparty democracies have to trade specific favors. Sometimes, this means appointing leaders of other parties to the Cabinet. Other times, it means using presidential powers to direct ungodly levels of pork-barrel spending to states represented by swing legislators.

Indeed, the dominant bloc in Congress is neither the ideological left aligned with Lula nor the radical right associated with Bolsonaro. It is instead something called the Centrão (Big Center): a loose group of parties that are center-right ideologically, but in practice willing to deal with any president who will help them secure pork funding and ignore their pervasive corruption.

Brazil thus replaced the American political logic of partisanship and ideology with self-interest and graft. Most deputies do not even aim to represent the general interest, but rather to secure enough pork for their constituents to ensure reelection. And the system encourages Brazil's executive to overlook the endemic corruption in the legislature; without ideological votes, a push for anti-corruption campaigns will not only fail but also alienate the corrupt.

Pereira and Melo acknowledged these downsides, but argued that they were not existential. The self-interested logic bound Brazilian leaders to the system, giving them a direct financial and careerist stake in maintaining democracy.

“We see a powerful presidency but also a potent web of watchdogs standing on guard to prevent wrongdoing,” they write. “All relevant political forces have found it best to keep submitting their interests and values to the uncertain interplay of democratic institutions.”

Soon after they wrote this, Brazil's democracy would plunge into crisis.

In 2014, Brazilian investigators uncovered shocking evidence of corruption at the highest levels of Brazilian politics. The multibillion-dollar “Lava Jato” scandal, one of the largest in the history of any democracy, implicated a vast swath of Brazil's political, economic, and social elite — producing the greatest period of turmoil since the dictatorship fell.

President Dilma Rousseff, a former anti-dictatorship guerrilla and Lula's chosen successor in the left-wing Workers' Party (PT), was impeached in 2016 for alleged financial improprieties unrelated to the investigation. Her vice president, the center-right Michel Temer, was criminally charged as part of Lava Jato in 2017. Lula was arrested and convicted on (extremely dubious) corruption charges in 2017 as well; when he tried to run for president again in 2018 from prison, the courts blocked him.

All of this played out during a major economic downturn. Together, they caused an explosion of anti-incumbent sentiment in much the same manner as the twin shocks of inflation and revelations about President Joe Biden's age did in 2024.

Thus, what Pereira and Melo identified as the glue holding Brazilian democracy — the transactional character of its legislators — set the stage for the rise of a would-be autocrat.

In early 2018, reporter Ana Clara Costa spent roughly two months with Jair Bolsonaro on the campaign trail. When we met for coffee in Rio, Costa summarized her impressions of the man during those months in three words: “He was insane.”

“Everything he said was so narrow-minded…it was very much based on conspiracy theories, things that were trending on Facebook,” she recalls. “I thought he was [playing] a character, but…the character was what he was 24/7.”

Bolsonaro's public record certainly supported her claims. He made no secret of his nostalgia for military dictatorship: When he voted to impeach Rousseff, he dedicated his vote to the army colonel who supervised her torture in the 1970s. Once, he told a female legislator that “I wouldn't rape you because you don't deserve it.” Another time, he told an interviewer that given the choice between one of his sons coming out as gay or dying, he'd prefer the latter.

Yet in an anti-incumbent moment, none of this was disqualifying — and perhaps even helped by situating him well outside the “normal” political elite. He won the 2018 election handily.

When Bolsonaro assumed office in January 2019, he had many of the same advantages as Trump did in 2025. Both men began with relatively high favorability numbers, owing to the combination of a rabid base and anti-establishment sentiment among swing voters. Both had a legislature with a center-right majority.

And both sought to take advantage in the same way: wielding presidential authority aggressively to consolidate power.

In his first weeks, Bolsonaro used the expansive formal powers of his office — including provisional decrees, which are like executive orders with the legal status of a law — to surveil NGOs, purge “disloyal” civil servants, and loosen gun restrictions. His moves pushed the boundaries of presidential power, cutting into authority rightly reserved for Congress.

“Bolsonaro, he's not a politician in the common sense,” Thomas Traumann, the former minister of communications under Rousseff, said. “He doesn't like to talk to people and negotiate; he just wants to issue orders.”

In the United States, Trump's version — which was significantly more aggressive and legally dubious — faced little pushback from Congress. But in Brazil, legislators immediately fought back.

Congress passed a law stripping Bolsonaro of the power to surveil NGOs. It blocked efforts to expand the number of fireable civil servants. And it reversed his effort to seize control over gun policy.

This congressional assertiveness wasn't just an early-days phenomenon. According to data from Pereira and Melo, Bolsonaro issued 254 provisional decrees — by far the most any Brazilian president issued in a four-year term. Yet these decrees require congressional approval to remain in force, and the institution only provided it in 115 cases. This was the worst success rate of any president to serve a full term; in fact, he was the only such president who had fewer than 50 percent of their decrees approved by Congress.

Similarly, Congress voted to override a Bolsonaro veto on legislation 30 times over the course of his presidency. By comparison, the four prior presidents — stretching back to 1995 — had a total of nine vetoes overridden.

The evidence leaves little doubt that Bolsonaro would like to have acted as Trump has done in his second term. But unlike in the United States, legislators bristled at Bolsonaro's efforts to arrogate lawmaking powers to himself. In effect, they stopped the rise of the imperial presidency before it started.

This resistance was, much like the Bolsonaro presidency itself, a product of the deep logic of the Brazilian system.

In the American two-party system, the entire right-wing ecosystem ran through the Republican Party — an organ that Trump controlled. Those center-right Republicans in Congress who have private qualms about Trump's authoritarian politics do not, for the most part, dare criticize him publicly: They are too afraid for their jobs, social standing, and potentially even their lives. Many of them have acted like what the political scientist Juan Linz called “semi-loyal democrats”: people who pay lip service to democratic ideals, but act in a way that encourages and even normalizes the radicals.

Brazil's multiparty system meant that Bolsonaro had no such control. Legislators had independent political support bases, and could win reelection without backing from the president.

Even more fundamentally, the self-interested logic that ran through the system gave center-right Centrão deputies incentives to actively defend the powers of their branch.

The Centrão cooperated with Bolsonaro when it suited them — he pushed through a major pension reform bill with their support in 2019. But they drew the line at his attempts to build an imperial presidency. The more power he got, the more threat he posed to their narrow interests. And Bolsonaro needed their support more than they needed his.

So from very early on, Brazil had the reverse institutional logic of the United States under Trump II: a center-right Congress calling the shots in a far-right administration.

“It's very clear to me that Bolsonaro [wanted to be] a populist president who slowly undermines checks and balances,” Borges said. “But this wouldn't be good for the old-style, traditional mainstream right. For them, it would be much better to have a weak president.”

About a year into Bolsonaro's presidency, he faced his first major crisis: the coronavirus pandemic. And by all accounts, he botched it. His extreme opposition to both social distancing and vaccines, together with his embrace of crank cures like hydroxychloroquine, led to both mass death and a collapse in his poll numbers.

At the same time, Bolsonaro also became more and more openly authoritarian. At the beginning of the pandemic, he asserted an emergency power to ignore the requirement that Congress approve provisional decrees — effectively asking to be able to make law unilaterally. He arrested critics of his Covid policy using a dictatorship-era national security law, and launched eight times as many investigations under this law per year than the average under prior presidents. He moved repeatedly to block the work of government transparency watchdogs and nominated his hyperloyal chief bodyguard to run the national police.

Perhaps most ominously, he began a sustained attack on the integrity of Brazil's elections, calling the country's electronic voting system corrupt and trying to move to a paper system. On Election Day 2022, he sent federal police officers to obstruct access to polling stations in the opposition's core territory in Brazil's northeast.

Once again, institutions pushed back. Congress had acquired even greater say over Bolsonaro at this point: Facing Covid-related impeachment threats, he was obliged to strike a formal coalition deal with Centrão parties, ceding key control over the legislative agenda and the budget. Congress was able to both repeal the national security law and block the voting changes.

But it was Brazil's judiciary that ultimately took center stage in the pushback against Bolsonaro. The country's highest court blocked his provisional decree power grab, overturned his anti-transparency moves, stopped his crony police appointment, and moved within hours to remove roadblocks at polling stations.

The Brazilian Supreme Federal Court did not merely respond to Bolsonaro's actions, but went on the legal offensive. In 2019, the Court asserted a novel power to open an investigation into threats made against judges by Bolsonaro allies and supporters. This unprecedented court-ordered inquiry spiraled into a wide-ranging investigation into “fake news” and anti-democratic activity led by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a center-right former prosecutor who would, in 2022, take on a dual role as president of Brazil's highest court for electoral matters (the Superior Electoral Court).

With backing from other justices, Moraes wielded his powers aggressively — emerging as the most effective and ruthless opponent of Bolsonaro's power grabs.

The president repeatedly tried to challenge court authority. In 2021, for example, he turned out hundreds of thousands of supporters for rallies on Brazil's Independence Day in which he openly promised to ignore Supreme Court rulings. But the political blowback was severe; two days after the rally, he released a humiliating public letter apologizing for things he said “in the heat of the moment.”

The judicial offensive against Bolsonaro was hardly a given. If you looked at the Court's pre-Bolsonaro record, you might have predicted something like what happened in the United States: ideologically aligned justices greenlighting a president's power grabs.

“The supreme court was heavily divided ideologically prior to Bolsonaro,” said Celso Rocha de Barros, a columnist at Folha de São Paulo (Brazil's New York Times equivalent). “If you look at the two guys with the highest legal reputations, Gilmar Mendes and Luís Roberto Barroso, they hated each other. If you look for it on YouTube, there's video of them cursing at each other during Supreme Court sessions.”

But the clearer Bolsonaro's authoritarian agenda became, the more united the Court grew in opposing him.

So here we have a puzzle: Why did Brazil's seemingly politicized Supreme Court manage to unite in defense of democracy in a way that SCOTUS demonstrably has not?

Once again, the multiparty system is a big part of the story. As in the United States, Brazil's 11 Supreme Court justices are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Except in Brazil, the Senate has members from roughly a dozen parties — meaning that presidents would never have the majority required to approve a true rubber-stamp justice.

“In Brazil, the Supreme Court is not partisan because you don't have this two-party system,” said Christian Lynch, a prominent Brazilian legal theorist. “You can't nominate a judge who is going to be loyal to you as a person, the president.”

But Lynch cautions against reducing the Court's behavior to a simple mechanistic model, in which multipartyism guarantees good judicial behavior. There was an element of choice here: a decision by the justices to push back against Bolsonaro's attempts to consolidate power in his own hands.

Jair Bolsonaro had over three times as many vetoes overridden by Congress as the prior four Brazilian presidents combined. Imagine the current US Congress overriding even one of Trump's!

This choice, he believes, reflects the post-dictatorship ideology of the Brazilian judiciary. Judges saw their role as not just adjudicating criminal cases, or even disputes between the branches, but rather as guarantors of the new democratic order. The Court's expansive powers, in their view, can and should be wielded aggressively to both ensure democracy's survival and promote its health.

From this perspective, the aggressive prosecution of corrupt politicians in the 2010s and the pushback against Bolsonaro in the 2020s reflected the same judicial approach: a self-confidence in its unique role as democracy's guardians. Though the facts of the corruption cases split the justices, and the Bolsonaro situation united them, the ideological logic that governed rulings in both cases was similar.

The justices said as much, both in private and in public. In a remarkable April 2022 essay, then-Justice Luís Roberto Barroso openly positioned the Court as a bulwark against what he called an “institutional coup” by Bolsonaro, describing a court once divided on corruption cases but now “joined in the defense of democracy.” This was, he argued, necessary: Courts play a “decisive” role in resisting authoritarian presidents, and must proactively choose to resist them.

Tellingly, Barroso's essay omits any praise for Congress. In fact, he writes that the Centrão is “allied” with Bolsonaro, describing the faction as being “renowned for its voracity for political offices and public funds.”

This rhetoric reflects another aspect of the court's ideology, and of the Brazilian democratic paradox more broadly. Though Congress's performance during Bolsonaro's term is impressive from an American perspective, the Court mistrusted such a cynical and self-interested body. Here, the weakness of the system indirectly generated another strength: the problems in the legislature emboldening the Supreme Court to shoulder a greater amount of the burden of democratic defense than it might have been expected to.

“Now the judiciary is the ringleader in a process of defending democracy, when it is no longer the legislative branch, which should be,” says Tião Viana, a former senator and governor from Lula's left-wing PT party. “Alexandre de Moraes is the expression of this.”

In October 2022, Brazilian voters delivered the greatest rebuke to Bolsonaro yet: denying him a second term in office. The election was closer than expected: Lula won in a second-round runoff with just 50.9 percent of the popular vote, the slimmest margin of victory of any president in Brazilian history. Support from the center-right was decisive: Some of Lula's prominent rivals, like Geraldo Alckmin and Simone Tebet, backed the leftist on defense-of-democracy grounds.

When Lula's victory was announced, nearly everyone in Brazilian politics immediately accepted the results. The exception, of course, was Bolsonaro. He started plotting a coup.

On December 7, the president met with his minister of defense and the heads of each branch of the military. Bolsonaro presented them with a draft of an order that would declare a state of emergency, annul Lula's victory, and place Justice Alexandre de Moraes under arrest. While the head of the Navy signed on, both the Air Force and Army leaders refused. But they did not notify Moraes or the police — nor did they do so after a second meeting a week later, where Bolsonaro's team again pitched them on the coup plan.

Stonewalled by top generals, Bolsonaro began plotting with some lower-ranked ones. At the same time, his supporters set up an encampment outside the army barracks in Brasília — and, on January 8, the mob swarmed the presidential palace, the Congress, and the Supreme Court simultaneously.

The attack was clearly shaped by the events of January 6, 2021. But instead of intending to convince members of Congress to vote to annul the election, the demonstrators were hoping to inspire the military to follow them out of the barracks and into the halls of power.

They were disappointed. Though the governor of the Federal District (DF), the state in which Brasília is located, was a Bolsonaro supporter who delayed deploying local police, Moraes stepped in swiftly — suspending the governor's authority and ordering a deployment to quash the riot.

In the months following, the justice — backed fully by his colleagues and the newly inaugurated President Lula da Silva— launched a sweeping investigation that uncovered the true scope of the coup plot. We know much of what we know about the plot thanks to depositions from the Army and Air Force chiefs, both of whom testified as part of the Moraes-ordered inquiry.

The evidence was damning enough to secure indictments for Bolsonaro, his former vice president, his defense secretary, and dozens of other generals and aligned officials. Late last year, Bolsonaro and his allies were convicted of masterminding a conspiracy against Brazilian democracy. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison and is currently serving time; a separate electoral court ruling, in 2023, had already disqualified him from running for public office until 2030.

The Bolsonaro inquiry has become the signature moment for the courts: the definitive example of both its vital role in safeguarding democracy and the damage it did to democratic freedom along the way.

From an American point of view, it's hard not to be jealous of a country where a former president incited an insurrection and actually suffered consequences for it. But in the pursuit of accountability, Moraes asserted extraordinary powers — including authority to suspend the DF governor and imprison people without trial if they made violent threats on social media. He both led the investigation into Bolsonaro and served as the presiding judge in the trial.

Even some supporters of Moraes's actions, like Meio's Pedro Doria, describe his actions as a kind of democratic chemotherapy: necessary to defeat the cancerous coup plot, but with dangerous side effects that Brazilians now must reckon with.

Moraes's approach was one “that involves weak institutions, that involves constitutional hardball playing, and that involves a system that's not a full-fledged liberal democracy,” Doria said. “But for the first time in our history, we survived to live another day, and we have a shot at getting this right in the next decades.”

As Brazilians still debate the benefits and risks of Moraes's growing power, they also contemplate another unsettling question: Why did the coup fail in the first place?

This can't be credited to other institutional actors: Neither Congress nor the courts knew about the full scope of Bolsonaro's plans until Moraes's post-facto inquiry. The decision depended entirely on choices made by the Brazilian brass, which had in the past been relatively supportive of Bolsonaro. The military all but openly backed his 2018 bid, and his administration was staffed top to bottom with soldiers who dutifully carried out his orders (however questionable).

“The military themselves, they don't have democratic convictions,” said Adriana Marques, a political scientist who studies civil-military relations in Brazil. “The military in the government used to say that Bolsonaro won the election, so he can do what he wants to do [without limits].”

No one knows for sure why the military made the choices they did. The officers' stony commitment to public silence makes their true intentions hard to divine. In Brasília, I was scheduled to meet with an admiral to discuss all of this. At the last minute, he dropped out — citing an alleged family emergency.

The best theory I've heard, advanced by Marques and others, is that their decision reflected not democratic principle but cost-benefit analysis. The generals simply had little to gain from backing Bolsonaro's coup, and would be risking quite a lot in doing so.

Without consolidated elite support, and with the notion of a coup deeply unpopular with the public, the military would have had a very difficult time consolidating control over the country without risking chaos, economic upheaval, and even mass death.

Moreover, the Biden administration had sent very clear signals that it wouldn't tolerate a coup. Given the Brazilian military's heavy dependence on the United States for training and advanced weapon systems, the specter of an aid cutoff from Washington was a powerful deterrent.

These are, to be clear, narrowly practical reasons to reject Bolsonaro's plan. Few informed people I met in Brazil believed the military had truly come to believe in civilian rule as a matter of principle.

In the United States, by contrast, there is a very long tradition of the military keeping out of civilian affairs. But at present, there is a live debate over whether Trump will order security services to interfere with voting during the midterm elections.

What choice will they make, if faced with a similar test to their Brazilian counterparts?

On January 8, I attended the president's official commemoration of the riots three years earlier. Standing in a hall in the presidential offices, I spotted politicians chatting with uniformed generals behind velvet ropes — their very presence, seemingly, a reassurance that the coup plot had been contained.

The stage featured a giant photo of the Brasília skyline, such as it is, with the phrase “defesa da democracia” emblazoned on it. Geraldo Alckmin, now well into his term as Lula's vice president, claimed that their victory saved Brazilian democracy.

“If they attempted a coup d'état after losing the elections, imagine what they would have done if they had won the elections,” he said.

Two days earlier, Washington marked its first anniversary of January 6 with Trump back in office — and, in a way, proved Alckmin's point.

There were no solemn presidential proclamations marking the day, as there had been under Biden, nor even the vaguest of gestures toward respect for democracy from the president. Instead, a group of rioters who had ransacked the Capitol, pardoned by Trump immediately on his return to power, reenacted January 6 by marching from the White House to the Capitol.

It is important not to overstate Brazil's democratic stability, even in comparison. Its weaknesses were on display even at Lula's January 8 event. The crowds were sparse, illustrating the minimal role the public played in democracy's defense. There were no actions during Bolsonaro's term comparable to the No Kings protests or Minneapolis anti-ICE resistance.

Even more tellingly, the event's centerpiece moment was a staged veto of a bill that would overrule court sentences for roughly 1,000 people convicted of coup-related crimes. The legislation, which would slash Bolsonaro's sentence from 27 years to two, may still become law if the Centrão joins with Bolsonaro's allies in Congress to support an override — a clear illustration of how the elite self-interest that helped stiffen resistance to Bolsonaro's power grabs can just as easily turn against democratic accountability when circumstances change.

There is also a presidential election in the fall. While Bolsonaro is disqualified, his son Flávio is looking likely to be Lula's chief rival. Lula is ahead in the polls currently, but his lead is not insurmountable — and the president turned 80 in October.

But these are problems that many Americans wish they had. It would be better if Congress acted as the first line of defense, resisting Trump's power grabs before things got so bad that ordinary citizens needed to put their literal lives on the line. And it would be better if the US Supreme Court was not so deferential to the Trump administration, but so militantly pro-democratic that the concern was not complicity but rather overreaction.

So if we wanted to learn from Brazil — to think about how we could repair our system so, in the future, it might be as resilient as theirs — what lessons could we take away?

The first, and most obvious, would be to try to create a multiparty system.

This is certainly consistent with Pereira and Melo's takeaway. Their excellent postmortem on the Bolsonaro presidency, titled “Why didn't Brazilian democracy die?” argues that the crisis during his presidency basically vindicates their prior claims about the virtues and stability of Brazil's multiparty system. And indeed, the international expert view on multiparty presidentialism has shifted quite far in their direction.

In a 2023 paper published by Protect Democracy, Scott Mainwaring — the American political scientist once so skeptical of Brazilian-style systems — conceded that he had gotten it wrong. He and his co-author, Lee Drutman, argued that the United States should move to a multiparty system — specifically, by adopting Brazilian-style proportional elections for the House that would provide safeguards against democratic erosion. They write:

Comparative evidence suggests that presidential democracy is most likely to fail when the president's party has a majority in both chambers of the national Congress. A moderate multiparty system would likely induce most presidents to govern more toward the center so as to be able to pass legislation.

The Brazilian case certainly provides real evidence for these conclusions. If the political stars align for something like it, I'd support it — but that likely won't happen anytime soon. So, is there any way to adopt Brazilian-style safeguards against authoritarianism in the meantime?

There is — but we have to shift our focus from structures to incentives.

Brazilian legislators win reelection by providing tangible goods for their constituents. American legislators depend on highly partisan primary voters and the national reputation of their party.

The Brazilian system has problems: It promotes wasteful spending and outright graft. But the American system has bigger ones: It creates ideologically disciplined parties whose members are terrified of bucking an in-party president. This is why a Republican Congress and a Supreme Court confirmed by GOP majorities are so much more supine in the face of Trump than their Brazilian peers.

To Brazilianize the US political system, then, we need to think of specific ways to change the incentives for legislators: to make politics less ideological, and more tied to place and specific deliverables for constituents.

On the electoral front, this might involve a national ban on partisan gerrymandering (which nearly became law during the Biden presidency) and the reform, or ideally abolition, of legislative primary elections (a corrosive American practice with no real peers elsewhere). These two reforms, when put together, would increase the number of representatives in both parties who were responsive to more mainstream electorates — creating incentives for a Brazilian-style culture of dealmaking rather than pure partisanship.

America should also take inspiration from Brazil's approach to congressional oversight. Currently, Congress has no formal role in approving or rejecting executive orders, allowing members of a president's party to easily deflect accountability for power grabs by saying it's out of their hands. But if the United States adopted a version of the Brazilian provisional decree system, mandating that executive orders expire within a set number of days absent affirmative congressional approval, members of a president's party could be held more directly responsible for White House actions — giving purple-state legislators more incentives to buck the party.

These specific reforms are hardly exhaustive: They would not fully “fix” Congress, let alone the Supreme Court or corroded institutions like the Department of Justice. But no study of another country will yield a single reform idea that saves American democracy on its own. Foreign models are best seen as rough templates, not strict blueprints — sources of broad guidance, rather than rigid prescriptions.

And the most valuable insight from Brazil is not that its specific system is the best possible, but rather that its operating logic — its ability to bind political actors to democracy through self-interest and incentives — was incredibly effective at hemming in a would-be authoritarian. American reformers need to start reflecting on that lesson and designing policies that work in our context (with an eye toward not replicating Brazil's corruption problem).

I believe that Americans will soon have an opportunity to put this into practice. Trump's authoritarian project will likely fail as Bolsonaro's did, albeit for very different reasons. Its failure should create an opening to build new barriers against any future president who tries to replicate his unilateral rule.

In that future, we had best be humble enough to learn from younger democracies like Brazil — places that, as of late, have much better democratic recent track records than our own.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic candidates have notched a series of wins in recent special elections — but a new AP-NORC poll finds views of the Democratic Party among rank-and-file Democrats have not bounced back since President Donald Trump's victory in 2024. 

Only about 7 in 10 Democrats have a positive view of the Democratic Party, according to new polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. While the overwhelming majority of Democrats still feel good about their party, they're much less positive than they've been in the past.




The midterm elections are still many months away, and lackluster favorability doesn't spell electoral doom. Other factors could benefit Democrats this year, including broadly negative views of Trump and other Republicans. Additionally, recent polling has found that independents tend to identify more with the party that's out of power, which could boost Democrats this year too. Historically, the party not in the White House has picked up seats in Congress in midterm elections.

But the lack of enthusiasm could be a longer-term problem for the party. Democrats' favorability of their party plummeted after the 2024 election, from 85% in September 2024 to 67% in October 2025. And despite overwhelming victories in November's off-season elections and a string of wins since then, those views haven't recovered. Other polling indicates that Democrats are deeply frustrated with their party.

At the same time, there's some potential good news for Democrats in the new poll. Although Republicans are slightly more enthusiastic about their own party, Americans in general don't think highly of either party. Health care is on many Americans' minds this year, and it's an issue where Democrats have a large advantage, according to the survey. Meanwhile, Republicans have lost some ground on two of Trump's signature issues, the economy and immigration, although Americans don't necessarily trust Democrats more on those issues as a result.




Other polling suggests that Democrats' post-2024 slump is unusually large.

In Gallup's measure of favorability, Democrats' positive views of their own party declined about 12 percentage points in the last year. That marked the lowest measure in that question's history, which dates back to 2001. Notably, Democrats did not see a similar decline after their first loss to Trump in 2016.




That diminished view of the Democratic Party in the AP-NORC polling is consistent regardless of Democrats' age, race, ideology or educational background — suggesting that appealing to a specific group or two won't fix the problem. 

A separate survey from the Pew Research Center last fall found roughly two-thirds of Democrats in September said their own party made them “frustrated” compared to just 4 in 10 Republicans.

Among those frustrated Democrats, about 4 in 10 felt their party was not fighting hard enough against Trump while about 1 in 10 said there was a lack of good leadership or a cohesive agenda. 

It's not just Democrats — Americans aren't thrilled with either party right now.

Roughly one-quarter of Americans have a negative view of both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, according to the AP-NORC data. That double-negativity is especially sharp among independents and Americans under 45.

About half of U.S. adults only view one party positively, and only about 1 in 10 feel good about both parties. 

But Democrats' loss of goodwill is more recent. Polling over the last 25 years from Gallup shows that Americans used to feel much more positively toward the Democrats. Around 2010, public sentiment turned against the Democrats. Since then, at least half of Americans have held unfavorable views of the party, according to Gallup. 




Negative views of the Democrats now rival the most negative points in time for the Republicans.

With health care at the top of Americans' priority lists as costs and premiums rise, Democrats have a possible advantage going into the midterm year. 

About one-third of U.S. adults — 35% — trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared to 23% for the Republicans. That is broadly in line with the last time the question was asked in October 2025. 

At the same time, Republicans have lost some ground on the issues that were key to Trump's reelection — the economy and immigration. But Democrats haven't managed to capitalize on it. Only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults, 31%, say Republicans are the party they trust to handle the economy, down slightly from 36% last year. But Democrats haven't made any gains on this issue; rather, slightly more Americans now say they trust “neither” party to handle the economy. 




Neither party has an edge on who is better equipped to manage the cost of living, which was first asked in the most recent poll. 

Republicans are also down slightly on handling immigration. Only about one-third of U.S. adults trust them to better handle immigration, an apparent decrease from 39% in October. Democrats didn't appear to benefit from that shift either.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,156 adults was conducted Feb. 5-8 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. The margin of sampling error for Democrats overall is plus or minus 6.0 percentage points.

NEW DELHI (AP) — A private Indian university was booted from a top artificial intelligence summit in New Delhi on Wednesday after one of its staffers displayed a commercially available robotic dog made in China, claiming it was the university's own innovation.

According to two government officials, Galgotias University was ordered to take down its stand at the summit a day after the university's professor of communications, Neha Singh, told state-run broadcaster DD News that robotic dog Orion was developed by the Centre of Excellence at the university. 

Internet users, however, quickly identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, sold by China's Unitree Robotics with a starting price tag of $1,600 and used widely in research and education.

On Wednesday, Singh told reporters she never explicitly claimed the dog was university's own creation, but only an exhibit.

The incident was an embarrassment for host country India, the two government officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. 

A statement from Galgotias on Tuesday said the university was “deeply pained” and described the incident as a “propaganda campaign” that could spread negativity and harm the morale of students working to innovate, learn and build their skills using global technologies.

Then, in a new statement on Wednesday, the university apologized for the confusion and said Singh, its representative at the AI summit pavilion, was not authorized to talk to the media and was “ill-informed.” 




“She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and in her enthusiasm at being on camera, gave factually incorrect information,” it said. 

It wasn't immediately clear if the university had removed its booth from the summit.

Still, the episode underscores the high stakes for India as it tries to cast itself as a global hub for AI and advanced manufacturing, drawing billions of dollars in investments while stressing credibility and local innovation.

The summit kicked off on Monday with some organizational hiccups as attendees and exhibitors reported long queues and delays at the venue. Several exhibitors took to social media to complain that their personal belonging and products on display were stolen. Organizers later said the items were recovered and returned.

The India AI Impact Summit, billed as a flagship event in the Global South, is attended by at least 20 heads of state and governments, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a session Thursday. 

Also expected to attend are Google's Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, Qualcomm's CEO Cristiano Amon, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft's President Brad Smith and AMI Labs Executive Chairman Yann LeCun.

The congresswoman who once was rewarded with her own prime-time documentary on CNN and a town hall on MS Now's prime time descended on Munich recently in a clear signal she plans on running for president. And in a stunning-but-not-surprising moment to those who have been paying attention, the possible commander in chief was asked the following foreign policy question:

“Would and should the U.S. actually commit U.S. troops to defend Taiwan if China were to move?” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was asked.

Her answer, per the official transcript:

“Um, you know, I think that this is such a, you know, I think that this is a um — this is, of course, a, um, very long-standing, um, policy of the United States and I think what we are hoping for is that we want to make sure that we never get to that point, and we want to make sure that we are moving in all of our economic research and our global positions to avoid any such confrontation — and for that question to even arise,” she responded.

Needless to say, the U.S. would be in serious trouble if somehow this social media creation ascended to the Oval Office. This answer, which makes the installed 2024 Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, sound like Margaret Thatcher, is disqualifying. Watch it if you haven't: This answer is no different than an unprepared sophomore struggling to reach a minimum time requirement on an oral exam, and the word painful is the only thing that comes to mind.

But Ocasio-Cortez wasn't done there. Here she is mocking Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the origin of American cowboys.

“Our expansion into the interior followed the footsteps of French fur traders and explorers whose names, by the way, still adorn the street signs and towns' names all across the Mississippi Valley,” Rubio said. “Our horses, our ranches, our rodeos — the entire romance of the cowboy archetype that became synonymous with the American West — these were born in Spain. And our largest and most iconic city was named New Amsterdam before it was named New York.”

“My favorite part was when he said that American cowboys came from Spain,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And I believe the Mexicans and descendants of African enslaved peoples would like to have a word on that.”

Is her history correct? Of course not.

Per History.com and the Galicenos of Sawannee Horse Ranch, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés brought the first horses to Mexico in the 16th century in his conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Spanish also instituted breeding farms to produce more horses.

“The modern cowboy culture of the Americas can also trace its roots back to Spain, given that the Spanish settlers trained indigenous populations to wrangle cattle on horseback in order to maintain their ranches in places like Texas, Arizona and New Mexico,” History.com reads.

Whoops. And throw in the fact that Ocasio-Cortez accused Israel of genocide in Gaza — and made such a claim while on German soil, a country that once carried out an actual genocide during World War II — and it's safe to say this was a disastrous trip for the 34-year-old.

But then again, this is a legacy media darling we're talking about, so perhaps the damage won't be as extensive as it should be. Exhibit A is the New York Times:

“Ms. Ocasio-Cortez sounded strongest when drawing a direct contrast with Mr. Trump's vision of the world,” the outlet argued after calling the aforementioned verbal disasters simply “stumbles.”

Ocasio-Cortez “urged the United States to instead deepen its bonds with allies and recommit to global projects like the United States Agency for International Development, the aid agency Mr. Trump dismantled,” the outlet reads.

And it gets even more hilarious, unintentionally, of course.

“American voters have twice elected Mr. Trump, who is hardly a foreign or domestic policy expert and often stumbles far more than she did on Friday,” the story that isn't labeled an opinion piece asserts. “Her slips could ultimately be outweighed by the practice she is getting in speaking about tough international issues, and perhaps by her star power.”

Yes, her star power will outweigh everything. The New York Times will try to ensure that.

As for its dig on President Donald Trump's foreign policy prowess, perhaps the publication, which hasn't endorsed a Republican presidential candidate since Dwight Eisenhower, could also have noted Trump's numerous foreign policy victories. These include the Abraham Accords, essentially ending North Korea's nuclear testing, defeating the Islamic State caliphate, moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, bringing dozens of hostages home, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, better trade deals with dozens of countries through tariff leverage, a relative end to the Israel-Hamas conflict, and setting back Iran's nuclear capabilities for the foreseeable future via Operation Midnight Hammer.

Back to Ocasio-Cortez, this is the same lawmaker who cried on the House floor after congressional funding was approved for Israel's Iron Dome, which has saved countless lives and arguably has saved Israel itself from extinction. She was given a pass for that cheesy performance art by outlets such as Bloomberg, which continues to carry an ocean's worth of water for her to this day.

“It was Ocasio-Cortez who drew the most buzz,” Bloomberg's “report” on her Munich performance reads. “It was her first time at the annual conference, and she doesn't sit on the House foreign affairs or armed services committees. What foreign-policy work she's done has centered mostly on Latin America and her opposition to Israel's war in Gaza.

“Republican commentators back home declared her unprepared for primetime for what they called a flubbed answer to a question from Bloomberg's Francine Lacqua on whether the US would come to Taiwan's defense if China attacked. But she recovered with a cogent response. ‘The US should avoid any such confrontation and for that question to even arise,' she said.”

After portraying Ocasio-Cortez's horrific answer on China-Taiwan as a “Republicans pounce” moment, this “straight news” story went on to quote an Ocasio-Cortez foreign policy adviser who called her incoherent response on China-Taiwan a simple matter of being “careful” with her words.

You can't make this stuff up.

So can Ocasio-Cortez still somehow get elected to the highest office in the land? In 2028, it's doubtful, albeit not impossible, for that to happen. But the smarter money is on Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), who also attended the Munich conference to bash Trump and his administration, to make Ocasio-Cortez his running mate.

Not because she's the best qualified, of course, but for the same reason Harris was chosen in 2020 by Joe Biden: to check off boxes on race, gender, and in this case, age, to appeal to the kind of younger voters who support Zohran Mamdani, the socialist mayor in the process of destroying New York City.

In the 2020s, more than ever, clicks and likes and reposts and snark on social media are just as important as articulating U.S. policy on Taiwan and China and tacitly supporting Hamas as a political entity instead of as a terrorist organization.

THE GREAT BRITISH HOMESCHOOLING CRACKDOWN

Ocasio-Cortez is the poster child of this kind of political environment.

And based not just on her statements in Munich but eight years in Congress, God help us all if she ever ascends to a position of actual power.

            Microsoft says it is on track to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring artificial intelligence to lower-income countries, as concerns mount over the technology's potential to deepen inequality.
    


            The announcement was made Wednesday at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where leading tech executives, government officials and AI researchers are debating how to use AI to solve real-world problems.
    


            Policymakers globally are increasingly worried that the unequal adoption of AI risks widening income and development gaps between rich and poor countries. In December, the United Nations Development Project called for global cooperation on standards and safety to ensure the technology “functions as a shared public good rather than a concentrated advantage.”
    


            At the summit, Microsoft likewise expressed the need for cross-border partnerships to prevent poorer countries from being left behind.
    


            “We need to act with urgency to address the growing AI divide,” Microsoft president Brad Smith and chief responsible AI officer Natasha Crampton said in a joint statement. “Artificial intelligence is diffusing at an impressive speed, but its adoption around the world remains profoundly uneven.”
    


            The company's $50 billion commitment to developing economies by 2030 compares with the roughly $80 billion that Microsoft invested into data centers last year alone, more than half of which was directed to a single economy: the United States.
    


            A recent Microsoft report found that AI usage in the global north, a catch-all term for developed and high-income countries, is roughly twice that of the global south — and growing.
    


            “This disparity impacts not only national and regional economic growth, but whether AI can deliver on its broader promise of expanding opportunity and prosperity around the world,” Smith and Crampton said.
    


            They warned that, just as unequal access to electricity has exacerbated a growing economic gap between the global north and south, without urgent action, the AI divide could perpetuate that disparity in the century ahead.
    


            On the other hand, the technology could be used positively to help poor countries leapfrog older development pathways. “If AI is deployed broadly and used well by a young and growing population, it offers a real prospect for catch-up economic growth for the Global South,” said Smith and Crampton.
    


            “It might even provide the biggest such opportunity of the 21st century,” the pair said.
    


            Microsoft's $50 billion investment will, among other things, help to build the data centers crucial to providing the computing power needed to run AI models. Extending internet access is another focus.
    


            Only about 36% of Africa's population had broadband internet access in 2022, according to the World Bank. That compares with some 90% of US households, official figures show.
    


            The AI Impact Summit, hosted by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highlights the country's ambition to position itself as an AI leader in the global south.
    


            High-profile attendees include Sam Altman of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai who is due to deliver a keynote address on Friday.

FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss President Donald Trump's efforts to reduce drug prices, expedite R&D and establish new vaccine requirements.

A Democratic Senate candidate endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is being slammed for allegedly flip-flopping on one of his primary campaign issues.

Abdul El-Sayed, the progressive candidate who previously ran an unsuccessful bid for Michigan governor, has made "Medicare-for-all" a hallmark of his Senate campaign.

However, as the Michigan Senate primary race heats up, El-Sayed's Democratic opponent, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, is accusing him of backing down from a full "Medicare-for-all" stance and of "rewriting definitions to have it both ways."

MEET THE NEW 'SQUAD': THE NEXT GENERATION OF TRUMP-ERA PROGRESSIVE CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES

Roxie Richner, an El-Sayed campaign spokesperson, responded by telling Fox News Digital, "Dr. El-Sayed is and has always been for ‘Medicare-for-all' — guaranteed public health insurance for every American. Cradle to grave. No premiums, deductibles, or co-pays." 

"Dr. El-Sayed would be the first Democratic doctor elected to the U.S. Senate since 1969, and he looks forward to passing ‘Medicare-for-all' into law," added Richner.

El-Sayed's campaign website page on "A Healthier America" cites a book he co-authored in 2021 in which he wrote that limiting private alternatives to "Medicare-for-all" would be important to ensuring providers accepted the insurance. The book advocates for "Medicare-for-all" as a type of "monopsony" in healthcare, in which there is only a single buyer of medical services, the government. 

"By insuring all Americans, M4A becomes a monopsony in healthcare. This is different from a monopoly, where there's only one seller of a good; in a monopsony there's only one buyer of a good. That gives the single buyer considerable negotiating leverage, which Medicare could use to rein in the cost of drugs, hospital stays, and physician services," the book reads. 

In a November post on X, El-Sayed explained that this monopsony "would instantaneously create a disciplining feature against rising prices," because it "takes out the profit motive on the payer end of the transaction." 

The book further states that "because alternatives to M4A [Medicare-for-all] would be limited, participation of providers would be virtually guaranteed." 

"Instead of spending time and money dealing with the arcane requirements of hundreds of different health plans […] providers could use one streamlined system that would free up resources to focus on clinical care," the books reads. 

The latest version of the federal "Medicare-for-all" Act, introduced in the Senate by Sanders, includes language that would effectively ban most comprehensive private insurance plans and relegate private insurers to providing limited supplemental care. 

The legislation would make it unlawful for "a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act; or (2) an employer to provide benefits for an employee, former employee, or the dependents of an employee or former employee that duplicate the benefits provided under this Act."

El-Sayed testified before the Senate in support of the "Medicare-for-all" Act in 2022, calling it "the clearest pathway to universal, durable healthcare insurance, bar none" and saying that "cradle to grave coverage would do away with the premiums, co pays, deductibles that leave even privately insured Americans rationing their healthcare today." 

The year before, in an interview with NerdWallet, El-Sayed said that under a "Medicare-for-all" plan, the government would be "buying you out" of your private insurance plan but would allow "a few insurance companies that offered a sort of concierge-level service for folks who wanted to pay for that."

In a 2024 episode of the "America Dissected" podcast, El-Sayed emphasized that "we don't really need private health insurance in this country."

He said that "private health insurance is a system by which you have a middleman in our healthcare system making a tremendous amount of money that is leading to a number of the biggest problems in American healthcare whether that's the fact that our costs continue to spiral upward, whether that's the fact that nearly ten million people in our country don't get health insurance at all, or it's the fact that we are consistently in this country, unable to guarantee, even people who are insurance access to the health care they need."

In October, El-Sayed knocked McMorrow for advocating for allowing a public option under universal healthcare, writing on X, "a public option can't deliver healthcare to every Michigander. Medicare for All can." Politico, in December, reported El-Sayed slamming McMorrow's call for universal healthcare with a public option as "incoherent."

"Now a public option is exactly that; it's just an option. There is no reason why it would actually address any of the foundational problems in our system. It wouldn't bring down the rising costs. It wouldn't guarantee people healthcare, and we don't really know how much it would cost," he said. 

Yet, while speaking on the Brian Tyler Cohen podcast in January, El-Sayed suggested that under "Medicare-for-all," "if you like your insurance from your employer or from your union, that can still be there for you."

Days later, speaking on radio channel WDET, he again said, "'Medicare-for-all' is government health insurance guaranteed for everyone, regardless of what circumstances you're in. If you like your insurance through your employer or through your union, I hope that'll be there for you. But if you lose your job, if your factory shuts down, you shouldn't be destitute without the healthcare that you need and deserve." He also said, "If you have a public option, what happens is, the private health insurance system will try to dump all of the most expensive patients onto that public option, vastly increasing the cost of that public option and making it unsustainable."

El-Sayed's campaign website states that he "believes in expanding Medicare to cover every single American from cradle to grave while sustaining the option for workers to keep supplemental private insurance their unions or employers may provide." Amid criticism from McMorrow, El-Sayed doubled down on his "Medicare-for-all" messaging in a January fundraising message, in which he wrote that "private insurance could supplement or duplicate Medicare."

Meanwhile, McMorrow has accused him of not being honest on "Medicare-for-all." 

"On an issue as important as healthcare, you have to be honest about what you're fighting for," McMorrow wrote in a public reply to El-Sayed, adding, "The ‘Medicare-for-all' legislation that you've championed completely eliminates private health insurance as it exists today."

Sanders' office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Team USA skiers Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin, along with Italy's Federica Brignone, are among the many skiers who have expressed concern during these Olympic Games about the accelerating melt of the world's glaciers.

And Olympic host city Cortina is a fitting place for them to be talking about climate change: Glaciers once visible from town have dramatically shrunk. Many have been reduced to tiny glaciers or residual ice patches at high elevations among the jagged peaks of the Dolomites. Any Olympian or spectator wishing to lay eyes on a major glacier would have to take a long drive on winding mountain roads to the Marmolada. It's melting rapidly, too.

The world's top skiers train on glaciers because of the high-quality snow there, and a warming world jeopardizes the future of their sport. Vonn started skiing on glaciers in Austria when she was just 9 years old.

“Most of the glaciers that I used to ski on are pretty much gone,” 41-year-old Vonn said Feb. 3 in response to a question from The Associated Press at a prerace press conference in Cortina before she crashed on the Olympic downhill course. “So that's very real and it's very apparent to us.”

As athletes in snow sports, Shiffrin said, they “get a real front-row view” to the monumental changes underway atop some of the world's highest, coldest peaks.




“It is something that's very close to our heart, because it is the heart and soul of what we do,” Shiffrin told AP after racing Sunday. “I would really, really like to believe and hope that with strong voices and sort of broader policy changes within companies and governments, there is a hope for a future of our sport. But I think right now, it's a little bit of a ... it's a question.”

Shiffrin became the first American skier to win three Alpine gold medals on Wednesday, in an emotional slalom win.

Italian glaciologist Antonella Senese said Italy has lost more than 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) of glacier area since the late 1950s.

“We are observing a continuous and uninterrupted decrease in glacier area and volume. In the last one to two decades, this reduction has clearly accelerated,” Senese, associate professor of physical geography in the University of Milan's environmental science and policy department, said in an interview.

Among the peaks surrounding Cortina d'Ampezzo, there are glaciers on the slopes of the Cristallo and Sorapiss mountains. The 2015 New Italian Glacier Inventory found these glaciers shrunk by about one-third since the 1959-1962 inventory. 

Shortly after winning a second gold Sunday at her home Winter Olympics, Brignone told AP that skiing is “totally different” now than when she was younger. Brignone lives in the Valle d'Aosta, about six hours away.

When she sees how glaciers are retreating to higher elevations, Brignone said she's not thinking about the future of skiing — she's concerned for the future of the planet.

“There we have a lot of glaciers, but they are going up and up, every year, more and more,” she told AP.

Yet many people who don't frequent the mountains remain unaware of what's at stake, so the University of Innsbruck created the Goodbye Glaciers Project. The loss of glaciers has far-reaching consequences, threatening water sources, increasing mountain hazards and contributing to sea level rise. 

The project shows how different warming levels change the amount of ice left on selected glaciers around the world. To be included, glaciers must have an estimated 2020 volume of at least 0.01 cubic kilometers. The Cristallo and Sorapiss glaciers no longer meet that threshold, said Patrick Schmitt, a doctoral student at the University of Innsbruck. 

Some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Cortina is the Marmolada glacier, one of the largest glaciers in Italy and the largest in the Dolomites. An apartment building-sized chunk of the glacier detached in July 2022, sparking an avalanche of debris that killed 11 hikers. The mountain is popular for hiking in summer and skiing in winter.

The University of Padua said in 2023 the glacier had been halved over 25 years.

It's expected to be mostly gone by 2034 if the world warms 2.7 Celsius (4.9 Fahrenheit), according to the Goodbye Glaciers Project. But if warming is limited to 1.5 C (2.7 F — the international goal — the glacier's life could be extended by another six years, and around 100 glaciers in the Alps can be saved, Schmitt said.

“Cutting greenhouse gas emissions now will reduce future ice loss and soften the impacts on people and nature,” Schmitt wrote in an email. “The choices we make in this decade will decide how much ice remains in the Dolomites, across the Alps, and around the world.” 

Globally, more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) has been lost since 2000, according to a study last year. And the prospective impact of climate change on Olympic sport is enormous; the list of places that could host Winter Games is projected to shrink substantially in the coming years. 

In Cortina, Noa Szollos, who is competing for Israel, said in an interview the state of the nearby glaciers speaks to the condition of glaciers around the world.

“I hope we can do something about it,” she said, “but it's a hard time.”

Silja Koskinen of Finland said in an interview she can't train on some of the glaciers she used to because of crevices, rocks and flowing water. Team USA skier AJ Hurt talked about starting the season in October on glaciers in Sölden, Austria. 

“Every year, I feel like we come and there's a little less snow. And every time, we're like, are we really going to start in October? There's no snow here,'” Hurt told the AP. “It is really sad and it's hard to ignore in this sport, definitely, when we're around it so much and it is so clear.” 

Norwegian skier Nikolai Schirmer is leading an effort to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports. Burning coal, oil and gas is the largest contributor to global climate change by far.

In Bormio, Italy, Team USA skier River Radamus said athletes — as stewards of outdoor winter sports— should be on the forefront of trying to defend the environment as best they can.

“It's always present in our mind that we're on a dangerous trend unless we do something right,” Radamus said.

An FBI official says investigative genetic genealogy is underway in the Nancy Guthrie investigation. This after DNA found on a glove matching the type worn by the subject seen in surveillance video outside Guthrie's home the morning she disappeared resulted in no CODIS hits. DNA recovered inside the home also yielded no matches.

The search for Nancy Guthrie entered its third week on Sunday. The 84-year-old disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, 17 days ago.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos cleared Nancy Guthrie's family as suspects in her disappearance case, calling them "victims" who have been cooperative.

Authorities still have no suspects or persons of interest, though Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said more law enforcement operations are expected in the coming days.

A glove with a DNA profile of an unknown male has been recovered, and appears to match the pair worn by a subject seen in surveillance video outside Nancy Guthrie's home, the FBI said Sunday. Investigative genetic genealogy is underway after the DNA resulted in no CODIS hits.

The FBI released a description of the suspect seen in a mask and gloves tampering with the doorbell camera in front of Nancy Guthrie's home in the early morning hours of Feb. 1 around the time she went missing. The suspect is described as a male between 5'9” - 5'10” tall, with an average build and was seen carrying a 25-liter "Ozark Trail Hiker Pack" backpack.

The FBI increased its reward to $100,000 for information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.

Coverage for this event has ended.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said the Nancy Guthrie case is far from being cold, stressing that it will not be considered cold as long as there are leads to pursue.

The sheriff said 400 investigators continue to work on thousands of tips and leads, according to NBC News.

"As long as we have the ability to chase a lead, it's not cold," Nanos said on Tuesday, according to the outlet.

'We're not going to give up. We're going to find Nancy, and we're going to find out who did this," he added.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos on Tuesday made a plea to the suspect in Nancy Guthrie's kidnapping, urging the individual to "just let her go."

"Just let her go. It will work out better for you in the long run," Nanos said, according to Fox 10. "Take her to a park. Take her to the hospital. Just let her go."

The sheriff also appeared to remain optimistic, saying the investigation continues to be a rescue operation and not a recovery mission.

"You have no proof, nobody does, that she's not [alive]," Nanos said. "I'm going to have that faith. Sometimes that hope is all we have."

When asked when the mission might turn into a recovery effort, Nanos said 400 investigators are remain in the field pursuing leads.

"My team, 400 people out there in the field today, woke up this morning and went out there with the hope and the belief that they're going to find Nancy, and she's going to be okay," Nanos said.



The archbishop of New York on Tuesday led a prayer on NBC's "Today" show calling for the safe return of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of the show's co-host, Savannah Guthrie.

Archbishop Ronald Hicks was selected by Pope Leo XIV in December to take over the position, and he assumed the role earlier this month.

Hicks was asked by NBC host Hoda Kotb about any words he wished to share with the Guthrie family, as authorities continue to search for the missing woman.

"It's heartbreaking," he said. "It's hard to watch."

"I want to just extend my absolute support, and especially my prayers, not only my own prayers, but she has a community of people who are praying for her and for her mom and for the entire family," Hicks continued.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told NBC that he has seen a photo that could show the suspect in the Nancy Guthrie case wearing a ring, but said investigators will analyze the image before drawing any conclusions.

“I look at the same photo you look at and I get, I see it,” Nanos said.

He added that the image would be reviewed more closely by investigators.

“I'm going to give that to my team,” he said. “They'll look at that. They'll analyze it and we'll see. Maybe, maybe it is.”



Investigators have not yet obtained video from additional cameras at Nancy Guthrie's home.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told NewsNation correspondent Brian Entin that authorities still do not have video from Guthrie's other cameras and that the video is currently “in the hands of Google.”

It was not immediately clear what type of cameras were involved or how long it may take for investigators to retrieve the material. 



Investigators looking to track down Nancy Guthrie's suspected kidnappers are turning to a relatively new technology that has been attributed to solving some of the most prolific criminal and cold cases in American history.

Investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) is defined as "the science of using genetic and genealogical methods to generate leads for law enforcement entities investigating crimes and identifying human remains," according to the International Society of Genetic Genealogy.

Investigators use a DNA sample to search for genetic familial matches, ultimately looking to narrow down potential identities by zeroing in on close relatives of the individual.

On Tuesday, the FBI confirmed to Fox News Digital that IGG was being used to test DNA found on a glove discovered two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home and other DNA samples found inside her house.

Find out more about how IGG could help solve the case.

This is an excerpt from a story by Fox News Digital's Julia Bonavita.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos addressed speculation involving Adult Protective Services in the case of missing 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, clarifying that after a neighbor made a call, APS sent an investigator to her home the day she was reported missing.

“The day she was reported missing a neighbor called Adult Protective Services,” Nanos said. “They sent an investigator to check on her.”

U.S. Border Patrol confirmed to Fox News its elite BORSTAR search and rescue team used the bright blue shirt seen lying along the walkway at Nancy Guthrie's home as part of a K-9 scent search at the property.

Border Patrol says the BORSTAR team, along with a K-9, was called to Guthrie's home twice — first on the night she went missing and later when the FBI returned to the residence. During those deployments, the team conducted a search using the scent from the blue shirt.

Fox News Digital previously reported that Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said the bright blue shirt was used by a U.S. Border Patrol K-9 team and had been left behind and later retrieved. The shirt was visible on video recorded by Fox News Digital on Feb. 3, two days into the search.

The garment was seen lying near blood drops on Guthrie's front steps.

Fox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said investigators are now debriefing recent forensic findings and prioritizing additional lab work as the investigation into the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie continues.

Nanos told Fox News Digital that the next phase will include separating merged DNA samples recovered inside Guthrie's residence, conducting further testing and evaluating whether any viable material could be used for investigative genetic genealogy or entered into CODIS.

Nanos said each step requires laboratory analysis before investigators can move forward.

Two men wearing badges were seen entering a home next door to Nancy Guthrie's residence as the investigation into the missing 84-year-old woman continues.



The men spent a few minutes inside the neighboring home before exiting and returning to a vehicle parked in the driveway. 



An FBI official tells Fox News Digital that investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) is already underway in the Nancy Guthrie investigation.

IGG is a forensic method that uses crime scene DNA to identify potential relatives through public genealogy databases when traditional law enforcement databases like CODIS produce no matches.

Earlier Tuesday, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Department said the unknown male DNA profile on a glove found two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home did not result in any CODIS hits. The DNA found in her home also produced no hits, according to the sheriff's department.

“The DNA found at the property is being analyzed & further testing needs to be done as part of the investigation," the sheriff's department said on X.

CeCe Moore, the chief genetic genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, told Fox News Digital she has full confidence that investigative genetic genealogy will be able to identify that DNA contributor.

"Thanks to the power of investigative genetic genealogy, it is just a matter of time now until they discover who that DNA belongs to and the investigators are able to pursue those leads and, hopefully, provide answers to Nancy's family," she said.



Authorities deployed specialized Bluetooth and Wi-Fi detection technology during the search for Nancy Guthrie, according to a statement from Parsons Corporation, which said it began assisting the Pima County Sheriff's Department earlier this month.

“At the beginning of February, the Pima County Sheriff's Department requested our support, and we immediately began deployment of BlueFly® units and personnel to Arizona to assist with the search for Nancy Guthrie,” the company said.

Parsons described BlueFly® as “a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sensor intended for search and rescue operations in challenging environments,” adding that the technology “has been used on a variety of air and ground vehicles, and on foot in austere terrain.” The system “provides first responders with a heat map to identify signals within a search area.”

According to the statement, BlueFly® was used Feb. 3 during the sheriff department's search and rescue helicopter operation over the Guthrie neighborhood and was later deployed in additional search efforts by helicopter, ground vehicles and on foot.

“Due to the sensitivity of the investigation, we will not provide additional details on ongoing operations,” the company said.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said there is no evidence Nancy Guthrie was taken across the border into Mexico, though investigators are aware of the region's proximity as the search for the 84-year-old continues.

During an interview with Fox News' Jonathan Hunt, Nanos was asked whether authorities were considering the possibility that Guthrie may have been transported into Mexico.

“You know, I'm sure the FBI has looked into that as well, but no,” Nanos said. “We check all the leads we have…we're like everybody else. We know where Mexico is in relationship to this, and it's a possibility. But no, we have nothing to indicate that.”

Nanos emphasized that investigators are continuing to follow available leads but have not uncovered any information suggesting Guthrie was taken across the border. The investigation remains ongoing.

Two men were seen walking the grounds of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie's property Tuesday as the search continues for the missing woman.

Drone footage captured by Fox's Flight Team shows the pair moving around the residence and into the backyard before entering the garage through an exterior-facing door.

It was not immediately clear who the two men were or whether they were law enforcement officials connected to the investigation, which remains ongoing. Authorities have released few details about the latest steps in the case.

An Arizona gun store owner says an FBI agent showed him pages of photos and names tied to a kidnapping probe and asked him to check for recent gun purchases – even as Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos disputes reports investigators have narrowed their focus to specific people.

Phillip Martin, co-owner of Armor Bearer Arms in Tucson, told Fox News an FBI agent visited his store with three pages containing photos and the names of roughly 18 to 24 people, asking whether any had purchased a firearm there within the past year.

“He actually had given me a list of paper, list of people that had pictures and names on it, and he wanted to know if I could help him pull up in my system if any of these people have purchased a gun in the last year,” Martin said.

Martin said he was initially skeptical but agreed to help out of sympathy for the victim's family.

“Anything that could help them find the person I was willing to help,” he said.

According to Martin, he typed each last name into the store's system, which would display identifying information if the person had made a purchase. He said none of the names returned a match.

The agent, Martin said, told him investigators planned to visit other gun shops to check whether anyone on the list had bought a firearm in the past year.

During an interview with Fox News' Jonathan Hunt, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos pushed back on reports that investigators were asking gun stores about around 40 people.

“That's not true,” Nanos said when asked whether authorities had narrowed the suspect pool to a few dozen individuals.

Nanos said investigators have not zeroed in on a specific group but are instead working through evidence that includes DNA, Ring camera footage and potential leads tied to a Walmart.

“We haven't narrowed it down to anything other than we have pieces of evidence that we're looking at to try to find this individual,” Nanos said.

The unknown male DNA profile on a glove found two miles from the home of Nancy Guthrie has been run through the FBI's DNA database – and did not result in any hits, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt in an interview on Tuesday.

DNA recovered from Guthrie's home also did not match records in the FBI database, Nanos said. The sheriff confirmed that the DNA on the glove was different from the DNA found inside the home.

The FBI confirmed the news to Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

“We're hopeful that we're always getting closer, but the news now, I think, is we had heard this morning that, of course, the DNA on the glove that was found two miles away was submitted for CODIS. And I just heard that, CODIS had no hits,” Nanos said.

The sheriff's department later provided clarity, writing on X: “The DNA that was submitted to CODIS was from the set of gloves found 2 miles away.

“It did not trigger a match in CODIS & did not match DNA found at the property,” it said. “The DNA found at the property is being analyzed & further testing needs to be done as part of the investigation.”



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told Fox News on Tuesday that a blue shirt seen lying along the walkway leading up to Nancy Guthrie's home had been left by federal law enforcement.

Nanos said the bright blue shirt was used by a U.S. Border Patrol K-9 team. The shirt was left behind and then retrieved.

The shirt was seen on video recorded by Fox News Digital on Feb. 3, two days into the search for Nancy Guthrie. The shirt was not far from a trail of blood drops on Nancy Guthrie's front steps.

A Milwaukee attorney told FOX6 Milwaukee that he is offering a new $100,000 reward in the Nancy Guthrie case.

Michael Hupy, who is also the president of Milwaukee Crime Stoppers, said he is offering the reward locally through Crime Stoppers for any information that leads to an arrest.

"She's an 84-year-old woman and I don't like the way the investigation and reward is being handled. I think it could have been done much better,” Hupy told the station. “I think if the $100,000 was put up through crime stoppers – we could be further along."

Hupy said he believes that even though the FBI has its own $100,000 reward, its requirement for personal information may discourage tips from the public. Crime Stoppers allows tipsters to remain anonymous.

"This woman has been missing for two or three weeks and no leads have amounted to anything,” he told the station. “So if the person who knows who the perpetrator is doesn't want his name exposed, wants a reward and has information that will lead to an arrest – crime stoppers is the perfect place to do it.”

He said the reward will be posted through Crime Stoppers of Tucson.

“No one did it, so I am doing it,” Hupy said of his reward offer.

A vehicle parked outside a home in Catalina Foothills that was raided by the FBI on Friday was towed away by an insurance company — not law enforcement — on Monday.

A neighbor told Fox News Digital that the vehicle, which appeared to have significant front end damage, was towed at the request of State Farm after it was totaled in a crash last week. 

The neighbor added that the car's owner is “pissed” about the Friday night raid, and his mother is upset because she doesn't know what's going on — but everyone wants Nancy Guthrie found.

A retired detective told “FOX & Friends” how investigators in Nancy Guthrie's disappearance may have examined her family members before clearing them in the case.

Jon Buehler, who worked as an investigator on the Laci Peterson missing persons case in California over two decades ago, detailed the process that law enforcement usually goes through when trying to pin down a suspect in such a case.

“Generally, what you're going to do is you're going to take a look at where family members were when the abduction took place and verify their alibi that they weren't involved in it,” Buehler said. “You're going to take a look at their friends and associates and make sure that none of them have a criminal record or past history of violence or anything like that, maybe gambling debts or things like that, that would put them in a position to target Nancy.”

Buehler noted that the process requires “a lot of legwork” by detectives that would keep them busy.

“But if the sheriff said that he's confident that they're not part of it, then we have to go with that,” Buehler said, referring to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos announcing that investigators cleared the Guthrie family — including siblings and spouses — in the case.

The sheriff's announcement came as the FBI was awaiting forensic testing results on a glove that had a DNA profile of an unknown male. The recovered glove appears to match the gloves of the subject seen in the surveillance video, the FBI has said.

Buehler said that a timeline on getting results in a case like this will likely be expedited to the “front of the line” due to the intensity of the media coverage and public interest.

He added, however, that the timeline on getting the results is “not like plugging in a wall socket or anything like that,” and may take time.

“It takes those criminalists in the lab time to find the results and quantify them, get them written down, and then have ready to go to the next step, whoever's going to look at it, whether it's Quantico or an intermediary, that's going to determine the quality is still there for further examination,” the retired detective said.



Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told local Tucson station KOLD13 that Nancy Guthrie's family members were ruled out as suspects “in the first few days” of the investigation.

Nanos on Monday issued a public message clearing the Guthrie family out of concern they were being unfairly targeted amid the investigation into the 84-year-old's disappearance.

Nanos described the Guthrie family as “nothing but cooperative and gracious” and emphasized that they are victims in the case.

NBC News national law enforcement and intelligence correspondent Tom Winter said the sheriff likely felt so strongly about making such a statement because there has been a lot of incorrect online speculation surrounding the case.

“Throughout the entirety of this investigation, there's not a single person that I have talked to that's been briefed on it, is familiar with all the facts of the case, that has ever said there was a single piece of evidence that tied back to any member of the Guthrie family, period,” Winter said on NBC's “Today.”

While detecting the signal of Nancy Guthrie's pacemaker may be like searching for a needle in a haystack, an expert says it remains the best hope of finding the missing 84-year-old, Griff Jenkins, co-host of "FOX & Friends Weekend," reported from Tucson, Arizona, on Tuesday morning.

Jenkins reported that Dave Kennedy, who created the new Bluetooth “signal sniffing” technology, told him that the type of pacemaker Nancy Guthrie has is “the best we could hope for.”

“It essentially every one to three minutes sends a simple ping up that says, ‘Hey, iPhone. Are you there?' Well, in this case, if the ‘signal sniffer' in the sky can pick it up, it can locate it, do a triangulation of directional antennas and within an hour they could possibly find her,” Jenkins reported.

Jenkins also flew in a helicopter over the search area's challenging terrain of rough hills and steep culverts, providing a birds-eye view similar to what law enforcement has seen while using the new high-tech Bluetooth scanner in the search for Nancy Guthrie.

“It's much like hunting for a needle in a haystack,” Jenkins said.

An FBI official told Fox News Digital DNA recovered from a glove believed tied to the suspect in the Nancy Guthrie case is still undergoing quality control testing at the sheriff's private lab in Florida after being sent from Tucson on Feb. 12.

Once that process is complete, the profile is expected to be entered into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, in the near future – possibly as soon as tonight – which could determine whether it matches anyone in the national database.

When asked whether more than one suspect could be involved, the official pointed to FBI Director Kash Patel's comments on “Hannity” last week referencing “persons of interest,” indicating investigators are not ruling out the possibility of multiple individuals.

Former Justice department prosecutor Jim Trusty discusses five suspects, including Don Lemon, pleading not guilty to federal civil rights charges related to an anti-I.C.E. protest that disrupted a Minnesota church service in St. Paul on ‘The Story.'

In the America of our childhood, churches were untouchable ground – sanctuaries of refuge, worship, community and peace. They were the one place where the noise of the world fell silent and reverence took its rightful seat. They were the last places anyone imagined would require security plans and emergency drills. Today, those sacred walls are under threat, not in theory, but in cold and documented reality. The data delivers an uncomfortable truth: houses of worship are being targeted with increasing frequency, severity and lethal intent.

Over the past 25 years, nearly 380 violent incidents at religious institutions have produced almost 490 deaths and hundreds of injuries. These attacks have not been confined to troubled neighborhoods or high-crime areas. They have erupted during quiet Sunday services, in rural chapels and suburban parishes alike. Evil has shown up where grandmothers pray, where children sing and where families gather in faith.

These are not abstract statistics. They are real people, real congregations and real communities – forever scarred. A few recent tragedies stand as stark reminders of just how vulnerable houses of worship have become.

The deadliest attack on an American house of worship within the past decade occurred in November 2017, at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. A gunman opened fire during Sunday services, murdering 26 people and wounding 22 others.

FAITH, FREEDOM AND THE FIGHT AGAINST RISING ANTISEMITISM

One year later, in October 2018 at the Tree of Life congregation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, worshippers were again targeted simply because of their faith. Eleven people were killed as they gathered for prayer and fellowship.

More recently, in August 2025 at Annunciation Catholic Church and School in Minneapolis, violence invaded a place dedicated to children and learning. A shooter attacked the church school community, killing two young students and wounding 21 others.

Only weeks later, in September 2025 in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, worshippers at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel were targeted in another shocking assault. An attacker crashed a vehicle into the church building during Sunday services, set it on fire and opened fire on congregants. The attack left four people dead and eight injured, transforming a peaceful morning of worship into chaos and grief.

PASTORS WARN OF 'CHILLING EFFECT' AFTER ANTI-ICE AGITATORS STORM MINNESOTA CHURCH SERVICE

These are only a few examples among hundreds. They illustrate a painful reality: no denomination, no region and no community is immune.

The pattern is impossible to ignore. Violent acts against houses of worship have occurred in more than 30 states, crossing denominational lines and geographic boundaries. No church is too quiet, too humble or too far off the cultural radar to be considered untouchable.

Violence in churches may occur less frequently than other crimes, but frequency is not the point. Consequence is. When violence invades a house of worship, the damage is catastrophic and deeply personal. These are not anonymous buildings. They are sacred spaces filled with families, children and elders who assume, reasonably, that they are safe.

GUNFIRE, ARSON AND VANDALISM: TRACKING POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN AMERICA

An attack on a church is not merely a crime. It is an assault on the very idea that holy ground still exists in America.

This trend did not emerge in a vacuum. It reflects a broader cultural decay – a society increasingly indifferent, and at times openly hostile, to faith and tradition. In too many corners of society, disrespect for the sacred eventually becomes permission for the profane. Words create climates and climates eventually produce actions.

The deadliest attack on an American house of worship within the past decade occurred in November 2017, at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. A gunman opened fire during Sunday services, murdering 26 people and wounding 22 others.

The conclusion is unavoidable. The comforting mantra that "it can't happen here" has become indefensible. Churches need protection, not merely prayers and platitudes, but practical, responsible security measures that recognize the world as it is rather than as it used to be.

This is not a call for fear. This is a call for clarity. Acknowledging that evil exists is not paranoia; it is common sense. And evil, when it strikes, does not aim at hardened targets. It aims at the most vulnerable – families in pews, children in Sunday school and the faithful bowed in prayer.

Churches must be proactive guardians of their flocks, not passive observers of risk. This is bigger than a psalm or a sermon. This is about the soul of America.

Just as schools train for modern threats, churches must implement layered security, establish trained safety teams, coordinate with law enforcement and rehearse emergency response. Security should be as intentional as the sermon and as disciplined as the choir. Preparation is stewardship.

When the places where we pray, teach our children and sing our hymns are under siege, the question is no longer about church security, it is about the character of a nation that still claims to cherish freedom.

This is our moment to wake up, to think clearly and to act boldly. Not just to protect churches, but to protect the idea that Americans can openly worship without fear. That idea is not optional. It is foundational.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani proposed a 9.5% property tax increase on Tuesday as part of his plan for the city's “preliminary budget.” Mamdani said the tax hike was necessary to offset a $5.4 billion budget shortfall in the city due to financial mismanagement by previous administrations. Mamdani's proposal comes months after his mayoral campaign focused on affordability issues and lowering the cost of living.

As part of his $127 billion city budget proposal for fiscal 2027, which begins in July, he described the property tax increase as a “last resort,” predicated on Gov. Kathy Hochul's (D-NY) refusal to implement a tax hike on affluent New Yorkers and corporations. Mamdani emphasized the proposed property tax increase could be avoided if Hochul agreed to taxing the wealthy.

Today, I'm releasing the City's preliminary budget. After years of fiscal mismanagement, we're staring at a $5.4 billion budget gap — and two paths. One: Albany can raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy and the most profitable corporations and address the fiscal imbalance between…

“Today, I'm releasing the City's preliminary budget,” Mamdani posted on X. “After years of fiscal mismanagement, we're staring at a $5.4 billion budget gap — and two paths.” 

“One: Albany can raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy and the most profitable corporations and address the fiscal imbalance between our city and state,” he said. 

“The other, a last resort: balance the budget on the backs of working people using the only tools at the City's disposal,” Mamdani said. 

“The first path matches a structural crisis with a sustainable and fair solution. I know where I stand,” Mamdani added. “New Yorkers voted for bold change and competent leadership. We will deliver both, and we look forward to partnering with Albany to protect working New Yorkers.”

If approved, it would be the first property tax increase in New York City since 2003, according to reports.

Hochul and other Democrats blasted Mamdani's idea, saying she didn't think it was “necessary.” 

“I'm not supportive of a property tax increase,” Hochul said at a press conference in New York City. “I don't know that that's necessary, but let's find out what is really necessary to close that gap.”

New York City Council Speaker Julie Menin also criticized the idea, emphasizing that it should not even be considered. Menin and City Council Member Linda Lee, the council's finance committee chairwoman, released a statement dismissing the idea, Politico reported.

“At a time when New Yorkers are already grappling with an affordability crisis, dipping into rainy day reserves and proposing significant property tax increases should not be on the table whatsoever,” read the joint statement.

Mamdani would need City Council approval to make his proposed property tax increase a reality, should it come to that point.

Mamdani administration officials said that the proposed tax hike would generate an additional $3.7 billion in revenue, the New York Daily News reported. However, it is also believed that such an increase would disproportionately affect black neighborhoods in New York City.

Citizens Budget Commission, a self-described “nonpartisan, nonprofit civic organization whose mission is to achieve constructive change in the finances and services of New York City and New York State government,” dismissed Mamdani's proposal and criticized the rationale behind it.

“Mayor Mamdani's preliminary budget proposes a false choice: either the state raises personal income and business taxes, or the city raises property taxes and saps money from reserves, including those to protect New Yorkers from a recession,” said Andrew Rein, president of the CBC. “The best choice is to eliminate spending that does not improve New Yorkers' lives and make government more efficient and effective.”

            Witkoff and Kushner.
    


            It sounds like an elite law firm, a 1970s cop show or even a duo of visionary architects, since they hope to turn battlefields into futuristic cityscapes.
    


But Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are running President Donald Trump's freelance peacekeeping franchise, on which global stability, countless lives and their boss's best hope of that elusive Nobel Peace Prize depend.
    


            The pair were in the thick of it Tuesday, on an extraordinary double-barreled day of diplomacy in Geneva, huddling with Russian, Ukrainian and Iranian officials. They're expected back in Washington this week for a meeting of the Board of Peace — Trump's personal big-dollar private global diplomacy network.
    


            The two super-rich, well-connected American dealmakers are charged with ending one vicious war and preventing one that might be about to erupt. Success in either case would be a huge achievement, but both goals seem intractable.
    


            Trump's hopes for a deal with Iran, as he masses a vast armada within shooting distance, only crawled forward Tuesday. The Iranians touted an understanding on “guiding principles.” But Vice President JD Vance told Fox News that while things “went well” in some ways, Tehran won't acknowledge some of Trump's red lines.
    


            The first of two days of talks between Ukraine and Russia also highlighted a big potential roadblock: the question of whether Moscow really wants to end the fighting or is only playing at diplomacy to buy time for battlefield wins.
    


            Still, talks are taking place. Given global skepticism about the prospects for agreements and of the Witkoff and Kushner double act, this is an achievement in itself and a mark of Trump's desire to work for peace.
    


            Witkoff and Kushner's latest efforts come at a perilous moment for the world and a politically tenuous one for Trump's presidency.
    


            ► Their biggest win so far — the ceasefire in Gaza — is fragile amid renewed fighting. The transition to the disarmament of Hamas still seems like a pipe dream. A possible renewal of full-scale war would worsen the misery of Palestinian civilians and again threaten Israeli security.
    


            ► At the same time, the Ukraine war is grinding through another winter, amid battlefield carnage and Russian attacks on defenseless civilians. The longer the war goes on, the greater the risk that it spills over into a NATO-Russia conflict. Maybe no one can end the war. But Trump probably has a better chance than anyone.
    


            ► The president, meanwhile, is getting inexorably dragged closer to a war with Iran that he may have to fight to save face and protect his own credibility. But polls show Americans don't want it.
    


            Each separate negotiation risks running into the same brick wall — the parties' refusal to compromise on issues they see as existential to national survival or honor. For President Vladimir Putin, this means fighting on at least until he seizes the reminder of the eastern Ukrainian Donbas region on which he's already spent tens of thousands of Russian lives. The government in Kyiv cannot cede the region — as the Trump administration apparently wants — because of its own massive casualties and because it forms fortifications vital to the defense of the capital.
    


            Iran has its own potential deal-breakers. While it's ready to discuss concessions on a nuclear program already shattered by US attacks last year, Tehran is refusing to bargain away its ballistic missile program and regional proxy networks, which it views as crucial to the survival of the Islamic revolutionary regime.
    


            Trump sometimes appears willing to take any deal to celebrate clinching it. But he'd lose face if he inks an agreement that offers Tehran sanctions relief and looks like the Obama-era nuclear pact he destroyed. He said on Friday that regime change “would be the best thing that could happen.” But if he tries to force it, he may unleash regional, political and economic consequences he can neither predict nor control.
    


            “If the parties want a limited and achievable agreement, they're going to have a deal,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, told CNN's Becky Anderson on Monday. “If they want to go for overreach, they're going to have a war.”
    


            Witkoff and Kushner might be unorthodox. But they have the indispensable credential every successful peace negotiator needs — empowerment by the president. Special envoy Witkoff, a wealthy real estate developer, has been a Trump friend for decades. Kushner has no official government role. But he's the husband of Trump's daughter Ivanka, and therefore family. Neither appears to have any political ambition outside polishing Trump's legacy.
    


            Each man personifies Trump's unique brand of foreign policy. They're business tycoons who disdain formal diplomatic and governmental structures and seem to see every global conflict as a potential real estate deal. Each also has huge commercial interests in the Middle East and elsewhere, a concern for critics who believe Trump makes no distinction between his own interests and the nation's.
    


            “We can't spend our time focused on perception as much as we have to focus on the facts,” Kushner told CBS' “60 Minutes” in a joint interview with his partner in October. “We're here to do good. These are impossible tasks.”
    


            But their double act also stirs concern among US allies and former US officials. Part of it is down to inexperience. Witkoff, for example, seems to emerge from meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin singing the Kremlin strongman's tune. “I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,” he said last year, of a man who launched an illegal, unprovoked invasion and has massacred thousands of Ukrainians.
    


            Concern grew over a transcript of a phone call reviewed and transcribed by Bloomberg last year that showed Witkoff coaching a top Russian official on how to talk to Trump. And a 28-point peace plan he drew up last year could have been written by Moscow. It took weeks of diplomatic sanding down, including by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, before it could serve as the basis for talks.
    


            Still, despite huge skepticism that their quasi-official partnership could master the diplomatic game while bypassing traditional US foreign policy norms, Witkoff and Kushner are responsible for one of the most significant foreign policy successes of Trump's second term: the Gaza ceasefire deal.
    


            Their quiet diplomacy and networks in the region — both in Israel and the Gulf states that will be asked to finance rebuilding — secured an official end to the fighting based on 20-point peace plan. This included the return of living and deceased Israeli hostages from Gaza in return for significant releases of Palestinian prisoners and large quantities of humanitarian aid entering the devastated strip.
    


            But the first stage of the deal — as difficult as it was — is the easy part. The second stage involves the disarming of Hamas, the entry of an international stabilization force to bolster a transitional technocratic government and the initiation of a reconstruction plan to be monitored by the Board of Peace. Trump said Sunday that members had pledged $5 billion toward rebuilding and thousands of troops to the stabilization force. “The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History,” he said on social media.
    


            But Phase 2 of the plan seems, for now, like a nonstarter. There's little chance nations will put their troops into a war zone, and at least 11 people died in Israeli airstrikes over the weekend, Reuters reported. And both Israel and Hamas regularly accuse the other of sabotaging the ceasefire agreement.
    


            “Boards of Peace don't mediate conflicts. Mediators mediate conflicts. The president knows this,” former US Middle East peace negotiator Aaron David Miller told CNN's Richard Quest last week. “He mediated, unlike all of his predecessors (and) brought (an) extraordinarily a degree of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to do phase one, and he has got his son-in-law and one of his best friends, Steven Witkoff, mediating or trying to mediate deconfliction with Iran and Russia-Ukraine.”
    


            But Miller argued that arms decommissioning was still a long shot. “The notion that Hamas is going to give up its guns before the Israelis withdraw, or frankly, before Hamas gets an opportunity to take over the Palestinian National Movement, which is what they want, is slim to none. And I am sorry to say, for the sake of the 2 million Palestinians in Gaza and Israeli civilians, slim already left town.”
    


            This reality points to a major liability of the Witkoff-Kushner approach. Conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine can superficially seem like land disputes, but they are far more complex than a knotty business problem. For those involved, the land is more than a future construction site. It's alive with symbolism and encapsulates history, identity and survival.
    


            Trump's impatience also means Witkoff and Kushner are under the kind of pressure that can lead to superficiality. Successful US peace efforts usually followed painstaking and intricate diplomacy. The Camp David Accords in the Carter presidency were the culmination of an entire term of preparatory work. The Dayton Accords that ended the war in the former Yugoslavia followed months of daring wartime diplomacy and relentless US duress on the parties led by Richard Holbrooke, the most talented American diplomat of his generation.
    


            The US also played a key role in the British government's Northern Ireland efforts — which took years to deliver the decommissioning of the IRA's weapons and eventual peace.
    


            Still, history also shows that using unofficial envoys outside the government's official structures can work.
    


            President Franklin Roosevelt maintained layers of personal emissaries in World War II to outwit other power centers in the government and to ensure he was the sole American with a full overview of the conflict. President Richard Nixon and his national security adviser Henry Kissinger set up a parallel foreign policy operation to cut out the State Department — much as Trump has done — and they opened a historic channel to communist China.
    


            But Trump's evisceration of the department has deprived his administration of institutional memory and expertise that might have built on any breakthroughs by Kushner and Witkoff.
    


            Ultimately, breakthroughs may require more than drive-by summits in Geneva. And America's amateur peacemakers may have Trump's ear, but they have yet to prove they belong in the geopolitical big leagues alongside a Machiavellian Putin, a manipulative political survivor like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the theocratic fascism of Hamas.

A shooting at a Rhode Island ice rink where a youth hockey game was scheduled Monday left three dead, including the suspect, and three injured, according to police.

PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) — The person who opened fire Monday during a youth hockey game at a Rhode Island ice rink was specifically targeting family members, killing an ex-wife and son as many fans dived for cover while a handful rushed the shooter to stop the attack, authorities said.

Pawtucket Chief of Police Tina Goncalves said the shooter's ex-wife Rhonda Dorgan and adult son Aidan Dorgan were killed and three others were injured: Rhonda Dorgan's parents, Linda and Gerald Dorgan, and a family friend Thomas Geruso, all of whom remained in critical condition Tuesday afternoon, Goncalves said

Police identified the shooter as 56-year-old Robert Dorgan, who died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Dorgan also went by the names Roberta Esposito and Roberta Dorgano, authorities said.

Goncalves said there was “no indication” there would be violence at the ice rink in Pawtucket on Monday afternoon, adding that Dorgan had been to many hockey games to watch family members play before without incident. 

Gender identity apparently was a contributing factor to Dorgan's wife filing for divorce in 2020 after nearly 30 years of marriage.

Court filings show Rhonda Dorgan initially wrote “gender reassignment surgery, narcissistic + personality disorder traits” as reasons for filing but crossed that out and wrote “irreconcilable differences which have caused the irremediable breakdown of the marriage.”




Court documents show that two shared the same last name even prior to getting married. Authorities have not provided additional details about the same name.

Under the name Roberta Dorgano, Dorgan posted on X that Rhonda Dorgan “hates the person who stole her husband” while posting about the couple's marital troubles in 2018. A year later Dorgan wrote on social media: “Transwoman, 6 kids : wife – not thrilled,” and encouraged people to not let being transgender stop them from creating a family.

A day before the shooting, Dorgan responded on X to anti-transgender posts by actor Kevin Sorbo and Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones by saying that constant criticism of transgender people is “why we Go BERSERK.”

Goncalves on Tuesday credited several “good Samaritans” who intervened and quickly stopped the attack 

At least three bystanders were able to contain Dorgan in the middle of the stands as the crowd fled and ran around them, but said Dorgan was still able to reach for a second firearm and died of a self-inflicted gunshot, Goncalves said.

The hockey game was livestreamed by LiveBarn, a streaming platform for youth sporting events, whose videos have been shared on social media showing players on the ice as popping sounds are heard. Chaos quickly unfolds as players on benches dive for cover, those on the ice frantically skate toward exits and fans flee their seats.

LiveBarn's social media account has been issuing warnings to those who shared the video that they do not have permission to do so. 

Michael Steven, who recorded video after the shooting, recalled crying parents trying to locate their children outside the arena and young people being taken out on stretchers.

“It happens far too often in our nation,” Steven told reporters.

Members of the community held a vigil at Slatersville Congregational Church in North Smithfield in the evening Tuesday.

“It's absolutely mind-boggling that this could happen to people we know and love and support through everything,” said Amy Goulet, whose son is a hockey player in the community.

Dorgan was an employee of General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, a ship building facility in Bath, Maine, that contracts with the U.S. Navy, David Hench, a spokesperson for the shipyard, said Tuesday. Co-workers said Dorgan often used the first name Roberta at work.

A colleague, Destiny Mackenzie, recalled that she and Dorgan would often talk about family. Mackenzie said Dorgan's ex-wife never came up in conversation but a hockey-playing son was a frequent topic. 

“What was supposed to be some seniors' only chance at playoff games is now ruined,” she wrote in a message to The Associated Press. “Images that these kids and family's now have to live with. That's who I send my condolences to is those families.”

Mackenzie also said Dorgan had a bad temper that sometimes led to screaming matches with colleagues.

Another co-worker said Dorgan appeared to be split on the issue of transgender acceptance, one second being proud of transitioning and the next, embarrassed. That co-worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of workplace reprisals, said they knew Dorgan owned guns but was unsure how many. 

Dorgan briefly served in the Marine Corps, enlisting on April 26, 1988, according to military records provided by the service. Less than three months later, on July 13, Dorgan was separated from the service with the lowest military rank.

Maj. Jacoby Getty, a Marine Corps spokesman, told The Associated Press that the rapid discharge indicated Dorgan's character “was incongruent with Marine Corps' expectations and standards.”

Getty declined to provide more detail.

Monday's shooting came nearly two months after the state was rocked by a shooting at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, as well as left a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor dead. Authorities later found Claudio Neves Valente, 48, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a New Hampshire storage facility.

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) offered Republicans a suggestion on Tuesday on how to ensure a competitive Senate seat remains in GOP hands. 

Fetterman contended that President Donald Trump and Republicans have the opportunity to “lock down” Sen. John Cornyn's (R-TX) hotly contested seat by coming together to endorse the incumbent over two other leading GOP candidates looking to beat Cornyn in a three-way primary. Fetterman's comments echo the viewpoint that, among the GOP field, Cornyn holds the most viable chance of beating a field of Democratic contenders eying a chance to flip the seat blue. 

“For me, like for Texas, for example, Cornyn is a reasonable Republican, and now that would be money in the bank. But now I don't know why politically — I'm not sure why the Republicans and the president wouldn't sit on that and just lock down Texas,” Fetterman said during an interview on Fox Business Network's Mornings with Maria.

Fetterman's comments came hours after Trump told reporters he couldn't endorse a GOP candidate in the race, saying it was too difficult to pick between Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX). Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) has also stayed neutral as the March primary inches closer, even as recent polling has not appeared favorable to Cornyn's hopes of winning the March 3 primary outright, instead handing Paxton and Hunt an edge, according to surveys aggregated by the New York Times.  

“They've all supported me. They're all good, and you're supposed to pick one. So, we'll see what happens, but I support all three,” Trump said Monday evening. “I just haven't made a decision on that race yet. It's got a ways to go.”

The three Republicans have angled to portray themselves as the most pro-Trump candidates as they vie for Trump's endorsement. The divisive three-way race could likely head to a May 27 runoff, which would only be averted if one of the contenders tops 50% of the vote in the primary next month. 

In 2020, Cornyn won a fourth term in office by under 10 percentage points, marking the closest reelection battle of his career. 

COLBERT POSTS JAMES TALARICO INTERVIEW ON YOUTUBE AFTER CBS PULLS IT OFF AIR OVER FCC EQUAL TIME RULE

His latest bid has attracted millions in funding, with former Republican Gov. Rick Perry's Lone Star Freedom Project promising Tuesday the group would spend “whatever we need” to keep Cornyn in office. Perry's group has already spent nearly $18 million on the race, according to the Texas Tribune. 

Whoever wins the March contest will likely face either Reps. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) or Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, whose recent interviews with The View and Stephen Colbert have drawn scrutiny due to the Federal Communications Commission's equal-time rule, in the general election. The pair are the Democratic front-runners in the Senate race and have engaged in an intense rivalry ahead of the party's primary.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Late-night host Stephen Colbert said his interview with Democratic Texas Senate candidate James Talarico was pulled from Monday night's broadcast over network fears it would violate regulatory guidance from the Trump administration on giving equal time to political candidates.

Colbert's statements overshadowed Tuesday's start of early voting for Texas primaries that feature a heated Democratic race between Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett. Four-term Republican Sen. John Cornyn also faces the fight of his long career against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt.

Colbert said CBS lawyers said in “no uncertain terms” that Talarico could not appear on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” broadcast because the network feared violating guidance from the Trump administration. Colbert nevertheless interviewed Talarico for nearly 15 minutes and posted the video on YouTube, because online material does not fall under the equal-time rule. 

“Then I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on. I could not mention me not having him on,” Colbert said. “And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.”

CBS disputed Colbert's account, saying its attorneys only “provided legal guidance” that broadcasting an interview with Talarico could trigger the Federal Communications Commission's equal-time rule. 

Crockett expressed skepticism about the “mania” playing out on the first day of early voting, “which feels kind of convenient.”




Both Talarico and Crockett have built national profiles through viral social media clips as media organizations have navigated around changing broadcast guidance issued under President Donald Trump governing how they interview political candidates. 

Talarico posted a nearly minute-long clip of his interview with Colbert on X, calling it “the interview Donald Trump didn't want you to see.” During the interview, Talarico said he thinks Trump is worried that Democrats can win the Texas seat. 

“The administration was playing politics and was trying to control what a late-night show puts on air, something that's never been done before,” Talarico told reporters during a news conference Tuesday in Austin after he voted early. “The executives at CBS were willing to go along with it.”

Crockett suggested that Colbert could have avoided an issue with the FCC by having her on the show, as he has in the past. Both she and Talarico also have appeared on ABC's daytime show “The View.” 

She told reporters after voting early in Dallas that she still was looking into the situation but added: “I've done Colbert a number of times. I've done ‘The View' a number of times. I've done (Jimmy) Kimmel a number (of times). I've done all of these shows a number of times.”

On the Republican side, Paxton stepped up what had been a low-key campaign with a rally Monday evening in Tyler in eastern Texas, while Cornyn had his own rally Tuesday in Austin. Hunt released a new television ad on Tuesday.

Broadcast networks have been required to give equal time to political candidates, but that rule hasn't traditionally been applied to talk shows. 

In January, the Federal Communications Commission issued new guidance warning late-night and daytime hosts that they need to give political candidates equal time. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, questioned the talk show exemption and posited that hosts were “motivated by partisan purposes.” 

The public notice said the FCC had not seen evidence that talk shows would qualify for an exemption from the rule for “bona fide news.” Carr has often criticized network talk shows, suggesting last year that probing “The View” — whose hosts have frequently been critical of Trump — over the exemption might be “worthwhile.”

The FCC did not immediately respond Tuesday to a message seeking comment.

Colbert's days as host are limited, following CBS' announcement last year that it was canceling his show this May for financial reasons, shuttering a decades-old TV institution in a changing media landscape.

But the timing of that announcement — three days after Colbert criticized the settlement between Trump and Paramount Global, parent company of CBS, over a “60 Minutes” story — led two U.S. senators to publicly question the motives behind the move, which served to remove from air one of Trump's most prominent and persistent late-night critics.

Meanwhile, Talarico and Crockett are hoping to avoid a May 26 runoff by capturing at least 50% of the Democratic vote in the March 3 primary. While Paxton also is, until Friday, the only ad his campaign ran had attacked Hunt.

Hunt is trying to appeal to voters seeking an alternative to Cornyn but uneasy about Paxton. The Texas attorney general beat a 2023 impeachment trial on corruption charges and reached a deal to end a long-running securities fraud case but now faces a contentious divorce over allegations of adultery.

Hunt's new ad shows photos of him with Trump, hitting Cornyn over his long political career and declaring, “This is our moment to end the status quo.” 

But Paxton's campaign has been airing its own ad featuring video clips of him with Trump since Friday. The president had not endorsed any candidate as of Monday. 

Paxton on Monday night portrayed Cornyn as a creature of the Washington establishment, adding, “Well, I'm not their person and I'm never going to be their person.” 

Paxton looks like the GOP's front-runner, even though Cornyn's campaign and allied super PACs had spent more than $54 million on television advertising since last year, according to the ad-tracing service AdImpact. 

Republican Senate leaders in Washington say Paxton would require hundreds of millions of dollars more to defend in a general election than Cornyn would — and that the party shouldn't have to spend in a state Trump carried by over 13 percentage points. 

Cornyn hit on those concerns during his Austin rally, saying nominating Paxton would “take a toll on everybody on the ballot” for the GOP.

“We'll pay the price of having an albatross like our corrupt attorney general around their neck,” he said.

Dr. Colleen Fitzpatrick, president and founder of Identifinders Forensic Genealogy, analyzes the results of the DNA test of a glove recovered in the Nancy Guthrie search on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

TUCSON, Ariz. — Investigators looking to track down Nancy Guthrie's suspected kidnappers are turning to a relatively new technology that has been attributed to solving some of the most prolific criminal and cold cases in American history. 

Investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) is defined as "the science of using genetic and genealogical methods to generate leads for law enforcement entities investigating crimes and identifying human remains," according to the International Society of Genetic Genealogy. 

Investigators use a DNA sample to search for genetic familial matches, ultimately looking to narrow down potential identities by zeroing in on close relatives of the individual. 

On Tuesday, the FBI confirmed to Fox News Digital that IGG was being used to test DNA found on a glove discovered two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home and other DNA samples found inside her house.

The move comes after both samples did not find a match in the nationwide law enforcement database, CODIS – which only includes individuals previously known to authorities.  

The technology has been used to solve several high-profile cases in recent years, with the FBI now turning to IGG in hopes of identifying the DNA found on the glove discovered two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home and other samples located inside the house. 

Here is a look at previous cases in which IGG helped authorities locate their suspect.

Immediately following the brutal murders of four University of Idaho college students on Nov. 13, 2022, investigators raced to track down the person responsible for killing Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Kaylee Goncalves.

Using DNA found on a Ka-Bar knife sheath left behind at the crime scene, authorities sent samples to forensics lab Othram after coming back empty-handed when using CODIS.

Othram was then able to create a DNA profile that matched items pulled from Bryan Kohberger's family trash at their Pennsylvania home, leading investigators to "a male as not being excluded as the biological father of Suspect Profile," according to the affidavit. 

Kohberger was subsequently taken into custody on Dec. 30, 2022 and pleaded guilty to the quadruple murders last summer as part of a plea deal to escape the potential death penalty. 

He is serving four consecutive life sentences, plus another 10 years.

NANCY GUTHRIE CASE INVESTIGATORS FIND SET OF BLACK GLOVES NEAR ROADSIDE

More than three decades after 13 people were murdered and dozens more raped, IGG led investigators to finally track down one of the most prolific killers in California's history. 

Using DNA collected from the crime scene, authorities were able to match a profile created for the Golden State Killer to online genetic profiles. The results pointed investigators toward a relative of former police officer Joseph James DeAngelo, who was arrested in 2018 and later charged with dozens of crimes.

Joseph James DeAngelo, right, and public defender Joseph Cress speak together during the first day of victim impact statements at the Gordon D. Schaber Sacramento County Courthouse on Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2020, in Sacramento, Calif.  

"We were confident that he was born between 1940 and 1960," Paul Holes, a former investigator with the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office, told Fox News during a 2021 interview for the Fox Nation documentary and Fox News Audio Podcast "Grim Tide: Hunting the Long Island Serial Killer."

"The common ancestors that we used were great, great-grandparents. These were people who were born in the 1840s, and we built a family tree that consisted of thousands," Holes said. "And then ultimately, we landed on a California branch with a small number of… males of the right age. And then, at that point, it's just ‘Investigation 101.' Who are these men and could any of them be somebody that we need to look at closer to being the person that is responsible?"

Prosecutors previously called DeAngelo's decades of crimes "simply staggering," encompassing 87 victims at 53 separate crime scenes spanning 11 California counties.

DeAngelo pleaded guilty to 13 murders and 13 rapes in 2020, and was later handed multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole. 

Nearly 25 years after the body of an unidentified little girl was discovered in a 55-gallon drum barrel near New Hampshire's Bear Brook State Park, investigators used genetic genealogy to crack the final name included in the infamous Allenstown Four.

From 1985 to 2000, authorities located four bodies stuffed in barrels in what was later ruled as homicides, with three of the individuals being identified as Marlyse Elizabeth Honeychurch, 24, and her two daughters, Marie Elizabeth Vaughn, 6, and Sarah Lynn McWaters, 1. 

However, the identity of the final victim remained unknown until 2025, when authorities used genetic genealogy to determine the young girl was Rea Rassmussen, according to the National Center for Missing and Endangered Children.   

All four victims are believed to have been murdered by serial killer Terry Peder Rasmussen, the biological father of Rea, who was suspected of killing at least six women and two children prior to his death in 2010.

The break in the case came in 2024, when the New Hampshire State Police partnered with the DNA Doe Project and learned the unidentified child's mother was a woman named Pepper Reed. 

Reed's family reportedly told investigators she was last seen in Texas during Christmas of 1975, and later moved to California while pregnant. Her family identified Terry Rasmussen as the father of the child, which was later confirmed by a birth record located in Orange County, California.

Using DNA samples from Reed's sole surviving sibling, investigators were able to confirm Rea Rassmussen's identity. She is believed to have been between the ages of 2 and 4 when she was killed. 

However, Reed remains missing and is believed to have been murdered by Terry Rasmussen, who was later convicted of killing girlfriend Eunsoon Jun in 2002.

William Talbott II, center, is escorted to his seat Friday, June 28, 2019, at the Snohomish County Courthouse in Everett, Wash. William Earl Talbott II has been found guilty in the 1987 killings of a young Canadian couple, Tanya Van Cuylenborg and Jay Cook.  

Investigators identified Talbott as a suspect after uploading DNA found at the crime scene to the public genealogy website GEDMatch. The technology pointed to two second cousins of Talbott, which allowed investigators to construct a family tree and ultimately identify him as their primary suspect. 

Detectives used a discarded coffee cup to obtain Talbott's DNA, which matched the evidence found at the crime scene.

The case was the first time genetic genealogy had been used to put a suspect on trial, with prosecutors reportedly using Talbott as an example showcasing the power of genetic genealogy testing. 

"Folks aren't going to get away with murder anymore when we have this information," prosecutor Adam Cornell said, according to FOX 13. "If you're a killer and you're out there, then this office and other law enforcement around the country may be coming for you."

American tech companies should "worry a little bit" about the subsidies their Chinese competitors receive from their government in the AI race, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC.

As competition between U.S. and Chinese companies intensifies to develop the most advanced models, Smith said that the U.S. has "an advantage in terms of access to the most powerful chips in the world" and "other technology innovation."

But, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India, he also said: "I do think we always have to think about, maybe even worry a little bit about Chinese subsidies."

Chinese AI companies have been supported by their government with measures such as a multi-billion-dollar national investment fund and vouchers for cheaper energy for their computing needs. Smith's warning comes after Chinese firms released a slew of models over the past two weeks, and their lower-cost AI models could be attractive in developing nations.

Smith said subsidies from Beijing to Chinese companies were "the fundamental approach that China successfully took to disrupt the telecommunications market," when state money and support helped companies like Huawei and ZTE expand.

"Some American companies disappeared. European companies like Ericsson and Nokia were thrown on the defensive," Smith added. 

Smith said data centers from Chinese firms Huawei and Alibaba exist around the world and "it will not be difficult for China to subsidize those."

"I think for the rest of us, we have to compete with that, and we have to be good at competing with that, with the support of our governments," Smith said.

CNBC approached Alibaba and Huawei for comment about whether they have accepted Chinese state subsidies but had not received a response as this article went live.

Alibaba's cloud computing division, through which it sells its AI services, operates globally. But outside China, it doesn't always build data centers, instead partnering with other infrastructure players. 

Beijing launched a 60.06 billion yuan ($8.42 billion) national AI fund last year to invest in early-stage projects.

Cities across the country, from Shanghai to the tech hub of Shenzhen, have offered "vouchers" to reduce the cost for companies looking to rent computing power.

Cheap energy has been another advantage for Chinese companies that are trying to build out the power-hungry infrastructure needed to train and run AI models.

Microsoft on Wednesday said it was on pace to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring AI to developing countries in the "Global South," which includes investments in infrastructure and reskilling.

Rory Green, TS Lombard's chief China economist, told CNBC this week that a "China tech sphere" could easily form in developing countries.

"For these economies, I think the choice is fairly simple, and you could see easily a world where maybe most of the world's population is running on a Chinese tech stack in five to 10 years' time," Green said.

Moderna said on Wednesday the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to review its experimental mRNA flu shot, reversing the agency's earlier decision to refuse to accept the application in a move that stunned Wall Street and the medical community. 

The announcement clears a path forward for the vaccine, which is key to Moderna's experimental combination Covid-flu jab and the company's goal of breaking even by 2028. The FDA is slated to make a decision on the flu shot on Aug. 5, which will allow Moderna to make the vaccine available for the upcoming influenza season. 

"Pending FDA approval, we look forward to making our flu vaccine available later this year so that America's seniors have access to a new option to protect themselves against flu," said Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel in a release. 

Shares of the biotech company rose more than 6% on Wednesday. 

Moderna said it had a "constructive" meeting with the FDA and proposed a revised regulatory approach that addresses criticisms the agency made when refusing to accept the application last week, tailoring its new proposal to an older population.

Under the new approach, Moderna is seeking full approval for the shot in adults ages 50 to 64 and an accelerated approval of the shot for people 65 and up. The latter means that upon approval, Moderna will have to conduct an additional post-marketing study in older adults to confirm its benefits. 

In a statement, Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon confirmed that the FDA has accepted the modified application. 

The agency specifically took issue with Moderna's decision to compare its product to a standard, approved flu shot in a phase three trial, arguing that it "does not reflect the best-available standard of care" in the U.S. The FDA's previous feedback expressed a preference for Moderna to use a higher-dose vaccine for older adults as a comparator in the trial. 

In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday before the announcement, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary did not indicate that the agency would reverse course. But he emphasized that the FDA reviewed the application and the initial late-stage trial on the shot when it came in, so "it's a little bit of a misnomer to say that it was not looked at." 

Makary said the agency's guidance to Moderna on its mRNA-based flu shot "was pretty clear." He said the FDA recommended that the group of participants ages 65 and up in the study who didn't take Moderna's shot receive the "standard of care, not the substandard of care" as a comparison product. 

Moderna has disputed that reasoning, noting that FDA rules and guidance do not actually require trials to use the most advanced or highest-dose vaccine as a comparator in clinical studies. The company also said it was inconsistent with the FDA's prior written communication about the trial design, even before the study began, where the agency said using the standard flu shot would be "acceptable."

The saga follows sweeping changes to U.S. immunization policy and regulation over the past year under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. 

Moderna last week said the decision specifically stemmed from the FDA's top vaccine regulator, Vinay Prasad, who returned to the agency in August after being ousted. Prasad, who heads the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has been vocal about tightening regulations for vaccines and recently linked child deaths to Covid shots without evidence. 

Last week, Moderna released a so-called Refusal to File letter from the FDA that was signed by Prasad on Feb. 3. HHS does not typically share those letters, and has not provided any details on who drove the decision-making on the company's application. 

When asked about his stance on mRNA technology, which Kennedy and some of his supporters have criticized as unsafe, Makary told CNBC on Wednesday that he's "hopeful and optimistic" about the platform but would also "like to see the data." 

"We're not going to get ahead of the game," he said. "We're going to basically say, we'd like to see the data, how far mRNA technology can be applied is a question where we'd love to see it applied, as far as it can be applied, but it's got to meet our scientific standards, so we'll see what it gets with cancer, with other infectious diseases ..."

White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Wednesday that the authors of a recent New York Federal Reserve paper that found U.S. companies and consumers are shouldering most of the tariff burden should be "disciplined."

In a CNBC interview, the National Economic Council director ripped the report, saying that central bank researchers ignored key aspects of how the duties worked and instead simply focused on prices. Hassett said the research also should have included the upward impact on wages and benefits that U.S. companies see by bringing more production onshore.

"I mean, the paper is an embarrassment," Hassett said during the "Squawk Box" interview. "It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class."

The paper in question was published Feb. 12 on the New York Fed's website.

Essentially, the researchers looked at whether countries that export products to the U.S. were lowering their prices, or in effect eating the tariffs, or raising their prices and passing them onto consumers and companies. The paper found that some 90% of the added costs from tariffs were being passed on, though it noted that the impact waned slightly as the year progressed.

However, Hassett insisted that the tariffs had little impact on prices and were responsible for a better standard of living.

"Prices have gone down. Inflation is down over time. Import prices dropped a lot in the first half of the year, that leveled off, and real wages were up $1,400 on average last year, which means that consumers were made better off by the tariffs," he said. "So consumers couldn't have been made better off by the tariffs, if this New York Fed analysis was correct. It's really just an embarrassment. I can't imagine who signed off on it."

The consumer price index in January rose 2.4% from a year ago and is up nearly 2% from April 2025, when President Donald Trump first announced the tariffs. The sore CPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.5% in January, its lowest annual gain since March 2021. Import prices in December were flat from a year ago while export prices rose 3.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

A New York Fed official declined comment.

Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora addressed the recent downdraft in software stocks, telling analysts in an earnings call that artificial intelligence won't replace cybersecurity "anytime soon."

"I'm still confused why the market is treating AI as a threat to at least cybersecurity," he said Tuesday. "I can't speak for all of software, but one thing we're definitely seeing is that customers have figured out that they need to drive more consistency in their security stack to be able to respond faster using AI."

Shares sank 7% Wednesday following the cybersecurity company's fiscal second-quarter results, which topped Wall Street estimates. However, third-quarter earnings guidance fell short of expectations.

The rise of new AI tools creating enterprise workflows or websites in a matter of seconds has intensified a selloff in software stocks in recent weeks. 

These new tools, from the likes of Anthropic and OpenAI, have left investors fretting over whether AI will permanently disrupt their business models.

So far this year, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has slumped more than 23%. Palo Alto Networks has dropped 11% year to date and 21% over the last year. 

But Arora believes AI is far from displacing the security products. 

"It's not a secret," he said. "Every one of us is working hard. Almost every AI, every security product has some version of a copilot that now runs in tandem with the product."

Palo Alto has been betting big on AI in recent months and launched a suite of new agentic tools in the fourth quarter. 

The company has also invested heavily in new acquisitions to scale cybersecurity capabilities for customers in the age of sophisticated AI. 

Earlier this month, the company closed its massive $25 billion acquisition of identity security company CyberArk and completed its purchase of AI observability platform Chronosphere in January. Palo Alto announced on Tuesday that it's buying Israeli cybersecurity startup Koi.

"These investments are a direct response to the inflections we see taking shape in the market," Arora told analysts. "While it's still early, the initial feedback from our customers has been very encouraging. We believe we're now entering the next phase of AI adoption."

Tech's elite are taking their talents to South Beach — again.

In January, David Sacks, the venture capitalist and crypto and AI czar, proclaimed that Miami will soon replace New York City as America's financial capital. Stripe's Patrick Collison has been marveling at the city's "boomtown" vibes. With California flirting with a one-time tax on billionaires, said billionaires like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg are buying oceanfront mansions. And on Tuesday, Palantir announced that it's moving its headquarters from Denver to Miami.

Is Miami the next Silicon Valley? We've been here before.

The pandemic sent waves of coastal workers to the city, turning it into a Zoomtown full of online venture capitalists like Keith Rabois and Delian Asparouhov, bitcoin bull runners, and purveyors of the finest NFTs. Billboards went up in San Francisco featuring a mock tweet from then-Miami mayor Francis Suarez: "Thinking about moving to Miami? DM me."

Here's the thing: It's easy to fall for Miami when a big chunk of the workforce is stuck at home and online. Five years later, it's a lot harder to build companies there.

"Miami is great three months out of the year," says one prominent venture capitalist who moved to the city during the pandemic but is now returning to an established hub.

While the Floridian tax benefits are real, the investor has found that the social scene hollows out in the summer as residents leave, making it "hard to build roots or have reliable friends." More critically for the startup ecosystem, the scene lacked the "hustle" of San Francisco or New York.

Silicon Valley practically runs on a conveyor belt from Stanford and Caltech to Y Combinator's Dogpatch offices. The machine turns students into founders, builders into companies, and companies into the next wave of founders. Miami, meanwhile, lacks a major university to pipe in tech talent. Instead, the investor says, the city tends to attract people who have already "made it."

The Miami market, while busy, significantly lags behind the major hubs. Startups in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metro raised about $3 billion in 2025, per PitchBook, down from $8.6 billion in 2022, when money and crypto sloshed about. The Bay Area, by contrast, still grabs 52% of the nation's venture funding, with $177 billion in capital pouring in last year.

Alligators may be all around in Miami, but unicorns are hard to find. In January, Cast AI, a startup that helps companies cut cloud costs, crossed the $1 billion valuation mark, becoming the region's first homegrown unicorn in years. Before that, Adam Neumann, the ousted WeWork cofounder, debuted his Miami residential real-estate venture, Flow, at a $1 billion valuation in 2022.

Even Garry Tan, the Y Combinator president and gadfly who's usually first in line to dunk on San Francisco's politics, has been blunt about where the breeding grounds are best. Tan recently said on X that the accelerator still hasn't opened offices outside the Bay Area because founders are simply more likely to build unicorns there. According to a Business Insider analysis of Crunchbase data, of the at least 97 new unicorns that investors minted in 2025, 43 of them were based in the Bay Area.

But those who dismiss the city entirely miss the point. Miami isn't the next San Francisco. It's establishing itself as something else.

Patrick Murphy, a former Florida congressman and entrepreneur, says that Miami's tech scene is growing, it's just being built in "reverse order." Silicon Valley, he says, emerged from an if you build it, they will come approach: Engineers built great companies first, which eventually created fortunes that cycled back into the community to fund the next generation of companies.

Miami, however, has a more if you come, they will build it tact. It's attracted the "wealth achievers" first — the family offices, private equity names, and already-successful founders who emigrated for lifestyle reasons. Finance heavyweights like Citadel and Thoma Bravo arrived early. Vanguard, one of the world's largest asset managers, is eyeing an expansion in Miami as it targets more Latin American wealth. The city is now importing the machinery that follows them. Legal, accounting, and consulting firms are opening local offices to stay close to clients — and scoop up star talent that no longer needs to live near HQ.

This dynamic has established Miami as a "control center" for decision-makers, Murphy argues, but not yet the "factory floor" where the actual work gets done. Murphy says that despite running a successful construction-tech startup, Togal.AI, his engineering team has been offshore from the beginning because the local talent pool simply "didn't exist" when he started in 2019.

"If you go to Miami, you're not going to see dozens of engineers at a Starbucks cranking away," he says. "That's not here yet."

Still, Miami's flood of wealth is creating demand for startups built on the city's local economy, especially in property tech and fintech, Murphy says. Togal.AI's annual recurring revenue has grown 1,000% over the past two years, Murphy says, and is now raising fresh venture funding in order to hire dozens of new employees this year.

Maya Bakhai, a Fort Lauderdale resident and founder of the early-stage venture firm Spice Capital, tells me that the city will flourish alongside "net new" industries that are still taking shape and where the center of gravity isn't locked in yet. Crypto firms like MoonPay and QuickNode still treat South Florida as a home base, she notes. A new space-tech accelerator backed by the state is trying to persuade founders to stick around by pairing them with funders.

Bakhai's bigger bet is that just as New York became the hub for e-commerce, Miami could become the place where creator businesses get built. Research out of the University of Hong Kong found Miami has more top influencers per capita than New York or Los Angeles.

And then there's Palantir, the strongest signal flare yet that tech is taking America's Playground seriously. It's hard to know what the data giant's HQ move will mean in practice — Palantir hasn't said how many employees it plans to relocate, or whether it will offer moving packages to lure talent south. The company did not respond to an email request for comment. If Palantir does move a meaningful slice of its workforce, it would give Miami something it's been short on: a marquee tech employer that can recruit and keep technical workers on the ground year-round.

On X, Palantir's move immediately became a kind of Rorschach test for Miami's future. "Florida is the future," cheered Andreessen Horowitz investor Katherine Boyle. Others were less convinced. "Florida is the new crypto," one user wrote. "For the next 20 years, nothing will change, but they will always tell you 'big things are happening in Florida.'"

Turning Miami into Silicon Beach is a long game, Bakhai argues. It won't be built by the billionaires buying houses to snowbird in today, she argues, but by the young strivers arriving for their first serious jobs — the entry-level analysts heading to Citadel and the junior lawyers starting at firms like Orrick. For the first time, she says, ambitious graduates can launch careers in Miami instead of treating New York or San Francisco as the default. The payoff, she says, comes years later, when they eventually spin off to start their own companies.

Until then, Miami remains largely a playground for the "made it" crowd, waiting in the sun for the builders to come.

Silicon Valley, he says, emerged from an if you build it, they will come approach: Engineers built great companies first, which eventually created fortunes that cycled back into the community to fund the next generation of companies.

Miami, however, has a more if you come, they will build it tact. It's attracted the "wealth achievers" first — the family offices, private equity names, and already-successful founders who emigrated for lifestyle reasons. Finance heavyweights like Citadel and Thoma Bravo arrived early. Vanguard, one of the world's largest asset managers, is eyeing an expansion in Miami as it targets more Latin American wealth. The city is now importing the machinery that follows them. Legal, accounting, and consulting firms are opening local offices to stay close to clients — and scoop up star talent that no longer needs to live near HQ.

This dynamic has established Miami as a "control center" for decision-makers, Murphy argues, but not yet the "factory floor" where the actual work gets done. Murphy says that despite running a successful construction-tech startup, Togal.AI, his engineering team has been offshore from the beginning because the local talent pool simply "didn't exist" when he started in 2019.

"If you go to Miami, you're not going to see dozens of engineers at a Starbucks cranking away," he says. "That's not here yet."

Still, Miami's flood of wealth is creating demand for startups built on the city's local economy, especially in property tech and fintech, Murphy says. Togal.AI's annual recurring revenue has grown 1,000% over the past two years, Murphy says, and is now raising fresh venture funding in order to hire dozens of new employees this year.

Maya Bakhai, a Fort Lauderdale resident and founder of the early-stage venture firm Spice Capital, tells me that the city will flourish alongside "net new" industries that are still taking shape and where the center of gravity isn't locked in yet. Crypto firms like MoonPay and QuickNode still treat South Florida as a home base, she notes. A new space-tech accelerator backed by the state is trying to persuade founders to stick around by pairing them with funders.

Bakhai's bigger bet is that just as New York became the hub for e-commerce, Miami could become the place where creator businesses get built. Research out of the University of Hong Kong found Miami has more top influencers per capita than New York or Los Angeles.

And then there's Palantir, the strongest signal flare yet that tech is taking America's Playground seriously. It's hard to know what the data giant's HQ move will mean in practice — Palantir hasn't said how many employees it plans to relocate, or whether it will offer moving packages to lure talent south. The company did not respond to an email request for comment. If Palantir does move a meaningful slice of its workforce, it would give Miami something it's been short on: a marquee tech employer that can recruit and keep technical workers on the ground year-round.

On X, Palantir's move immediately became a kind of Rorschach test for Miami's future. "Florida is the future," cheered Andreessen Horowitz investor Katherine Boyle. Others were less convinced. "Florida is the new crypto," one user wrote. "For the next 20 years, nothing will change, but they will always tell you 'big things are happening in Florida.'"

Turning Miami into Silicon Beach is a long game, Bakhai argues. It won't be built by the billionaires buying houses to snowbird in today, she argues, but by the young strivers arriving for their first serious jobs — the entry-level analysts heading to Citadel and the junior lawyers starting at firms like Orrick. For the first time, she says, ambitious graduates can launch careers in Miami instead of treating New York or San Francisco as the default. The payoff, she says, comes years later, when they eventually spin off to start their own companies.

Until then, Miami remains largely a playground for the "made it" crowd, waiting in the sun for the builders to come.

A judge on Wednesday threatened to hold anyone using AI smart glasses during Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony in contempt of court. 

"If you have done that, you must delete that, or you will be held in contempt of the court," the judge said. "This is very serious."

Members of the team escorting Zuckerberg into the building were pictured wearing the Meta Ray-Ban artificial intelligence glasses.

Recording is not allowed in the courtroom.

The tech CEO said during his testimony that some users lie about their age when signing up for Instagram.

Zuckerberg was responding to questions about documents from previous testimony before Congress, which stated that 4 million kids under 13 used the platform in the U.S. 

The Facebook founder said that the company removes all underage users identified and includes terms about age usage during the sign-up process. 

"You expect a 9-year-old to read all of the fine print," a lawyer for the plaintiff questioned. "That's your basis for swearing under oath that children under 13 are not allowed?"

The comments came during testimony in a landmark trial about social media and safety that's being likened to the industry's "Big Tobacco" moment.

Lawyers also questioned whether Zuckerberg previously lied about the board's inability to fire him in a courtroom on Wednesday. 

If the board wants to fire me, I could elect a new board and reinstate myself," he said, in response to remarks he previously made on Joe Rogan's podcast.

During his interview with the podcaster last year, Zuckerberg had said he wasn't worried about losing his job because he holds voting power.

Zuckerger said he is "very bad" at media.

The CEO walked into Los Angeles Superior Court just before noon ET Wednesday.

The trial, which began in late January, centers on a young woman who alleged that she became addicted to social media and video streaming apps like Instagram and YouTube.

Lawyers representing the plaintiff contend that Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Snap misled the public about the safety of their services and knew that the design of their apps and certain features caused mental health harms to young users. 

Snap and TikTok settled with the plaintiff involved in the case before the trial began.

Meta has denied the allegations and a spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that "The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff's mental health struggles."

Last week, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri testified that while he thinks there can be problematic usage of social media, he doesn't believe that's the same as clinical addiction.

"So it's a personal thing, but yeah, I do think it's possible to use Instagram more than you feel good about," Mosseri said. "Too much is relative, it's personal."

The Los Angeles trial is one of several major court cases taking place this year that experts have described as the social media industry's "Big Tobacco" moment, because of the alleged harm caused by their products and the related company efforts to deceive the public.

Meta is also involved in a major trial in New Mexico, in which the state's attorney general, Raúl Torrez, alleged that the social media giant failed to ensure that children and young users are safe from online predators.

"What we are really alleging is that Meta has created a dangerous product, a product that enables not only the targeting of children, but the exploitation of children in virtual spaces and in the real world," Torrez told CNBC's "Squawk Box" last week when opening arguments for the trial began.

This summer, another social media trial is expected to begin in the Northern District of California. That trial also involves companies like Meta and YouTube and allegations that their respective apps contained flaws that fostered detrimental mental health issues in young users.

Oil prices rose more than 4% on Wednesday, after Vice President JD Vance said Iran did not address U.S. red lines in nuclear talks this week and President Donald Trump reserves the right to use military force.

U.S. crude oil rose $2.86, or 4.59%, to close at $65.19 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent was up $2.93, or 4.35%, to settle at $70.35 per barrel. 

U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held nuclear talks with Iran in Geneva on Tuesday. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, described the discussions as "constructive," according to Iranian media.  Araghchi said the talks yielded a general agreement on guiding principles.

Oil prices closed lower Tuesday as traders interpreted the foreign minister's comments as a sign that the U.S. and Iran could still reach a settlement. 

But Vance said Tehran had failed to address core U.S. demands. 

"In some ways it went well, they agreed to meet afterwards," the vice president told Fox News on Tuesday evening. "But in other ways it is very clear that the president has set some red lines that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through."

Trump reserves the right to use force if diplomacy does not succeed in stopping Iran's nuclear program, Vance said. "We do have a very powerful military — the president has shown a willingness to use it," the vice president told Fox News. 

Sources told Axios, meanwhile, that a U.S. military campaign against Iran would likely be massive, last weeks and look more like a full-fledged war than the raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in January. 

Iran's Revolutionary Guard conducted war games this week in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital trade choke point for global oil flows. About one-third of all waterborne crude exports pass through the narrow waterway, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. 

The market is worried those oil flows would be disrupted if the U.S. and Iran go to war. Iranian state media said traffic in part of the strait was closed Tuesday due to the military exercises. 

Kpler did not observe any halt in traffic in the strait on Tuesday, said Matt Smith, an oil analyst at the firm.

Trump has stationed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Middle East. The USS Gerald Ford is en route to the region.

Trump said Friday he deployed the second aircraft carrier in case negotiations fail. "If we don't have a deal, we'll need it," the president told reporters outside the White House. 

The Iranian government did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Oil prices rose about 4% on Wednesday, after Vice President JD Vance said Iran did not address U.S. red lines in nuclear talks this week and President Donald Trump reserves the right to use military force.

U.S. crude oil rose $2.65, or 4.25%, to $64.98 per barrel by 12:20 p.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent was up $2.65, or 3.93%, to $70.07 per barrel.

Five-time Olympic medalist Eileen Gu just shut down a reporter's question asking if she'd "lost" two gold medals by finishing second in her events.

The 22-year-old Olympic freeskier, who was born in the US and is representing China in the 2026 Winter Olympics, was responding to a reporter who asked whether Gu felt disappointed not to win gold in Milan.

"Do you see these as two silvers gained or two golds lost?" the journalist asked a press conference following her second silver at these games. During her Winter Olympic debut in Beijing in 2022, Gu won two golds.

Gu immediately laughed off his question and, without hesitation, said: "I am the most decorated female freeskier in history. I think that is an answer in and of itself."

"How do I say this? Winning a medal at the Olympics is a life-changing experience for every athlete."

"Doing it five times is exponentially harder, because every medal is equally hard for me, but everybody else's expectations rise, right? And so the two medals lost situation, to be quite frank with you, I think it's kind of a ridiculous perspective to take," she added.

Zing!

The clip quickly garnered significant attention online.

You got to give lots of credit to Eileen Gu for responding brilliantly back to the reporter with great confidence. She looked him in the eye said that was a "ridiculous perspective" without any hesitation or fear. 😁 pic.twitter.com/fPz5uQIosT

Alvin Foo, venture partner at Chain Valley Capital, reposted the clip on his X feed, writing, "You got to give lots of credit to Eileen Gu for responding brilliantly back to the reporter with great confidence."She looked him in the eye said that was a "ridiculous perspective" without any hesitation or fear," he added. Foo's post has received over 700,000 views.

Other posts praising Gu for being confident and poised gained thousands of views.

Gu's messaging and self-advocacy follow the trend of what Business Insider's Amanda Yen recently dubbed "The most Gen Z Olympics yet."

It's been an Olympics full of public statements and oversharing, Yen wrote.

This has included a Norwegian biathlete who confessed to cheating on his ex in a slopeside interview, and American figure skater Amber Glenn addressing discrimination against the queer community under President Donald Trump.

Jay-Z has been name-dropping luxury timepieces in his songs for decades.

References to Rolex, Audemars Piguet, and Hublot are scattered throughout his music catalog.

He doesn't just rap about watches, though. The billionaire mogul has amassed quite a collection of statement timepieces.

The $1,075,652 Patek Philippe Grand Complication 5304-301R he wore at the 2025 Grammys was just one of them.

While that Patek Philippe was expensive, Jay-Z has timepieces that cost twice as much — or more. Here's a look at some of his watch collection.

Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, is a big fan of Patek Philippe watches. He wore one with a rose-gold case and dozens of diamonds for the 2025 Grammys.

Its face includes several functions, such as days of the week and moon phases, that help keep a perpetual calendar for tracking the date. The calendar automatically adjusts for leap years and accurately counts the days until 2100, according to GQ.

The hand-stitched strap is made of alligator leather.

Jay-Z quite literally announced his love of Hublot in the 2011 song "Otis," where he pronounced, "New watch alert: Hublot."

Perhaps it was prophetic. In 2012, his wife and fellow artist Beyoncé gifted Jay-Z a $5 million Hublot Big Bang in 18-karat white-gold for his 43rd birthday, according to jewelry blogs.

The watch was encrusted with 1,282 diamonds, and it took more than 14 months to assemble, the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève, a foundation that highlights contemporary watches with awards and exhibitions, reported. It also took more than a year to source all the diamonds.

Hublot released the Shawn Carter Hublot Classic Fusion in yellow gold and black ceramic in 2013. The former watch was priced at $33,900, and the latter at $17,900.

The collection was limited to just 350 total pieces, according to GQ.

Jay-Z's custom Blueprint Richard Mille 56 watch required more than 3,000 hours to produce, GQ said in 2019. No wonder it cost $2.5 million.

During a 2019 show in his hometown of Brooklyn, the rapper freestyled a tribute to the timepiece: "Blueprint on my wrist cost 2.5/Only thing that flips the script between you and I."

What was the price of that Richard Mille 56 watch? $3 million, according to Complex. Or at least, that was its retail value. Alex Todd, who customized the watch, told the outlet that its monetary value is higher.

It was custom-made for Jay-Z and featured rare green sapphire crystals.

He did so with an RM011 Felipe Massa Chronograph in rose gold. The watch was originally released in 2007 and was designed with its namesake, F1 driver Felipe Massa, the brand said on its website.

The timepiece is meant to invoke a racing aesthetic and the sport's history of tech innovation. Its crown "resembles a smooth tyre encircling a spoked wheel rim," the maker said.

Mille is no longer making this model, but you can get a used one for $215,000.

Jay-Z wore the Richard Mille RM027 Rafael Nadal to watch its namesake take on Novak Djokovic at the 2011 US Open championships.

It was designed to be as lightweight as possible and take on all the wear and tear a tennis superstar like Nadal might put it through, Richard Mille said.

Nadal referred to it as his "second skin" timepiece. There were only 50 of these watches made at the time, according to Mille. You can buy one on the secondary market for $1.95 million.

Nadal collaborated with Richard Mille on several additional versions of this timepiece that the rapper later acquired. Jay-Z has also worn the Richard Mille Rafael Nadal 27-01, which has an anthracite casing.

Jay-Z shouted out Audemars Piguet in his 2011 "Watch the Throne" track "N—s in Paris," saying: "Ball so hard, got a broken clock / rollies that don't tick-tock / Audemars that's losing time / hidden behind all these big rocks."

He's also worn the brand. Included in his collection is the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar Openworked 26585CE. It has an openwork sapphire dial, rose gold dial markers, a black ceramic band and case, and a titanium clasp.

You can buy one from the watchmaker, but it's "price upon request" — or, in other words, wildly expensive. To get it on the secondary market, you'll need to shell out over $375,000.

When describing the Patek Philippe 6002 Sky Moon Tourbillon watch on its website, the brand notes the extensive detail that went into creating the timepiece.

Some of the highlights include handmade engravings, a double-face design, a retrograde perpetual calendar, a sky chart, and more.

It's one of the most technically complicated Patek Philippe watches, and its price is only available "on request." However, used versions of the watch can be found on the secondhand market for prices between $4 million and $6 million.

Jay-Z wore his model to Lebron James' 39th birthday party.

The Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711 in Tiffany Blue initially retailed for $52,635, but since only 170 were made, the price skyrocketed on the secondary market.

Days after the watches sold out, one was auctioned off for $6.5 million, CNBC reported in 2021.

Jay-Z and Beyoncé were named Tiffany ambassadors that year.

The "Yves Klein" version of the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak 25594ST watch is an ode to the French artist. He's widely known for developing his own vibrant shade of blue — international Klein blue 191.

The Royal Oak design features a perpetual calendar, which keeps track of everything from the time and date to the moon's phases.

It's a popular style in its own right, but the Yves Klein version is especially rare. Few are rarely found on the resale market.

Jay-Z sported the Perpetual Calendar Split Seconds Chronograph 5004P watch during a decadent, seafood tower-filled lunch meeting with DJ Khaled in 2023.

The watch is modeled on Patek Philippe's first perpetual calendar watch, released in 1996.

The particular watch that Jay-Z has, the 5004P model with a silver link band, is nearly impossible to find, but it was valued at $600,000 in 2022, according to IFL Watches.

The Grandmaster Chime is considered Patek Philippe's most complicated watch, with more than 1,500 individual components.

The company made the watch in 2014 to commemorate its 175th anniversary, and only seven were produced. Six went to the watchmaker's most dedicated collectors (who apparently had to apply for the privilege of buying one), while the seventh went to the company's museum in Geneva.

Patek Philippe then went on to make the Grandmaster Chime in other fabrications. Jay-Z has the white gold version, which runs around $2.5 million, according to reports.

Patek Philippe produced this watch in limited quantities from 1950 to 1985. Only 349 were made.

Jay-Z's Patek Philippe 2499 was previously owned by Swedish watch collector and dealer Tony Kavak, who had a yellow-gold band specially made for the piece. As Kavak tells it, the watch wasn't initially for sale.

"The watch is so exclusive that I often chose not to wear it in public, and I always wear my watches, that's my philosophy," Kavak told watch site Bezl.

But he knew Jay-Z was the right person to own the watch, he added.

"You should have seen his happiness," Kavak said in an interview with watch blog Hodinkee. "It just reminded me of how happy I get when I find something rare myself."

Neither Kavak nor Jay-Z would reveal the deal's cost, but in 2022, a similar watch sold at auction for $7.68 million.

His first FP Journe Tourbillon Souverain was set with 93 baguette diamonds circling it and even more across its face, according to Celeb Watch Spotter. Jay-Z wore the piece for a meeting with Tom Brady.

His wife Beyoncé later shared photos from Super Bowl weekend on her website. They included a close-up shot of another FP Journe Tourbillon Souverain watch, this one in green, on Jay-Z's wrist.

Welcome to the "boomcession."

The term is a portmanteau of the words "boom" and "recession." It highlights how the average American doesn't feel like they're reaping the benefits of an economy that is — on paper — humming along, according to creator Matt Stoller.

Economic output and the stock market are surging, consumers are spending big and the post-pandemic recession that many expected never materialized. But many feel terrible about their finances, with debt at all-time highs, and the majority of Americans incorrectly believe the country is in an economic slowdown.

"Traditionally, the economy is doing really well," said Stoller, an antimonopoly advocate and research director at the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonpartisan thinktank. "But ordinary people are saying they're not."

It's thematically similar to the "vibecession," a term popularized in 2022 to explain the disconnect between solid economic data and negative consumer sentiment readings exiting the pandemic. It can also draw comparisons to the "K-shaped economy," a phrase illustrating how Americans can feel vastly different depending on their income bracket.

Stoller's "boomcession" framework aims to bring awareness beyond opinion to the material financial hardships faced by those not in America's uppermost echelons, he said. Once that's contextualized, it's easier to understand why many Americans believe the national economic engine they help power isn't propelling them forward, Stoller said.

On its surface, Stoller said the "boomcession" theory can help explain why data in recent years shows that U.S. GDP growth hasn't correlated with better consumer sentiment readings. That marks a significant break from the typical trend seen over the past six decades.

"I've never seen anything like it," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at consulting firm KPMG. "I've been doing this for 40 years. And that's a long time to never see anything like this."

Helping drive that disconnect, Stoller and economists say, is the fact that inflation isn't one size fits all. Consumers face different rates of price growth based on factors like their income class or geographical location, data shows.

Grocery and shelter inflation rose the most of any essential tracked by Morgan Stanley between 2020 and 2025. Those two categories made up a disproportionately high share of lower-income consumers' spending in 2024, the bank found.

Lower earners historically see higher rates of inflation than their better-off counterparts, said Morgan Stanley economist Heather Berger. The inflationary gap widens when overall price growth is above the Federal Reserve's target of 2% — as has been largely the case for the past several years, according to the bank.

This can't be written off as a post-pandemic idiosyncrasy. The Atlanta Fed reported this year that food prices rose around 9% more in poorer areas than richer ones between the second quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2020. More grocers in underserved communities can increase competition and drive down prices, Stoller said, in turn helping lessen the inflation disparity.

"If you look at monopolization as a systemic feature of the American economy and price discrimination as a systemic feature of the American economy, then it's not that hard to jump from there," Stoller said. "The people who are happy are getting different prices than the people who are sad."

President Donald Trump has pushed initiatives aimed at lowering prices for homes and pharmaceuticals this year. Trump claimed last month that there was "virtually no" inflation in the U.S. despite the latest data showing rates higher than the 2% annual level considered healthy by monetary policymakers.

Economists and investors are watching to see how affordability initiatives ramp up ahead of November's midterm elections.

In the meantime, households feel less insulated than they did when pandemic stimulus programs rolled out in the early 2020s, said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at financial education platform NerdWallet. Credit card debt hit a record high of $1.28 trillion in the fourth quarter of last year, according to data from the New York Fed released last week.

While high prices have been a perennial issue since the pandemic's inflationary shock, consumers without financial safety nets have more recently focused their concern on the job market.

Economists have described the current labor backdrop as a "jobless boom" and "hiring recession." Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dubbed it a low hire, low fire environment.

December job openings fell to their lowest level since 2020 despite the stock market rallying further, data shows. Because higher-income cohorts are more likely to own stocks, economists say that continued gains in these holdings can buoy economic confidence and pad consumer spending. Meanwhile, anxiety washes over the rest of the country as the labor market tightens.

"If you have the assets that are enjoying really high values, then you're feeling supported," said Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. "But strong stock markets don't mean a lick to you if you don't own any stocks."

Economic output by worker per hour broke out of its pandemic funk to new all-time highs last year, federal statistics show. But that may be bad news for employees: The boost can be taken as a sign that artificial intelligence is turbocharging productivity, which could encourage companies to whittle down headcounts.

Nike, Amazon and UPS announced large-scale job cuts this year. Layoffs surged more than 200% from December to January, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

So-called labor share, or the percentage of economic output trickling down to workers in the form of compensation, tumbled to new lows last year. What's more, the gap between corporate profits and employee pay as a slice of GDP grew to its widest on record. Michigan's survey of sentiment fell near all-time lows last year.

Strength in consumer spending despite the bad vibes helped the economy expand at a faster-than-expected rate of 4.3% in the third quarter of 2025. However, total spending is more driven than ever by the top 20% of Americans, according to a Moody's analysis. Fourth-quarter GDP data is scheduled for Friday.

Last week's nonfarm payroll report for January came in hotter than economists predicted, offering hope of stabilization in the job market. But those overall gains were mainly driven by the health care sector, which alone accounted for more than half of net growth.

Nearly three-fifths of Americans believe the U.S. economy is currently in a recession, which is widely defined as a period of multiple quarters with negative GDP growth, according to a Guardian-Harris poll conducted in December. That's up 11% from a similar survey taken earlier in 2025.

A new survey from Snap Finance shared exclusively with CNBC shows just how much worse the outlook is for those at the bottom of the financial food chain.

Just around one-fourth of respondents called their current financial situations "unstable" or "very unstable," per data released Wednesday. But that percentage shoots up to 41% for those with credit scores below 670 and 54% for people in households with incomes at or below $50,000.

Snap Finance polled more than 1,400 people in December. 

That can help explain the growing skepticism of economic data from the government. YouGov found fewer Americans trusted federal reports on the economy than didn't in August of last year, a reversal from a few months prior. Trump fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in August, implying that the agency was manipulating labor market data under her leadership.

But NerdWallet's Renter cautioned against concluding that these reports — which are meant to be aggregate readings — aren't necessary if they don't match how an individual feels. These national data sets can help ensure, for example, that economic grants are appropriately allocated, she said.

"Multiple experiences can be true," Renter said. "The economy can be doing quite well, and millions of people are pretty uncomfortable in it at the same time."

Veteran broadcaster Anderson Cooper said Monday that he is leaving his role as a correspondent on CBS News' "60 Minutes" after nearly 20 years.

In a statement, Cooper said he intended to spend more time focusing on his CNN gig, and his family.

His exit comes at an already turbulent time for CBS News under its new editor in chief, Bari Weiss.

Here are what some of the leading voices in media are saying about Cooper's "60 Minutes" departure.

Sports broadcaster Keith Olbermann shared the news about Cooper's departure on his Bluesky account, posting: "Anderson Cooper has left the sinking ship that is Idiot Bari Weiss's New Stormfront CBS."

Olbermann later added, "Now, people will only be able to NOT watch AC on cnn."

Cooper has worked at CNN since 2001, where he is a political commentator and hosts the "Anderson Cooper 360" show.

Brian Lowry, a longtime media columnist and current Hollywood correspondent at Status News, a media newsletter, wrote on X: "Have worked around Hollywood long enough to know nobody ever really leaves a job to spend more time with their family."

Tom Jones, senior media writer at The Poynter Report, wrote in his newsletter that Cooper's departure marked "the end of a journalism era."

Jones said that Cooper's exit "certainly adds more uncertainty in a news division that is very much in flux under relatively new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss."

He added: "It also raises questions about '60 Minutes,' the previous gold standard of TV news shows."

Lydia Polgreen, a New York Times opinion writer and the former editor in chief of HuffPost, posted to X on Tuesday: "I don't watch much TV news, but @andersoncooper is in a league of his own as a television journalist. A huge loss for 60 Minutes."

CNN's chief media analyst, Brian Stelter, wrote in his "Reliable Sources" newsletter Tuesday that there are open questions about which other correspondents might leave, "and on what terms."

"The risk is obvious: Loyal '60 Minutes' viewers will leave along with the correspondents they like to watch," Stelter said.

Trish Regan, the former Fox Business Network anchor, said on her YouTube channel on Tuesday that she "didn't buy" Cooper's statement that he was leaving to spend more time with his family. She added that people usually mention family in their departing statements when their company can't pay them enough or when their bosses want them out the door.

Regan said that Cooper's exit raised the bigger question of what would happen with Weiss, adding that it seemed like she was an unpopular figure at CBS News. 

"The inmates are running the asylum, shall we say, over there at '60 Minutes'," Regan said. "They're just coming apart at the seams."

Regan added that she admires the moves Weiss has made so far at CBS News, including bringing in "more diverse political voices." 

"In other words, you need some more right-leaning ones to go with all the lefties you get over there," she said.

Business Insider Edition 

Nigerian industrialist Abdul Samad Rabiu is taking his place among Africa's elite yacht owners, commissioning a 60-meter superyacht from renowned Italian shipbuilder Baglietto, according to a post on his Facebook page.


        Rabiu wrote simply: “60 metres in the making. Thanks, Fabio and James. #ASR,” signaling the project is underway or in early planning stages.
    


        The yacht, a large-scale luxury build, positions Rabiu within a select group of Nigerian tycoons who regularly commission bespoke assets in Europe. At 60 meters, the vessel falls within Baglietto's upper-tier offerings, typically designed for long-range cruising with charter-level amenities.
    


        Industry insiders note that such projects require custom naval architecture, extensive engineering, and a multi-year construction period, depending on specifications and yard capacity.
    


        Baglietto, headquartered in La Spezia on Italy's northwest coast, has a long-established reputation for crafting yachts between 40 and 60 meters.



        The company has delivered numerous high-end builds across Europe, making it a top choice for wealthy African clients seeking prestige and performance. While Baglietto has not publicly confirmed the contract, Rabiu's post strongly indicates the partnership is confirmed.
    


        Rabiu, founder of the BUA Group, chairs one of Nigeria's largest industrial conglomerates, with interests spanning cement, sugar, flour, and infrastructure. 
    


        BUA Cement, part of his portfolio, is a key player in West Africa's building materials market, while his broader industrial ventures in manufacturing and energy have cemented his status among the continent's wealthiest entrepreneurs.



        Luxury superyachts are increasingly popular among Africa's high-net-worth individuals, often serving as both status symbols and functional assets for family travel, corporate hosting, and leisure. 
    


        Observers say these builds underscore the region's growing engagement with bespoke European and Gulf markets, highlighting the intersection of wealth, industrial influence, and lifestyle aspirations.
    


        If confirmed by the shipyard, the 60-meter Baglietto would place Rabiu in a small circle of Nigerian tycoons with large-scale, top-tier superyachts. The project exemplifies how Africa's industrial magnates continue to translate business success into high-profile personal assets, showcasing both status and international connections.

U.S. President Donald Trump has welcomed Japan's pledge to invest nearly $36 billion in oil, gas and critical mineral projects in Texas, Ohio and Georgia. 

The commitment represents the first tranche of investments by Japan following a landmark trade deal between the two countries, one in which Tokyo pledged to invest $550 billion in American-based projects and Trump cut tariffs on most Japanese imports to 15%.

"Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!" Trump said Tuesday in a social media post.

"The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS," he added. 

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said the projects strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance and were expected to bring increased sales and business expansion for Japanese companies.

"We believe these initiatives truly embody the purpose of this Strategic Investment Initiative, namely the promotion of mutual benefit between Japan and the United States, the enhancement of economic security, and the promotion of economic growth," Takaichi said in a post on X, according to a Google translation.

By far the largest investment is a natural gas facility in Ohio that's expected to generate 9.2 gigawatts of power.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Portsmouth Powered Land Project, valued at $33 billion and operated by SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japan's SoftBank, would be "the largest natural gas generation facility in history." 

The White House said Japan would also finance a $2.1 billion deepwater crude oil export facility off the Texas coast. At full capacity, the Texas GulfLink project is expected to generate up to $30 billion in annual U.S. crude exports. Dallas-based energy infrastructure group Sentinel Midstream is developing the project. 

The Commerce Department said the third major project refers to plans to create a synthetic diamond grit facility in Georgia, with Japan set to invest approximately $600 million.

The project is set to be operated by Element Six, part of De Beers Group, the world's leading diamond company. 

Diamond grit, dust and powder are critical raw materials in U.S. industrial manufacturing due to their exceptional hardness and wear resistance, the Commerce Department said, making the material to U.S. economic and national security.

Geopolitics will be the main theme of the day, with markets watching the high-stakes talks between the U.S. and Iran, as well as Ukraine and Russia, that are being held in Geneva.

The talks between Kyiv and Moscow represent the latest round of the U.S.-brokered negotiations between the countries as Russia's invasion of Ukraine nears its 4-year mark.

The talks kicked off on Tuesday and are expected to enter their second and final day on Wednesday, with no concrete agreements yet reported. Russia reportedly struck Ukraine's power infrastructure on Tuesday, drawing condemnation from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Washington's and Tehran's negotiations appear to be yielding more progress so far.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that the sides reached a general understanding on "guiding principles," Reuters reported, though that does not mean a deal on the countries' longstanding nuclear disputes is imminent.

Still, Araghchi's comments eased fears of an immediate conflict in the region, with oil futures down on Wednesday.

U.S. stock futures were trading slightly up on Wednesday, led by the Nasdaq which gained 0.25%. That was after a tepid session for U.S. equities on Tuesday, which saw major averages post slim gains.

Investors remain jittery about the impact of artificial intelligence. The software sector, which has already been under pressure due to fears of disruption by AI tools, continued to fall on Tuesday, with leaders such as CrowdStrike and ServiceNow losing 3.6% and 1.1%, respectively.

In an interview with CNBC's Arjun Kharpal, the CEO of leading European start-up Mistral AI, predicted that more than 50% of enterprises' current software could be replaced by AI. 

He made the comments on the sidelines of India's AI Impact summit which will continue this week. Major announcements have come from the event so far, such as a pledge from Adani to invest $100 billion into data centers in the country by 2035. 

Also coming Wednesday will be consumer price inflation numbers from the UK, a day after jobs data showed the UK's unemployment rate rose to a 5-year high while wage growth slowed in the last three months of 2025.

Shares of German multinational life sciences company Bayer will be in focus after its Monsanto unit said it had reached an agreement worth as much as $7.25 billion to resolve thousands of current and future lawsuits regarding concerns that its Roundup weedkiller caused cancer.

Anthropic rolled out Claude Sonnet 4.6. The new and improved AI model is the company's second major product launch in less than two weeks.

China exports add to freight trade slump for the biggest U.S. port. New data from the Port of Los Angeles shows that commitments made by China to buy more U.S. agricultural products have yet to materialize. 

Meta expands Nvidia deal to use millions of AI chips. The new sweeping deal will see Meta use the chips, including Nvidia's new standalone CPUs and next-generation Vera Rubin systems, in its AI data centers. 

Nvidia is partnering with Indian VC firms in AI start-up push. The company says it was working with several major venture capital firms, to identify and fund AI start-ups in India's growing AI market. 

Iran partially closed the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz. State media reported the news citing "security precautions" as Tehran's Revolutionary Guard conducts military drills in the waterway.

Japan export growth surges to over 3-year high. Exports climbed 16.8% year on year in January, sharply beating market expectations and growing at their fastest rate since November 2022.

[Pro] Appaloosa Management's David Tepper bullish on Micron, Korean stocks. The billionaire hedge fund manager added to his Micron stake and took a position in Korean stocks, both of which are AI plays. 

Businesses scramble to reach China's growing experiences economy

There's nothing quite like the holiday rush in China for the Lunar New Year.

The Beijing city streets start emptying out several days in advance as the majority of residents return to their hometowns or travel elsewhere. A quiet calm replaces the normally tense atmosphere of people rushing to work or school.

So where are the locals going? Immersive experiences rank high.

"Late Show" host Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night called CBS' denial of his claim that it blocked the broadcast of his interview with Texas state Rep. James Talarico "crap" — and urged the network and its parent, Paramount Skydance, to stand up to the "bullies" in the Trump administration.

Colbert's broadside came hours after CBS issued a statement on the controversy. 

The host, whose show will end in May as it was canceled by CBS, held up a printed copy of the network's statement about Talarico's interview during his show Tuesday night and said, "I don't even know what to do with this crap."

He then pulled a plastic doggy bag from behind his desk, picked up the statement, tied a knot and mimed throwing it away before cutting to commercial.

The controversy is the latest flap to spark speculation that CBS is currying favor with the Trump administration as Paramount makes a hostile tender bid for Warner Bros Discovery. If WBD's shareholders accept Paramount's bid, federal government regulators would need to sign off on the deal.

Colbert had invited Talarico, who is running in the Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas, to appear on Monday night's broadcast of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."

But early in that night's show, Colbert said to his studio audience that CBS' lawyers had told him "in no uncertain terms ... that we could not have him on the broadcast." 

Colbert said the lawyers wanted to avoid running afoul of new guidance by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr that suggests broadcast talk shows could be required to abide by the so-called equal time provision requiring broadcasters to give political candidates equal coverage if their opponents appear on air.

Colbert noted that he had put Talarico's interview on the "Late Show" YouTube channel — the video has been seen more than 4.4 million times.

CBS, in its statement on Tuesday afternoon, denied Colbert's main allegation that it had barred the interview from being aired.

"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico," the network said.

"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett [D-Texas], and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled," CBS said.

Colbert scoffed at the statement during Tuesday's show.

"They know damn well that every word of my script last night was approved by CBS lawyers who, for the record, approved every script that goes on the air," Colbert said.

"In fact, between the monologue I did last night, and before I did the second act talking about this issue, I had to go backstage," he said. 

"I got called backstage to get more notes from these lawyers. Something that had never, ever happened before, and they told us the language they wanted me to use to describe that equal time exception, and I used that language," Colbert said. "So I don't know what this is about."

Colbert went on to say he wasn't "mad" at the network and does not want an "adversarial relationship."

"I'm just so surprised that this giant global corporation would not stand up to these bullies," he said.

"Come on. You're Paramount. No, no, no, you're more than that. You're Paramount+," Colbert cracked. "And for the lawyers to release this [statement] without even talking to me is really surprising."

The host also noted that there has long been "a very famous exception to" the equal time rule, "and that exception included talk shows, interviews with politicians."

"We looked, and we can't find one example of this rule being enforced for any talk show interview, not only for my entire late-night career, but for anyone's late-night career, going back to the 1960s," he said.

Colbert said that Carr has "not gotten rid of" that exception for talk show hosts "yet."

"But CBS generously did it for him and told me, unilaterally, that I had to abide by the equal time rules, something I have never been asked to do for an interview in the 20 years of this job," he added.

"Now, that decision, I want to be clear, is their right, just like I have the right to talk about their decision on air last night," Colbert said.

Paramount did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Early voting in the Texas Democratic primary began Tuesday. Talarico is in a close contest against U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett. The winner will face the victor of the Republican primary between Sen. John Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. 

Democrats have not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994.

CNBC has reached out to the FCC for comment.

NEW DELHI — More than 50% of enterprises' current software could be replaced by AI, the CEO of Mistral AI told CNBC on Wednesday, potentially adding to investor concerns over software stocks.

The comments by Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral AI, come after a sell-off in major software names that was sparked in part by Anthropic's Cowork product as investors grow increasingly worried that AI can do more of what current enterprise software does. 

Investors fear AI could eat into so-called software as a service, or SaaS, business models. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which counts names such as Microsoft and Salesforce among its top holdings, is down more than 20% this year. In India, major software stocks like Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys have also fallen. 

"I would say more than half of what's currently being bought by IT in terms of SaaS is going to shift to AI," Mensch told CNBC at the India Accelerates event on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India. 

"AI is making us able to develop software at the speed of light," Mensch added.

The Mistral CEO said as long as enterprises have the "right infrastructure in place" they're able to connect their data to AI systems to create applications to run certain parts of work.

"Then we do see with our customers ... in a couple of days, we can create fully custom applications to run a workflow, to run a procurement workflow, or to run supply chain workflows, for instance, in a way where I would say five years ago, you would actually need a vertical SaaS." 

Mensch said there is a "replatforming" taking place where businesses are looking to use more AI instead of current SaaS. 

"The replatforming is a big opportunity for us, because we now have more than 100 enterprise customers coming to us also with that will of maybe changing and replatforming their IT system, so maybe getting rid of certain things that they bought 20 years ago, and that is starting to be a bit expensive," Mensch said. 

"They see AI as a way to replatform the thing so that it becomes more efficient and less costly."

Mensch said software focused on systems of records "are not going to change," however. This type of software is responsible for data within an organization and often works in tandem with AI. 

Bipul Sinha, CEO of Rubrik, has similar views to Mensch. In an interview on Wednesday with CNBC, Sinha said "workflow software" could be "significantly disrupted by AI." However, system of record or data infrastructure software that is enabling AI, "will be a positive." 

Mensch also told CNBC that the company plans to open its first office in India this year as it expands into a market that global tech giants are all trying to get a slice of. 

Mistral is currently working with international companies that have a footprint in India but is now "prospecting" potential customers based in the country in both the public and private sectors.

While Mistral is building data centers in Europe, the approach will be different in India, with the company planning to partner with companies that already have a physical infrastructure footprint in the country, Mensch said.

The Indian government is pushing AI firms to create models that can run locally with data stored domestically. India also has various languages such as Hindi and Punjabi which Mistral said its large language models are able to accommodate. 

"That's something that down the line will be super important for the Indian consumer market," Mensch said.

Ducati's top executive said he hopes he'll never see the day when motorcycles can drive themselves.

Jason Chinnock, who has been with the Italian luxury motorcycle company for over 20 years and served as its North American CEO for a decade, said being a motorcyclist is a core part of his identity.

He told Business Insider in an interview that a self-driving motorcycle would "take away the entire reason to ride a motorcycle."

Autonomous cars, he said, are useful for mobility — they transport people in a "safe, smooth, efficient, and carefree way."

He said Ducati's motorcycles are less about transportation and more about entertainment and the riding experience.

"We are not building mobility. We're building motorcycles. We're building something for joy and for fun," Chinnock said. "If it takes away the ability to operate it and experience it, then just get in a pod and go from point A to point B."

There are no commercially available self-driving motorcycles. Some companies, such as Japan's Yamaha and the Singapore-headquartered Omoway, have started work on self-balancing bikes.

However, Ducati is not entirely dismissing autonomous features, adding them where necessary for safety. For instance, Chinnock said some of Ducati's models come with electronic cruise control, traction control, and an anti-lock braking system.

Ducati, which was founded in Bologna, Italy, in 1926, is owned by the Volkswagen Group.

Its motorcycles cost more than $10,000 in the US, with some models exceeding $40,000. In 2024, Ducati sold about 55,000 motorcycles worldwide, earning 1 billion euros, or about $1.17 billion, in revenue.

Autonomous cars are gaining traction globally. Tesla's robotaxis and Alphabet's Waymo both offer autonomous taxi services in San Francisco and the Bay Area, with Uber set to join the fray this year.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lauren Rose Kocher, 39, an American entrepreneur and CEO of Vegas PR Group in Tokyo. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.

I grew up in a small town in Indiana, but my interest in Japan started early. I still remember watching a "Sesame Street" episode where Big Bird visits Japan. That image stuck with me.

In college, that curiosity took shape: I studied Japanese at the University of Chicago and spent a summer in Hokkaido. After graduating, I moved to Japan in 2008 to teach English, though a career in teaching was never my goal.

I wanted to work for a Japanese company and use the language skills I'd built in school. I'd never worked full-time in the US, so my understanding of corporate culture has been formed almost entirely in Japan.

After teaching, I transitioned into corporate roles in Japanese companies. I spent three years as an assistant and international concert promoter before joining Sony Music's business development division for four years. I later became the cofounder and COO of a VC-funded ticketing platform.

After nearly a decade inside corporate Japan, I stepped into senior leadership.

Now, I'm the CEO and sole founder of Vegas PR Group, a Tokyo-based marketing agency focused on culture, the arts, music, and fashion. Our bilingual team of nine works across Japanese and international clients.

Since 2024, I've also overseen two businesses founded by my late husband, a sandwich restaurant and a clothing brand.

I plan to stay in Japan long-term. My two children are half-Japanese, and I value raising them here.

Japanese business culture relies heavily on consensus-building, often through "nemawashi," the process of privately aligning stakeholders before any formal decision is announced.

Feedback is similarly indirect. Japanese teams are often hesitant to raise concerns openly, which means issues can remain unspoken until they surface all at once. Decision-making is cautious and risk-averse, and change tends to be incremental rather than dramatic.

I've learned to factor this into timelines, particularly when working with Japanese clients who require internal alignment before moving forward. The people I hire tend to defy that stereotype and slot easily into our open, international culture.

I wouldn't say my management style is particularly American, but my American communication style and entrepreneurial instinct certainly are. I try to respect local expectations, though I know my tendency to move quickly and take decisive swings has occasionally come across as abrasive in a culture where decisions are slow, and relationships are built with great caution.

Because all of my work is rooted in the Japanese market, I encourage international staff to follow Japanese work customs when dealing with local clients, while leaving room for each person to navigate what they're personally comfortable with.

Punctuality is one example. In many countries, joining a Zoom call a minute or two late is inconsequential. In Japan, it's not. Logging in at 9:01 a.m. for a 9 a.m. meeting is considered late, and I enforce that expectation.

The same applies to in-person meetings, where arriving at least 10 minutes early is standard. When doing business in Japan, being on time is non-negotiable.

My leadership philosophy is rooted in servant leadership. I'm heavily invested in the success of the people I work with, and that approach has helped me build trust across Japanese and international teams.

As a white American woman in Japan, I'm perceived first as foreign. I'm also conscious of the privilege I carry. For anyone moving to Japan to lead a team, my advice is to be slow and deliberate.

Deliver important news one-on-one before making major announcements. Don't expect clear or immediate feedback, and don't assume silence means satisfaction. It's also critical to respect people's attachment to their roles, hierarchies, and existing relationships, which hold significant weight in Japanese workplaces.

I learned all of these lessons firsthand.

Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. took a chance on me as a 19-year-old college student.

At that age, as an intern in 2009, I should've been pouring coffee, maybe making copies. Instead, he put me to work on college affordability policy, youth violence prevention, and immigration reform at his Rainbow PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) Coalition on the South Side of Chicago.

That was nearly two decades ago. This week, he passed away.

A few weeks ago, I sat with him in the hospital. He was extremely present even as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy disorder had taken his voice — the same instrument that had formed seemingly impossible coalitions and made the moral case for justice in language that brought people together instead of tearing them apart.

I met him in 2009 at a press conference he held to announce his intention to negotiate the release of journalist Roxana Saberi from an Iranian prison.

Saberi was an alum of Northwestern University, where I was a student. Several classmates and I had staged a rally to call attention to her issue, and Rev. Jackson had invited us to join him at his press conference in Chicago.

When it ended and everyone packed up to leave, I made a split-second decision. 

I grabbed him by the shoulder — strongly enough that his security detail sprang into action — and asked if I could volunteer for his Reduce-the-Rate initiative on college affordability. It was an issue that deeply resonated with me, as I'd borrowed a crippling amount to attend Northwestern. He said yes.

That moment changed everything. Less than a month later, I became the campaign's manager, working part-time during school. I handled policy research and community interface and accompanied Rev. Jackson to meetings and events. I spent time with him every week and at times even did my homework at his house.

He became a mentor, coaching me and looking out for me not only professionally, but personally. I left the role in 2011, but over the years, we stayed close. 

From Rev. Jackson, I learned three lessons about leadership that have shaped everything I've done since.

Rev. Jackson had a pattern: When things got difficult, he moved closer to the problem, not away from it.

He negotiated the release of over 200 hostages across Syria, Cuba, Iraq, and Serbia. He flew into war zones and sat across the table from dictators. He showed up to Texaco's headquarters during their discrimination scandal. He walked into corporate boardrooms where he wasn't welcome.

Many leaders I know do the opposite. When crisis hits, they create distance — delegate to lawyers, let the public relations team handle it, wait for it to blow over.

Rev. Jackson taught me that the moments when you want to step back are precisely when you need to step forward. Your measure as a leader is taken in the hardest moments, not the easy ones.

Rev. Jackson had no reason to believe in my abilities. But he understood that individuals have incredible capacity for growth — they just don't start off optimally productive.

He put a 19-year-old on policy work that mattered, then put me on-air representing the campaign. That wasn't reckless — it was intentional investment. He knew that by giving people opportunities, some would disappoint him over the years, but the ones who didn't might surpass what he could've imagined.

I've carried that forward — looking for people others overlook and investing in their growth. Not everyone pans out. But the ones who do become extraordinary.

Real leadership isn't about finding perfect people. It's about developing the potential in imperfect ones.

Rev. Jackson was simultaneously the agitator and the negotiator. The prophet and the pragmatist.

He showed up uninvited to shareholder meetings and organized boycotts, but also sat down with those same executives afterward to identify resolutions.

"Diamonds can't be produced without pressure," he once told me. This applies to individuals, organizations, and systems.

He understood that real change requires both confrontation and conversation. You can't just be nice and hope things improve. But you also can't only apply pressure and expect people to come around.

I watched him do this with the Wall Street Project, pressuring corporations like Texaco and Coca-Cola to commit billions to diversity initiatives. He made them uncomfortable with boycotts. Then he sat down with their leadership and helped build solutions.

Too many leaders think they have to choose to either be tough or be empathetic. Rev. Jackson taught me that's a false choice; the best leaders do both.

Rev. Jackson once told me the work of justice isn't about being comfortable. It's about being consistent. It's about showing up when it's hard, especially when staying silent would be easier.

He showed up. Consistently. The work he did — building coalitions across impossible divides, making the moral case in language that united rather than divided — we need it now more than ever.

Last year, during one of my Saturday visits to Rainbow PUSH, I brought the manuscript for my book "Faster. Messier. Tougher: Crisis Communications Strategies in an Era of Populism, AI, and Distrust." He saw how I was continuing on the work and agreed to put his name behind it. 

Last week, when I held the first copy from the printer and saw the quote from him on the front cover, it was so moving. That he could support me one last time means the world to me.

I grabbed his shoulder at 19 because I didn't want to let the moment pass. He taught me to lean into hard moments, develop people others overlook, and hold the tension between conflict and conversation.

That work doesn't end with him. It's up to us to pick it up.

In Europe, there's been a lot of handwringing over why there are very few large, successful tech companies in the region. Peter Steinberger, the creator of the agentic AI hit OpenClaw, has an answer.

Steinberger was recently hired by OpenAI and is moving from Europe to the US. An Austrian by birth, he previously split his time between London and Vienna.

On X, a professor from a European university asked why Europe couldn't retain this tech talent.

Steinberger replied that most people in the US are enthusiastic, while in Europe, he's scolded about responsibility and regulations.

If he built a company in Europe, he would struggle with strict labor regulations and similar rules, he added.

At OpenAI, he said most employees work 6 to 7 days a week and are paid accordingly. In Europe, that would be illegal, he added.

The most valuable company in Europe is Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML, valued at about $550 billion. In contrast, there are 10 US companies worth more than $1 trillion. Most of these are tech companies.

In 2024, a landmark EU report found that the region had fallen behind the US, particularly in innovation. It proposed a series of changes to tackle the problem, but by the end of 2025, few of the recommendations had been implemented.

Steinberger said he was hopeful about EU INC, an effort to create a single corporate legal framework to make it simpler to run a business across the region.

But this seems to be "fizzling out," he wrote on X. "Watered down, too much egoistic national interest that ultimately hurts everyone."

Tesla says its purpose-built robotaxi just reached an important manufacturing milestone.

In an X post on Tuesday, the company said the Cybercab, a two-door car without a steering wheel, came off the production line at Tesla's sprawling Gigafactory in Austin.

"Congratulations to the Tesla team on making the first production Cybercab!" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on X.

The Cybercab was designed for Tesla's nascent robotaxi ride-hailing program.

Tesla's robotaxi program has so far deployed only 2025 Model Ys and mostly relies on human safety monitors to supervise rides. Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides to the public in January.

Unlike the Model Y, the Cybercab doesn't have a steering wheel or pedals — it's intended to be fully autonomous. Amazon's Zoox similarly manufactures purpose-built robotaxis designed solely to transport passengers.

Tesla has said it expects to start production of the Cybercab in April.

What's less clear is the timeline for when the automaker expects the Cybercab to be fully street legal.

Federal vehicle safety standards were written with human control systems like a steering wheel in mind, which means Tesla would likely need special approval from regulators for any requirements it can't meet. Notably, Zoox received such a federal exemption and now operates a limited public service in Las Vegas and San Francisco.

Musk also said people will have the option to buy the car. Selling a car without pedals or steering controls not only requires clearing federal regulatory hurdles but could also expose Tesla to a patchwork of state-by-state rules governing registration, insurance, and autonomous vehicle operation.

"What we designed is optimized for autonomy," Musk said during an earnings call in October 2024. "It will cost on the order of — cost roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car. And you can, you will be able to buy one exclusively if you want."

A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

FutureBit launched the Apollo III today, a new home Bitcoin mining system combining a high-performance miner and a full Bitcoin node in a single desktop device.

FutureBit launched the Apollo III today, a new home Bitcoin mining system combining a high-performance miner and a full Bitcoin node in a single desktop device.

The system is built around next-generation 3nm American-designed ASICs and a custom in-house controller, marking the first U.S.-engineered Bitcoin ASIC paired with a domestically built hardware platform in a consumer desktop form factor, according to a note shared with Bitcoin Magazine.

The Apollo III continues FutureBit's mission to decentralize hash power through low-power, individual-focused systems.

Founder John Stefanopoulos highlighted the device's role in strengthening Bitcoin decentralization, referencing the company's 2024 milestone of mining a modern-era sovereign solo block.

“In 2024, our customers mined one of the first modern- era sovereign solo blocks, sending shockwaves through the industry and proving that industrial scale wasn't a prerequisite for meaningful participation in Bitcoin,” Stefanopoulos said. “Apollo III expands that possibility. Nearly 20 terahash of efficient, accessible hash power in the hands of individuals strengthens the decentralization that Bitcoin was built for.”

Key specifications include up to 18 TH/s in Turbo Mode, up to 15 J/TH efficiency in Eco Mode, an integrated full Bitcoin node with solo mining capability, and a desktop‑class controller featuring 8 ARM cores, 8 GB RAM, and a 2 TB SSD.

Designed for continuous operation in a home or office, Apollo III provides more than 10 TH/s while consuming power similar to standard household electronics. The company said the Apollo III is a personal computing solution for Bitcoin infrastructure, giving individuals the tools to run both a miner and a node without relying on industrial-scale operations.

FutureBit's Apollo line of home Bitcoin miners, including the Apollo II with 10 TH/s and a full Linux node, makes mining at home accessible while promoting network decentralization. 

The company aims to restore “full Bitcoin citizenship” by combining mining power with running a full node, echoing Satoshi's original vision. While home mining is no longer competitive for profit, it offers privacy, education, and the ability to verify balances without relying on third parties.

Home miners can contribute to decentralization both geographically and in block template diversity, reducing the influence of large industrial pools and potential regulatory capture. 

By empowering individuals to mine and run their own nodes, FutureBit seeks to foster a more resilient, distributed, and user-controlled Bitcoin network.

Vitalik Buterin is speaking up about privacy. The Ethereum co-founder recently shared a blog post about Iran's surveillance state. 

He used it to make a broader point about freedom and technology. His comments come as tensions between the US and Iran are heating up fast. The crypto world is now paying close attention.

Buterin says freedom advocates are making a mistake. They call surveillance “dystopian” and stop there. To him, that is not enough. 

Calling something dystopian sounds like an aesthetic complaint, not a real argument. He wants people to understand the actual harm.

This is a good post on the impact of surveillance in Iran:https://t.co/TzSqUE2JOo

It's worth reading.

IMO one mistake that freedom advocates often make is that we talk about privacy violation and surveillance as "dystopian", using the word as a semantic stop sign: we know it…

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 18, 2026



He wrote on X that surveillance shifts the power balance between individuals and the state. Governments with total surveillance can stay in power forever. They only need a small group of loyalists with weapons and technology.

 He referenced “The Dictator's Handbook” to explain this. Small coalition governments, he noted, are the most dangerous kind.

Buterin sees privacy technology as part of the solution. He also supports building censorship-resistant internet access. 

He called basic internet, around 1 Mbps, a global human right. In his view, it should sit outside nation-state control. Crypto tools that protect privacy can reduce the risk of total government control.

He did not spare Western governments either. Buterin pointed out that US and Israeli tech companies also run surveillance operations. 

The difference, he argued, is the scope. Iran, Russia, and China focus on deep control within their borders. Western surveillance is broader but spreads across the globe. Both types pose serious threats to individual freedom.

The war talk is now rattling financial markets. The Kobeissi Letter reported on X that Axios revealed evidence of an imminent US-Iran conflict. 

Israel is reportedly preparing for war within days. The expected campaign would be far larger than recent operations. The US has moved two aircraft carriers, 12 warships, and hundreds of fighter jets to the region.

Over 150 military cargo flights have already moved weapons to the Middle East. Another 50 fighter jets, including F-35s and F-22s, arrived within 24 hours. 

Oil prices jumped above $64 per barrel on the news. War in a major oil-producing region tends to shake global markets hard. Crypto is no exception.

BREAKING: Axios reports that there is evidence that US war with Iran is "imminent" and Israel is preparing for a scenario of "war within days," which is expected to include:

1. Weeks-long "full-fledged" war unlike the Venezuela operation, sources say

2. Joint US-Israeli…

— The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 18, 2026



Historically, geopolitical crises push investors toward safe-haven assets. Gold typically rises during conflict. Bitcoin has increasingly played a similar role in some portfolios. 

A prolonged US-Iran war could drive more interest in decentralized assets. Investors looking to escape traditional financial instability sometimes turn to crypto.

At the same time, market fear can trigger sell-offs across all asset classes, including crypto. The outcome is never guaranteed. What is clear is that the combination of war risk and growing surveillance concerns gives Buterin's message more urgency. 

Crypto, Vitalik argues, is not just a financial tool. It is a defense against concentrated power

Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 network, Base, is changing the technology that powers it, stepping back from relying on Optimism's OP Stack, the toolkit it originally launched on.

In a blog post titled “The Next Chapter for Base,” the team said it plans to take more control over its own code and infrastructure. Instead of depending on multiple outside teams for key upgrades and changes, Base will consolidate everything into a Base-managed codebase.

In simple terms, Base was built using Optimism's technology, but now it wants to steer more of its own ship. Optimism is a layer-2 blockchain on top of Ethereum that aims to reduce settlement times and transaction costs.

Base launched in 2023 and quickly became one of the most widely used Ethereum layer-2 networks, with $3.85 billion locked in the protocol today.

The OP token is down 4% over the past 24 hours following the announcement. 

The team said that the change doesn't mean Base is cutting ties with Optimism entirely. The company said it will still work with Optimism for support and will remain compatible with OP Stack standards during the transition. For everyday users and developers, nothing should immediately change.

The team said the shift is happening because, if it controls its own stack, Base can ship upgrades faster and simplify how the network operates behind the scenes, aiming to double its pace of major upgrades to about six per year.

For now, the transition is mostly technical. 

"This unification does not mean Base will be built in isolation. The protocol remains public and specified in the open, and alternative implementations are welcome and encouraged," the team wrote in their blog post.

Ethereum's 50% staking milestone triggers backlash over 'misleading' supply data

CoinShares researcher Luke Nolan says the 50% figure is ‘inaccurate, or at least materially misleading' and staked ether is closer to 30% of supply. Ethplorer.io's Aleksandr Vat agrees.

Ethereum has crossed a symbolic threshold, with more than half the total ether (ETH) issued now held in its proof-of-stake (PoS) contract for the first time in the network's 11-year history, Santiment said in a post on X that has been met with criticism.

The onchain analytics firm on Tuesday said that 50.18% of all ETH issued historically is now sitting in the staking deposit contract. The figure reflects cumulative ETH that has flowed into the contract since staking was introduced ahead of the network's 2022 transition from proof-of-work to PoS.

According to CoinDesk data, the total supply of ether is 120.69 million tokens. Bitmine, the world's largest ether-focused treasury firm, has 4.29 million ETH, of which 2.9 million is staked. According to Arkham data, the largest holder is the Eth2 Beacon Deposit Contract with 77.1 million or over 60% of the total supply. It holds the most because it serves as the central, mandatory gateway for staking to secure the blockchain. Beacon is followed by Binance with 4.1 million ETH, BlackRock with 3.4 million and Coinbase with 2.9 million.

While the tokens are staked, they cannot be transferred or traded. Withdrawals have been enabled since the Shanghai upgrade in 2023, allowing validators to exit and return ETH to circulation.

That distinction prompted some analysts to caution against interpreting the 50% figure as a permanent supply lock.

“The post is inaccurate, or at least materially misleading,” Luke Nolan, senior research associate at CoinShares, told CoinDesk. “It references the one-way deposit contract used for ETH staking, but does not account for withdrawals. While ETH is sent into that contract when validators stake, it is not a permanent sink.”

Since withdrawals were enabled, ETH can exit the validator set and re-enter circulation, meaning that looking at the deposit contract balance alone can overstate the amount effectively staked, Nolan said.

“There is also an important nuance around the numbers being cited,” he added. “It is not correct to suggest that over 80 million ETH are currently staked. Roughly 80 million ETH have passed through the staking contract historically, but the amount actively staked today is closer to 37 million ETH, which is around 30% of the current circulating supply. That distinction materially changes the narrative.”

Aleksandr Vat, BizDev at Ethplorer.io, agreed with Nolan and provided CoinDesk with supporting data reinforcing that distinction.

The Beacon deposit contract balance on the Etherscan tracker, currently around 80.97 million ETH, reflects cumulative deposits since launch and does not decrease when validators exit. Withdrawals are processed by minting ETH back to execution-layer addresses rather than subtracting from the deposit contract itself, Vat said.

According to active staking metrics, approximately 37,253,430 ETH are presently staked, based on data from Ethplorer and CryptoQuant, implying that staking represents 30.8% of the total supply.

Santiment's 50% figure appears to compare the cumulative Beacon contract balance to historically issued supply prior to EIP-1559 burns, Vat said. While that may be mathematically consistent depending on the denominator used, it does not represent the amount of ETH currently locked or removed from circulation, he noted.

Even so, the milestone highlights how central staking has become to Ethereum's economic design, Vineet Budki, partner and CEO at Sigma Capital, told CoinDesk. As participation rises, a larger share of ETH earns yield through validator rewards, reinforcing its positioning as a yield-bearing crypto asset, he said, adding he sees the development as evidence of Ethereum's maturation into what he called a “digital bond.”

“Ethereum's milestone of 50% staked supply marks its evolution into a digital bond, where the network's security is fueled by long-term conviction rather than short-term speculation,” Budki said. “By locking half the total issuance in a one-way vault, the protocol has engineered a structural supply crunch.”

Budki also pointed to accelerating network activity, including a 125% year-over-year increase in daily transactions, a doubling of daily active addresses and an increase in tokenized real-world assets, much of it occurring on layer-2 networks that settle back to Ethereum's base layer.

Nolan noted, however, that recent validator growth has been concentrated among large participants.

“A significant portion of recent validator entries has been driven by large entities such as Bitmine and U.S.-listed ETFs, which have taken up a notable share of the entry queue,” he noted.

With staking levels continuing to climb, the debate shows just how Ethereum's supply metrics, and how they are presented, can significantly shape market narratives, Budki concluded.

Laßnitzhöhe, Austria, February 18th, 2026, FinanceWire

Blockchain DMD today announced the release of a new technical analysis examining the relationship between its DMD Diamond (DMD) V4 blockchain and rapidly growing zero-knowledge (ZK) technologies, positioning DMD V4 as a foundational Layer 1 infrastructure designed to support the next generation of scalable and privacy-focused applications.

As the crypto industry intensifies its focus on Layer 2 scalability and privacy-enhancing solutions, Blockchain DMD's development team published a comparative architectural review of its newly launched V4 mainnet and widely adopted zero-knowledge proof systems.

DMD Diamond, originally founded in 2013, recently deployed its V4 mainnet built on Honey Badger BFT (HBBFT) consensus combined with POSDAO governance. According to the announcement, while ZK rollups and privacy protocols are gaining momentum, they depend on a secure, decentralized, and cost-efficient base layer — a role Blockchain DMD states DMD Diamond is engineered to fulfill.

Technical Analysis Highlights Core Differences




The analysis outlines several fundamental distinctions between DMD Diamond's Layer 1 architecture and zero-knowledge technologies:

Consensus-Level vs. Cryptographic Security

DMD Diamond V4 delivers consensus-level security through HBBFT and POSDAO, enabling the network to remain operational and secure even when a significant portion of validator nodes behave maliciously. This model emphasizes cooperative Byzantine fault tolerance at the protocol level.

Zero-knowledge systems, by contrast, rely on mathematical cryptographic proofs that validate information without revealing underlying data. These solutions are typically deployed on top of existing base-layer networks.

Instant Finality vs. Dependent Finality




DMD V4 offers deterministic instant finality, meaning transactions become irreversible as soon as they are included in a block.

ZK rollups operating on networks such as Ethereum generally inherit the finality characteristics of the underlying Layer 1, which may introduce confirmation delays.

Positioning DMD Diamond as a ZK-Ready Infrastructure Layer

Rather than framing zero-knowledge technologies as competitive alternatives, Blockchain DMD's announcement emphasizes interoperability and synergy.

The technical analysis identifies three primary advantages DMD Diamond offers to ZK-based applications:
		



The company stated that the analysis is part of a broader initiative to position DMD Diamond as an infrastructure optimized for high-performance decentralized applications requiring security, fairness, and scalability.

About DMD Diamond

Founded in 2013, DMD Diamond is one of the longest-running Layer 1 blockchains focused on security, interoperability, and decentralized governance. The ecosystem is community-driven, with stakeholders collectively guiding protocol development and long-term strategic direction.

Artificial intelligence will take white-collar workers' jobs and threaten to crash the US economy, which Arthur Hayes says will pave the way for Bitcoin to reach a new record high.

In his latest missive, the Maelstrom chief investment officer argues that large language models from OpenAI and Anthropic will push office workers out of their jobs and trigger a financial downturn, as those workers fail to repay their loans. 

Eventually, that will force the Federal Reserve to step in and print money to avoid deflation spiralling out of control, Hayes argues. 

When that happens, Bitcoin is set to hit a new all-time high.

“Deflation is bad, but ultimately good for fiat credit-sensitive assets like Bitcoin,” Hayes wrote in his Tuesday blog.

His forecast may serve as a slight balm for investors who've been burned by the market downturn that has shaved 45% Bitcoin's price since it reached its $124,000 record in October. 

During that time, the overall crypto market has lost about half of its total value, or $2 trillion. 

Hayes' argument is simple. 

Companies will replace white-collar workers with AI tools, which means those workers will be unable to pay their debts. If enough of them default on their loans, banks will suffer roughly $527 billion in losses, per Hayes' estimates.

Those defaults risk wiping out all but the biggest banks from the market. 

“This will be a rerun of the regional bank crisis in early 2023 that destroyed three banks in a fortnight,” Hayes wrote. 

“But this time it will be much worse, as the genesis of the crisis is the unstoppable nature of AI, a narrative the market believes and is terrified by.”

As the crisis continues, traders will likely dump their stocks to avoid being swept up in the banking crisis, which will cause the stock market to collapse, Hayes argues. 

The result of this cascading crisis is that the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury will step in to print money in order to avoid a repeat of the Panic of 2008.

“And then wham bam thank you ma'am it's time to back up the fucking truck and buy Bitcoin and shitcoins like it's 2020,” Hayes said.

To be sure, the BitMEX co-founder doesn't say this will happen tomorrow or maybe not even this year, only that he believes it will happen.

Hayes has form when it comes to making bullish Bitcoin bets. 

Usually, those calls revolve around some sort of intervention from the Federal Reserve that'll see the central bank plough more money into the economy.

In the past, he's predicted that Bitcoin will pump thanks to the Fed printing money to bail out its Japanese counterpart, the central bank's Reserve Management Purchases programme, falling mortgage rates, and commercial banks lending to strategic industries.

In January, he also suggested that the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro would give the US access to the Latin American country's oil, which would keep inflation down and give the Fed an excuse to cut interest rates. 

Low interest rates usually incentivise investors to bet on riskier assets like Bitcoin.

In December, he predicted that Bitcoin's price would reach $200,000 by March.

To be sure, Hayes has an impressive track record for forecasting the price movement of the world's biggest cryptocurrency, but he's been proven wrong in the past. 

At the beginning of 2025, he — like Tom Lee and analysts at Bernstein, Bitwise and Standard Chartered — predicted that Bitcoin would end the year trading at $200,000. 

Hayes later lowered his target to $150,000. Bitcoin ended the year trading just over $87,500.

Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong said on Sunday that retail users on the cryptocurrency exchange showed strong resilience in the ongoing market downturn, steadily purchasing Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) during the dips.

Armstrong highlighted on X a rise in native Bitcoin and Ethereum units held by retail users on the platform.

“They've been buying the dip,” he stated. “They have diamond hands – vast majority of customers had native unit balances in Feb equal to or greater than their balances in December.”

Retail users on Coinbase have been very resilient during these market conditions, according to our data:– They've been buying the dip – we've seen a native unit increase for retail users across BTC and ETH– They have diamond hands – vast majority of customers had native unit…

It's worth noting that Google search interest for Bitcoin reached a 5-month high in February, aligning with the top cryptocurrency's steep drop toward $60,000.

Additionally, Binance retail traders in derivatives showed strong Bitcoin optimism, with a Long/Short ratio of 1.90, according to Coinglass.

Coinbase's fourth-quarter revenue for 2025 hit $1.78 billion, missing analyst estimates, but EPS came in strong at $0.66, beating forecasts. Full-year revenue reached $7.2 billion, a 9% increase from last year.

During the earnings call, Armstrong stated that the company has the ability to launch its own prediction market business, beyond serving as a retail distributor for platforms like Kalshi.

PALM BEACH, Fla. — Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he owns "very little, but some" bitcoin, although he continues to follow the asset closely as part of a broader interest in how technology is reshaping finance.

“I'm an observer of bitcoin,” Solomon said at the World Liberty Forum on Wednesday, saying he's still trying to understand how it moves. 

While Goldman Sachs has taken a cautious approach to digital assets, the firm's leadership sees crypto as part of a longer-term shift in financial infrastructure, Solomon noted.

He dismissed the idea that traditional banks and crypto firms are locked in a zero-sum fight. “It's one system, it's our system,” he said. “We have to do it the right way … and there's going to be disagreements and that's OK.”

Solomon said the evolution of markets is being shaped by large-scale technology platforms, and tokenization will play a central role. 

“The evolution of those platforms … there's obvious impact,” he said. “Tokenization ... that I think is super important.”

While other banking giants such as JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have pushed deeper into the digital asset space, Goldman Sachs' involvement has been limited so far. The main reason, according to Solomon, is regulation. 

“Until 10 minutes ago, the regulatory structure was extremely prohibitive,” he jokingly said, but suggested that as regulators begin providing greater latitude for companies to get "more involved" in the sector, Goldman may take another look.

Solomon criticized the economic effects of overregulation. 

“When you burden this system with excessive regulation, you start to extract capital,” he said. “That absolutely happened in the last five years.”

He emphasized getting the approach right. “It's got to be done thoughtfully, and we've got to get it right.”

Solomon previously said that the banking giant is ramping up its research and internal discussions around crypto-adjacent technologies, including tokenization and prediction markets.

We are pleased to announce that two further individuals have been convicted following our extensive investigation into the unlawful accessing and sale of personal information obtained from over 400 garages across the UK, as well as claims management and insurance companies. 

Christopher Munro, 37, of Knutsford, Cheshire, and William Chipoma, 35, of Enfield, London, were charged after investigations uncovered their involvement in the theft and sale of personal data within the claims management sector. 

Our enquiries revealed that Munro and Chipoma deliberately sought employment with the intention of stealing and selling personal data. 

Munro, while working for two different companies during 2015 and 2016, accessed thousands of records without legitimate authority or consent, receiving payments totalling £16,000. He made multiple employment applications to claims management and insurance companies but left after short periods when unable to access personal data. He was charged with four offences: two under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and two under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998. 

Chipoma illegally accessed records and sold personal data between 2015 and 2017, receiving payments totalling £70,550. He was also charged with four offences: two under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and two under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998. 

Both men pleaded guilty to all offences at an earlier hearing.  

Following this, both men appeared at Minshull Street Crown Court on 11 February 2026 where Chipoma was handed a 10 month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, as well as being ordered to complete 240 hours of unpaid work. Whilst Munro was handed a 32 week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, as well as being ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.

This brings the total number of people prosecuted in our largest nuisance call investigation to 10. Three people have been cautioned in relation to this case.

ICO Financial Investigators as well as external Financial Investigators are looking to recoup the financial benefits obtained by these offenders by utilising the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. 

Eight men guilty following largest ever nuisance call investigation

We welcome a guilty verdict in a trial related to the unlawful accessing and obtaining of people's personal information from vehicle repair garages to generate potential leads for personal injury claims.

The verdict follows a 10 week trial and an extensive investigation by the ICO. During which, we seized the widest body of evidence we have ever seen, demonstrating the misuse of people's personal details to make nuisance calls to try and persuade people to make personal injury claims.

A jury at Bolton Crown Court this week found Craig Cornick, 40, of Prestbury, guilty of conspiracy to unlawfully obtain personal data contrary to the Data Protection Act.

Earlier in the month, the jury returned a not guilty verdict for Cornick and Thomas Daly, 35, of Macclesfield, for a charge of conspiracy to access computer systems without authority contrary to the Computer Misuse Act.

Daly had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to unlawfully obtain personal data.

Cornick and Daly join six other men who had all previously pleaded guilty to the offences listed below:

All the defendants are due to return to court on 11 July, where it is proposed Proceeds of Crime Act and cost issues will be discussed, with sentencing following at a later date.

ICO Head of Investigations, Andy Curry, said:

“Most of us have had nuisance calls asking if we've been in a crash. At best they're annoying but at worst they cause real upset and fear, especially to vulnerable people, and have a real impact on the businesses affected.

This case uncovered a vast, murky criminal network where crash details were stolen from garages across England, Scotland and Wales and traded to fuel distressing predatory calls. This has been an enormous and complex case which has seen ICO staff use both technical expertise and investigative skills to work tirelessly to track down those responsible and hold them accountable on behalf of the public.”

Our investigation 

We initially started this investigation in 2016 when the owner of a car repair garage in County Durham contacted the regulator, saying he was worried his customers blamed him for the nuisance calls they were receiving about personal injury claims.

From this first initial complaint, the investigation snowballed into one of the largest nuisance call cases we have ever dealt with, resulting in a wealth of evidence that demonstrated misuses of personal data for the purpose of making calls relating to personal injury claims.

After identifying the people involved, our investigations team conducted nine warrants in the Manchester and Macclesfield areas. The devices seized under search warrant contained 241,000 emails, 4.5 million documents,144,000 spreadsheets,1.5 million images and 83,000 multimedia files.

The defendants were found to have conspired together between 2014 and 2017, where they accessed or obtained personal data of people from vehicle repair garages without their consent. Approximately one million records were accessed by the defendants convicted of an offence under the Computer Misuse Act.

This data was then sold onto claims management firms hoping to generate potential leads for personal injury claims. We have an ongoing second phase of our investigation and anticipate further prosecutions of people embedded into insurance companies and claims management companies with the sole aim of stealing personal data.

 

We are pleased to announce that two further individuals have been convicted following our extensive investigation into the unlawful accessing and sale of personal information obtained from over 400 garages across the UK, as well as claims management and insurance companies.

The next phase of the Data (Use and Access) Act (DUAA) implementation commenced yesterday, 5 February 2026. This means that most of the remaining data protection provisions of the Act have come into force, except for the requirement for organisations to have a complaints procedure which is due to commence on 19 June 2026 and some ICO governance provisions which will follow at a later date. 

We have fined MediaLab.AI, Inc. (MediaLab), owner of image sharing and hosting platform Imgur, £247,590 for failing to use children's personal information lawfully.  

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has opened formal investigations into X Internet Unlimited Company (XIUC) and X.AI LLC (X.AI) covering their processing of personal data in relation to the Grok artificial intelligence system and its potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.  

We have reprimanded Staines Health Group for sending excessive medical details about a terminally ill patient to their insurance company. 

In January 2025, we responded to the government's call for proposals to boost the UK's economy and foster economic growth.

We have fined two companies a total of £225,000 for sending millions of unsolicited marketing messages in breach of the law. 

We have updated and enhanced our guidance on international transfers of personal information, making it quicker for businesses to understand and comply with the transfer rules under UK GDPR. 

Our new report released today shows how the rise of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) could transform the way we live our lives, with personal shopping ‘AI-gents' potentially arriving within the next five years.

Crypto, Tech

During the wild craze that was dubbed the next Bitcoin, Justin Bieber once bought a ‘Bored Ape' NFT for millions of dollars – but fast forward four years, and it's almost worthless.

In a bid to recreate the Bitcoin boom that has made common tech gurus into billionaires, we've had schemes like Dogecoin, Metaverse tokens, and NFTs.

The latter might be one of the biggest currency collapse stories we've had since Wall Street, though, as ultra-wealthy people poured a lot of money into these avatar-like mascots.

One of those was Justin Bieber, who bought Bored Ape Yacht Club for $1,301,550 in January 2022, but it's now worth less than what it costs to get an oil change in his cars.

Although Ferrari is trying to revive NFTs, the cryptocurrency fell flat on its face shortly after booming in 2022.

Justin Bieber bought the third-most expensive NFT ever owned by a celebrity, paying $1,301,550 for the Bored Ape Yacht Club, expecting it to become increasingly rare and an investment for the future.

However, in one year, it lost 95 percent of its value.

Now, it's over 99 percent, as current NFT rates suggest that the BAYC avatar is worth just $12,000 today.

That's about as much as a one-year-old Nissan Versa, slated as America's most affordable car.

But it's not just Bieber whose money has been lost to the NFT scene, as millions of online tokens are now worth pennies on the dollar.

The designers, Yuga Labs, were even sued for using celebrity endorsements, like Justin Bieber, in order to convince others to begin investing in the scheme. 

The claimants believe these celebrities were hired to ‘artificially inflate and distort the price' of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs.

Justin Bieber wasn't the biggest loser, though, only taking the bronze medal here, as Snoop Dogg set the bar for celebrities with a $7 million purchase of ‘Right Click and Save As guy'.

Snoop's token is worth $60,000 today, although his investment did reap rewards with a recent collection based on the celebrity, managing to raise $12 million.

Gary Vaynerchuk's $4 million CryptoPunk token was the runner-up, now worth less than $50,000.

Other celebrities such as Neymar Jr., Madonna, Eminem, Logan Paul, and Tom Brady all lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

It really was a huge investment blunder for everyone, all of whom could have had a similar fate to this Bitcoin investor if they chose the right pot to grow their money in.

Crypto is the forgotten middle child of tech right now, sandwiched in between AI labs and vertical AI startups. Despite small glimmers of hope for blockchain technology, from continued hype around stablecoins to sustained hope for market structure legislation, sentiment is at an all-time low, especially because there's no easy villain like Gary Gensler or Sam Bankman-Fried to blame for sinking prices. 

Amid the winter, the blockchain venture firm Dragonfly Capital managed to close its $650 million fourth fund, avoiding the “mass extinction event” suffered by its peers, as general partner Rob Hadick put it. The simple reason for its success is timely investments into a number of category winners that convinced its backers to re-up the war chest, including Polymarket and the stablecoin card issuer Rain. But beneath that is a years-long belief that crypto would be hurtling toward Wall Street, and not toward a Web3 version of the internet that other VCs saw in the glimmering future. 

Dragonfly began in 2018 as a partnership between Alex Pack, then leading crypto deals for Bain Capital Ventures, and Bo Feng, a veteran of the early Chinese internet ecosystem. The firm had a rocky first few years, including a breakup with Pack that has become lore in blockchain VC circles, as well as an abandonment of China amid the government's crypto crackdown. But led by Haseeb Qureshi and Tom Schmidt, Dragonfly built a name for itself as one of the top investors in the space. After Hadick came over from the traditional finance side in 2022, though, Dragonfly shifted its focus, realizing that crypto was quickly converging with fintech. 

Schmidt told me that crypto is going through “the biggest meta shift” he has experienced during his time in the industry, as investors realize that there will be fewer native tokens for apps—the previous model for crypto VCs—and more tokens that represent real-world assets like stocks and private credit funds. 

Is this a comedown for blockchain technology, which began as a rebellion against Wall Street and governmental control of global finance? Probably. But even as crypto loses its sheen, Schmidt says it's important to not lose sight of the bigger picture, which is that digital internet money has gone from “zero to a trillion dollars in 10 years.”

                            Logan Paul's NFT has collapsed — what about the collections of other celebrities? | Source: CCN                        

When YouTuber Logan Paul paid 188 ether for a rare digital collectible from the 0N1 Force NFT collection in August 2021 — worth roughly $623,000 to $635,000 at the time — the purchase embodied the peak of the pandemic-era NFT frenzy.

Five years later, the collection's floor price has fallen to around 0.08 Ether, or approximately $155 at current prices near $1,965, according to data reviewed on NFT marketplace OpenSea.

The collapse, which has drawn widespread ridicule on social media, has raised questions regarding what other celebrity NFTs are valued at today.

Logan Paul purchased the 0N1 Force NFT in August 2021 for 188 ETH at the height of the NFT craze, buying the NFT alongside a myriad of other celebrities.

However, just one year later, Paul had accepted he made a “mistake” claiming “it's worth essentially nothing.”

A year ago, I spent $623,000 on an NFT. Today, it's worth essentially nothing.

I've immortalized this mistake in 99 Originals with an exact replica helmet & outfithttps://t.co/OzBRdQPxUK pic.twitter.com/srD2h4SgO7

— Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) July 13, 2022



At the time of reporting, five years on, the broader 0N1 Force collection shows a floor price of roughly 0.08 ETH ($155) on OpenSea.

Because NFTs trade infrequently, the “worth” of a specific token often reflects the lowest active listing price for the collection.

While Paul has always denied wrongdoing, the backlash has been amplified by controversy surrounding CryptoZoo, an NFT-based game project he promoted in 2021 that was later criticized after failing to deliver key features.

CryptoZoo was marketed as a blockchain game in which users would buy NFT “eggs” that could hatch into hybrid animals and generate token rewards.

The project drew complaints from buyers who said they had spent thousands of dollars on NFTs and tokens but were unable to recoup funds after development stalled and prices fell.

Paul has previously said he intended to make affected CryptoZoo buyers whole and has blamed the project's failure on advisers and developers.

He has also said he did not personally profit from the project.

The renewed attention has extended beyond NFTs into other tokenization ventures tied to Paul's brand — including a separate controversy involving the fractionalization of a rare Pokémon card.

Earlier this week, Paul set a Guinness World Record after selling his rare Pikachu Illustrator Pokémon card for nearly $16.5 million — making it reportedly the most expensive Pokémon card sale in history.

He had purchased the card for $5.3 million in July 2021.

The record sale, however, reignited criticism over Paul's 2022 decision to fractionalize ownership of the card through Liquid Marketplace, a platform which eventually collapsed.

Some investors were temporarily unable to access their holdings, and the episode prompted legal action in Canada.

Paul has said the platform's shutdown was beyond his control and that he later paid to restore the site so users could withdraw funds.

He claimed that only 5.4% of the card had been fractionalized, representing roughly $270,000 in outside investment.

However, community notes on X highlight how Logan Paul co-founded the platform, previously naming it as “my platform.”

A hearing is currently scheduled for June, though Paul is not named in the lawsuit.

Pop star Justin Bieber purchased Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #3001 in January 2022 for 500 ETH, roughly $1.29 million at the time, according to blockchain data.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, one of the most prominent NFT projects of the boom, reached floor prices above 150 ETH in 2022.

As of Feb. 18, BAYC's floor price stands around 6.10 ETH on OpenSeam, which stands at just approximately $12,184 at today's trading prices.

The markdown represents over 90% of its value lost.

Bieber's specific NFT has not recently sold, making its exact market value uncertain.

Rare traits can usually command premiums, but valuation typically tracks close to the collection floor.

Along with Logan Paul, Rapper Snoop Dogg emerged during the NFT boom as one of the highest-profile celebrity collectors, operating under the pseudonym “Cozomo de' Medici”.

The account, which began posting regularly about NFT acquisitions in 2021, quickly drew a large following in the crypto community, sharing purchases and commentary on the speculative dynamics of the market.

— Snoop Dogg (@SnoopDogg) September 20, 2021



The account, which was initially anonymous, announced a contest which said a celebrity would publicly claim the identity and reward the first user to spot the announcement with 1 ETH.

In a move that many claim was a standout moment from the NFT boom, Snoop Dogg revealed on X that he was the man behind the profile.

The Cozomo wallet has been linked to a vast array of NFTs, including CryptoPunks, Art Blocks, and other high-value works that were widely traded during the market's peak.

Some industry estimates at the time placed the portfolio's value in the tens of millions of dollars, though these figures fluctuate sharply.

Among the most prominent assets associated with the wallet are CryptoPunks, one of the earliest and best-known NFT collections.

Individual CryptoPunks sold for more than $10 million during the boom, but prices have since fallen substantially.

As of Feb. 18, CryptoPunks' floor price stands at roughly 29.8 ETH, according to listings on OpenSea.

At today's trading price, that equates to approximately just $55,000.

Because the Cozomo portfolio contains NFTs of varying rarity — including pieces that may trade far above floor prices — its total value cannot be determined without recent sales.

Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker purchased a BAYC NFT in 2022 for approximately $241,000, according to reporting at the time.

As with Bieber's NFT, current valuation tracks with BAYC floor prices, 6.10 ETH on OpenSeam, which stands at just approximately $12,184 at today's trading prices.

Media personality Paris Hilton was among the celebrities who publicly embraced NFTs at the height of the boom, purchasing a BAYC for roughly $287,000 in 2021.

Famously, Hilton appeared on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where she and Fallon displayed their respective Bored Ape NFTs and discussed the emerging trend.

The segment has gone down in recent history one of the most visible mainstream endorsements of NFT culture during its peak.

Falling NFT trading volumes are frequently cited as evidence that the market has completely failed.

But analysts have cautioned that turnover alone can be a misleading gauge of underlying demand.

During the 2021–2022 boom, according to Dr. Efstathios Polyzos in a recent opinion piece for CCN, exceptionally high trading volumes were driven by rapid flipping and short-term momentum strategies.

In many cases, tokens changed hands multiple times within days or even hours as traders sought quick profits.

In today's market, which has massively decreased in terms of prices, OpenSea transaction records show that holding periods have lengthened since the market's peak.

While overall transaction counts have fallen sharply, remaining trades have reflected a matured market — focusing on longer investment strategies or specific use cases.

The retreat in Ethereum prices has also played a big part in the reduced NFT valuations of Logan Paul and other celebrities which publicly entered the arena.

Even when and if NFT floor prices hold steady in Ethereum terms, their dollar value is still fluctuating depending on the overall crypto market.

Ethereum is currently trading at around $2 935 below its 2021 peak, which is roughly 59.27% lower than that all‑time high.

In other words, during the NFT boom in 2021, Ethereum peaked around $4 953.73, versus about $2 017.76 now.

At the height of the boom, barriers to minting NFTs also fell dramatically.

By 2025, total NFT supply had ballooned to an estimated 1.34 billion tokens, roughly 25% higher year over year, as low-cost minting platforms made it easier than ever to launch new collections.

This rapid expansion and accessibility heavily diluted scarcity, a core pillar of what made NFT pricing models so valuable.

While early collections such as CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club benefited from limited supply and first-mover advantage, thousands of newer projects have struggled to maintain demand.

Total NFT sales revenue fell roughly 37% in 2025 to about $5.63 billion, down from approximately $8.9 billion in 2024, according to blockchain data.

By early 2026, overall NFT sales volumes remain an estimated 70% to 80% below peak levels reached during the speculative surge.

Nearly a year after launching a nationwide crypto payment system for tourists, merchants say hardly anyone is using it — raising questions about who the experiment really serves.

Nine months into its big push for cryptocurrency payments, Bhutan isn't finding many takers for its plans.

Last May, Bhutan became the first country to launch a nationwide crypto payment network for tourists. Visitors to the Himalayan kingdom could pay for their visas, flights, hotels, and meals in more than 100 cryptocurrencies via Binance. Within the first month of its launch, over 1,000 merchants signed up to receive payments in crypto.

Almost a year on, though, nothing much has changed on the ground.

In Thimphu, the QR codes displayed by local businesses to receive crypto payments gather dust. Several merchants have never had any customers opt for them.

“It has been four to five months, but no customer has used it until now,” Sonam Dorji, who works at Lotus Peak Enterprise, a handicraft store on the premises of the Le Meridien hotel, told Rest of World. “No one knows that we accept cryptocurrency and Binance Pay.”

Experts and locals said the government's push for cryptocurrency is driven by its own massive bitcoin reserves, and doesn't account for structural hurdles like power shortage and low literacy, which make the transition unlikely.

“Mining bitcoin gives [Bhutan] a currency to purchase imports that it didn't have before, so I understand why the political establishment in the country wants to go for digital payments,” Jay Zagorsky, a professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, told Rest of World. “However, just because the central bank is pushing Bhutan society toward digital payments does not make it sensible.”

Zagorsky is the author of The Power of Cash: Why Using Paper Money is Good For You and Society. The book argues that preserving physical money is essential to protect individual privacy, curb overspending, and prevent the economic exclusion of the world's most vulnerable populations.

The director of Bhutan's Department of Tourism, Damcho Rinzin, and DK Bank CEO Ugyen Tenzin did not respond to Rest of World's request for interviews or comment.

The Bhutanese government started mining bitcoin in 2019. Abundant rivers and mountainous terrain make hydroelectric power plentiful in the kingdom, and domestic consumption is low given its population of less than a million people. Bhutan uses the surplus electricity generated from renewable sources to power its crypto mining operations.

In October 2024, Bhutan's bitcoin reserves touched $1.4 billion, making it the biggest state-backed green-mined reserve in the world. Other countries with larger government reserves, like the U.S. and China, acquired bitcoin through purchases or asset seizures — or, in Ukraine's case, donations.

Countries with shaky infrastructures and low rates of literacy are not the best places for introducing new types of legal tender.”

Bhutan's infrastructure, however, does not support widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies for transactions. One-third of Bhutanese people are not literate — a necessary criterion to navigate digital payments, Zagorsky said. 

The country also suffers from an unstable power supply, which can make digital payments challenging. The typical customer deals with power cuts 19 times a year, due to causes that are only under the power companies' control, according to a government report. One-fifth of businesses in Bhutan own or share a ground generator, World Bank data shows.

“Using crypto as legal tender means items like bitcoin need to be accepted by all types of businesses, from large to very small, at all times for any debt,” Zagorsky said. “Countries with shaky infrastructures and low rates of literacy are not the best places for introducing new types of legal tender, especially when other small countries like El Salvador, who have tried it, did not see the experiment succeed.”

In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to make bitcoin legal tender — a decision it walked back in 2025 when the International Monetary Fund had to bail out the tanking economy.

The Central African Republic, which had made bitcoin legal tender in April 2022, also reversed the decision within a year after significant pressure from the IMF and World Bank. Compared to the Latin American country, it saw barely any adoption among its citizens, given low internet penetration and frequent power outages.

In one of Thimphu's oldest eateries, Ambient Cafe, owner Junnu Chhetri told Rest of World her establishment doesn't keep track of the daily usage of Binance. She said some guests — mostly foreigners — have used it.   

Experts say Bhutan isn't necessarily heading in the same direction as El Salvador and the Central African Republic. The current system instantly converts crypto payments to ngultrum for merchants. It's more of a gateway than a store of value, reducing risk and volatility.

“Initially, there was talk about expanding crypto payments to other sectors, but in practice, I haven't seen this happen in any significant way yet,” Ugyen Dendup, the co-founder of Bhutan's first AI startup NoMindBhutan, told Rest of World. “At the market or business level, tourism is the only sector where this conversation is visible, and even there, adoption remains limited.

”Dendup said there's nothing clearly written or formalized on paper regarding crypto laws or regulations in Bhutan. “It exists in a kind of gray area: Some people push for it, some are cautious, and enforcement or guidance isn't very clear,” he said. “Because of this, it's hard to say whether Bhutan is moving toward making bitcoin legal tender.”

American companies are staging boxing matches with VR-controlled Chinese humanoids to enthusiastic fans. A researcher says it is just robot theater.  

The crypto-based prediction platform is hiring Mandarin-speaking staff and adding Lunar New Year bets, even as it remains blocked in China.

Western automakers are chasing rare earth-free motors but China's cost advantage remains difficult to crack.

Integration aims to make food distribution transparent, leak-proof and beneficiary-centric

In a landmark move blending financial innovation with welfare delivery, the Government of India has launched a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)-based Digital Food Currency pilot in Gujarat, marking the first integration of programmable digital money into the Public Distribution System (PDS).

The pilot was inaugurated by Amit Shah in the presence of Prahlad Joshi, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, and Bhupendra Patel, along with senior state and central officials.

CBDC Integration: A Structural Upgrade to India's Food Security Architecture

Describing the initiative as a milestone reform, Prahlad Joshi said that integrating CBDC into the PDS architecture represents a decisive step toward transparency, efficiency and beneficiary empowerment. India's PDS — the world's largest food distribution network — serves over 80 crore beneficiaries. With the launch of the Digital Food Currency pilot, the government aims to further modernize the system through technology-led governance.

Under the new framework, digital coupons generated via the Reserve Bank of India will be credited directly to beneficiaries as programmable digital rupee (e₹). These coupons can be redeemed at Fair Price Shops (FPS) using QR codes or voucher codes for entitled foodgrain quantities. The programmable nature of the digital rupee ensures that funds can be used exclusively for foodgrain transactions, thereby minimizing misuse and enhancing accountability.

Addressing Biometric and Operational Challenges

Officials indicated that the CBDC-enabled system will reduce dependence on repeated biometric authentication and mitigate operational issues associated with e-POS devices. By generating a real-time, traceable digital trail of transactions, the platform enhances monitoring and oversight while simplifying the user experience for beneficiaries.

In addition, Fair Price Shop dealers will receive their margins in real time, improving cash flow efficiency and strengthening trust across the distribution chain. The digital wallet architecture ensures seamless transactions while reinforcing fiscal discipline within the system.

Pilot Rollout and Expansion Strategy

The pilot has been launched in collaboration with the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of Gujarat across selected districts — Ahmedabad, Anand, Valsad and Surat. Following its initial implementation, the program will expand to the Union Territories of Chandigarh, Puducherry, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu as part of a phased national rollout strategy.

Amit Shah described the initiative as an extension of the Digital India vision into welfare governance, noting that India now accounts for nearly half of the world's digital transactions. He emphasized that CBDC integration aligns with the government's “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance” approach by strengthening transparency and ensuring that beneficiaries receive their entitled foodgrains with greater awareness of their rights.

Building on a Decade of PDS Digitization

The CBDC pilot builds upon extensive digital reforms undertaken by the Department of Food and Public Distribution in recent years. These include end-to-end digitization of ration cards, nationwide portability under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) framework, Aadhaar-enabled e-POS authentication, and real-time supply chain monitoring through platforms such as Ann Chakra. Grievance redressal systems like Ann Sahayata have further strengthened citizen-centric accountability.

By embedding a sovereign digital payment layer into the PDS, the government is effectively closing the loop between entitlement, authentication, transaction and audit.

A New Template for Welfare Delivery

The pilot, which currently covers a limited number of beneficiaries, is positioned as a proof-of-concept for integrating programmable digital currency into large-scale welfare systems. If successful, it could redefine subsidy delivery mechanisms by replacing traditional cash or in-kind transfer inefficiencies with a secure, traceable and purpose-bound digital alternative.

With the slogan “Har Dana, Har Rupiya, Har Adhikar,” the initiative seeks to ensure that every grain, every rupee and every entitlement reaches its intended beneficiary. As the pilot scales up, it may offer a replicable governance model for other social protection schemes, positioning India at the forefront of digital public infrastructure innovation in welfare administration.

Macrophages are crucial in immune responses, tissue repair and homeostasis, making them prime candidates for translational applications. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell)-derived macrophages hold considerable promise for regenerative medicine, cancer therapy, inflammatory disease treatment and in vitro bioassays. However, cost-effective, standardized intermediate-scale bioreactor systems tailored for early-stage research and drug discovery in academia remain limited. Here, we present an extension of our previously published protocol that is feeder free, semi-defined and user friendly, enabling the standardized production of iPS cell-derived macrophages in an intermediate (10–50 mL)-scale benchtop bioreactor. This Protocol can be implemented by users with basic iPS cell culture experience without requiring advanced bioprocessing expertise. This method consists of two primary endpoints: the generation of mesoderm-primed aggregates with hematopoietic potential, termed hemanoids, and the standardized production of iPS cell-derived macrophages that are ready for downstream applications. This Protocol enables continuous macrophage generation in long-term cultures, with a minimum of five consecutive collections, yielding an average of 2–3 × 107 cells per collection per vessel. Four vessels operate independently, each with a maximum culture volume of up to 50 mL, while critical process parameters (CO2, temperature and pH) are monitored. This semi-automated platform and in-process monitoring improve process control, leading to higher yields, reproducibility and cell quality compared with other systems. The simplified process spans 24 d, starting from single-cell iPS cells to ready-to-use macrophages. By bridging the gap between small- and large-scale systems, this approach provides scalable, standardized manufacturing of iPS cell-derived macrophages, making it a valuable tool for academics focused on human immune cells such as macrophages.

This Protocol Extension details the standardized production of iPS cell-derived macrophages in an intermediate-scale benchtop bioreactor. This method is divided into two stages: the generation of mesoderm-primed aggregates with hematopoietic potential, termed hemanoids, and the standardized production of iPS cell-derived macrophages that are ready for downstream applications.

The use of standardized intermediate-scale bioreactor systems is tailored for early-stage research and drug discovery in academic and industrial settings.

The cellular nucleotide pool is a major focal point of the host immune response to viral infection. Immune effector proteins that disrupt the nucleotide pool enable animal and bacterial cells to broadly restrict diverse viruses, but reduced nucleotide availability induces cellular toxicity and can limit host fitness1,2,3,4,5. Here we identify Clover, a bacterial anti-phage defence system that overcomes this trade-off by encoding a deoxynucleoside triphosphohydrolase enzyme (CloA) that dynamically responds to both an activating phage cue and an inhibitory nucleotide immune signal produced by a partnering regulatory enzyme (CloB). Analysis of phage restriction by Clover in cells and reconstitution of enzymatic function in vitro demonstrate that CloA is a dGTPase that responds to viral enzymes that increase cellular levels of dTTP. To restrain CloA activation in the absence of infection, we show that CloB synthesizes a dTTP-related inhibitory nucleotide signal, p3diT (5′-triphosphothymidyl-3′5′-thymidine), that binds to CloA and suppresses activation. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of CloA in activated and suppressed states reveal how dTTP and p3diT control distinct allosteric sites and regulate effector function. Our results define how nucleotide signals coordinate both activation and inhibition of antiviral immunity and explain how cells balance defence and immune-mediated toxicity.

Organic batteries using abundant and recyclable organic electrode materials provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to commercial lithium-ion batteries1,2,3,4,5, which rely on resource-limited mineral-derived inorganic electrode materials6,7,8. However, the practical use of organic batteries has been severely hindered by the intrinsic insulation and dissolution of organic electrode materials9,10. Here we report practical organic batteries using an n-type conducting polymer cathode, poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO), which exhibits excellent mixed ionic and electronic transport and low solubility. The PBFDO cathode maintains its n-doped state throughout the electrochemical processes and exhibits stable and reversible redox characteristics, high electrical conductivities and significant lithium-ion diffusion coefficients, without the need for additional conductive additives. Consequently, ultrahigh-mass-loading polymer cathodes, with mass loadings up to 206 mg cm−2, are realized, delivering a high areal capacity of 42 mAh cm−2 and demonstrating robust cycling stability. Furthermore, practical 2.5 Ah lithium–organic pouch cells were fabricated, achieving an impressive energy density of 255 Wh kg−1. Notably, the conducting polymer cathode operates efficiently over a wide temperature range from −70 °C to 80 °C and demonstrates excellent flexibility and safety, marking considerable potential for applications in extreme conditions and wearable electronics.

Owing to the complexity of conducting polymer resonance and lithium-ion storage mechanisms, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the positions of counter-ions, only a schematic representation of one possible resonance pathway was provided here. The pristine PBFDO, with an n-doping level of around 90%, was first discharged to 1.5 V by lithium-ion uptake. During the subsequent charge process, lithium ions were extracted, while approximately half of protons were also removed, leaving the remaining protons preserved within PBFDO, which also contributed to PBFDO maintaining its n-doped state. Afterward, PBFDO experienced reversible electrochemical reactions, with some protonated carbonyl groups persisting, leading to a reversible capacity of 230.4 mAh g−1. b, XPS spectra of the PBFDO cathode at different charge/discharge states. c, Voltage profiles of the PBFDO cathode at 50 mA g−1 with marked voltages for the FTIR tests. d, FTIR spectra of the PBFDO cathode at different charge/discharge states as indicated in c. e, In situ Raman spectra of the PBFDO cathodes during charge/discharge processes.

Acral melanoma, which is not ultraviolet-associated, is the type of melanoma reported most commonly in several non-European-descent populations1,2,3, including in Mexican people4. Latin American samples are substantially under-represented in global cancer genomics studies5, which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures6,7,8. To address this, we characterized the genome and transcriptome of 123 acral melanoma tumours from 92 Mexican patients—a population notable because of its genetic admixture9. Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF, NRAS or NF1. Although most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations. The tumours with activating BRAF mutations had a transcriptional profile more similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, indicating that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared with other tumours arising in these locations. Transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with recurrence-free and overall survival. Our study enhances knowledge of this understudied disease and underscores the importance of including samples from diverse ancestries in cancer genomics studies.

Melanoma is classified into several clinicopathological subtypes on the basis of tumour site of presentation and histopathological features. Acral melanoma is an understudied melanoma subtype due to its low incidence globally, and because it represents a small proportion of melanoma cases in European-descent populations2,10; however, acral melanoma represents the vast majority of melanoma cases in some Latin American, African and Asian countries due to the lower incidences of ultraviolet-induced melanoma subtypes11. Furthermore, the causes of this type of disease are unknown, with patients managed in a similar way to ultraviolet-associated cutaneous melanoma. However, its site of presentation and genomic characteristics are vastly different12.

Acral melanoma arises on the glabrous (non-haired) skin of soles, palms and in the nail unit (subungual location), and its genome differs substantially from other cutaneous melanoma subtypes13. In contrast to ultraviolet-linked subtypes, acral melanoma has a lower burden of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), a higher burden of structural variants and a low prevalence of mutational signatures SBS7a/b/c/d, which are associated with ultraviolet irradiation14,15,16,17,18. Genes that are mutated frequently in cutaneous melanoma such as BRAF, the RAS genes and NF1, are reported to be altered at a significantly lower frequency in acral melanoma. This, coupled with the comparatively lower number of studies of acral melanoma when compared with other cutaneous melanoma subtypes, has translated into limited available therapies for acral melanoma management.

It is known that cancer risk and incidence, as well as tumour genomic profiles, vary with ancestry and geographical location6,19,20. As most genomic studies on acral melanoma have been performed on patients of European or Asian ancestry, we considered it necessary to examine the genomics of this subtype of melanoma in Latin American people. Specifically, Latin American populations have been substantially under-represented in cancer genomic studies, with only about 1% of all samples in cohorts such as the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other repositories, and those contributing to cancer genome-wide association studies, being of Latin American origin5,21,22. Identification of differences in the genomic profile among populations can potentially aid the discovery of germline/inherited or environmental factors related to acral melanoma aetiology, as well as identify optimal therapeutic strategies for all patients.

In this study, we analysed 123 acral melanoma samples from 92 Mexican patients through genotyping, exome sequencing, SNV and insertion/deletion (indel) variant calling, copy number estimation and gene expression profiling, and examined the correlation of these molecular characteristics with clinical variables. We reveal a significant correlation between genetic ancestry and BRAF somatic mutations, as well as a distinct transcriptomic profile in tumours with BRAF-activating mutations compared with samples without activating mutations in BRAF. We also identify significant differences in recurrence-free and overall survival among patients with tumours with distinct gene expression profiles.

A total of 123 uniformly ascertained samples from 92 patients from a large Mexican tertiary referral hospital were analysed in this study (Supplementary Table 1; Methods). Of these tumours, 89 were primaries, 27 were metastases, five were recurrences, one was a lesion in transit and one was unknown (Supplementary Table 1). Latin American genomes are generally a mixture of European, African and Amerindian ancestry. Of note, 90% of genotyped samples (n = 80) in this study had predominantly Amerindian ancestry (median 81%) (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2) with European and African ancestries contributing a median of 13.6% and 2.5%, respectively. The median age of the patients in this cohort was 60, with 59% of the patients being female. Most patients were stage III (American Joint Committee on Cancer, 8th edn)23 at diagnosis, and the most common primary site was the foot—most frequently the sole. The median Breslow thickness was 4.0 mm and most primary tumours were ulcerated (68%) (Table 1). It should be noted that only four patients received immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapy, due to lack of access.

Considering all 123 samples, acral melanoma tumours showed a SNV+indel (hereafter referred to as tumour mutational burden (TMB)) mean of 0.95 mutations per megabase and a median of 0.87 mutations per megabase (range, 0–3.49 mutations per megabase). When including only one sample per patient, with primaries being selected preferentially, the most frequently mutated genes were NRAS (14% of samples; Q-value < 4.97 × 10−10), KIT (14% of samples not counting deletions, as they are unlikely to be activating; Q-value = 4.97 × 10−10), BRAF (13%, Q-value = 3.86 × 10−7) and NF1 (9%, Q-value = 0.0001) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). Two of these samples had homozygous NF1 deletions, in addition to a further two secondary samples from other patients (Extended Data Fig. 1a). For BRAF, all mutations except one were V600E, with one L597R (Fig. 1b). These genes, which represent known drivers, were identified as being under positive selection (Methods) and exhibit mutual exclusivity (only one patient has tumours with mutations in more than one of these genes), which reflects their functional redundancy in activating the MAPK pathway. Separate capillary sequencing of the TERT promoter in 76 samples belonging to 64 patients identified that six carry the −124 promoter mutation (9.3%) and two out of 59 patients for which the −146 position was amplified successfully carry a mutation in this position (3.4%) (Supplementary Table 4). In total, we estimate that about 10.5% of patients have an activating TERT promoter mutation, which is similar to estimates in other studies15,24. All samples from all patients that had several samples sequenced and that could be assessed had a concordant TERT genotype, in agreement with an early emergence of this mutation during tumour evolution24. Other genes reported previously as mutated in other melanoma subtypes, as well as other cancer types are also mutated in this cohort, such as TP53, HRAS and KRAS (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2). In summary, the ‘classic' melanoma driver genes (N/H/KRAS, BRAF and NF1) are mutated in 40% of Mexican acral melanoma samples, with most of the samples in this cohort therefore being classified as ‘triple wild-type' melanomas. Apart from the known HRAS, SPRED1, TP53 and KRAS driver genes, we also find mutations in PTPRJ, ATM, NF2 and RDH5 (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Specifically, in those tumours without mutations in any of the abovementioned four driver genes (BRAF, NRAS, KIT, NF1, ‘quadruple wild type' (QWT)), we find two tumours each from different patients with deleterious mutations in ATM and RDH5 (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The mutations in these genes are all protein-changing and deleterious. All these genes have been linked previously to tumour suppressor activities in either acral or mucosal melanomas25,26,27,28,29,30, as well as other cancer types, and may represent low-frequency drivers. We also observe a significantly higher proportion of women versus men carrying mutations in driver genes (two-tailed Fisher's test P value = 0.003) (Supplementary Table 5). After adjusting for date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, ancestry and tumour stage, the odds ratio of having a mutation in a driver gene in female patients (compared with men) was estimated to be 3.83 (95% confidence interval, 1.32, 11.03) (multivariate logistic regression, P value = 0.013).

The estimate and its two-sided P value were obtained from the summary of the model. d, Barplot depicting the number and mutational classification of samples in different acral and cutaneous melanoma studies14,15,18,31,32,33,34.

When examining the relationship between ancestry and somatic profile, we identified significantly higher odds (P value = 0.02) of carrying a BRAF somatic mutation with increasing European ancestry in a linear model controlling for age at diagnosis, sex and total TMB (Fig. 1c). Patients with mutations in KIT showed a tendency for higher Amerindian ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 2). We also found that patients with NRAS mutations were younger at diagnosis (median and mean age of diagnosis for patients with NRAS mutations was 49 years and 50.84 years versus 63 years and 62.9 years without, respectively), but this effect is probably mediated by ulceration status, as patients with NRAS mutations have a significantly lower rate of ulceration (two-tailed Fisher's exact test P value = 0.016).

Out of 22 patients for whom we sequenced at least two different samples (for example, a primary and a metastasis), 13 were classified as NRAS/KIT/BRAF/NF1-mutated. For BRAF, all four patients have mutations across all samples and, for NRAS, three out of four patients have a NRAS mutation in both the primary and lymph node metastasis. These data indicate that these mutations appear as an early event in tumour evolution. For patients with KIT mutations, about half of the times the mutation is found in the primary and not in the metastasis. These data agree with those of Wang et al.24, and indicate that metastases are seeded before the appearance of these mutations (Supplementary Table 6).

Collectively, these results are similar to those reported in other acral melanoma studies14,15,18,31,32,33,34, with some important differences: first, the genetic composition of the patients in our study includes a high proportion of Native American ancestry, which is severely under-represented in already published cancer genomics studies and permits the identification of relationships of specific ancestries with somatic characteristics. In addition, the fraction of activating BRAF mutations is lower than in the studies with predominantly European-descent patients, and more similar to those with Asian patients, probably due to the positive relationship between BRAF mutation and European ancestry (Fig. 1d).

Somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) analysis across all samples showed a higher burden of amplifications than deletions (Fig. 2a). Examination of 47 samples, one per patient, that passed our stringent quality filtering for this type of analysis (Methods), showed that 18 regions were significantly amplified, and six regions were frequently deleted (Supplementary Table 7). About a quarter (11, 23%) of these 47 samples had whole genome duplication events (Supplementary Table 1). Potential driver genes in frequently amplified regions include TERT (43% of samples), CRKL (36%), GAB2 (30%) and CCND1 (28%) (Supplementary Tables 4 and 7–9). Regions that showed recurrent deletions contained genes such as CDKN2A, CDKN2B, ATM and TP53. Specifically, CDKN2A and CDKN2B had deletions in 59.6% of samples, with eight of them (out of 28) being homozygous deletions (Extended Data Fig. 1b; Methods), whereas ATM and TP53 both had deletions in 38% and 34% of samples, respectively. No association was found between ancestry and any of the significantly altered CNA regions.

SCNA profiles varied depending on whether samples had mutations in driver genes or were QWT. Specifically, samples with mutations in driver genes (n = 23) showed preferential amplification of NOTCH2 (P value = 0.036, two-tailed exact Fisher test) and 1q21.3, containing several genes (P value = 0.02), whereas CCND1 (P value = 0.049), and ARF6 and SOS2 (both in same amplification peak, P value = 0.048) were preferentially amplified in QWT tumours (n = 24). The 8p12 region, containing genes such as FGFR1 and TACC1, was found amplified only in five QWT samples, whereas several regions were found altered only in mutated tumours (Supplementary Tables 10–15 and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4).

When stratifying samples by mutational status (considering BRAF-, NRAS-, NF1-, KIT-mutated and multi-hit, which included one sample with mutations in more than one of these drivers), we did not observe any significant differences in SCNA among groups (measured by global copy number alteration score (GCS); Methods) (Fig. 2b,c). Considering all samples, those with NRAS, BRAF and NF1 mutations had the lowest median total TMB, whereas KIT-mutated and multi-hit tumours had the highest median total TMB (Supplementary Fig. 3). We found a significant correlation between GCS score and total TMB (Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient = 0.72; P value < 0.0001) (Fig. 2d). Tumours from the subungual region also had a higher median GCS score than those found on the feet (Fig. 2e).

Statistical significance was assessed using two-sided Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests.

Single-base substitution mutational signature analysis across 116 samples that carried at least one SNV revealed previously reported COSMICv.3.4 signatures SBS1, SBS5 and SBS40a (Extended Data Fig. 5). Apart from clock-like signatures SBS1 and SBS5 (ref. 35), SBS40a was also prevalent across the cohort, contributing 53.38% of mutations to the total (Supplementary Fig. 4). SBS40a is of unknown origin but was identified originally in kidney cancer and is present in many cancer types36. Copy number signature analysis identified a number of previously reported signatures across different samples (n = 60 samples; Methods)37,38. CN1, which has been associated with a diploid state and CN9, which is potentially caused by local loss of heterozygosity on a diploid background, dominated the copy number landscape (Extended Data Fig. 5; Methods). As expected, signatures related to chromothripsis (CN7, CN8) were also found in several samples across the cohort. The number of indels in the samples was too low to add meaningful information (average, 2.52 indels per sample), so signature analysis for indels was not performed. We similarly did not find any significant associations between ancestry and any mutational signature.

It has been postulated previously that BRAF-mutated acral melanomas might be more biologically similar to melanomas from non-acral sites than to other acral melanomas18,39; because of the observed correlation of European ancestry with BRAF mutation rate, we decided to investigate this hypothesis. We successfully extracted and sequenced RNA from 77 primary tumours from different patients (Supplementary Table 1; Methods). We then generated a gene signature-based score for identifying acral- versus cutaneous-derived melanomas. For this, we sourced a list of candidate genes from acral melanoma and cutaneous melanoma datasets (Supplementary Table 16; Methods) and identified 20 genes with high classification accuracy in a training cohort of ten primary acral melanomas (used to derive a v-mel score, or ‘A' for acral) and ten primary cutaneous melanomas (used to derive a c-mel score, or ‘C' for cutaneous) recruited at the University of Utah (Fig. 3a,b). We then obtained scores (v-mel/c-mel, or A:C) for samples in our dataset of acral melanomas, separating primary tumours with BRAF-activating mutations (n = 10) versus BRAF-wild-type (n = 67) tumours. We observed a difference between BRAF-activating and BRAF-wild-type tumours (P value = 0.045), with BRAF-activating tumours having a score closer to cutaneous melanomas (Fig. 3c, left panel). We then replicated this analysis in an independent cohort of 63 acral melanomas from Newell et al.15 (BRAF-activating n = 10, wild type n = 53), which further confirmed these results (P value = 0.039) (Fig. 3c, right panel). Therefore, we explored the possibility that this difference could be due to downstream mutated BRAF signalling. First, we replicated this analysis in the TCGA cutaneous melanoma data, finding no significant differences among BRAF and non-BRAF-mutated samples (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We then examined datasets in which mutant BRAF was introduced into primary melanocytes in a doxycycline-inducible manner40. We found that the c-mel signature genes were not activated downstream of mutant BRAF, further indicating that the classifier does not simply reflect BRAF-driven transcriptional changes (Fig. 3d). Using a recently developed method for assessing gene signature similarity41, we compared the c-mel gene signature from our classifier to a previously published set of genes directly activated by mutant BRAF in melanoma cells42. We found no significant correlation between these signatures (Extended Data Fig. 6b).

In conclusion, in these comparisons, BRAF-activating tumours expressed a more ‘cutaneous melanoma-like' transcriptional program. This result indicates that BRAF-mutated melanomas that occur at acral sites are transcriptionally closer to non-acral cutaneous melanomas, a transcriptional program that is not explained by BRAF downstream signalling, and are associated with increasing European genetic ancestry.

We then applied a more stringent quality filter, including coverage and alignment features, to primary tumours in this collection with 44 samples remaining for further analyses (Supplementary Table 1; Methods). Consensus clustering of gene expression identified three sample groups, expressing different gene modules (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 17; Methods). Cluster 1 was characterized by an epidermal/immune profile module, with high expression of keratin genes (for example, KRT1 and KRT9), cytokines (for example, CXCL16, IL7, IL4R, IL1R, IL15RA and CXCL14) and processes such as epidermis development, cell–cell junction organization and wound healing (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 18). Cluster 2 expressed higher levels of a mitotic/proliferative-related signature, with high expression of genes such as MITF and TYR, and processes such as chromosome segregation, nuclear division and mitochondrial translation (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 19). Cluster 3 showed expression of a gene module characterized by respiration and oxidative phosphorylation-related genes (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 20). Cluster 1 was associated with better prognostic clinical characteristics, such as a smaller proportion of ulcerated samples (53% versus 93% in cluster 2 and 57% in cluster 3), a tendency for earlier clinical stages and lower mitotic rates (Mann–Whitney U cluster 1 versus cluster 2 P-value: 0.041, cluster 1 versus cluster 3 P-value: 0.052) (Fig. 4c). Deconvolution of gene expression profiles also indicated differences in immune cell infiltration composition, with cluster 1 having a higher proportion of CD4+ T cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cluster 2 having a higher proportion of B cell infiltration (Fig. 4d–f, Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 21).

Individual data points are plotted as dots. For c–f, two-sided Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney paired tests were performed. For c–f, 14 samples are included in cluster 1, 16 samples in cluster 2 and 14 in cluster 3.

Next, we evaluated whether the genomic and transcriptomic characteristics had any impact on patient overall or recurrence-free survival. We included in the analysis those participants whose primary could be analysed (n = 85; Methods). The mean time between diagnosis and recruitment was 2.01 years, including 21 participants recruited within 6 months; the range was from a few days to more than 10 years. Among these participants, 12 primary tumours had an NRAS mutation, 11 had a mutation in KIT, 11 had a BRAF mutation, seven had NF1 mutations, one had multiple hits and 43 were classified as QWT.

Carrying any driver mutation was not associated with age at diagnosis or tumour stage (data not shown). Having a tumour with a driver mutation was, however, associated with a reported recurrence, with 66.7% of mutated tumours having a recurrence as compared with 37.2% of QWT tumours (Pearson two-tailed Chi-squared test P value = 0.007). After adjusting for date of diagnosis, sex, age at diagnosis, ancestry and tumour stage (n = 73, primaries with ancestry information available), the odds ratio for a mutated tumour having a recurrence compared with QWT tumours was 5.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.56, 18.12), (multivariate logistic regression, P value = 0.008) (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 22). Notably, among the mutated tumours, for each different gene, tumour recurrence was increased over QWT tumours (Fig. 5a), most notably for NF1, where all seven of the mutated tumours recurred.

Each panel indicates the crude survival curves as indicated. Parametric analyses are derived from the same sample adjusted for the relevant covariates. The centre of each error bar is the estimated cumulative survival (recurrence-free or alive proportion) to that time point, and the bars represent its 95% confidence interval (CI). All reported P values are two-sided. NS, not significant.

Overall, 44 of the tumours could be classified transcriptomically into one of the three clusters. There was no association between tumour driver mutation and transcriptomic cluster (data not shown). There was, however, evidence of differences in recurrence frequency by cluster, with 35.7% of cluster 1 tumours, 81.2% of cluster 2 tumours and 57.1% of cluster 3 tumours having a recurrence (Fisher's exact test, P value = 0.04 for homogeneity). Logistic regression adjusting for age at diagnosis, sex, diagnosis date and stage at presentation showed that those tumours from cluster 2 had a higher rate of recurrence as compared with cluster 1 (odds ratio = 6.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.97, 46.27), multivariate logistic regression, P value = 0.054; Supplementary Table 23), whereas cluster 3 had intermediate rates of recurrence (Fig. 5b).

Fifteen participants (17.6%) died during the study period; 9% of participants with QWT tumours and 26.2% of participants with tumours with driver mutations died (P value = 0.042 for homogeneity). Log rank analysis of time to death from diagnosis showed a tendency for an increased risk of death among those with any mutation (P value = 0.077) (Supplementary Table 24), whereas similar analysis by specific mutation showed more extreme significance (P value = 0.0006) (Supplementary Table 25). Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusting for age, sex, tumour stage and ancestry indicated participants whose tumour had any mutation in a driver gene had a tendency for an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 3.19, 95% confidence interval, 0.8, 12.74; P value = 0.1), although this was not conventionally significant (Supplementary Table 26) (Fig. 5c).

Finally, survival analysis based on the 44 tumours with transcriptomic classification showed significant variation between the clusters, with 0% of cluster 1, 43.7% of cluster 2 and 21.4% of cluster 3 having died (log-rank P value = 0.011, Pearson two-tailed Chi-squared P value = 0.017), again in keeping with the analysis of recurrence, a known main risk factor for survival (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 27). Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusting for age at diagnosis, sex, stage at presentation and ancestry did not provide significant evidence of differences between the clusters in terms of mortality rates, in keeping with the limited sample size.

In this study, we report the analysis of the somatic and transcriptomic profile of 123 acral melanoma samples from Mexican patients—one of the largest cohorts reported for this type of cancer. In our view, this study helps address several research gaps: (1) the underrepresentation of samples of Latin American ancestry in cancer sample repositories5: as shown previously, genetic ancestry and environment influence the somatic profile of tumours, with potential impacts on patient management and treatment6,19,20; (2) the relative lack of studies of acral melanoma, when compared with other types of the disease, as this type of melanoma constitutes most reported cases in some non-European populations11, and (3) the relative paucity of genomic studies performed and directed from low- and middle-income countries such as Mexico.

Most patients in this study had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, which allowed us to perform an analysis of genetic ancestry correlates with somatic mutation profile. We identified a positive correlation between European ancestry and BRAF mutation rate (Fig. 1c). A possible link between European ancestry and BRAFV600E mutation had been described previously18, and this study provides further confirmatory evidence. Other similar correlations have been described recently for other types of cancer, such as a positive relationship between Native American ancestry and EGFR mutation rate in lung cancer20, and an increased rate of somatic FBXW7 in African patients compared with European patients6. In accordance with this observation, other cohorts of acral melanoma, which studied patients with predominantly European ancestry, have a higher BRAF mutation rate than that in this study (for example, 23% in Australian patients with predominantly European ancestry15). These observations should provide the basis for future studies exploring the relationships between ancestry and somatic mutation rate.

We were intrigued to discover that acral melanomas with BRAF-activating mutations exhibit a more ‘cutaneous melanoma-like' transcriptome than other genetic subtypes of acral melanoma. One possible explanation is that this gene signature is uniquely downstream of a BRAF missense mutation. However, in further analyses, we do not see evidence for this explanation (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6). An alternative explanation involves the distinct origins of acral melanomas with BRAF-activating mutations compared with other acral melanomas. In our previous work43, we identified distinct subclasses of human epidermal melanocytes: a common type enriched in limbs (c-type) and a rare type enriched in volar regions (v-type). We observed that most acral melanomas generally retained a transcriptional signature such as v-type melanocytes, whereas a subset seemed more akin to c-type melanocytes43. The current work indicates that these tumours are more likely to belong to the BRAF-activating genetic subtype, indicating that a subset of volar melanomas might be classified more accurately by cell of origin and/or genetic profile as non-acral cutaneous melanoma, rather than bona fide acral melanomas. It is important to clarify that the hypothesis that acral melanomas may arise from different cells of origin is not based solely on this study but is also supported by previous work. Our previous research has demonstrated transcriptional diversity among melanocytes in different anatomic locations, including distinct populations of epidermal melanocytes in the palms and soles43. Furthermore, our zebrafish model studies have shown that acral melanoma-associated drivers preferentially (although not exclusively) induce tumours in the limbs (fins), whereas cutaneous melanoma-associated BRAF mutations lead preferentially (but not exclusively) to tumours in the trunk44. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that BRAF mutations selectively drive hyperproliferation in less-pigmented primary human melanocytes40. Therefore, although our additional analyses do not strongly support an oncogene signature as the explanation for the differences in transcriptional scores, thus favouring the cell-of-origin hypothesis, it is possible that, in some cases, these two phenomena could be intertwined. For example, recent data have shown that some acral melanomas harbouring amplifications of the CRKL oncogene depend on HOX13 positional identity programs already present in the cell of origin, indicating that oncogenes and cell-of-origin programs can synergize44. Future studies could explore the diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma as acral versus non-acral based on molecular signatures rather than solely on anatomic location. The fact that BRAF-mutated tumours occur less frequently on patients of non-European ancestry highlights the need to study a diverse set of samples to maximize clinical benefit to all patients.

Patients with cluster 1 tumours showed better prognosis than other patients, which is not surprising given their associated clinical characteristics (lower Breslow thickness, a tendency for earlier stages at diagnosis and lower mitotic indexes). However, what may be surprising is the gene expression profile characteristic of this cluster. More CAFs and CD4+ T cells were found by deconvolution to be associated to cluster 1, signatures commonly associated with immunosuppression. A possible explanation is that early-stage tumours are associated with immunosuppressive microenvironments—a balance which, in later tumours, may have been tilted in favour of tumour cell growth. Another potential explanation may involve the recently described roles of CAFs in immunostimulation45. Patients with cluster 2 tumours, with a proliferative signature and expression of pigmentation genes showed the worst survival. It has been observed previously in a zebrafish model and in TCGA samples that a pigmentation signature also predicts worse survival46 and, in a recent report by Liu and collaborators31, acral melanoma tumours with a proliferative signature also were associated with worse survival than other tumours. This study both extends and replicates these findings in acral melanoma.

This study has several limitations, regarding the nature of the samples (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)), and the stringent mutation and copy calling methodology, selected to mitigate artefacts at the cost of sensitivity. This study was also done using whole-exome data, which limits our ability to call mutations in non-coding regions of the genome. There are other challenges of setting up such a study. For instance, the fact that the year of diagnosis preceded the date of recruitment by up to 10 years means that somatic mutations associated with higher mortality rates would be under-represented among those recruited, whereas survival is probably extended over a similarly sized cohort of prospectively recruited cases. To assess the impact of any biases on our interpretation of the impact of mutations, we performed an analysis with only those tumours diagnosed after mid-2016, that is, those closest to the time of recruitment (Methods), obtaining similar results.

All tumours included in this study were confirmed as melanomas arising from glabrous skin. Our data indicate that tumours harbouring BRAF mutations may constitute a distinct subtype, sharing characteristics with superficial spreading and acral melanoma. These findings would have implications for patient selection in clinical trials evaluating new therapies for acral melanoma. Overall, we were able to identify new associations of the germline and somatic profile in acral melanoma, genomic-clinical correlates of overall and recurrence-free survival, as well as transcriptional differences in BRAF-mutated acral melanomas. This study shows the value of studying diverse populations, allowing us to uncover previously unreported relationships and better understand tumour evolution.

A flowchart describing the analyses, steps and number of samples used in each individual section can be found in Supplementary Fig. 5.

The protocol for sample collection was approved by the Mexican National Cancer Institute's (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, INCan, México) Ethics and Research committees (017/041/PBI;CEI/1209/17) and the United Kingdom's National Health Service (18/EE/00076). Patient samples collected for the Utah cohort analysis were derived as described previously47.

Recruitment of patients and sample collection took place from 2017 to 2019. Patients attending follow-up appointments at INCan who had previously been diagnosed with acral melanoma were offered the chance to participate in this study and, upon signing a written consent form, were asked to provide access to a FFPE sample of their tumour tissue that had been kept at the INCan tumour bank, as well as a saliva or normal adjacent tissue sample. Patients provided samples and their clinical data in Excel format with written informed consent. FFPE samples underwent inspection by a medical pathologist to establish whether sufficient tumour tissue was available for exome sequencing. Saliva samples were collected using the oragene DNA kit (DNAGenotek, catalogue no. OG-500).

DNA extraction from all saliva samples was performed at the International Laboratory for Human Genome Research from the National Autonomous University of México (LIIGH-UNAM) using the reagent prepITL2P (DNAGenotek, catalogue no. PT-L2P) and the All-Prep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, catalogue no. 80224). DNA and RNA extraction from FFPE samples was performed at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (UK) using the All-prep DNA/RNA FFPE Qiagen kit. Samples with >0.1 ng μl−1 were sequenced through the Sanger Institute's standard pipeline. Saliva and adjacent tissue samples were used for whole-exome sequencing, and only saliva samples were used for genotyping.

Genotyping was performed using Illumina's Infinium Multi-Ethnic AMR/AFR-8 v.1.0 array at King's College London and Infinium Global Screening Array v.3.0 at University College London. Sufficient germline DNA was available for genotyping for 80 out of 92 samples (86.9%). Ancestry estimation was performed using PLINK v.1.9, and ADMIXTURE48 v.1.3.0 for unsupervised analysis together with the superpopulations of the 1000 Genomes dataset49. Five superpopulations were identified, corresponding to AFR (Q1), AMR (Q2), SAS (Q3), EAS (Q4) and EUR (Q5) (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

FFPE samples, saliva and normal adjacent tissue underwent whole-exome sequencing as follows: Exome capture was performed using Agilent SureSelect AllExon v.5 probes and paired-end sequencing was performed at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (UK) in Illumina HiSeq 4000 machines. Control and tumour samples were sequenced to a mean coverage of 43.72×. Alignment was done using BWA-mem50 v.0.7.17, using the GRCh38 reference genome. Sequencing quality filters were performed using Samtools v.1.9 stats51 and fastqc v.0.11.3 (ref. 52). Sample contamination was estimated using the GATK v.4.2.3.0 tool CalculateContamination53. Concordance between sample pairs was estimated using the Conpair v.0.2 tool54. Samples that had less than 90% similarity with their pair (tumour-normal) or showed a level of contamination above 5% were excluded from the study. After this step, 123 samples remained for further analysis.

The nature of our samples (FFPE) may introduce artefacts that affect our ability to identify SNVs and indels accurately. Therefore, to mitigate this risk and increase specificity, we used three different variant calling tools, albeit at the cost of reduced sensitivity. As formalin fixation can generate DNA fragmentation, this may also affect copy number estimation analyses and, consequently, copy number mutational signature analysis. To mitigate this, we stringently filtered the samples used for this analysis, which affected our statistical power due to a reduced sample size.

Somatic variant calling was done using three different tools (cgpCaVEMan55 v.1.15.2, Mutect2 (ref. 56) v.4.1.0.0 and Varscan2 (ref. 57) v.2.3.9), keeping only the variants identified by a minimum of two out of the three tools. SmartPhase v.1.2.1 (ref. 58) was used for variant pairs phasing. VCF handling was done using bcftools v.1.9 (ref. 59). For BRAFV600E mutations, we kept these variants even if they were identified by only one of the tools as its oncogenicity and relevance in melanoma is well known. When available within the variant calling tool, strand bias filters were applied. A minimum base quality score of 30 on the Phred scale was used. Indel calling was performed using cgpPindel60,61 v.1.15.2. When selecting one sample per patient, preference was given to primaries, and metastases or recurrences were chosen only when a primary had not been collected.

Significantly mutated genes were identified using the tool dNdScv62 v.0.0.1.0 with default parameters using SNVs identified by two of the three tools used for variant calling and indels identified by pindel as input data. Positive selection was considered for genes that had global Q values below 0.1 according to the dNdScv tool recommendations. Visualization of variants was done using Maftools v.2.2.10 (ref. 63).

Two lymph node metastasis samples (one from a patient that had a BRAFV600E mutation and another one with an NRAS mutation) and their primaries were annotated as having the same mutation for follow-up analysis after manual inspection using IGV64.

Statistical tests were performed to identify potential clinical and ancestry covariates that correlated with driver mutational status. For tumour stage, sex, ulceration status and tumour site, which are discrete variables, association was tested with contingency Chi-squared tests.

For each of the four driver genes, a logistic regression model was fitted to predict the presence or absence of a mutation on the acral melanoma samples using the inferred ADMIXTURE48 cluster related to the European ancestry component from the 1000 Genomes Project, correcting for age, sex and total TMB (total TMB, SNVs + indels), as such: driver gene status ~ EUR related cluster proportion + age + sex + total TMB. The log odds related to the EUR cluster were then plotted with their respective confidence intervals. The models were constructed using 80 samples out of the 92, which were those with available genotyping information and with all tested covariables available.

Sequenza65 v.3.0.0 and ASCAT66 v.3.1.2 were used to estimate ploidy and purity values for each sample. These values per sample were compared between the two tools, and samples that had a high discrepancy in their purity estimates (less than 0.15 versus 1, respectively) were filtered out (Supplementary Table 28). Samples with an estimated goodness of fit below 95 were also filtered out. Subsequently, copy number, cellularity and ploidy values estimated by ASCAT were used in follow-up analyses. Whole genome duplication events were assigned as reported by ASCAT. Regions significantly affected by CNAs were identified using GISTIC2 (ref. 67) v.2.0.23. Amplifications were classified as low-level amplifications when regions had a copy number gain above 0.25 and below 0.9, and as high-level amplifications when regions had a copy number gain above 0.9 according to GISTIC2 values; deletions were classified as low-level deletions when regions had a copy number change between −0.25 and −1.3 and as high-level deletions when regions had a copy number change lower than −1.3. Only peaks with residual Q values < 0.1 were considered as significantly altered. For the analyses of differences in CNA burden by sample group (mutational status or site of presentation), we used the CNApp tool68 to generate GCS, focal copy number alteration scores and broad copy number alteration scores, calculating segment means (seg.mean) as log2(cn/ploidy) and using default parameters. GCS is a number quantifying the copy number aberration level in each sample provided by the CNApp tool68. Higher GCS scores indicate a higher burden of copy number aberrations compared with all other samples in the cohort. GCS is the sum of the normalized broad copy number alteration score and focal copy number alteration score, which are calculated considering broad (chromosome and arm-level) and focal (weighted focal CNAs corrected by the amplitude and length of the segment) aberrations per sample. These values are calculated using as input the number of DNA copies normalized by sample ploidy. A more detailed explanation can be found in the original publication68. GCS values were used for comparisons between sample groups. All paired comparisons between groups were evaluated with a Mann–Whitney test.

To further scrutinise the presence of deletions in tumour suppressors NF1 and CDKN2A, we used CNVkit69 v.0.9.10. We called copy number alterations against a pooled reference generated from the highest quality normal samples, and generated bin-level and segmented level log2 ratios. We calculated the log2 ratio estimated for homozygous deletions for each sample based on ASCAT's estimation of ploidy and purity as published previously25. For NF1—a large gene—we considered homozygous focal deletions when at least two contiguous bins had log2 ratios at or below the calculated threshold for that sample, or at least one full exon has read coverage equal to zero. For CDKN2A—a small gene—we considered a sample as having a homozygous deletion if it had at least one bin below the threshold, at least two other bins close to the threshold and a noticeable difference in log2 ratios for bins falling in CDKN2A in comparison with its neighbours by manual scrutiny.

Mutational matrices were generated using SigProfilerMatrixGenerator70 v.1.2.20. These matrices, with single nucleotide mutations found by at least two of the three variant callers and all insertions and deletions identified by cgpPindel, were used as input for mutational signature extraction using SigProfilerExtractor71 v.1.1.23 and decomposition to COSMICv.3.4 (ref. 72) reference mutational signatures72. For single base substitutions, the standard SBS-96 mutational context was used, with default parameters and a minimum and maximum number of output signatures being set as one and five, respectively. A total of 116 samples with an SNV count > 0, were used for this analysis. For copy number signature analysis, all 60 samples with available copy number data were used with default parameters, and using the standard CN-48 context from COSMICv.3.4.

Total RNA library preparation followed by exome capture using Agilent SureSelect AllExon v.5 was performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000 machines. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome using the splice-aware aligner STAR73 v.2.5.0. Of these, we focused on the 77 samples that came from different patients, that had matching DNA and were primaries for the score analysis (see below). We then applied further quality control filters for the consensus clustering analysis: samples were excluded if total read counts were fewer than 25 million, or if the sum of ambiguous reads and no feature counts was greater than the sum of all gene read pair counts. Forty-four samples remained for downstream analysis. Counts were generated with HTSeq74 v.0.7.2. Transcripts per million normalization was performed and values were log2(transcripts per million + 1) transformed.

Patient samples collected for the Utah cohort analysis were derived as described previously47. Invasive acral and non-acral cutaneous melanomas were identified and collected as part of the University of Utah IRB umbrella protocol no. 76927, Project no. 60, and RNA was extracted and quantified as described previously47. A custom NanoString nCounter XT CodeSet (NanoString Technologies) was designed to include genes differentially expressed between glabrous and non-glabrous melanocytes43,44. Sample hybridization and processing were performed in the Molecular Diagnostics core facility at Huntsman Cancer Institute. Data were collected using the nCounter Digital Analyzer. Raw NanoString counts were normalized using the nSolver Analysis Software (NanoString Technologies). Normalization was carried out using the geometric mean of housekeeping genes included in the panel (Supplementary Table 16). Background thresholding was performed using a threshold count value of 20. Fold change estimation was calculated by partitioning by acral versus cutaneous melanoma. The log2 normalized gene expression data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) using the PCA function in Prism v.10.2.1 (GraphPad Software). PCA was performed to identify the main sources of variability in the data and to distinguish between acral and cutaneous samples.

To determine the top differentially expressed genes contributing to the variance between acral melanomas and cutaneous melanomas, the loadings of the second principal component (PC2) were examined. Genes with the highest positive and negative loadings on PC2 were selected as the top ten and bottom ten genes, respectively; log2 expression values of these genes were used to generate a multiplicative score, producing the ratio of acral to cutaneous melanocyte genes. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism v.10.2.1 (GraphPad Software). Differences in acral to cutaneous ratios were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U test.

The acral:cutaneous (A:C) ratio was calculated for each of the 77 primary acral tumours using the method described above after batch correction (limma v.3.64.1, ref. 75) on normalized and transformed expression data processed by the R package DESeq2 v.1.48.1 (ref. 76). Differences in the A:C gene expression ratio scores between BRAF-activating mutation-positive and BRAF-wild-type acral melanoma samples were assessed using a Mann–Whitney U test. The same normalization, scoring method and statistical testing was applied to the 63 transcriptomes from acral melanoma tumours considering BRAF-activating (n = 10) and wild type (n = 53) in Newell et al.15. All available samples in this cohort were used, as only one primary had a BRAF mutation. Only samples with BRAF-activating mutations (V600E and L597R for the Mexican acral melanoma set) were included in the BRAF group.

To determine whether the cutaneous melanoma classifier genes are induced by BRAFV600E signalling in melanocytes, we analysed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from McNeal et al.40, which consisted of bulk-RNA-seq of primary human melanocytes transduced with BRAFV600E and cultured under two conditions: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and endothelin-1 (ET1). We extracted normalized expression values for cutaneous melanoma classifier genes across four conditions: PMA, PMA + BRAFV600E, ET1 and ET1 + BRAFV600E. Normalized expression levels were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test in Prism v.10.2.1 (GraphPad Software).

We evaluated the A:C classifier in clinical melanoma samples using RNA-seq data from TCGA Skin Cutaneous Melanoma Firehose Legacy cohort. Normalized gene expression data were downloaded from cBioPortal77. Samples were classified as BRAF-activating or BRAF-wild type in the same way as for Fig. 3c. We calculated the product of the expression of cutaneous melanoma classifier genes for each category. Differences were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U test.

We used an interactive Shiny application, What Is My Melanocytic Signature (WIMMS; https://wimms.tanlab.org)41 to compare transcriptional programs associated with distinct melanocytic cell states. WIMMS classifies melanocytic gene expression profiles by aggregating previously published gene expression signatures and clusters them into seven principal cell state categories. We input our gene signature into WIMMS to assess correlation with these reference states. The resulting dendrogram (Extended Data Fig. 6b) represents the relationship between our classifier-derived cutaneous melanoma genes and known signatures.

To identify molecular subgroups based on transcriptome data, we performed consensus clustering using the Cola R v.2.10.1 package78. Standard preprocessing of the input matrix was performed, including removal of rows in which more than 25% of the samples had ‘NA' (not available) values, imputation of missing values, replacement of values higher than the 95th percentile or less than 5th by corresponding percentiles, removal of rows with zero variance and removal of rows with variance less than the 5th percentile of all row variances. Consensus clustering was performed using several algorithms (k-means, partitioning around medoids, hierarchical clustering) and feature selection methods (s.d., median absolute deviation, coefficient of variation) to ensure robust partition identification. The optimal number of clusters was determined using several stability metrics including 1-PAC (Proportion of Ambiguous Clustering) score, concordance and index, Jaccard index, coefficient and visual inspection of the consensus matrix through heatmaps visualizations. The best-performing method (s.d.:partitioning around medoids with k = 3) was selected based on highest consensus scores and biological interpretability.

Following sample clustering, we performed a two-level signature analysis to characterize both sample clusters and gene co-expression modules.

Characterization of sample clusters was performed by identifying genes with significantly different expression across the three identified sample groups using F-tests with false discovery rate correction (P < 0.05). For each differentially expressed gene, we determined the sample cluster with highest mean expression to characterize the molecular profiles of patient subgroups.

To understand co-expression patterns within signature genes, we applied k-means clustering (k = 3) to group signature genes based on their scaled expression profiles across the three sample clusters. This identified gene modules (M1, M2, M3) representing distinct biological programs that may be co-ordinately regulated across different sample subtypes (Supplementary Tables 17–20).

Functional enrichment was performed separately for each gene module using over-representation analysis with the clusterProfiler R package v.4.12.6 (ref. 79). Gene Ontology Biological Process terms were tested using the hypergeometric test with Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate correction (Q < 0.05). Ensembl gene identifiers were mapped to gene symbols using the org.Hs.eg.db v.3.19.1 (ref. 80) annotation package before enrichment analysis (Supplementary Tables 17–20).

The EPIC algorithm81 v.1.1.7 was used in the R programming environment to perform deconvolution to infer immune and stromal cell fractions within acral melanoma tumours. We used the TRef signature method with default parameters, which includes gene expression reference profiles from tumour-infiltrating cells. The algorithm generated an absolute score that could be interpreted as a cell fraction.

Consenting and recruitment of patients started in 2017 and ended in 2019. Because of the challenges of recruiting sufficient numbers of participants with acral melanoma, patients diagnosed in earlier years who were still attending follow-up clinics for primary or recurrent disease were recruited. To ensue data consistency, only participants with a primary available for analysis were the subject of focus on analyses of recurrence and/or death (n = 85 patients). In total, 73 participants were recruited whose primary and ancestry data were available for analysis on driver mutations. A total of 44 patients with primary and RNA cluster data available were used for analysis on clusters regardless of their ancestry data availability. Analyses were performed with Stata v.19.5 (ref. 82).

To compare the effect of distinct driver mutations and the RNA clusters, we examined two measures of disease severity: (1) the recurrence of the primary tumour and (2) overall survival. For recurrence, we examined time to recurrence using a life-table approach from date of primary diagnosis onwards as a descriptor, and based analyses of differences between mutations (and clusters) on logistical regression adjusting for date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, sex, stage at diagnosis (advanced/early), ancestry (only for mutations) and time from diagnosis through either death or last known to be alive. Primary tumours were either classified as QWT or mutated for known drivers; tumours with several driver mutations were classified as ‘multi-hit'. We also conducted analyses based on a binary exposure of ‘QWT' or ‘Mutated' tumour based on the existence of one or more mutations in a known driver gene.

For survival analysis, we also included a life-table approach, again as a descriptor, based on time from diagnosis through to date of death or date last known to be alive. Statistical assessment of the effect of each mutation and/or cluster were based on Cox proportional hazard analysis with follow-up starting from date of recruitment through to date of death (or last date alive) adjusting for date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, sex and ancestry (as a sensitivity analysis). Analysis of combined mutations were also conducted as for the recurrence analysis.

To assess the impact of any biases on our interpretation of the impact of mutations, we restricted attention to the 40 tumours diagnosed since the beginning of 2017, that is, those closest to the time of recruitment. Analysis of survival gave qualitatively and quantitatively similar results to those reported above; in total, 7 of 23 (30.4%) of cases with mutated tumours had died, as opposed to 1 of 17 among cases with QWT tumours (P value = 0.055). In the analysis of recurrence, again results matched with 70.0% of cases with mutated tumours recurring (16 of 23 cases) compared with 17.7% of QWT tumours (3 of 17; P value = 0.001). Results for the RNA clusters were similar to the results quoted above for both survival and recurrence.

Data formatting and handling were performed using Python and R.

Each row represents one sample, with the left panel displaying the whole chromosome and the right panel a close up view at the gene region. Each point represents a bin as calculated by the CNVkit algortihm, the x-axis represents chromosomal position and the y-axis the log2 ratio calculated with CNVkit. Red dots indicate bins falling in the gene region. The purple dotted line represents the expected log2 ratio for a homozygous deletion (Methods). The orange lines represent segmented data. a) NF1 gene. PD40986d and PD41020d are secondary samples and a different sample was selected as representative for these patients. b) CDKN2A region.

a) Oncoplot depicting the seven most mutated genes according to dNdScv and five selected genes based on mutational frequency and biological function. Mutational classification, sample type, tumour stage, sex, age at diagnosis, ulceration status, tumour site and mutational spectra are shown by sample. Primary samples were selected preferentially for this analysis. One sample where no mutations were detected is not depicted in the oncoplot. b) Mutations found in PTPRJ, ATM, NF2 and RDH5, for which all mutations are deleterious and are found altered each in two samples.

All depicted regions have been identified by GISTIC2 analysis per group of samples. Statistically significant differences are marked in colour, green = amplified in mutated tumours, red = amplified in QWT, yellow = deleted in mutated tumours, blue = deleted in QWT tumours. Differences are determined first by assessing the global GISTIC2 output and determining differences between groups by one-sided Fisher's exact test (P-value < 0.05). If a region is not found in the global GISTIC2 output, but it is found only in the analysis per group, we have indicated it as statistically different. Number of mutated tumours = 23, number of QWT tumours = 24.

Top panel. Number of significant regions altered by sample. Bottom panel. Binary heatmap showing the significantly altered regions identified by GISTIC2 per sample. One sample per patient is shown. Heatmap is ordered on the X axis by mutational classification and on the Y axis by frequency of alterations per region. As a note, sample PD41002a does not show a deletion in CDKN2A (Deletion peak 3) by GISTIC2 analysis, but a deletion was detected by CNVkit (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1).

a) The SNV component of tumour mutational burden per sample. b-c) Proportions of mutational signatures per sample are shown in stacked bars for single base substitutions (b), and copy-number aberrations (c). In b) and c), samples with a light gray background did not have data available. Genomic subtypes and clinical characteristics are plotted at the bottom. As a note, mutational signature CN48F in c) is a de novo mutational signature that was not successfully reconstructed by COSMIC reference mutational signatures, and was therefore considered as novel.

A) Scatter plot comparison of Acral:Cutaneous gene expression ratio in cutaneous melanoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) stratified by activating mutation status. Samples were compared in two groups: non-BRAF activated tumours and BRAF-activating tumours. Statistical significance was assessed using individual Mann-Whitney U test. B) Hierarchical clustering dendrogram generated using the WIMMS platform to compare the cutaneous melanoma classifier genes to other published molecular signatures, including a signature of genes activated by mutant BRAFV600E in melanoma cells (Ryu_2011_BRAFV600E_Targets)42.

P-values were estimated with Kruskal-Wallis tests.

A) Box plot of macrophage proportion (Y axis), as calculated by deconvolution, per sample classified by transcriptional cluster. B) Box plot of endothelial cell proportion (Y axis), as calculated by deconvolution, per sample classified by transcriptional cluster. C) Box plot of other cells (non-immune), as calculated by deconvolution, per sample classified by transcriptional cluster. D) Box plot of CD8 T cell proportion (Y axis), as calculated by deconvolution, per sample classified by transcriptional cluster. The central line within each box represents the median value, the box boundaries represent the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers extend to the lowest or highest data point still within 1.5xIQR. Individual data points are plotted as dots. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney paired tests were performed.

AI optimists envision a future where artificial general intelligence (AGI) surpasses human intelligence, but the path remains riddled with scientific and logistical hurdles.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Once upon a time, the world seemed like it was made of larger building blocks. Rain fell from what looked like opaque, puffy masses that also blocked the Sun. The human body seemed self-contained and solid, and there wasn't a way to prove otherwise. Even when alchemists were melting pieces of ore, they thought mercury must be related to silver. How could it not be? They looked the same, after all.

We know that the universe itself moves toward disorder, but our knowledge of the universe moves toward the minuscule. Higher resolutions, more powerful zoom, electron microscopes, particle accelerators, nuclear energy. For technology, powering these levels of detail has fallen into the broad purview of computer chips—and computer chips have also gotten higher-resolution, in a sense.

On a basic level, computers use circuitry—carefully mapped series of connections between different conductive or semiconductive parts—to do tons of arithmetic. Early punchcards (predecessors to the chips we have now) had openings so that portions of circuitry could literally form a connection, like playing certain notes on the piano using certain fingers, or connecting phone lines on an old switchboard. But our knowledge of electronics has grown so minuscule that it's almost hard to fathom.

In the 1960s, in the midst of a global semiconductor boom, engineer Gordon Moore gave a presentation in which he made an observation. Moore was a cofounder of computer chip pioneer Intel, and it was there that he noticed that transistors—switches used to direct the current within electrical devices—were shrinking at a pretty consistent rate. This led to the 1958 invention of the integrated circuit, which could be installed in devices that were previously built one transistor at a time.

Moore showed a now-iconic graph of the number of components on an integrated circuit over time, which predicted an overall rate of growth of doubling about every two years between 1962 and his extrapolated 1970. In the accompanying lecture, he suggested this trend could actually last for the next ten years (until 1975). But Moore's Law, as it was later called, has held for decades past this initial forecast. It's been taught as canon in computer science programs around the world (even though it has never been, nor was it ever intended to be, a hard and fast rule).

But for the last several years, those in the computing industry (and those who study it) have started to discuss the “end of Moore's Law.” There's a point at which transistors simply can't get any smaller because of the basics of physics itself—these tiny transistors must still be able to communicate with the rest of what's required to build an integrated circuit, be widely manufacturable, and stay cost effective.

The slowdown of Moore's Law has been notable for a while. From MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL):

But that reality, and the reality of physics itself, is somewhat at odds with the widely promoted corporate technologies of 2026. Companies like OpenAI make opaque promises about how generative AI will change all of our lives, save us hours a week, and make many sectors of human labor obsolete. Venture capitalists have leveraged these promises to attract investors, while companies like Microsoft have started to require their employees to use generative AI in the workplace.

You can counter the slowing shrinkage of transistor design by simply making larger and larger computers. Manufacturers and generative AI companies are already doing this. They're also designing all other elements of these machines to be as efficient as possible. But that's not a long-term solution to the growing demand for this amount of computing. Like leadership of the late Roman Empire or the icing on a dry cake, our computing components can't be spread too thin.

However, if you don't like the idea of a limit on computing, you can turn to futurism, longtermism, or “AI optimism,” depending on your favorite flavor. People in these camps believe in developing AI as fast as possible so we can (they claim) keep guardrails in place that will prevent AI from going rogue or becoming evil.

The goal of these AI boosters is known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. They theorize, or even hope for, an AI so powerful that it thinks like... well... a human mind whose ability is enhanced by a billion computers. If someone ever does develop an AGI that surpasses human intelligence, that moment is known as the AI singularity. (There are other, unrelated singularities in physics.) AI optimists want to accelerate the singularity and usher in this “godlike” AGI.

One of the key facts of computer logic is that, if you can slow the processes down enough and look at it in enough detail, you can track and predict every single thing that a program will do. Algorithms (and not the opaque AI kind) guide everything within a computer. Over the decades, experts have written the exact ways information can be sent, one bit—one minuscule electrical zap—at a time through a central processing unit (CPU).

From there, those bits are assembled into a slightly more concrete format as another type of code. That code becomes another layer, and another, until a solitaire game or streaming video or Microsoft Word document comes out. Networks work the same way, with your video or document broken into pieces, then broken down further and further until tiny packets of data can be carted back and forth as electrical zaps over lengths of wire.

The human brain is, in some ways, another piece of electrical machinery. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) quantifies it as an exaflop caliber computer: “a billion-billion (1 followed by 18 zeros) mathematical operations per second—with just 20 watts of power.” By this standard, you power dozens of human brains by plugging them into a single U.S. household outlet. NIST cites the world-class Oak Ridge Frontier supercomputer as requiring “a million times more power” to do the same level of computing.

It's possible that the human brain is also predictable when you understand all of its parts and influences enough. But our brains have little in common with the abstracted, mathematical way our computers are designed. The earliest computers were mechanical, with physical parts that visibly connected with and moved each other. And despite an iconic, massively influential paper stating otherwise, the cell is not like a machine. (Mitochondria, you can still be the “powerhouse!”)

The California Institute of Technology, Caltech, has a primer on how the brain works:

There are countless ways the human brain could be boosted or hindered by factors we can't even measure yet. We don't even know why many common antidepressants and other medications work in the brain—just that they do. We can't predict when a particular turn of phrase or “certain slant of light“ will remind us of childhood, a popular TV show, what we had for dinner the other day, or a pair of shoes we used to wear. We are many years away from a diagrammatic understanding of the brain the way we understand manufactured computer parts.

Because of that gap in understanding, there's no guarantee that a certain amount of computing power comparable to a human brain (or even a million human brains) would become sentient or have consciousness. That seems especially true when aspiring “AI caretaker” engineers want their AIs to know everything from all of human history.

But let's say that efficiency or quantity of information isn't an issue. Let's say we can build one-million-exaflop computers to run advanced AIs that will mimic human think tanks. How does the end of Moore's Law affect scientists who work toward that technological singularity?

The answer is simple: size. That's both the size of electrical energy required and the physical size associated with storage, processing, cooling, and everything else required to keep a computer running. There are a few directions we could go to solve the size problem, but none of them are easy to achieve.AI boosters push nuclear fusion (another technology that is still far away) as a cure-all for the energy problems associated with large AI computing. But no one knows for sure when (or if) nuclear fusion will produce more energy than what is required to run nuclear fusion facilities. That has not happened yet. It will not happen for years and years.

There's also space-based possibilities. The Kardashev scale is a thought exercise about Solar System- or galaxy-scale civilizations. As humankind advances, the next step on the Kardashev scale would be for us to start to turn entire planets into data farms or harvest the energy of entire stars using Dyson spheres. But while Moore's Law was a forecast based on expertise in both technology and global supply chains, the Kardashev scale and Dyson spheres are thought exercises with no real-life analog at all. They are science fiction dreams.

On a more grounded level, quantum computing has been touted as an advance toward the realm of AI, ultimately leading into the singularity. But quantum computing is in its infancy, to say the least. It currently requires extreme cooling unlike anything in today's traditional computer realm. There is no usable consumer version of a quantum computer, and we're not even close to one. They must be painstakingly assembled by hand by engineers and physicists with things like atomic tweezers.

All of that means we have a lot of options that are at least 10 years away—or even as much as 100 or 1,000 years away. Venture capitalists today are selling a vision of the future. Today, there is no nuclear fusion energy, there is no efficient quantum computing, and there is no Dyson sphere.

“In this head the all-baffling brain,In it and below it the makings of heroes.”—Walt Whitman

In the huge field of artificial intelligence, there are countless ways to define and work toward goals like finding new prescription drugs or faraway galaxies. AGI is a separate, specific idea, but even within that there are variations. The public discourse has grown very muddled because of the ambiguity of terms like “artificial intelligence” outside of their intended engineering contexts.

I personally believe that AGI is very far away—though some very smart people, like Google DeepMind and Imperial College London computer scientist Murray Shanahan, believe it's closer than I think. (Shanahan's book for MIT Press about the technological singularity is a great introduction.)

Then there's OpenAI's Sam Altman, who has suggested a Dyson Sphere that encloses our Solar System, for example, as a back-of-the-napkin solution to the rising energy costs of AI. In 2019, over 750 million people on Earth still didn't have access to electricity, an additional over 400 million aren't able to use local available electricity, and both numbers are subject to stagnation or even worsening in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

A Dyson sphere is a science fiction invention with no stable version anywhere near Earth or our stellar neighborhood. We would need to drain the entire Solar System (and more!) of certain elements to even build what Altman suggests. While Moore's Law is real, many factors of the singularity are not—at least, not this decade. Climate change and the global energy crisis, though, are very, very real.

A lot of claims of “artificial intelligence” come down to highly developed algorithms combined with the ability of computers to test millions or billions of configurations at a time. This is one of its best use cases, because the human mind is just not good at this kind of work. The same way we can look around a room and categorize and remember many details at a glance, computers can plug away at enormous lists of ingredients without missing a beat or losing their place.

In 2024, Oregon State University chemist Mas Subramanian (the creator of the novel pigment YInMn Blue) told Popular Mechanics that algorithms to discover new molecules are difficult to work with because of factors that the public doesn't really understand. It's just not that easy to find a new pigment, for example—YInMn blue has an unusual crystal structure. The chemical reaction that makes the color is found in a bipyramidal shape, Subramanian explains, rather than a tetrahedral or octohedral network. (Bipyramidal is like two tetrahedrons, or “D4” shapes, glued together. The octohedron has eight faces in a different form.)

As a layperson, it's hard to understand how crystal structures like this can make a huge difference in the outcome of a substance. But take carbon, for example. Graphite and diamond are different crystalline forms of the same element.

That need for context is a major limitation of algorithms as we know them. Machine learning might tell you to put diamond in your innovative new pencil or graphite in your engagement ring.

So, Subramanian explains, the machine learning algorithm suggests a long list that must be vetted by a human, and many suggestions don't work in real life right off the bat. And because these models are trained on what already exists, they can't innovate, in the most literal sense. “The breakthrough discovery comes from unknowns,” Subramanian said. “If you don't have that in the starting point, how will you predict?”

The end of Moore's Law as an engineering benchmark is as helpful to us today as Moore's original presentation was in the 1960s. Concrete observations based on data and logistics can help manufacturers around the world adjust their planned products, research and development, and even marketing. Indeed, as the transistor industry approaches the limits of physics itself, they highlight a gap we're about to encounter as the human species—there is nothing that can start to replace and surpass our existing computer paradigm in the near future.

Today, people like Altman will tell you they're selling you the building blocks of the singularity. But as the people of Gary, Indiana, found out in The Music Man, someone selling you your first trombone shouldn't tell you it comes with a first-chair position in the New York Philharmonic. The landmarks of expert-level artificial intelligence studies don't sound like sales pitches or soundbytes—they sound more like Shanahan's clarifying note, written after he used some imprecise language in a paper that escaped containment and entered the mainstream press:

Indeed, in a context where large language models (LLMs) are used to “summarize,” Shanahan's care means a great deal. His precision and corrections give others in his field somewhere to start—whether they agree or disagree with his positions. He concludes: “The aim, rather, was to remind readers of how unlike humans LLM-based systems are, how very differently they operate at a fundamental, mechanistic level, and to urge caution when using anthropomorphic language to talk about them.”

It's very different than Altman's public comment that he might need to Dyson-Shere the entire Solar System. The point stands: we don't even know how we'd build a computer big enough to need it.

Chatbot-driven lab robots are automating methods such as protein synthesis.Credit: Du Yu/Xinhua via Alamy

Last year, synthetic biologist Meagan Olsen performed the biggest experimental campaign of her career.

The PhD student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, was trying to make proteins in a test tube more efficiently. Across more than 40 experiments over 4 months, she tested 1,231 combinations of sugars, amino acids and other ingredients, including cellular machinery, before landing on a cocktail that was at least six-times cheaper than existing cell-free protein-synthesis recipes1.

Now, an ‘autonomous laboratory' system made up of a large language model (LLM) ‘scientist', lab robotics that automate simple tasks such as liquid transfer and human overseers created by scientists at artificial-intelligence firm OpenAI in San Francisco, California, and Ginkgo Bioworks, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has eclipsed Olsen's record. It achieved a further 40% reduction in cost, after testing more than 30,000 experimental conditions over 6 months.

The findings — described in a paper2 posted on the bioRxiv preprint server on 5 February — have sparked discussion over the extent to which chatbot-controlled robots could replace humans.

‘Set it and forget it': automated lab uses AI and robotics to improve proteins

‘Set it and forget it': automated lab uses AI and robotics to improve proteins

“That is going to be the future of biology,” says Philip Romero, a protein engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

However, the technology has some way to go before it can gain wide usage. Existing lab robotics still struggle to perform tasks that require dexterous skills or conduct bespoke experiments, such as those involving tissue samples or animals. And achieving some complex research goals is beyond the grasp of existing AI tools. But, even as autonomous-lab systems grow more capable, scientists stress that human expertise will continue to be an essential ingredient for research.

Most efforts to apply autonomous labs to biology have focused on engineering proteins. Romero's team, for instance, paired a simple machine-learning model with liquid-handling lab robotics to improve a protein's heat tolerance3. Others have used more sophisticated ‘protein language models' to predict amino-acid changes — implemented by lab robotics — that can enhance an enzyme's activity4.

Cell-free protein synthesis — in which various combinations of chemicals are mixed with a bacterial cell lysate containing protein-making machinery and a protein-encoding DNA sequence — seemed like a suitable challenge for cutting-edge LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-5 that have excelled in mathematics, computer coding and theoretical physics, says Joy Jiao, who is the life-sciences research lead at OpenAI. “We really wanted to benchmark GPT-5's performance in real biology.”

The Ginkgo-OpenAI set-up used GPT-5 to interpret results and design experiments that could be performed by Ginkgo's lab robotics. The researchers supplied reagents and implemented GPT-5's experimental designs. They also made protocol tweaks and, after three experimental rounds, gave GPT-5 access to a preprint paper describing Olson's work, as well as the ability to access other literature on the Internet. GPT-5 kept a lab notebook of data interpretations and hypotheses.

Before the model had access to the Internet or Olsen's preprint, one of its notebook entries hypothesized a cost-saving reagent swap that Olsen's team also used. “The model actually had pretty decent biochemical reasoning capabilities,” says Jiao.

Nonetheless, the biggest improvements to the efficiency of protein synthesis came from the experimental steps after GPT-5 had access to fresh information. “All of that allowed it to make a big leap forward and actually beat the human state of the art,” Jiao adds.

Michael Jewett, a synthetic biologist at Stanford University in California, who supervised Olsen's effort, says the Ginkgo–OpenAI recipe for cell-free protein synthesis is broadly similar to the one he, Olsen and their colleagues came up with. However, it's difficult to know how much of his lab's work helped GPT-5 to design its experiments.

FDA agrees to review Moderna mRNA flu vaccine in dramatic reversal

After initially rejecting Moderna's application for review, the FDA will now consider the company's mRNA flu shot

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will review a messenger RNA (mRNA) flu vaccine for approval, according to its maker, Moderna. The decision is a dramatic U-turn for the agency, which, only about a week ago, had publicly rejected Moderna's application to get the shot reviewed.

When it initially rejected the application, the FDA had said Moderna's clinical trials were lacking. On Wednesday, Moderna said it had made modifications to its application. While the reversal has been welcomed by the vaccine maker and public health experts alike, the incident has been the latest instance of the Trump administration undermining vaccine science. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whose department has jurisdiction over the FDA, is a noted vaccine skeptic who has repeatedly criticized mRNA COVID vaccines.

HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that the FDA had held discussions with the company, leading to “a revised regulatory approach and an amended application, which FDA accepted.”

“FDA will maintain its high standards during review and potential licensure stages as it does with all products,” Nixon said.

William Schaffner, an infectious disease physician and a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says the FDA's decision to backtrack is “good news.”

“It is important to give all candidate new vaccines a fair equitable assessment. This is especially true for new mRNA-based vaccines as this technology currently is being applied to create vaccines against a variety of illnesses, including cancers," he says.

Modern's mRNA flu shot is based on the same technology as its COVID vaccine. The mRNA COVID shots have been credited with saving millions of lives. “With these mRNA vaccines, the benefits outweigh the risk,” says Angie Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.

In these kinds of shots, mRNA—essentially the instruction manual for genes to make proteins—is injected into the body, where it teaches cells to recognize and attack viral proteins. Vaccines that use mRNA are attractive prospects for protecting against flu and a host of other diseases, including cancer. They are easy to manufacture quickly and highly flexible, meaning new vaccines can be made rapidly to respond to emerging viral variants.

Having such a vaccine available for flu would “potentially be a major step forward in efforts to protect the health of individuals from severe influenza,” says Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

Identifying vulnerabilities is good for public safety, industry, and the scientists making these models.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

In a new paper that's making waves, scientists from Stanford, Cal Tech, and Carleton College have combined existing research with new ideas to look at the reasoning failures of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude. Those who rely on LLMs for intellectual labor often cite the models' reasoning ability as a major draw, despite the evidence that this ability is limited, even when dealing with simple questions. So, what's the truth of the matter?

First, a quick primer. One of the major lines of criticism leveled by today's AI skeptics goes something like this: large language models work much like your phone's autocomplete—spicy autocomplete, so to speak. But there are significant differences. LLMs come with a much longer attention span and a much larger computer system than your phone's messaging app does. It comes down to data and processing power. Huge portions of the public internet, books, magazines, academic journals—whatever is most relevant to a particular model—are transformed into code that then organizes everything into complicated lists. Furthermore, while computing in general is not like the human brain almost at all, LLMs have something in common with the way we humans think. When a prompt is received, both your brain and an LLM travel many possible paths and strike a bunch of clusters of ideas before using logic to pull together a response. We may think of computers as doing binary arithmetic, but LLMs start with college-level linear and matrix algebra, and only get more complicated from there.

All of this math behind the curtain can give the impression that an LLM is thinking or sentient, but it is not. An LLM is, however, capable of certain types of associative reasoning—a technical and philosophical term meaning that it can consider information and apply logic to draw a conclusion. Yet, as the new research paper's authors make clear, there are limits. “Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios.” 

In their review—which is available now on the preprint site arXiv, as well as through the online resource Transactions on Machine Learning Research—the scientists categorized LLM reasoning failures and picked out common categories of errors, some of which are listed below. (You can also find a link to their repository of compiled references and research here.) 

The news sounds bad (and it is), but identifying weaknesses and working to mitigate them is key to developing any model or product. The failings of today's LLMs may be instructive for building better artificial intelligence architectures in the future. For example, the scientists pointed out architecture and training as an area for feasible large improvements: “[R]oot cause analyses in those categories are particularly rich, suggesting meaningful methods not only for mitigating the specific failures, but for generally improving the architecture and our understanding of it.” In other words, large language models are great for lots of things, but they're not the path to artificial general intelligence.

The scientists also suggested some field-wide structures for improvement:

1. Root cause analysis across all the types of reasoning failures that LLMs display.

2. Unified, persistent failure benchmarks for all types of reasoning failures; “Such benchmarks should preserve historically challenging cases while incorporating newly discovered ones.”

3. Failure-injection principles, applied “by adding adversarial sections, multi-level task difficulty, or cross-domain compositions designed to trigger known weaknesses.”

4. “[D]ynamic and event-driven benchmarks could combat overfitting and encourage continual improvement.”

“Overall,” the researchers concluded, “the systematic study of reasoning failures in LLMs parallels fault-tolerance research in early computing and incident analysis in safety-critical industries: understanding and categorizing failure is a prerequisite for building resilient systems.”

Researchers have pinpointed three already approved medications that may be repurposed to treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease. Instead of starting from scratch, scientists examined medicines that are currently used for other conditions to see whether any could help protect the brain.

The study, funded by Alzheimer's Society and led by the University of Exeter, was published in Alzheimer's Research and Therapy. Among the drugs reviewed, a shingles vaccine (Zostavax) emerged as the most promising candidate. Viagra (sildenafil) and a medication used to treat motor neurone disease (riluzole) also showed strong potential.

Why Drug Repurposing Matters

Dementia is the leading cause of death in the UK, affecting around one million people. One in three people born today will develop dementia in their lifetime -- yet there is still no cure.

Creating brand new drugs can take 10 to 15 years and cost billions of pounds -- with no guarantee of success. Repurposing medicines that are already approved and widely used could provide a faster, safer, and more affordable path toward new Alzheimer's treatments.

This work was also supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), the Exeter Biomedical Research Centre, and the NIHR HealthTech Research Centre in Brain Health.

How the Top Alzheimer's Candidates Were Chosen

An international group of 21 dementia specialists from universities, hospitals, and the pharmaceutical industry, along with people affected by dementia, evaluated 80 existing medications. Their goal was to identify which ones showed the greatest promise for treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for more than half of all dementia diagnoses.

After multiple rounds of review, the panel agreed on three 'priority candidates' for further research. Each drug was selected because it targets biological processes linked to Alzheimer's, has shown encouraging results in cell and animal studies, and is considered safe for use in older adults.

The three priority drugs are:

Shingles Vaccine Shows Strongest Signal

Experts are now calling for clinical trials to determine whether these medications truly benefit people who have Alzheimer's or are at risk of developing it.

Among the three, the shingles vaccine stood out. It requires no more than two doses and has a long record of safety. Previous research suggests that people who received the vaccine were about 16% less likely to develop dementia.

Researchers hope to launch a large UK clinical trial of the shingles vaccine, using the to track participants. PROTECT is an online registry in which volunteers complete annual questionnaires about their health and lifestyle and take part in brain health research.

Other Drugs Considered

Five additional medications were shortlisted but did not meet the criteria to be named 'priority candidates.' These included fingolimod (used in MS), vortioxetine (used to treat major depressive disorder), microlithium (used to treat depression), dasitinib (used for leukaemia), and cytisine (used in anesthetics).

Experts Urge Caution and Further Trials

Dr. Anne Corbett, Professor of Dementia Research at the University of Exeter, said: "Beating dementia will take every avenue of research -- from using what we already know, to discovering new drugs to treat and prevent the condition.

"Drug repurposing is a vital part of that mix, helping us turn today's medicine for one condition, into tomorrow's treatment for another.

"It's important to stress that these drugs need further investigation before we will know whether they can be used to treat or prevent Alzheimer's. We now need to see robust clinical trials to understand their true value and know for certain if they are effective to treat or prevent Alzheimer's."

Prof Fiona Carragher, Chief Policy and Research Officer at Alzheimer's Society, said: "Dementia devastates lives, but we believe research will beat it.

"Years ago, we saw aspirin being repurposed from being a painkiller to helping people reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke. This is what we want to see in the field of dementia, and why we believe drug repurposing is one of the most exciting frontiers in dementia research."

Sondra Williams is no stranger to medical diagnoses and treatments. As a teenager and young adult, she spent a decade in and out of mental-health facilities, medicated for conditions including schizophrenia and social anxiety.

It wasn't until she was in her late 30s that she finally received a diagnosis that made sense.

By then, she had married and had four children. After two of her kids were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), doctors reviewed her medical history. Williams, too, met the criteria for the neurodevelopmental condition.

“When I finally got the diagnosis, it felt like being in labour as a mom, being in labour for most of my life and finally delivering that baby, that relief,” says Williams, who lives in Dublin, Ohio. “It was a relief to me knowing that my differences had a meaning to it. And it wasn't me being crazy or mentally ill. It had a rhyme and reason to it.”

The diagnosis answered some questions — but raised others. Williams, now 63, has recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that some studies have suggested are more common among autistic people than in the general population. “I'm terrified of my future because I'm plagued with so many health issues,” says Williams.

The number of older autistic people is surging. A study analysing data from more than 200 countries, published online last year1, reported that the number of autistic people aged 70 or older rose from 894,700 in 1990 to nearly 2.5 million in 2021. This figure is estimated to double to 5.1 million people by 2040, according to the study.

Some of the increase is simply because the world's population is growing. But awareness of and screening for autism have also improved. Another important factor is a change in the diagnostic criteria that was made about a decade ago: before this, autism was predominantly diagnosed in early childhood; the revision meant that adults could be given the diagnosis.

And yet, researchers know almost nothing about how autism might affect people as they age. Only 0.4% of studies of autism since 2012 included autistic people in midlife or old age2.

The fact that Williams and other autistic adults live with such uncertainty concerning their health stems from two blind spots in scientific research. Firstly, the study of autism has historically focused on children and adolescents. Secondly, studies on ageing, which have ramped up in recent years, often exclude autistic people.

Features of autism can affect age of diagnosis — and so can genes

But what researchers do know paints a picture of a group that might be more susceptible to certain health conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and heart disease, and more-severe symptoms of menopause. Autistic people might benefit from extra support as they age — making it imperative to include them in research.

“People want research where there's going to be a tangible impact on their lives. With the research area of autism and ageing, we're still at that point of setting the scene,” says Gavin Stewart, a developmental psychologist at King's College London, UK.

Autism was first identified as a distinct condition by two researchers in the 1940s3,4. Before that, it was thought to be part of schizophrenia. Even in the 1960s, when autism was added to diagnostic manuals, it was listed as a schizophrenia-related condition that occurred in children. It was not until 1980 that autism became recognized as a stand-alone condition in such manuals.

The criteria for characterizing it continued to change. The official diagnosis of ASD — including how to identify it in adults — was introduced only in 2013. As a result, there are generations of autistic people who grew up not knowing that they were autistic, nor getting the support they needed to thrive, because they were excluded by earlier diagnostic criteria.

The largest survey to estimate the prevalence of autism in adults in England suggested that up to 75% of autistic people aged 20–49 and more than 90% of those over 50 are undiagnosed5.

This means that millions of people around the world might not be receiving the support that they need. It also makes it difficult for researchers to recruit older participants into studies and to follow them over the long term.

Between 1980 and 2021, more than 40,200 papers on autism in childhood and adolescence were published, compared with only 174 papers on autism during old age2 (see ‘Scant studies').

“We know almost nothing,” says Gregory Wallace, a developmental neuropsychologist at the George Washington University in Washington DC.

But there has been a growing interest in ageing and autism, and studies on older autistic adults have nearly quadrupled2 since 2012.

Some of these studies have asked whether autistic adults will face any particular health risks as they age. The data so far suggest that they might.

An analysis of health records from nearly 5,000 autistic adults and 46,850 neurotypical adults over 65 years old found that the autistic group had higher rates of mood disorder, epilepsy and gastrointestinal disorders. Autistic adults, nearly 44% of whom had an intellectual disability, were also more likely to have a diagnosis of age-related conditions, such as osteoporosis, heart disease, Parkinson's disease and dementia6 (see ‘Health needs').

Source: Ref. 6

In a larger survey of around 250,000 autistic people, people with intellectual disabilities or both, presented at a conference in 2024 and not yet published, Wallace and his colleagues reported that the risk of developing symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease was three times higher in that group than in the general population (see go.nature.com/4rcft9w). Previous genetic studies have also found that autism is linked to mutations in PARK2, a gene associated with Parkinson's disease7.

But interpreting these findings is complicated. Many autistic people have challenges with movement or differences across development compared with neurotypical people, says Wallace. And it is difficult to determine whether the Parkinson's-like symptoms occur as an ageing-related complication or whether their roots were there all along.

Neuroscientist Zheng Wang at the University of Florida in Gainesville is investigating movement difficulties in autistic people aged 40 to 60 years using brain imaging. In her project, which ends next year, she wants to find out whether structural changes in the cerebellum and basal ganglia — brain areas involved in coordinating movement — might underlie any motor difficulties.

Ageing autistic adults are also “more likely to have been prescribed various psychotropic medications” in their earlier life than are neurotypical people of the same age, says Wallace. Long-term use of such drugs, including antipsychotics and anti-seizure medications, can lead to a cascade of side effects, including Parkinson's-like symptoms, that might not manifest until later life.

That said, when Wallace and his team did another analysis excluding those who had taken such drugs during the study window, the likelihood of Parkinson's-like symptoms was still higher than in the general population.

Researchers have reported similar patterns for other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The largest study of its kind, published last year, examined data from 90 million health-care records, which included 114,582 autistic individuals. The authors revealed that up to 35% of autistic adults aged over 64 had a diagnosis of dementia, compared with only 10% in the general population8.

But studies based on medical records might be including only a subset of autistic adults who have interacted with health systems or at least have a diagnosis.

Some research on autistic adults paints a more positive picture of health in later life. For instance, brain-imaging studies have found that some neuronal networks showed less age-related change in autistic adults than in neurotypical ones. “If there was a difference at the beginning of life, there was also a difference later on in life. But this gap between people who were autistic and non-autistic didn't grow bigger with increasing age,” explains Hilde Geurts, a neuropsychologist at the University of Amsterdam who found such a difference in a 2020 study9. She and her team were surprised that the gap didn't widen with age — that autistic people didn't seem to be subject to accelerated ageing.

But she acknowledges that not all such studies agree. “It is not what everyone finds across different labs,” says Geurts.

Nonetheless, the work of Geurts and others has led to the suggestion that autism could protect against some of the declines in cognitive abilities that occur with age. “Older autistic folks have these really incredible compensatory mechanisms,” says Blair Braden, a behavioural neuroscientist at Arizona State University in Tempe.

She and her colleagues wanted to document age-related changes in the brain in autism, so they imaged the brains of 25 autistic adults and 25 neurotypical adults aged 40 to 70 years old for up to 5 years10. They focused on tasks of short- and long-term visual memory. When they looked at the data from the autistic group, they found that “there is a subset of people that are actually experiencing accelerated memory decline” compared with neurotypical participants, “and some people who are staying stable,” says Braden — much like Geurts found.

One of the most exploited properties of synthetic materials—and a limiting factor for the broader use of bio-based materials—is their durability and water stability, achieved through strong intermolecular interactions. However, this molecular stability also makes them persistent disruptors of ecological cycles, in contrast with biological structures, which undergo continuous molecular reconfigurations and use their environments to achieve both excellent mechanical properties and biodegradability. This study takes inspiration from chitinous cuticles to produce a biological material that uses water to gain strength and become waterproof. The process involves the vitrification of chitosan with small traces of nickel to create a dynamic network of intermolecular bonds using environmental water, resulting in a biomaterial that increases its strength when wet, an uncommon property previously observed in a few biological structures and never achieved artificially. The approach preserves the biomolecule's original chemistry and biodegradability while avoiding the strong organic solvents typically associated with bio-derived materials. The study describes the principle and demonstrates its application by manufacturing fully biodegradable and aquatically robust consumables and large objects made from Earth's second most abundant renewable molecule.

An essential enabling characteristic of synthetic polymers that explains their ubiquitous use in product manufacturing is their stability and persistence in water-based environments1,2, which is strongly linked to their biodegradability—or rather, the lack thereof. Polymeric materials are made suitable for manufacturing by increasing their crystallinity, crosslinking density, and molecular weights, simultaneously providing water stability and the mechanical characteristics to form standalone structures3,4. However, water plays a pivotal role in the metabolic processes that enable biodegradation5, and the stability of these polymers in the presence of water therefore comes at the expense of compostability. The result is materials that, even when they have bio-based origins, can only be biodegraded in specialized facilities—if at all—making their end of life as bad or worse than every other type of persistent synthetic polymer due to their limited recyclability6,7.

That the cost of adapting natural molecules to the current manufacturing paradigm is the loss of their integration with ecological cycles is not because of any limitation of the molecules themselves. Biological systems evolve to use their environment, not isolate themselves from it, producing structures that both develop and perform in water-rich environments by incorporating water as a central element in their designs8,9. The production of the chitinous cuticle of arthropods is an excellent example of this; it is secreted in a gel-like form into water, hardens to form solid exoskeletons for insects and crustaceans, and performs in humid or underwater environments throughout the animal's life10. The sclerotization process, in which the cuticle transitions from a soft hydrogel to a hard structure, is a complex amalgamation of intertwined processes that involve water transport, molecular reorganizations, and mechanical forces11. Special attention has recently been given to the role that transition metals (e.g., Zn, Cu, Ni) have in this process and the particularities of the complex relationships they have with the organic components of the cuticle (refer to12 for an insightful and extensive review of the use of metal ions in biological structures). The natural availability and biosynthesis rate of some of these structural molecules—specifically chitin polymers—are orders of magnitude greater than the world's demand for plastics, suggesting that if their industrial isolation were upscaled in an environmentally friendly manner, they could be strong candidates for sustainable manufacturing. However, even when the biomolecules that constitute biological structures are fully isolated, their artificial reassembly into solid materials does not recapitulate the creation process and principles they follow in natural systems13. As a result, despite identical chemistries, the differing molecular organizations of naturally and artificially assembled materials yield completely distinct properties. This chemistry/organization divide is evident in, for example, cellulose-based systems: although a few naturally organized cellulose fibers, such as cotton and linen, even display modest water-induced stiffening (typically <10%) arising from hierarchical structures formed during growth, this behavior does not survive disassembly14. When these biomaterials are disassembled and reconstituted without strong organic solvents, both the modest stiffening and even stability in liquid water are lost. In practice, reconstituted biomaterials are highly susceptible to water and require barrier coatings prior to use in manufacturing15,16.

Here, we report constructs created from an unmodified structural biopolymer formed in a water-based solvent and particularly suitable for use in contact with water. The constructs are made of nickel-doped chitosan (i.e., deacetylated chitin), which incorporates surrounding water into its intermolecular structure, creating a network of weak but highly dynamic water-mediated bonds that avoid failure through internal reconfiguration. The result is a material that almost doubles its strength in contact with water, achieving capacities well beyond those of commodity plastics. This result is particularly significant for two reasons. First, achieving this outcome with a biological material challenges the conventional view of water as an external stressor and instead establishes environmental water as a functional component of a load-bearing network. Second, it emerges in chitin-derived materials, the second-most abundant organic molecules on Earth—surpassed only by cellulose—allowing the proposed technology to potentially scale up to a level that will have a global impact. This result is also particularly timely because chitin-chitosan polymers are becoming central to the development of sustainable and regional manufacturing processes through their role in valorizing organic waste (e.g., food waste) and the local production of nutrients (Fig. 1a)17. Furthermore, the extensive and efficient production of chitin-chitosan in every ecological cycle—particularly by organisms that both produce food and decompose waste—suggests they will even play a key role in creating the efficient, self-sustaining human communities that will allow humanity to colonize other planets18.

a Conceptual schematic of regional circular production of chitin-derived polymers. Chitin and chitosan, typically byproducts of the shrimp and crab processing industry, are structural components in most heterotrophs used for the bioconversion of organic waste and the local production of nutrients. As part of any ecological cycle, chitin can be reincorporated into circular production cycles through waste management or, if unmanaged, into natural ecological cycles. b Photographs showing the color of vitrified chitosan films with increasing trapped Ni (quantified in Supplementary Fig. 1). Scale bar is 1 cm. c Schematic illustration of plausible Ni ion locations relative to a chitosan chain; the distribution depends on local degree of deacetylation, water content, and crystallinity, and is expected to comprise a mixture of these possibilities. d FTIR spectra of Ni-doped films at different Ni contents, showing that spectral changes associated with added water dominate over Ni-specific contributions. e FTIR region dominated by water's O-H bond vibrations and normalized to the carbohydrate skeletal vibrations (800–500 cm−1, inherent to the chitosan structure), showing increased Ni-associated intermolecular water content. f X-ray diffraction patterns: pristine vitrified chitosan shows peaks at 9.5° and 20° and a broad amorphous contribution (15–30°); at low Ni content, the peaks' shift is consistent with a doping process where small molecules take the interstitial space between the organized ones, whereas at higher Ni and water contents the amorphous regions come to dominate the structure. g Representative tensile stress–strain curves of dry Ni-doped films; Ni concentrations below 0.8 M have a limited effect on tensile strength, while at higher concentrations, they increase elasticity without loss of strength, simultaneously achieving strength and toughness, a characteristic functional versatility of structural biomaterials. h Tensile strength before (open bars) and after (filled bars) immersion in water for films prepared from initial Ni concentrations of 0.6–1.4 M; Cs (black) denotes pristine chitosan (no Ni). Elastic moduli and toughness are reported in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, with statistical tests in Supplementary Fig. 2. Measurements include at least three points; data are presented as mean values +/- SD.

This study was inspired by the serendipitous observation that when zinc is removed from the fangs of the sandworm Nereis Virens, they become susceptible to hydration, softening when immersed in water19,20. While most studies on the role of metals in animals' cuticles center on the protein–metal interaction—specifically, the role of histidine—it is already known that the chitin that form the organic matrix in most cuticles also interact with metals. Indeed, one of the primary uses of chitinous waste from shrimp and crab processing is as a heavy metal flocculant in water treatment systems21. While the studies of the role of metals in arthropod cuticles and biomaterials have primarily focused on mechanical properties22,23, we hypothesized that transition metals might play an essential role in controlling water interactions within chitin-based materials. We specifically used nickel because, although it is not as common as other transition metals (e.g., zinc) in the cuticle, it is a ubiquitous micronutrient necessary for life, is water-soluble, and has shown ample versatility in interacting with chitin and chitosan in theoretical models24,25. However, while phenomena in metal-enriched arthropod cuticles inspired our work, our aim here is not to reproduce arthropod cuticle; we examine a reconstituted chitosan system in which environmental water and trace Ni govern mechanics. Determining whether the principles we uncover are related to processes operating in natural cuticle remains an open question for future research.

We began our exploration by entrapping varying amounts of nickel within a chitosan structure. Chitosan extracted from discarded shrimp (Penaeus monodon) shells was dispersed at a 3% concentration in a weak solution of acetic acid at the anaerobic limit (1% acetic acid in water; for comparison, table vinegar ranges from 5 to 8%), to which we added nickel chloride dissolved in water at concentrations from 0.6 to 1.4 M. The water was then evaporated, forcing the vitrification of the polymer into a solid film. The first noticeable change from the presence of nickel in the chitosan films was a green color (λ = 520 nm; films without nickel are yellowish), which is characteristic of nickel (II) compounds. This color became more intense as the concentration increased (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1).

Theoretically, and if no factor other than the nickel itself is considered, the most stable location for nickel ions in chitosan polymer chains is the space between the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups of consecutive pyranose rings (Position I in Fig. 1c), where it weakly interacts with the fully coordinated oxygen atom in the ring24. When external elements are also considered, the most stable position is between the primary amino and secondary hydroxyl groups (Position II in Fig. 1c), where the nickel ions can coordinate with water molecules and the sterically available groups of adjacent chitosan chains. It has also been theorized that nickel could take the position between the primary amino and the primary hydroxyl groups of consecutive rings26. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR; Fig. 1d) spectra of the films show a blue shift of the amide II band from 1542 to 1561 cm−1 due to the presence of nickel in the chitosan structure, consistent with interaction with the primary amines (Position II in Fig. 1c). However, a similar blue shift is also apparent in the band located at 1325 cm−1, corresponding to the bending of the -CH2 group, consistent with nickel in the inter-ring position (Position I in Fig. 1c). The direct contribution of nickel to the spectrum can be observed by the moderate modifications of the 500–700 cm−1 region, where the vibrations of the bond between the nickel ions and the hydroxyl groups appear. However, the impact of nickel on the chitosan spectra is not primarily due to its direct interactions, but rather to the changes introduced by the new water molecules associated with the nickel ions.

Nickel forms weak hydrogen bonds with water molecules—up to six when in solution—and while the new interactions with the chitosan chains replace some of those molecules, the nickel-doped films incorporate several times as many water molecules as the number of nickel ions introduced. The effect of this additional water is observable in the band at 1628 cm−1, which corresponds to the bending vibration of the hydroxyl groups in water molecules. While this vibration is overshadowed by the amide I band (1636 cm−1) in pristine chitosan films, it completely dominates the fingerprint region in nickel-doped films, even with the smallest amount of nickel, and grows rapidly as the concentration increases. A similar effect can also be clearly seen in the intensity of the broad band at 3250 cm−1 (Fig. 1e), where the intensity of the vibrations corresponding to the stretching of the O-H bond rapidly increases with the amount of nickel in the system.

The additional water also strongly impacts the crystal structure of the chitosan films (Fig. 1f). Regular chitosan films have a hydrated crystal structure, in which water molecules mediate many of the intermolecular interactions. It has recently been demonstrated that strain stiffening, which reorganizes chitosan films into a more crystalline structure using external forces, also results in closer packing by reducing the free volume and expelling water molecules from the material as new chain–chain direct interactions replace their binding sites27. A similar but opposite effect can be observed in the nickel-doped films, as the additional nickel and its associated water result in lower crystallinity. Considering only the changes in the chitosan organization, the inclusion of nickel and its associated water into the chitosan structure might be (wrongly) seen as plasticization; indeed, a common approach to increasing the flexibility or manufacturability of long polymers is to disrupt their intermolecular bonds, although this occurs at the cost of decreasing their tensile strength. However, in the nickel-doped films, the disruption of the intermolecular bonds by the additional water and the lower crystallinity does not have the expected negative impact on their mechanical characteristics, resonating with recent results on the importance of disorder in biological systems28.

All the samples—independent of their nickel content and therefore their crystallinity—have tensile strengths in the range of 30 to 40 MPa (Fig. 1g), which is similar to commodity plastics. Despite the additional water and lower crystallinity, using low concentrations (less than 0.8 M) of nickel has a minimal impact on the mechanical properties of the films, with insignificant changes in their strength or elasticity compared with pure chitosan films. Beyond 1 M concentrations, however, the strength of the material is preserved while its Young's modulus—a measure of stiffness—falls significantly, marking the material's increased ability to be stretched and, therefore, to absorb more energy before breaking—in other words, greater toughness. Introducing nickel into the chitosan structure, therefore, increases both the material's flexibility as a plasticizer and its strength as a crosslinker, properties that are usually considered incompatible. This result cannot be overstated: the ability of a material to be both tough and strong simultaneously has been a chimeric goal in the field of structural materials that, as a feature unique to biological composites, has been the leading motivation for research into bioinspired materials29. Furthermore, the ability to tune the properties of a biopolymer to different mechanical characteristics without sacrificing strength enables a single material and production process to be adapted to various functions. In biological systems, this phenomenon makes possible, for example, the insect cuticle, which is a continuous and multifunctional structure made of very stiff parts (e.g., wings) and very elastic parts (e.g., joints) with only minor compositional changes. This use in nature of few, but very versatile, materials is the result of intense evolutionary pressure toward efficiency—the so-called survival of the cheapest30. This principle is directly applicable to product design, optimizing both cost and environmental impact by minimizing the number of materials used, simplifying both production and end-of-life management.

While the creation of an unmodified biological material with tunable hardness and constant strength is already an exceptional result, the inclusion of nickel ions in the chitosan matrix provides an even more extraordinary effect: the material gets stronger when it is immersed in water (p = 0.0014, Fig. 1h, and Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Movie 1). The strengths of all the nickel-doped films, except the one with the lowest concentration of nickel, remained constant or increased when immersed in water. This is particularly notable in samples made with a 0.8 M nickel concentration, which showed an increase in strength of almost 50% upon immersion. We hypothesized that there is an optimal balance between the roles of nickel and water in simultaneously enhancing intermolecular bonds through new interactions and disrupting them by preventing direct chain–chain interactions. We therefore focused the rest of the study on the material produced using a 0.8 M concentration of nickel. Analogous experiments performed under identical conditions using Zn²⁺ or Cu²⁺ in place of Ni²⁺ did not produce a comparable water-strengthening response, indicating that the effect depends on the specific coordination chemistry rather than divalent charge alone, and motivating future systematic exploration of other coordination chemistries and material systems.

The nickel-doped films, which in dry conditions have a tensile strength of 36.12 ± 2.21 MPa—within the strength range of commodity plastics (e.g., polypropylene, polystyrene, polylactic acid)—show an increased tensile strength of 53.01 ± 1.68 MPa when immersed in water, placing them in the range of engineering plastics (e.g., polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate glycol, polyoxymethylene; Fig. 2a). Using a 0.8 M concentration for fabricating the nickel-doped films appears optimal for achieving this mechanical improvement in water, but at the cost of also incorporating significant amounts of nickel that are irrelevant to that enhancement. This can be observed at the macroscopic level through the leaching of nickel and the behavior of the nickel-doped films upon first immersion in water: freshly made films exhibit a permanent mechanical change relative to their initial state. Subsequently, nickel-doped films that are successively hydrated and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h transition between two mechanically distinct states, both different from that of a freshly made film (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 3). This macroscopic change after the first immersion is also observable in the accumulation of nickel on the surface of a freshly made film, which later disappears (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 4). Importantly, repeating the wet tests in 0.9% NaCl instead of water yielded indistinguishable strength (47.16 ± 5.16 MPa), indicating the effect is robust to electrolyte screening and not due to long-range electrostatics (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Scale bars are 10 micrometers. d C 1 s XPS spectra of a chitosan film without nickel (Cs) and a nickel-doped film before (fresh) and after (washed) first immersion in water. e Schematic of the proposed role of Ni and water in vitrified chitosan: Interchain interactions may be direct (solid lines) or water-mediated (dashed lines). Ni provides additional labile coordination links (blue lines). Among the possibilities is the complete or partial coordination of nickel ions with water, without significant bonds to the polymeric chains, and their release to the environment (This schematic is intended only to illustrate the interaction types in CsNi films; it does not depict chain amorphousness or bending, nor the full range of chitosan–nickel–water interactions). f Thermogravimetric analysis in the water-loss region shows higher water content in fresh nickel-doped chitosan (44%, blue line) than in the same film after its first immersion in water (20%, purple line), and the water content remains stable after 24 h of drying at 60 °C (red line). This is still higher water content than that of pure chitosan (black line) (see Supplementary Fig. 8 for an analysis of weight loss during the first immersion). g Colorimetric assay of Ni release during first immersion. ~13% of the nickel introduced contributes to intermolecular bonding (i.e., one nickel atom per eight saccharide rings), whereas the remaining 87% is released into the surrounding water. After 24 h, no further measurable nickel is released from the films, even when immersed in boiling water for several hours. Data are presented as mean values +/- SD.

At the molecular level, the C 1 s x-ray photoelectron spectrum of the surface of a nickel-doped film shows that three peaks (C-(C, H) (aliphatic), C-(N, O), and C = O/O-C-C) have higher binding energies than the same peaks in a pure chitosan film (Fig. 2d, and Supplementary Table 1). There is also a notable reduction of the area under the deconvoluted C-(N, O) peak (i.e., 286.37 eV), confirming that the primary interaction between nickel and chitosan occurs through the latter's side functional groups24,26. This observation is further supported by the shift in the peak positions of C3,5 and C2 in the ¹³C NMR (Supplementary Fig. 6), which correspond to the hydroxyl and amide groups. However, after the first immersion of a nickel-doped film in water, those differences disappear, leading to a surface analysis similar to that of pure chitosan films. The same effect is observed in the O 1 s, N 1 s, and Ni 2p spectra, which confirms the Ni +2 oxidation state and the stability of the Ni ions interacting with the side groups of the polymeric chains when the films are immersed in water for the first time (Supplementary Fig. 7), supporting the hypothesis that the permanent change in the material is because the loosely bound nickel and associated water is removed upon first immersion. This hypothesis is also substantiated by the weight loss of the nickel-doped films immediately after immersion, in contrast to the weight gain normally expected of a typically hydrophilic material (e.g., In neutralized chitosan films, their water content increases from 17% of their dry weight to 56% when they are submerged in water) due to water uptake (Supplementary Fig. 8).

In nature, chitinous materials are organized as hydrated crystals in which the relatively long-range interactions between the functional groups of adjacent polymer chains are enabled by intermediate water molecules31. The inclusion of nickel during the formation of the chitosan structure brings a new level of dynamism to the material. Nickel can form weak hydrogen bonds with multiple water molecules—whether dissociated or not—and with the oxygen and nitrogen in the functional groups of the chitosan chains. While some water is bound within the polymeric chains, large amounts are also introduced from the environment alongside the nickel (Fig. 2e). The result is a structure of stiff polymeric chains bound together by a combination of direct interchain bonds and weak, rapidly configurable bonds, mediated by highly motile particles (i.e., nickel and water) trapped within the structure (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). This versatility to bond in multiple ways also includes combinations that do not contribute to the structure, such as nickel and water molecules without significant bonds to the polymeric chains. We hypothesize that these nickel particles and associated water molecules that do not contribute to the structure are the ones released during the first immersion. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that 44% of the weight of a freshly made nickel-doped film is water, but this drops to 20% after the first immersion, which is still significantly higher than the water content in pure chitosan films (13%; Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 11). Similarly, even while the films keep their strength underwater, 87.18 ± 2.72% of the entrapped nickel is weakly bound to the chitosan and is released during the first immersion (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). This indicates that, despite the amount of nickel introduced, only 1 nickel ion per 7.91 pyran rings is required to produce the water-strengthening effect in chitosan. In a macroscopic context, this means that the nickel content of a discarded AAA battery (2.2 g) would be sufficient to manufacture more than a dozen typical drinking cups (4.7 g each) using nickel-doped chitosan.

The post-wash Ni content (~1 Ni²⁺ per eight pyranose rings) constrains site occupancy and argues against a dense lattice of permanent multidentate chelates. As discussed above, spectroscopy and structural data indicate that the residual Ni²⁺ engages primarily with side groups while retaining a substantial hydration shell, and that Ni/water incorporation reduces crystallinity. Together with the large initial loss of loosely bound Ni on first immersion ( ~ 87%) while wet strengthening persists, these observations support a water-mediated, dynamically reconfigurable network rather than a permanently cross-linked architecture. This was confirmed by chelating coordinated Ni²⁺ with 0.5 M EDTA for two hours, which collapses the films into a jelly-like material indistinguishable from chitosan (data not shown), indicating that removal of inner-sphere Ni abolishes the effect. Consistent with this picture, the wet tensile strength increases near neutral/alkaline pH (Supplementary Fig. 14), as deprotonation facilitates Ni²⁺-amine interactions. Together, these data support a mechanism in which Ni²⁺-amine interactions and water-mediated hydrogen-bond networks enable wet-state strengthening, rather than extensive, rigid Ni-polymer chelation.

The release of the inconsequential nickel during the first immersion could be seen as an optimization of the material, in which the arbitrary entrapment of the nickel needed to saturate the system is followed by a process that removes all but the nickel that contributes to the material's structure. This process is carried out in water, which is also the environment in which the films form. The resulting waste from the optimization process is therefore itself an ingredient (i.e., nickel and water) for producing the films. With this in mind, we developed a production cycle in which the water used to remove the inconsequential nickel is used as an input for fabricating films (Fig. 3a). Using this zero-waste process, we produced several objects with an approach similar to the use of chitosan in product manufacturing—that is, vitrifying it on a positive mold15. This approach enabled the production of common plasticware, such as containers and cups (Fig. 3b). Note that the purpose of these objects was to explore the material's malleability rather than its ability to replace products that might no longer be justifiable in a society that can use biological materials and regionalized production. Nevertheless, the nickel-doped chitosan containers showed that the biological molecule not only gains strength in aqueous environments but can also retain water as effectively as common plastics, demonstrating the material's suitability for such tasks (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Movie 2). The studies were extended to include the production of negative replicas, which involves maintaining contact between the material and the mold during the vitrification process to account for the inherent shrinking of the object as it forms. To overcome this limitation, we fabricated a random positioning machine (a two-axis clinostat; Fig. 3d, and Supplementary Movie 3) with two independently perpendicular frames and an attached negative mold. The continuous repositioning of the mold forced the polymeric solution to maintain contact during vitrification, enabling the molding of closed geometries and a qualitative improvement in the esthetics of the objects compared to those produced with positive molds (Fig. 3e).

a Diagram of zero-waste production of Ni-doped chitosan objects. The inconsequential nickel released during the optimization of one object is used as a primary component for the next by topping up the nickel content. The system ensures 100% utilization of nickel despite the need to saturate the material with large amounts of it during vitrification to achieve the water-strengthening effect (see Fig. 1h). The top-left corner shows the process's actual inputs and outputs, expressed as weights. As a reference, the drinking cup in the next panel weighs 4.7 g. b Replica of a drinking cup made of nickel-doped chitosan formed using a negative mold (i.e., the material vitrifies against the mold's outside walls). On the right is the same object after the inconsequential nickel has been removed by immersion in water—a process that has no apparent impact on its geometry. See Supplementary Fig. 13 for closer images of the color change due to the release of the inconsequential nickel. c Images of a nickel-doped chitosan cup filled with water, demonstrating the material's impermeability. A detailed recording of the first 24 h is in Supplementary Movie 2. d Picture of the clinostat used to replicate negative molds for the nickel-doped chitosan. The continuous movement forces the material to vitrify against the inner walls, enabling the fabrication of closed geometries and producing more accurate, high-quality objects (see Supplementary Movie 3 for more detailed information). e Comparison of the same objects fabricated using negative (i.e., with the clinostat in the previous panel) and positive molds. f An example of a three-square-meter film made of nickel-doped chitosan used to test the process's scalability. Detailed information on this construct is provided in Supplementary Movie 4.

In the last few decades, the materials proposed for ecologically integrated manufacturing have focused on recovery processes32 or uncommon biological components with limited scalability33. The approach here is based on the biomimetic coordination of a transitional metal with chitin, Earth's second-most abundant organic material, with an estimated renewable production rate of 1011 tonnes per year34—the equivalent of three centuries of plastic production. Such production is sustainable, seamlessly integrated into Earth's ecological cycles, and easily reproducible in urban environments through the bioconversion of food and other organic wastes17. This unparalleled bioavailability enables the potential scaling of the results presented here to unprecedented levels for a new technology by avoiding the need to develop an industrial biosynthesis but, more importantly, the theoretical upscaling of production to quantities with a global impact and the regionalization of that production. To explore the potential for upscaling—even within the limited confines of a research laboratory—we produced a 1 m2 chitosan-doped film and tested its ability to hold weight after 24 h of water immersion (Supplementary Movie 4). Building on the initial scale-up, we produced a film three times larger without notable processing challenges (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Movie 4); importantly, these large-area films remained mechanically robust during handling and exhibited similar macroscopic mechanical behavior to smaller-area samples, demonstrating an absence of scalability restrictions and highlighting the potential for rapid scaling of the results and principles presented here to ecologically relevant scales.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the interaction between a transition metal—specifically nickel—and chitosan creates unique material properties for the molecule in its native form, from the tunability of elastic properties without impacting material strength to improving mechanical performance underwater. Unlike the usual approach of fitting biological molecules into the synthetic polymers paradigm, the production process presented here applies the principles of bioinspired manufacturing by adapting biological strategies to use unmodified biological components, applying water-based and environmentally friendly chemistries, and minimizing waste production35,36. This strategy preserves the natural biodegradability of chitin-derived polymers (Supplementary Fig. 15), without relying on special conditions, human intervention, or recovery.

The results presented here represent an approach to manufacturing in biological environments and a departure from the current view that assumes inertness is unavoidably associated with resilience. In the case of polymer-based materials, resilience is achieved through heavily crosslinked long molecules that depend on strong and exhaustive internal links to produce materials that are unresponsive to the surrounding environment. Here, resilience is achieved in a biomimetic way, using the environment instead of fighting it, relying on water transport between the nickel-doped chitosan and the environment to create a dynamic structure of weak and long-range intermolecular bonds in continuous reconfiguration.

Because of the mechanical properties of the nickel-doped chitosan in water-based environments, the absence of a human immune response, and existing FDA approval for medical uses of both nickel37 and chitosan38 individually, we foresee applications of these results in the medical field and as a waterproof coating for biomaterials35 while the proposed shaping technologies are perfected and upscaled for general use (refer to the supplementary material for an additional discussion on health and environmental impact). However, in a world that generates 400 million tonnes of persistent solid waste every year, much of it specifically for its performance in water environments39, we believe the approach presented here and the principles and materials upon which it is based will have implications at an unprecedented scale. They mark the potential for a paradigm shift toward bioinspired manufacturing based on ubiquitous biological materials, regional production, and environmental integration, which can address the limitations of current manufacturing and curb humanity's persistent waste production40.

Chitosan was sourced from shrimp-processing factory byproducts in India, provided by iChess Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. Industrial-grade acetic acid and nickel chloride hexahydrate (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were obtained from local vendors and used as received.

Films were fabricated by dissolving chitosan flakes in 1% acetic acid under continuous stirring for 48 h at room temperature to prepare a 3 wt% chitosan solution. Nickel chloride solutions at concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 M were prepared separately in 10 mL of distilled water. Both solutions (i.e., chitosan and nickel) were mixed through continuous stirring for 6 h to ensure the uniform distribution of nickel ions in the chitosan solution. The solution was poured into a Petri dish to prepare the standard samples, which were then dried in an air oven at 40 °C for 24 h. However, similar results have been obtained with other molds and drying conditions (e.g., 3 m2 films dried at room temperature; see Supplementary Movies 3 and 4). The samples are coded as Cs, 0.6 M, 0.8 M, 1.0 M, 1.2 M, 1.4 M relative to the Molar concentration of Ni in the original solution. Depending on the state of the film, they are also labeled as fresh for chitosan and chitosan-nickel films or constructs after they are dried/vitrified from the original solution. Washed for nickel-doped constructs (e.g., films) that have been immersed in water for more than 24 h at least once, and the inconsequential Ni has been removed. Wet for constructs currently or recently immersed in water and still soaked, retaining large amounts of excess water. Dry for constructs that have been oven-dried and have had excess water removed. Appropriate safety equipment was used during reagent handling.

The chitosan films (i.e., without nickel) used to compare the underwater properties of pure chitosan with nickel-doped chitosan were neutralized with 1 M NaOH to prevent dissolution upon immersion. Freshly prepared films were washed five times in a beaker containing NaOH solution, then rinsed in double-distilled water in another container. For all other characterizations, the pure chitosan and nickel-doped chitosan films are prepared using the same procedure (i.e., without neutralization).

The crystallographic structures of the polymers were determined using an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., UK) with a Cu anode, generating Cu Kα radiation. The patterns were recorded at room temperature using continuous scanning between 5 and 60°.

UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1800, Shimadzu Corp., JP) was used to measure the light absorption of the films in the 200–800 nm wavelength range. Beer-Lambert's law was used to determine the concentration of nickel released. Samples with a fixed Ni concentration were used as references to determine the unknown Ni concentration in a solution. The standard data were obtained by plotting absorbance versus the known Ni concentrations (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 M). From this plot, the unknown concentration of Ni in water (falling in the range between 0 and 1.6 M) can be determined with absorbance values.

The morphology of the samples was characterized using Scanning electron microscopy (JSM-7600F, JEOL Ltd., Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Before imaging, samples were gold-coated to render the surface conductive.

Three-dimensional representations of the chitosan, nickel, and water molecules were created using 3D Studio (Autodesk Inc., San Francisco, USA). The atomic positions in the 3D space and atomic radii were sourced from PubChem (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA). In Fig. 2e, the polymer chains have been ‘flattened' (i.e., molecular bonds' out-of-plane twists have been removed) for illustrative purposes.

Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) using a spectrometer (VERTEX 70 FT-IR, Bruker Corp. USA) in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) between 4000–400 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Chitosan's degree of deacetylation (DD) was calculated by comparing the absorbance of the measured peak at 1650 cm−1 (which is proportional to the DA) with that of the reference peak at 3450 cm−1 (which is independent of the DA)10. The DD of 86.82 ± 2.86% was determined using the equation:

The orbital level information was obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Axis Supra Plus, Kratos Analytical, UK). The data were acquired using Al Kα as the X-ray source. The wide scan had a pass energy of 160 eV (1 eV step size), and the narrow scan was 20 eV (0.1 eV step size). The data obtained were analyzed using CasaXPS (Casa Software Ltd., GB). A standard carbon C1s peak (284.8 eV) was used for reference, and Shirley background was used to correct the spectrum. The data were deconvoluted using a Gaussian Lorentzian (GL-30) line shape function to determine the films' oxidation state and elemental composition.

The intrinsic viscosity and viscosity-average molecular weight were determined using an Ubbelohde capillary viscometer with a capillary diameter of 0.8 mm. We tested four concentrations of a chitosan solution in a solvent system composed of 0.3 M acetic acid and 0.2 M sodium acetate at a temperature of 25 °C11. The experimental results were then used in the Mark–Houwink equation to determine the molecular weights:

Where [η] is the intrinsic viscosity, K and α are Mark-Houwink constants. K and α were previously determined under identical conditions to be 0.74 × 10−3 and 0.76, respectively. The viscosity-average molecular weight of the chitosan used in these experiments was 189,520.5 ± 1,179.2 Da.

Mechanical strength was measured using a universal testing machine (UTM; Instron 5943) for both dry and wet samples. Dog-bone-shaped samples with a test dimension of 10 × 2 cm (L × W) were used for the tensile tests. The measurements were conducted at room temperature, with a RH of 70%. Wet samples were immersed in water for 24 h and then removed immediately prior to measurement. A customized setup consisting of a water container with a pass-through attachment to the tensile tester container was engineered to accurately measure the samples' underwater performance. Wet tensile testing was conducted with a gauge length submersion of 7 cm, a controlled strain rate of 1 mm/min, and grip forces of ~1.5 kN applied at an air pressure of 6–8 bar. This configuration ensured that the sample remained in water during the tensile test. The dry samples were tested in the empty container to avoid introducing variability between the dry and wet tests. See Supplementary Movie 1 for an example of a test.

To test the effects of solution acidity and alkalinity on mechanical performance, the tensile strength of the Cs-Ni samples was measured at pH 4, 7, and 10 using buffer solutions. A 0.9% NaCl solution was used to evaluate the effect of a saline environment.

The water transport and decomposition of the polymer matrix were studied using a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA Q50) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The data were recorded over the temperature ranges 30 to 600 °C (TGA) and 30 to 300 °C (DSC) at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen.

The changes in the chemical structure as a function of Ni content were studied using 400 MHz solid-state NMR (Bruker).

The polymer swelling behavior was studied using 5 cm × 3 cm films immersed in water, and the films were weighed every hour for 24 h. The swelling degree was determined using the relation.

Where WW and Wo are the weight of a wet sample at a given time point and its initial (dry) weight, respectively.

The Nickel released in water was reused for manufacturing new composite films, following the same procedure described in the methodology to prepare composite films, with the only difference that the same amount of nickel that remained in the washed construct is added to the wastewater to achieve the right concentration for the formation of new constructs.

A two-axis clinostat, a random positioning machine with two independently perpendicular frames usually utilized to simulate microgravity environments, was equipped with a positive mold to create a negative replica of CsNi composite-based objects. The frame, constructed with aluminum profiles, is powered by two stepper motors and controlled by an Arduino UNO microcontroller, which independently operates both motors. We used the AccelStepper library to program the system. The system produces a continuous movement between two positions or moves to random positions at a pre-determined rate.

A standard soil burial test was used to assess the biodegradation of the CsNi samples in environmental conditions. Individually weighed groups of samples were buried in garden soil, and degradation was monitored until the material's half-life (i.e., half of the material had degraded) was reached, which occurred after ~four months (128 days). The samples were collected from the soil at 20-day intervals, and mass loss was assessed by weighing them after washing and drying. The mass loss of various degraded samples was measured to assess the extent of degradation in the soil over time.

Antibiotic resistance (AR) has escalated rapidly in recent years, growing into a serious global health emergency. Disease-causing bacteria are continually adapting, finding new ways to survive treatments that once eliminated them. As a result, more drug resistant "superbugs" are spreading, and projections suggest that by 2050 they could be responsible for more than 10 million deaths worldwide each year.

These dangerous bacteria often thrive in hospitals, wastewater treatment facilities, livestock operations, and fish farms. In response to this expanding threat, scientists are turning to advanced genetic technologies. Researchers at the University of California San Diego are now using powerful new gene editing tools to directly counter antibiotic resistance.

CRISPR Gene Drive Strategy Targets Resistance

Professors Ethan Bier and Justin Meyer of the UC San Diego School of Biological Sciences have teamed up to create a new way to remove resistance traits from bacterial populations. Their approach builds on CRISPR gene editing and borrows concepts from gene drives, which are used in insects to block the spread of harmful traits such as malaria carrying parasites.

The team developed a second generation Pro-Active Genetics (Pro-AG) system called pPro-MobV. This updated technology is designed to spread through bacterial communities and disable the genes that make them resistant to antibiotics.

"With pPro-MobV we have brought gene-drive thinking from insects to bacteria as a population engineering tool," said Bier, a faculty member in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology. "With this new CRISPR-based technology we can take a few cells and let them go to neutralize AR in a large target population."

How the Genetic Cassette Restores Antibiotic Sensitivity

The foundation for this work began in 2019, when Bier's lab partnered with Professor Victor Nizet's team (UC San Diego School of Medicine) to design the original Pro-AG system. That earlier version introduced a genetic cassette into bacteria, allowing it to copy itself between bacterial genomes and shut down antibiotic resistance genes.

This cassette specifically targets resistance genes carried on plasmids, which are small circular DNA molecules that replicate inside bacterial cells. By inserting itself into these plasmids, the cassette disrupts the resistance genes and makes the bacteria vulnerable to antibiotics again.

Spreading Through Biofilms and Bacterial Mating

The newer pPro-MobV system expands on that concept by using conjugal transfer, a process similar to bacterial mating, to move CRISPR components from one cell to another. According to findings published in the Nature journal npj Antimicrobials and Resistance, the researchers demonstrated that the system can travel through a natural mating channel formed between bacteria, distributing the resistance disabling elements across populations.

Importantly, the team showed that this method works inside biofilms. Biofilms are dense communities of microbes that cling to surfaces and are notoriously difficult to eliminate with standard cleaning methods. They are involved in most serious infections and help bacteria survive antibiotic treatment by forming a protective barrier that limits how easily drugs can penetrate. Because of this, the new approach could have important applications in hospitals, environmental cleanup efforts, and microbiome engineering.

"The biofilm context for combating antibiotic resistance is particularly important since this is one of the most challenging forms of bacterial growth to overcome in the clinic or in enclosed environments such as aquafarm ponds and sewage treatment plants," said Bier. "If you could reduce the spread from animals to humans you could have a significant impact on the antibiotic resistance problem since roughly half of it is estimated to come from the environment."

Pairing CRISPR With Bacteriophages

The researchers also discovered that elements of their active genetic system can be transported by bacteriophage, or phage, viruses that naturally infect bacteria. Phage are already being engineered to fight antibiotic resistance by slipping past bacterial defenses and delivering disruptive genetic material into cells. The team envisions pPro-MobV working alongside these engineered phage to strengthen the impact.

As an added safeguard, the platform can include a process known as homology-based deletion, which allows scientists to remove the inserted genetic cassette if necessary.

"This technology is one of the few ways that I'm aware of that can actively reverse the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes, rather than just slowing or coping with their spread," said Meyer, a professor in the Department of Ecology, Behavior and Evolution, who studies the evolutionary adaptations of bacteria and viruses.

NASA has successfully launched two sounding rocket missions from Alaska to investigate the powerful electrical forces behind the northern lights. The Black and Diffuse Auroral Science Surveyor and the Geophysical Non-Equilibrium Ionospheric System Science mission, known as GNEISS (pronounced "nice"), both lifted off from the Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks.

The Black and Diffuse Auroral Science Surveyor launched Feb. 9 at 3:29 a.m. AKST (7:29 a.m. EST) and climbed to about 224 miles (360 kilometers). Principal investigator Marilia Samara reported that all instruments, including technology demonstrations, performed as planned and that the mission returned high-quality data.

The two-rocket GNEISS mission followed with a dramatic back-to-back launch on Feb. 10 at 1:19:00 a.m. and 1:19:30 a.m. AKST (5:19:00 a.m. and 5:19:30 a.m. EST). The rockets reached peak altitudes of approximately 198.3 miles (319.06 kilometers) and 198.8 miles (319.94 kilometers), respectively. Principal investigator Kristina Lynch said ground stations, subpayloads, and instrument booms all operated as expected, and the team is pleased with both the launch and the data collected so far.

How the Northern Lights Form an Electrical Circuit

When the aurora lights up the night sky, it is powered by electrons streaming down from space into Earth's upper atmosphere. These charged particles energize atmospheric gases, causing them to glow. It is similar to electricity traveling through a wire to power a lightbulb.

But the process does not end where the glow appears. Electricity moves in loops. Just as a lightbulb is part of a complete circuit, the aurora is only one stop along a larger electrical pathway. If electrons are flowing into the atmosphere, they must also return to space to complete the circuit.

The incoming particle beams are relatively focused, like current flowing through a cord. The return flow, however, is far more scattered. After igniting the aurora, electrons spread out in many directions. Their motion is shaped by collisions, shifting winds, pressure differences, and changing electric and magnetic fields. Eventually, they make their way back to space, but only after weaving through the constantly changing upper atmosphere.

GNEISS Creates a 3D Scan of Auroral Electricity

To truly understand how auroras work, scientists need to see how this returning current closes the circuit. That means mapping the many possible routes electricity takes through the sky, which is extremely challenging.

"We're not just interested in where the rocket flies," said Kristina Lynch, principal investigator for GNEISS and a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. "We want to know how the current spreads downward through the atmosphere."

Lynch designed GNEISS to answer that question. Using two rockets and a coordinated network of ground receivers, the mission builds a three-dimensional picture of the aurora's electrical environment.

"It's essentially like doing a CT scan of the plasma beneath the aurora," Lynch said.

The two rockets launched side by side into the same aurora, each traveling along a slightly different path. Once inside, each rocket released four subpayloads to take measurements at multiple points within the glowing region.

As they flew overhead, the rockets transmitted radio signals through the surrounding plasma to receivers on the ground. The plasma changed those signals as they passed through it, much like body tissues alter X rays during a medical CT scan. By analyzing those changes, scientists can determine plasma density and identify where electrical currents are able to flow. The result is a large-scale CT style scan of the aurora.

Why Mapping Auroral Currents Matters for Space Weather

Understanding these electrical currents is not just about solving a physics puzzle. Auroral currents control how energy from space is distributed through Earth's upper atmosphere. When currents spread out, they heat the atmosphere, stir up winds, and create turbulence that can affect satellites traveling through that region.

Researchers have long relied on ground-based instruments to study auroras. NASA's EZIE satellite mission, launched in March 2025, measures auroral electrical currents from orbit. By combining satellite observations, ground imagery, and direct measurements from sounding rockets, scientists can examine the system from multiple angles at once.

"If we can put the in situ measurements together with the ground-based imagery, then we can learn to read the aurora," Lynch said.

Investigating Black Auroras and Current Reversals

The GNEISS rockets were not alone during this launch campaign. The Black and Diffuse Auroral Science Surveyor focused on unusual dark regions within auroras known as black auroras. These blank spots may mark areas where electrical currents suddenly reverse direction.

The mission marked its second attempt at flight after a 2025 effort was postponed due to weather and scientific conditions. With this successful launch, researchers now have new data to examine how these mysterious dark patches fit into the broader auroral circuit.

Auroras form where space and Earth's atmosphere interact. Electric currents, streams of charged particles, and countless collisions combine to create these glowing displays. Sounding rockets provide a rare opportunity to fly directly through them, placing instruments exactly where the action unfolds. Through brief but precisely timed missions, NASA is turning fleeting flashes of light into deeper insight about how space weather shapes our planet's upper atmosphere.

Battery technology presents a major economic opportunity, spanning diverse metal-ion battery chemistries with distinct material, performance and supply chain characteristics. How knowledge is shared across these chemistries is essential for industrial strategies informed by techno-economic forecasting but understudied. Here we report the use of advanced large language models for automated patent classification to map knowledge flows within and across lithium-ion and sodium-ion battery chemistries, based on patent citation networks encompassing over 15,000 patent families classified at the chemical structure level. We find substantial, persistent knowledge flows within and across chemistries for product and process innovation, with continuous directional knowledge flows from mature lithium-ion to emerging sodium-ion chemistries. For some lithium-ion chemistries, cross-chemistry knowledge flows even exceed within-chemistry flows. These results indicate that industrial strategies aiming to leap-frog to new chemistries without design and manufacturing experience in existing chemistries are unlikely to succeed, and battery chemistries should therefore not be treated as fully independent technologies in forecasting models.

Batteries have become a cornerstone technology of the global low-carbon energy transition, enabling decarbonization of the transportation and electricity sectors1,2,3,4. This represents an enormous economic opportunity, with global battery production capacity being projected to reach 7.0 TWh yr−1 by 20305. Consequently, a global race for market shares has started, supported by active industrial policy targeting the technology, including in China, the USA and the European Union5,6. Yet, over the last decades, the monovalent metal-ion battery landscape has become increasingly diverse, constituting multiple chemistries7 that serve different market segments, trading off costs, energy density, safety, cycle life and raw material dependencies8,9,10. This includes the dominant lithium-ion battery (LIB) chemistries such as lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP), alongside emerging sodium-ion battery (SIB) chemistries such as sodium nickel iron manganese oxide (NFM) and sodium iron pyrophosphate (NFPP). Throughout this study, we use ‘metal-ion battery' to refer to monovalent chemistries (LIB and SIB chemistries), which store energy by moving single charged metal ions between electrodes11. We focus on monovalent metal-ion chemistries of LIBs and SIBs as these represent mature systems with sufficient patent activity for analysis, unlike other monovalent systems such as potassium-ion batteries or multivalent systems such as aluminium-ion batteries, which remain at lower technological readiness levels with insufficient patent data for robust citation network analyses11,12.

Whether this increasing technological heterogeneity results in independent knowledge trajectories within and across monovalent chemistries is currently inadequately understood, leading to sub-optimal resource allocation decisions by policymakers and investors and modelling assumptions by technology and energy system modellers.

The lack of this understanding affects resource allocation decisions in two key ways. First, if knowledge trajectories across different battery chemistries are highly interconnected, this creates substantial market entry barriers13,14,15,16. Existing market players would have major advantages in next-generation chemistries, given their expertise in mature battery chemistries. This would make technological leap-frogging—a strategy aimed at by western countries and firms—challenging17. Second, effective resource allocation and strategic planning of energy policy is informed by technology forecasting, where the experience curve is a fundamental input18,19. The granularity at which experience curves should be modelled—whether different battery chemistries follow independent learning trajectories or learn together—substantially changes the resulting performance and cost projections20. Current approaches reflect this lack of understanding through varied modelling assumptions. While some studies estimate independent experience curves for each metal-ion battery chemistry with component-specific learning rates10,21,22, others estimate aggregated experience curves based on use cases disregarding chemistry differences23,24,25. These varied approaches result in substantially different cost and deployment projections, leading to divergent conclusions about market competitiveness and deployment and potential misallocation of public and private resources.

Despite the importance of knowledge interdependencies between metal-ion battery chemistries to strategic decision-making, our knowledge about them is very limited. Previous research examining knowledge flows between sectors14 and between distinct battery technologies with fundamentally different electrochemical mechanisms, such as lead acid and lithium-ion batteries26, found that cross-technology knowledge flows were mainly limited to peripheral components. Other electrochemical storage systems, such as redox flow batteries, operate on fundamentally different principles and are not included here, although bibliometric keyword analysis of scientific publications indicate some thematic proximity to LIB research27. However, knowledge flows within metal-ion battery technology between different chemistries have not been systematically analysed, despite their shared underlying principles potentially resulting in more substantial knowledge flows throughout these chemistries' development and deployment. This represents a critical gap, especially as metal-ion batteries are poised to dominate battery markets in the coming decades5,28,29.

We address this research gap by systematically analysing within-technology knowledge flows between metal-ion battery chemistries using large language model (LLM)-assisted patent classification and their citations. Patent citations serve as common proxies for knowledge flows, with citation patterns indicating how innovations build upon existing technical knowledge foundations13,26,30,31,32, offering high-resolution insight into knowledge interdependencies. Using a LLM, we are able to systematically classify inventions contained in over 35,000 LIB and SIB patent family claims across three levels: component focus (positive/negative electrodes, electrolyte or cell level), innovation type (product/process innovations or mixed) and electrode active material (16 distinct positive and negative LIB and SIB electrode materials; Table 1). Among these, 15,000 patent families relate to specific electrode chemistries, while the remainder concern the overall technology, such as cell assembly processes.

Rather than analysing individual battery chemistries, we group electrode active materials by their chemical structure classes (for example, layered oxides, polyanionic materials; Table 1), as materials within the same structural class share similar chemical properties, technical challenges and knowledge bases33,34. The classes serve as our units of analysis, enabling identification of systematic knowledge flow patterns across chemically related groups. From here onward, we refer to groups of chemical structure classes as classes for brevity. We construct directed patent citation networks from the nearly 100,000 citations between electrode material-related patents, including analysing the type of innovation and their temporal nature, to analyse knowledge flows between chemical classes.

First, we quantify knowledge flow patterns within and across classes to measure technological interdependence. Second, we examine whether knowledge flows differ between product and process innovations, as process innovations rely on tacit manufacturing knowledge while product innovations constitute more codified design knowledge17. Third, we assess the temporal persistence of cross-structural flows, as sustained interdependencies would refute the independent development assumption. We find substantial, persistent knowledge flows within and across lithium- and sodium-ion battery chemistries, with notable interdependencies at both product and process levels and consistent directional knowledge flows from mature LIB to emerging SIB chemistries. These findings suggest that LIB and SIB chemistries should be considered an interconnected technology from industrial policy and technology modelling perspective.

Figure 1 presents knowledge flows within and across all nine LIB and SIB classes (Methods provide calculation details). Knowledge flows are derived from patent citation networks for battery-chemistry-specific patent families, coded using the alphanumeric system from Table 1. We calculate relative knowledge flow intensities by determining what percentage of each receiving chemical class's total backward citations comes from each providing class, then normalizing by the percentage from the same structural class (diagonal values = 100%). Off-diagonal values show cross-structural flows relative to within-structural flows (detailed networks shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 to Supplementary Fig. 4; non-normalized percentages in Supplementary Fig. 5).

Relative knowledge flow intensities between all LIB and SIB classes (A–I providers, 1–9 receivers). Values show knowledge flows between battery classes normalized to within-structural self-citation baseline (diagonal = 100% by definition). Brown intensity indicates high knowledge flow intensities. Numbers above each column show the within-structural citation percentages used as normalization baselines for the respective receiving class.

Source data

LIB classes show substantial directional learning. The highest knowledge flows occur from layered oxides to spinel (A → 3: 109%—even exceeding within-structural knowledge flow intensity) and to polyanionic (A → 2: 85.6%). The A → 2 flow means the polyanionic LIB class (LFP-based chemistry) receives knowledge from layered oxides (LCO-, NMC-, NCA-based chemistries) at 85.6% intensity compared to knowledge flows within their own chemical structure class. The graphite-based class provides substantial knowledge to polyanionic (G → 2: 81.8%) and layered oxides to LTO (A → 8: 78.8%). Weakest knowledge flows include polyanionic to graphite-based (B → 7: 5.8%) and LTO to graphite-based classes (H → 7: 5.2%).

SIB classes exhibit more balanced patterns. Layered oxides serve as primary knowledge providers: to polyanionic (D → 5: 27.7%), to PBA (D → 6: 27.0%) and to hard carbon (D → 9: 27.7%) classes. Hard carbon also provides notable knowledge flows to polyanionic (I → 5: 25.2%) and PBA (I → 6: 26.2%) classes.

Knowledge flows from LIB to SIB classes demonstrate substantial cross-structural technological learning, with higher knowledge flows between different battery chemistries with similar chemical structures. The highest knowledge flow intensity occurs from the LIB graphite-based class to the SIB hard carbon class (G → 9: 67.7%). Structurally analogous battery chemistries show substantial knowledge flow intensities: LIB polyanionic to SIB polyanionic (B → 5: 28.3%) and LIB layered oxides to SIB layered oxides (A → 4: 27.1%). Additional notable knowledge flows include LIB graphite-based class to SIB polyanionic class (G → 5: 23.9%). The weakest knowledge flows occur from LIB LTO to SIB layered oxides (H → 4: 2.6%) and to SIB PBA (H → 6: 3.5%).

Cross-electrode knowledge flows demonstrate that battery innovation integrates positive and negative electrode development. LIB positive electrode classes provide substantial knowledge flows to negative electrode classes, with the highest knowledge flows from LIB positive electrode classes to the LTO-based LIB negative electrode class: 78.8% (LIB layered oxides, A → 8), 28.2% (LIB polyanionic, B → 8) and 55.9% (LIB spinel, C → 8). LIB positive electrode classes also provide knowledge to the LIB graphite-based class: 21.6% (LIB layered oxides, A → 7), 5.8% (LIB polyanionic, B → 7) and 12.0% (LIB spinel, C → 7). This pattern extends to SIB classes, where LIB and SIB positive electrode classes provide knowledge flows to the SIB hard carbon class: 15.0% (LIB layered oxides, A → 9), 11.8% (LIB polyanionic, B → 9), 7.7% (LIB spinel, C → 9), 27.7% (SIB layered oxides, D → 9), 13.6% (SIB polyanionic, E → 9) and 16.4% (SIB PBA, F → 9).

Knowledge flows demonstrate clear directional asymmetries. Given their more recent development, SIB chemistries provide minimal knowledge to LIB chemistries ( < 1%), whereas LIB chemistries provide substantial knowledge to SIB chemistries, with intensity varying by similarity of chemical structures.

Figure 2 presents knowledge flows disaggregated by innovation type: product innovation (electrode architecture and design), process innovation (manufacturing techniques) and mixed innovation (both product and process). Flow thickness represents the share of each receiver's total knowledge base derived from chemistries of different chemical structures for the given innovation type.

a–c, Sankey diagrams show cross-structural knowledge flows between LIB classes (39,383 total knowledge flows) (a), between SIB classes (457 total knowledge flows) (b) and from LIB to SIB classes (677 total knowledge flows) (c). Knowledge providers include LIB (A–C, G, H) and SIB classes (D–F, I). Knowledge receivers, disaggregated by innovation type (product, process and mixed), include LIB (1–3, 7, 8) and SIB classes (4–6, 10). Flow thickness represents the share of each receiver's total knowledge base derived from a given provider. For each receiving class, the percentage of total knowledge obtained from other classes (excluding self-citations) is reported by innovation type. Colours correspond to battery chemical structure classes according to Table 1.

Source data

For LIB classes, cross-structural knowledge flows are substantial for both product and process innovations. The LTO class receives the highest share of its product knowledge from other classes (12.7%), followed by the spinel class (12.2%) and the polyanionic class (11.1%). Process innovations also show substantial cross-structural dependencies, with the LTO class again receiving the most knowledge from other classes (11.5%), followed by the spinel class (9.5%) and the polyanionic class (7.0%).

SIB classes show similar patterns, with substantial cross-structural knowledge flows for product and process innovation types. For product knowledge, the PBA class receives the highest share from other classes (12.9%), followed by the polyanionic class (9.9%). Process innovations show notable cross-structural flows, with the layered oxides and PBA classes each receiving 3.3% from other classes and the polyanionic class receiving 2.5%.

Knowledge flows from LIB to SIB classes are substantial for both innovation types. For product knowledge, three SIB classes receive over 10% from LIB classes: the polyanionic (13.1%), the layered oxides (12.2%) and the hard carbon (10.8%) classes. For process knowledge, the SIB polyanionic class receives the highest share from LIB classes (8.0%), while the SIB PBA class receives the lowest (3.3%).

Mixed innovation knowledge flows typically fall between product and process levels. Technological learning across positive and negative electrode classes occurs consistently for all innovation types.

Figure 3 presents temporal knowledge flow dynamics across LIB, SIB and from LIB to SIB classes, with knowledge flows measured as the percentage of each receiving class's total annual backward citations that come from other classes with different chemical structure (excluding self-citations). Knowledge flows between LIB classes demonstrate continuous technological learning throughout 2002–2022. The LTO class exhibits the highest knowledge flows at approximately 15% with stable trends, whereas the spinel and the polyanionic classes show upward trajectories, rising from 9% to 13% (polyanionic) and 11% to 15% (spinel). The layered oxides class maintains knowledge flows around 7–9% with marginally declining trends, whereas the graphite-based class remains consistently lowest at 5%.

a–c, Knowledge flows between LIB classes (a), between SIB classes (b) and from LIB to SIB classes (c), 2002–2022 (LIB–LIB), 2017–2022 (SIB–SIB and LIB–SIB). Knowledge flows are measured as the percentage of annual knowledge flows from other battery chemistries with different chemical structures (excluding self-citations) within each receiving class's annual total knowledge base. The x axis shows years corresponding to priority years of citing patent families. The y axis shows percentage of annual knowledge flows within total annual knowledge base. Dashed lines represent linear trend lines indicating temporal trends in cross-structural technological learning. Colours correspond to chemical structure classes according to Table 1.

Source data

Knowledge flows between SIB classes reveal emerging technological learning patterns over 2017–2022. Across SIB classes, the PBA class demonstrates the highest upward trend (5% to 13%) but with high volatility, whereas the hard carbon class shows slight increases (5% to 7%) and the polyanionic and layered oxides classes reach stable levels around 10% and 6%, respectively.

Knowledge flows from LIB to SIB classes show persistent trends. The SIB layered oxides and the polyanionic classes maintain consistent flows around 5–8% from LIB classes, whereas the PBA class exhibits volatile patterns (2–25% fluctuation). The hard carbon class represents the only class with clearly declining trends, dropping from initial high flows in 2017 (18%) to stabilized levels of 3–7%.

Our analysis provides insight into three fundamental questions about knowledge interdependencies in metal-ion battery development. First, we find substantial knowledge flows within and across LIB and SIB classes, demonstrating high technological interdependence based on shared knowledge trajectories. Second, we observe substantial knowledge flows at both product and process levels, highlighting the interlinkage of manufacturing and design knowledge across battery chemical structure classes for innovation in emerging battery chemistries. Third, we document persistent cross-structural knowledge flows over time, with emerging battery chemistries showing continued reliance on knowledge from mature metal-ion battery chemistries across different structural classes. The findings strongly indicate that emerging battery chemistries remain technologically interdependent with mature chemistries rather than achieving technological independence.

These knowledge flow patterns observed at the structural class level directly translate to the individual LIB and SIB chemistries. An analysis of patent applicants (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Tables 3–5) reveals pronounced differences in how knowledge flows are shaped across actors in LIB and SIB innovation. In LIB development, both the providers and receivers of knowledge are predominantly large incumbent industrial actors. In contrast, SIB-related knowledge flows involve a more diverse constellation of emerging industrial actors and academic applicants. Collaboration patterns complement these findings: SIB → SIB knowledge flows are predominantly shaped by academia–academia collaboration, LIB → LIB flows are driven by strong industry–industry collaboration and LIB → SIB flows involve a mix of academia–industry collaboration. Most LIB → LIB and SIB → SIB knowledge flows occur across different applicants—exceeding 77% and 90%, respectively. By comparison, nearly half of all LIB → SIB knowledge flows stem from the same applicant, indicating that incumbents frequently build on their own LIB experience when advancing SIB technologies. Within-structure class flows (that is, citations within the same battery structure class) show that around one-quarter of citations occur within the same applicant, whereas cross-structure class flows (that is, citations across different battery structure classes) show only about one-fifth within-applicant citations, with the remainder involving multiple applicants. Our findings have important implications for policy design, technological forecasting and innovation theory, which we discuss below.

For policy design, industrial strategies should treat metal-ion battery chemistries as interdependent technologies, emphasizing support for integrated research and development (R&D) and platform capabilities that exploit manufacturing compatibility and design knowledge across chemistries. Because knowledge flows occur across both product and process innovations, it indicates comprehensive technological knowledge integration. LIBs and SIBs share the same production processes—from electrode manufacturing to cell assembly and formation—meaning that process experience can easily flow across chemistries9,35. However, the systematic citation patterns we observe demonstrate technological interdependencies beyond manufacturing compatibility alone. China's success is consistent with this integrated approach: building comprehensive cross-chemistry capabilities rather than attempting chemistry-specific leap-frogging6. The approach recognizes that competitive advantage stems from mastering the complete technology rather than excelling in isolated chemistry domains. Consequently, newcomers entering SIB markets should expect competitive disadvantages relative to incumbents with established LIB knowledge and must strategically mitigate this position through targeted approaches such as joint ventures, hiring experts with LIB experience or acquiring specific LIB production capabilities.

For technological forecasting, our results have equally important implications for technology modelling. In current modelling approaches some researchers develop distinct experience curves for different metal-ion battery chemistries10,21,22 whereas others apply aggregated curves, producing substantially different projections about market competitiveness and investment priorities23,24,25. Technology forecasts and investment roadmaps that assume independent experience curves for LFP versus NMC or for LIB versus SIB chemistries will systematically underestimate shared learning effects, therefore potentially also underestimating cost declines and misallocating public and private resources. Our findings support implementation of models that recognize cumulative, technology-wide learning trajectories. Modellers should incorporate effects of deployment of one chemistry (for example, LFP) on ‘discounted' learning benefits for related chemistries (for example, NMC, SIB) even without direct deployment. The substantial cross-chemistry knowledge flows we quantify provide empirical basis for calibrating these ‘discounted' deployment factors in energy system models. Effective forecasting should thus model metal-ion battery chemistries as an interconnected technology with shared knowledge base rather than independent technological trajectories.

For innovation theory, our findings imply that a shift to new chemistries does not automatically open new windows of opportunities for new entrants. Leap-frogging strategies assume that new entrants can catch up with incumbents by bypassing previous technological knowledge trajectories and competing directly in next-generation alternatives36,37. However, we show that incumbents compound their advantages by leveraging cross-chemistry design and manufacturing knowledge. For new entrants targeting SIB development without prior LIB expertise, access to critical and often tacit knowledge is limited, creating higher barriers than what the leap-frogging strategy would probably require.

Beyond these sector-specific implications, our methodological approach offers a generalizable method for understanding knowledge interdependencies in technologies beyond batteries. By integrating LLM-based patent classification with temporal citation network analysis, we demonstrate that patent citations can reveal the boundaries of technologies based on the extent of their knowledge base at the core component level. This method can be applied to identify entry barriers and knowledge interdependencies across technologies where the emergence of independent technologies remains uncertain. Whereas similar independencies are expected for chemistries beyond LIB and SIB given the fundamental similarities, generalizability requires investigating alternative battery systems. Future research could extend our analysis to potassium-ion batteries, another monovalent intercalation-type system or aluminium-ion battery, a multivalent intercalation-type system once sufficient patent data becomes available. Additionally, examining systems with substantially different architectures and ion transport mechanisms—including solid-state batteries and conversion-type batteries (for example, lithium-sulfur and lithium-air batteries)—will reveal whether the observed knowledge interdependencies are specific to LIB and SIB chemistries or represent broader patterns of technological learning in battery innovation. Whereas previous research suggests that knowledge spillovers across battery technologies are generally limited26, early LIB developments—particularly for graphite anodes and for electrolytes—have benefited from knowledge generated in other technologies such as zinc and primary batteries38.

In sum, effective industrial policy and useful techno-economic forecasts depend on recognizing and modelling these interdependencies, moving beyond simplified assumptions of technological independence towards more nuanced understandings of how knowledge flows shape competitive dynamics in complex technologies.

We examine technological knowledge flows between monovalent metal-ion battery chemistries using patent citation analysis. Our study focuses specifically on technological knowledge flows rather than organizational or geographical knowledge flows. Technological knowledge flows capture the absorption, evolution and diffusion of technological knowledge between different technological domains, reflecting how technical solutions, material innovations and process improvements flow within and across battery chemistries39. This differs from organizational knowledge flows, which examine knowledge flows between companies or institutions40, and geographical knowledge flows, which track knowledge flows across regions or countries41,42. Our technological focus enables precise analysis of how battery chemistry innovations build upon prior technical knowledge regardless of the organizational or geographical context.

We used patent families as our unit of analysis. Patent families represent single inventions protected in multiple jurisdictions, providing more accurate representation of distinct technological contributions than individual patent documents while eliminating geographical duplication artefacts43,44. Our analysis captures knowledge flows in complete electrode assemblies rather than pure stoichiometric materials—when we reference ‘layered oxide chemistry', we mean the fully engineered battery component, not simply the base crystalline structure. Knowledge flows occur when later patents cite earlier patents as prior art, with such citations serving as evidence of subsequent technological developments that build upon the cited technological knowledge41.

Our analysis operates at three levels to identify patterns behind technological learning. First, we examined knowledge flows at the chemical structure level to understand how chemical similarities influence knowledge trajectories. Second, we analysed innovation types to investigate whether knowledge flow patterns differ systematically when enabling product and process innovations. Third, we assessed temporal evolution to examine the persistence of cross-structural knowledge flows over time and identify whether emerging chemistries develop technological independence. For LIBs, we focused on commercialized battery chemistries with established market presence, whereas for SIBs, we examined the most promising chemistries based on expert consultations and literature review.

We assume that knowledge flows through patent citations can be measured effectively, as patents embody explicit technological knowledge45 that enables tracing of knowledge trajectories41,46. According to Asche (2017)47, approximately 80% of codified technical knowledge is contained in patents, making them a strong indicator for technical knowledge flows. However, this approach has well-documented limitations. Patents do not capture tacit knowledge, which constrains our study's scope48. Additional limitations include potential citation biases, particularly examiner-added citations that may not reflect genuine knowledge use by inventors49, varying patenting strategies across industries and jurisdictions50,51 and the time lag between patent filing and publication6,52. Furthermore, not all knowledge flows result in patent citations, particularly when knowledge flows occur through informal channels, personnel mobility or collaborative research relationships53,54. Despite these limitations, patent citations remain a robust metric for measuring technological knowledge flows because they create a systematic, legally mandated record of technological dependencies and capture knowledge flows across organizational, geographical and temporal boundaries13,41,42, making them particularly suitable for examining knowledge interdependencies within and across battery chemistries.

We selected the The Lens patent database for patent retrieval because it provides comprehensive family-level citation data and full-text patent claims, both essential for our classification and network analysis approach.

We developed comprehensive search strategies combining International Patent Classification (IPC) and Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) codes with targeted keywords in titles, abstracts and patent claims. For LIBs, we built on the validated search strategy from Peiseler et al. (2024)55, which systematically captures LIB innovations across battery chemistries, manufacturing processes and system integration domains. For SIBs, we applied the search strategy from Hemmelder et al. (2025)6, specifically designed for the emerging SIB technological domain. Both strategies originate from peer-reviewed publications and have demonstrated validity in their respective domains. The search strategies employ Boolean operators to combine classification codes with relevant keywords, ensuring comprehensive coverage while minimizing false positives. Complete search queries with Boolean operators, classification codes and keywords are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

We included patent families from four major jurisdictions: Japan Patent Office (JPO), European Patent Office (EPO), US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA). For the established LIBs, we included EPO, JPO and USPTO patent families, which capture innovations with international market relevance and maintain consistency with established patent quality criteria56. For SIBs, we included all four jurisdictions (EPO, JPO, USPTO and CNIPA) to ensure comprehensive coverage, as many SIB innovations remain concentrated in CNIPA filings because the technology lacks established international markets, with most R&D occurring in China6. Whereas our dataset does not include Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) filings directly, cross-jurisdictional analysis shows that 52% of LIB and 5% of SIB patent families have at least one KIPO family member, representing 47% of all analysed families. As many Korean applicants file patent families across the USPTO, JPO and EPO, a substantial portion of influential Korean technological contributions is captured through these triadic filings56.

We applied systematic filters to ensure data quality and relevance. First, we included only families with at least one granted patent in our selected jurisdictions (EPO, JPO and USPTO for LIBs; EPO, JPO, USPTO and CNIPA for SIBs) to ensure patent validity. Second, we retained only families receiving at least one forward citation to enable citation network analysis. Third, we included only families containing at least one patent with English-language claims to enable automated classification. To ensure sufficient sample size and avoid systematic exclusion of Chinese patents, we supplemented original English-language claims with English translations from the Derwent Innovations Index database, which provides professional translations of key patent documents from major patent offices including CNIPA. This filtering process yielded 33,256 LIB and 2,255 SIB patent families suitable for the patent classification step.

We employed GPT-4o via the OpenAI application programming interface (API) for comprehensive multi-level patent classification across four dimensions: battery identification (LIB vs SIB), component classification, specific electrode material identification and innovation-type categorization. We restrict our analysis to intercalation-based LIBs and SIBs with liquid electrolytes, explicitly excluding molten-salt batteries and other alternative battery mechanisms. Complete LLM prompts are detailed in Supplementary Table 2.

Our API configuration was optimized for classification accuracy and consistency through carefully selected parameters: Temperature was set to 0 to ensure deterministic, precise results rather than creative variations, as our task required consistent categorization rather than interpretative flexibility. Maximum tokens were set to 100 for material classification and 50 for LIB/SIB classification, constraining responses to required formats while allowing sufficient space for multi-category assignments. We selected GPT-4o after comparing GPT models, finding it offered the best reasoning capabilities in technical domains for our needs. To handle token length constraints, we truncate patent claims to approximately 1,000 words when full prompts exceed 3,900 tokens, ensuring model compatibility while preserving the most relevant patent information.

We manually validated GPT-4o classification through two independent researchers across several hundred patent families. On the basis of our evaluation, the agreement levels achieved were comparable to what we would expect from human annotators. To ensure reliability, the classification prompt was run multiple times on the same patent data, confirming consistent and deterministic outputs across repeated runs. The classification prompts underwent multiple iterative evaluations and optimizations to achieve this accuracy level. Any systematic classification errors were identified and corrected through prompt refinement.

We developed a hierarchical classification system to enable precise tracking of knowledge flows between specific technological domains. Patent families underwent initial battery classification (LIB vs SIB), followed by categorization across three primary dimensions:

For LIBs, we identified positive electrode materials including LCO, NMC, NCA, LMO, LFP and category for other positive electrode materials. Negative electrode materials included graphite, LTO, silicon/carbon composites and other negative electrode materials. These categories represent primary commercialized LIB chemistries with established market presence57.

For SIBs, positive electrode materials included Fe-PBA, Mn-PBA, NVPF, NFP/NFPP, NFM, CFM, NMO and other positive electrode materials. The primary negative electrode material was hard carbon (non-graphitizing carbon with disordered structure and d-spacing >0.37 nm (ref. 58)) plus other negative electrode materials. These categories represent the most promising SIB chemistries based on our expert consultations and comprehensive literature review.

Patents were further classified by their primary technological focus: positive electrode-related innovations, negative electrode-related innovations, electrolyte (electrolyte formulations, additives, solvents) or cell-level innovations (full cell designs, packaging, system integration).

Patents were finally categorized as product innovations (new materials, electrode architectures, cell designs, novel compositions), process innovations (manufacturing methods, production techniques, processing procedures, coating methods) or mixed innovations addressing product and process aspects simultaneously. This classification enables analysis of whether knowledge flow mechanisms differ systematically between innovation categories.

Patent families that were identified as innovating in multiple specific battery chemistries, such as those, for instance, describing calendering processes relevant to NMC, LFP and LCO chemistries simultaneously, were assigned to all relevant categories. Consequently, knowledge flows in our networks were counted multiple times (for example, flows from NMC to target, LFP to target, and LCO to target for the same patent family being cited (knowledge provider)).

We constructed directed citation networks mapping knowledge flows through forward patent citations between all patent family members. Only citation links between patent families included in the validated LIB/SIB core dataset were considered; citations to patent families outside this dataset—representing other battery technologies or unrelated technological domains—were excluded to maintain focus on knowledge flows between LIB and SIB chemistries. The core dataset was constructed using broad, validated initial search strategies followed by an LLM-based classification step, which removed false positives (52% of the original LIB set and 20% of the original SIB set) while ensuring comprehensive coverage of true LIB (n = 16,007) and SIB (n = 1,791) patent families. We constructed three separate network types: positive electrode material networks, negative electrode material networks and cross-electrode knowledge flow networks (capturing bidirectional flows between positive and negative electrode innovations). This separation enables analysis of whether knowledge flows differ systematically between electrode types and whether innovations in one electrode type influence innovations in the other.

Our analysis is limited to patent families that refer to one or more battery chemistries based on electrode active materials. Consequently, a substantial portion of the overall LIB and SIB patent dataset is excluded from network analysis, including system-level patents, patents focused on non-electrode components (current collectors, tabs, separators) and patents addressing general battery architectures without specific electrode material focus. This limitation ensures that knowledge flows are analysed specifically between identifiable battery chemistries rather than across heterogeneous patent categories.

For each citation relationship, we identified the citing patent family, the cited patent family, their respective battery chemistry classifications and temporal relationships. We aggregated these individual citation relationships to construct material-level knowledge flow networks, where edges represent the cumulative citation relationships between different battery chemistry categories. Edge weights correspond to the total number of citation relationships between chemistry pairs, enabling quantitative analysis of knowledge flow intensities.

Networks employ material-year nodes, where each node represents a specific battery chemistry in a particular year. Node size reflects the number of patent families per material-year combination, providing visual indication of technological activity levels. Colour coding corresponds to chemical structure classes as detailed in Table 1 (colour column), enabling visual identification of knowledge flow patterns across structurally related chemistries.

Citation networks inherently capture temporal knowledge flows, as patents can only cite prior inventions, creating chronologically directed knowledge flow pathways. We examined citations across all available data spanning from the earliest patents in our dataset through April 2025. Recent years require careful interpretation due to systematic time lags between patent filing, publication and subsequent citation by later patents. Patents typically become citable 18 months after filing6,44,59, with meaningful citation patterns emerging several additional years later, particularly for emerging batteries such as SIBs.

Different battery chemistries exhibit vastly different patent volumes and citation patterns, making absolute citation counts incomparable across battery chemistries. Established LIB chemistries such as LCO accumulated thousands of patents over decades, whereas emerging SIB chemistries such as NVPF have hundreds of patents from recent years. Raw citation counts would inherently bias towards older, more established chemistries regardless of actual knowledge flow intensity or relevance. We developed a systematic two-step normalization methodology to enable meaningful comparison across chemical structure classes with varying citation volumes and technological maturity levels.

We quantify knowledge flows by calculating the percentage of knowledge each battery class (knowledge receiver) receives from other battery classes (knowledge providers) relative to the receiver's total knowledge base. Specifically, for each receiving class, we calculate the proportion of all backward citations obtained from each providing class across all time periods. The total knowledge base for each receiving class includes all backward citations ever received by all patent families within that battery structure class.

with:

\({\mathrm{KF}}_{i\to j}\) = Percentage of knowledge that flows from battery class i (knowledge provider) to battery class \(j\) (knowledge receiver)

\({C}_{j\to i,t}\) = Number of citations from battery class \(j\) (citing patent families) to battery class i (cited patent families) in years \(t\)

\({\sum }_{k}{\sum }_{t}{C}_{j\to k,t}\) = All time backward citations made by battery class \(j\) across all technological domains

\(j\) = Citing battery class (knowledge receiver)

i = Cited battery class (knowledge provider)

\(k\) = All cited patent families (knowledge providers) across all technological domains (including i)

\(t\) = Time index

This approach addresses the fundamental question: ‘of all the knowledge this class has ever received through patent citations, what percentage originated from each of the other classes?' The resulting percentages provide a comprehensive view of knowledge dependencies that accounts for differences in patent and citation volumes across battery classes.

Raw percentages require contextual interpretation because absolute values can be misleading. A 3% knowledge flow from one battery class to another may appear modest but becomes substantial if the receiving class obtains only 5% of its total knowledge from itself (within-chemistry flow). Because battery classes are expected to exhibit strongest learning from their own prior patents, this represents a natural baseline for comparison. We normalize cross-structural knowledge flows against within-structural knowledge flows to assess whether the flow of knowledge between different classes is high or low relative to expected baseline levels.

with:

\({\mathrm{RKF}}_{i\to j}\) = Relative knowledge flow intensity from battery class i (knowledge provider) to battery class \(j\) (knowledge receiver)

\({\mathrm{KF}}_{i\to j}\) = Percentage of knowledge that flows from battery class i (knowledge provider) to battery class \(j\) (knowledge receiver) (equation (1))

\({\mathrm{KF}}_{j\to j}\) = Percentage of within-structural knowledge that flows from battery class \(j\) (knowledge provider) to battery class \(j\) (knowledge receiver) (self-citations within battery class \(j\))

This normalization produces relative knowledge flow intensities where diagonal elements (self-citations within identical chemical classes) equal 100%, and off-diagonal elements represent the strength of cross-structural knowledge flows compared to within-structural knowledge flows.

\({\mathrm{RKF}}_{i\to j}\) = 100% = Battery class \(j\) receives equal knowledge from battery class i and from itself (diagonal element always equal 100%, self-citation)

\({\mathrm{RKF}}_{i\to j}\)> 100% = Battery class \(j\) receives more knowledge from battery class i than from itself

\({\mathrm{RKF}}_{i\to j}\)< 100% = Battery class \(j\) receives less knowledge from battery class i than from itself

To examine whether knowledge flow mechanisms differ between innovation types, we further subdivided the already battery structure-classified patent families by innovation type into three categories: product-related innovations, process-related innovations and innovations addressing both aspects simultaneously. We calculated knowledge flow percentages using a receiver-specific normalization approach: for each receiver class and innovation-type combination, we determined the total backward citations (citations made by the receiver) as the normalization denominator. The knowledge flow percentage from each provider class was then calculated as the citation count from receiver to provider divided by the receiver's total backward citations, multiplied by 100. Provider classes were aggregated across all innovation types, whereas receiver classes were split by innovation type (product, process, mixed). For intra-battery flows (LIB → LIB, SIB → SIB), within-structural citations were excluded to focus on cross-structural knowledge flows. This approach enables direct comparison of knowledge flow patterns across different types of technological innovation within and across battery classes, with percentages representing the proportion of each receiver's total knowledge intake derived from specific provider classes.

For time-dependent examination of knowledge flows, we calculated annual backward citation counts from receiver classes to provider classes using a receiver-specific normalization approach. For each receiver class in each year, we determined the total backward citations (citations made by the receiver to all providers) as the normalization denominator. We then calculated the proportion of backward citations from receivers to specific provider groups (for example, all LIB classes excluding the receiver for intra-LIB flows or all LIB classes for LIB-to-SIB flows) relative to each receiver's total backward citations in that year. We analysed three types of knowledge flow: (1) from all LIB classes (excluding receiver) to individual LIB receivers, (2) from all LIB classes to individual SIB receivers and (3) from all SIB classes (excluding receiver) to individual SIB receivers. Values represent the percentage share of each receiver's total knowledge intake derived from the specified provider groups in each year, enabling assessment of knowledge flow consistency and evolution patterns while controlling for differences in citation volumes across classes and time periods.

Knowledge flow patterns are visualized through multiple approaches. Heat maps display relative knowledge flow intensities between battery structure classes, with colour intensity representing flow strength relative to within-structural baselines. Sankey diagrams illustrate relative knowledge flow intensities disaggregated by innovation type (product, process, mixed), with flow thickness proportional to relative knowledge flow values between battery structure pairs. Temporal knowledge flow evolution is presented through scatter plots showing normalized annual citation counts over time, where values are normalized to each knowledge receiver's latest available year citation count (reference = 1.0), accompanied by linear trend lines to identify increasing or decreasing temporal patterns.

Researchers in China have created a more efficient strategy for producing natural killer (NK) cells for use in cancer immunotherapy.

NK cells play a critical role in the body's early defense against viruses and cancer, along with other immune functions. Because of their natural ability to detect and destroy abnormal cells, they are an attractive tool for cancer treatment. In chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK therapy, scientists equip NK cells with a lab-designed receptor (a CAR) so they can recognize a specific marker on cancer cells and attack them more precisely.

Traditional CAR-NK approaches usually depend on mature NK cells collected from sources such as peripheral blood or cord blood. This method presents several obstacles, including wide variability between cells, limited efficiency during genetic modification, high production costs, and lengthy preparation times.

Stem Cell-Derived NK Cells From Cord Blood

A team led by Prof. WANG Jinyong at the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed a different approach. Instead of modifying mature NK cells, the researchers started with CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) taken from cord blood. From these early-stage cells, they generated induced (that is, lab-generated) NK (iNK) cells as well as CAR-engineered iNK (CAR-iNK) cells.

The findings were published in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

Earlier efforts to produce NK cells from cord blood-derived CD34+ HSPCs struggled with low efficiency and immature cell function. To address these limitations, the team moved the genetic engineering step earlier in development, working directly at the CD34+ HSPC stage. This strategy combined CAR transduction, strong expansion of progenitor cells, and guided commitment to the NK lineage.

Three-Step Expansion and Differentiation Process

The researchers used a three-stage system. First, they expanded CD34+ HSPCs (or CD19 CAR-transduced HSPCs) with the help of irradiated AFT024 feeder cells. Within 14 days, the cells multiplied roughly 800- to 1,000-fold.

Next, the expanded cells were cultured with OP9 feeder cells to create artificial hematopoietic organoid aggregates, structures that support efficient NK lineage commitment and development.

In the final stage, cells that had committed to becoming NK cells were allowed to mature and multiply further. This process produced highly pure iNK or CAR-iNK cells that expressed endogenous CD16.

Massive Cell Output From a Single Stem Cell

The team found that a single CD34+ HSPC could generate as many as 14 million iNK cells or 7.6 million CAR-iNK cells. The researchers estimate that one-fifth of a typical cord blood unit could theoretically yield enough cells for thousands or even tens of thousands of treatment doses.

Another major improvement was the sharp reduction in viral vector needed for CAR engineering. Compared with the amount usually required to modify mature NK cells, this method used only about ~1/140,000 (by Day 42 of culture) to ~1/600,000 (by Day 49) as much viral vector.

Strong Tumor Killing in Leukemia Models

In laboratory testing, both iNK and CAR-iNK cells demonstrated powerful tumor-killing ability. In cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models of human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), CD19 CAR-iNK cells reduced tumor growth and extended the animals' survival.

According to the researchers, the new approach not only improves the efficiency of producing iNK and CAR-iNK cells but also significantly lowers the cost of CAR engineering.

Understanding the complexity of reaction mechanisms is pivotal for advancing scientific and engineering solutions. This study addresses the challenge of distinguishing between slow and fast species in high-dimensional reaction mechanism, where direct analytical solutions are intractable. Through a hybrid approach combining analytical derivations and computational techniques including numerical simulations via MATLAB toolboxes we elucidate the kinetic behavior of species, quantify parameter sensitivities and calculating Surface Bifurcation. This paper provides a comprehensive examination of complex reaction mechanisms. The findings based on the analysis of the elementary steps involved in product formation show that, the hydrogen-assisted propagation step offers the dominant net contribution, while the direct radical recombination step stays close to equilibrium. The relative availability of molecular hydrogen, reactive radicals, and product-driven reverse reactions control step dominance. The integration of computational modeling with analytical insights not only clarifies reaction dynamics but also facilitates the optimization of reaction conditions and the design of efficient analytical frameworks. This work highlights the critical role of model reduction strategies in demystifying complex systems, offering a robust foundation for future innovations in sustainable technology and industrial applications.

Griptape, a Seattle-based startup founded in 2023 by former Amazon Web Services executives, has been acquired by Foundry, a London-based company whose software is used in visual effects and animation across Hollywood. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 

Griptape built a platform that helps companies securely manage and coordinate multiple AI models and agents. Foundry said the deal will boost its push into AI-powered production tools. 

“By bringing Griptape into Foundry, we can provide the tools our customers want to realize their creative vision more efficiently, while retaining control,” Foundry CEO Jody Madden said in a press release.

Griptape initially pitched itself as an enterprise-grade alternative to frameworks such as LangChain. The startup, which works with several production studios, raised a $12.5 million round in 2023. Investors include Seattle-area firm Fuse, as well as Acequia Capital, Crosslink Capital, Range Ventures, and Peterson Ventures. The company has 22 employees, according to LinkedIn.

Roche spent more than eight years at AWS. He previously founded 2lemetry, an IoT startup that Amazon acquired in 2015. 

Vasily Vasinov, the company's co-founder and former CTO, left Griptape in 2025.

After years spent finding and investigating data breaches, Greg Pollock admits that when he comes across yet another exposed database full of passwords and Social Security numbers, “I come to it with some fatigue.” But Pollock, director of research at the cybersecurity company UpGuard, says he and his colleagues found an exposed, publicly accessible database online in January that appeared to contain a trove of Americans' sensitive personal data so massive that his weariness lifted and they sprang to action to validate the finding.

The UpGuard researchers point out that not all of the records represent unique, valid information, but the raw totals they found in the January exposure included roughly 3 billion email addresses and passwords as well as about 2.7 billion records that included Social Security numbers. It was unclear who had set up the database, but it seemed to contain personal details that may have been cobbled together from multiple historic data breaches—including, perhaps, the trove from the 2024 breach of the background-checking service National Public Data. It is common for data brokers and cybercriminals to combine and recombine old datasets, but the scale and the potential quantity of Social Security numbers—even if only a fraction of them were real—was striking.

“Every week, there's another finding where it looks big on paper, but it's probably not very novel,” Pollock says. “So I was surprised when I started digging into the specific cases here to validate the data. In some cases, the identities in this data breach are at risk because they have been exposed, but they have not yet been exploited.”

The data was hosted by the German cloud provider Hetzner. Since Pollock could not identify an owner of the database to contact, he notified Hetzner on January 16. The company, in turn, said it notified its customer, which removed the data on January 21.

Hetzner did not provide WIRED with comment ahead of publication.

The researchers did not download the entire dataset for analysis due to its size and sensitivity. Instead they worked with a sample of 2.8 million records—a tiny fraction of the total trove. By analyzing trends in the data, including the popularity of certain cultural references in passwords, they concluded that much of the data likely dates to the United States in roughly 2015. For example, passwords referencing One Direction, Fall Out Boy, and Taylor Swift were very common. Meanwhile, references to Blackpink, Katseye, and Btsarmy were just barely beginning to show up.

Old data is still valuable for two reasons. First, people often reuse the same email address and password, or a variation of the password, across many different websites and services. This means that cybercriminals can keep trying the same login credentials for the same people over time. The second reason is that people's Social Security numbers are often linked to their most sensitive and high-stakes data but almost never change during their lifetimes. As a result, valid SSNs are one of the crown jewels of identity theft for attackers.

In the sample of data the researchers reviewed, Pollock says that one in four Social Security numbers appeared to be valid and legitimate. The sample was too small to extrapolate to the entire dataset, but a quarter of all the records containing SSNs would be 675 million. A fraction of that would still represent a very significant set of Social Security numbers.

To verify the data, UpGuard researchers contacted a handful of people whose data appeared in the leaked trove. Pollock emphasizes that one of the most concerning findings from speaking to those individuals was that not all of them have had their identities stolen or suffered hacks. In other words, there was information in the database that has not been exploited by cybercriminals—and potential victims don't necessarily know that their information has been exposed.

The finding is a reminder, Pollock says, of how incidents like the 2015 US Office of Personnel Management breach or the 2017 breach of credit bureau Equifax create a long tail of uncertainty for anyone whose data was stolen. Similarly, he notes that recent erosion of safeguards that separated data within the US federal government creates privacy and security risks.

“I do not at all think this is the data the DOGE group mishandled, but I do think that's another example of how mistakes in how you handle data can have impacts for decades,” he says. “These are land mines that have been put down and then are dangerous forever.”

Snap's direct revenue business has reached a $1 billion annualized revenue run rate, the company announced on Wednesday. Annualized revenue refers to a business's current revenue rate projected over a full year. The social media giant says the milestone is driven by its Snapchat+ offering, which has now surpassed 25 million subscribers.

Launched in 2022, Snapchat+ gives subscribers access to exclusive and pre-release features for $3.99 per month. Following a successful launch, Snap introduced additional paid tiers beyond the core Snapchat+ subscription over the past year to further diversify its revenue streams.

“Snapchat+ has become one of the fastest-growing consumer subscription services globally, with subscriber growth every quarter,” the company wrote in a blog post. “What started as an early-access program for our most engaged Snapchatters has quickly scaled into a meaningful business—one that now represents a strong and growing revenue stream alongside our ads business.”

Last June, Snapchat launched Lens+, which gives users access to exclusive Lenses and AR experiences, along with the perks in the standard Snapchat+ tier, for $8.99 per month. 

In early 2025, the company launched an ad-free Snapchat+ subscription tier called Platinum for $15.99 per month. And, in a controversial move in September, Snapchat announced plans to cap free storage for its Memories feature and launched a paid storage plan that costs $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ subscribers will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB.

Moving beyond Snapchat+, the company announced yesterday that it's launching creator subscriptions in alpha with select people in the U.S. Users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscriptions, which will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator's public Stories, and an ad-free experience for that creator's Stories.

In terms of the future, Snap says it's going to continue to grow Snapchat+ with a focus on customization and community-driven features. 

Snap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, and rival Meta is following suit, as the company told TechCrunch last month that it was going to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.

It's been a while since IDW's ongoing Star Trek comic wrapped up a blockbuster run, and in the meantime the publisher has been delivering a plethora of other series set across the Trek timeline. But now that Star Trek is turning 60 this year, it's time for the main book to boldly go once more… and a deliver a story that fans have been waiting for.

io9 can exclusively confirm that later this year, IDW will celebrate Star Trek‘s big anniversary with a relaunch of its main Trek title with a new creative team and storyline—as well as an accompanying sister series—that will follow the adventures of the USS Enterprise-G and its captain, Seven of Nine, after the events of Star Trek: Picard‘s final season and pick up on fan demand to see the 25th-century adventures of the latest addition to the venerable line of starships Enterprise.

Written by Christopher Cantwell, with art by Dennis Menheere and lettering by Jodie Troutman, the new Star Trek ongoing will see Seven lead the Enterprise on a top-secret mission to a hidden region of space, beyond the four charted quadrants of the Star Trek galaxy as we know it, to investigate a mysterious power that threatens to unravel the Federation.

“As we look back on 60 years of Star Trek, we celebrate a story universe that has actually always been about looking forward—a shared dream swirling within the daunting wonder and awe of the stars,” Cantwell said in a statement provided to io9. “I discovered Star Trek at the age of 10 and my life was never the same. The worlds, the people, the stories that wrestled with the work it takes to build community and consensus, to establish and hold sacred values like peace and harmony, the tenuousness of truce amid a galaxy of agendas and perspectives. That is the magic of Star Trek—the kaleidoscopic wonder of its complex themes and notions.”

“In building a brand new Star Trek adventure, we seek to do just that: create something brand new, something that looks entirely forward into the hope of the complete—and at times frightening—unknown, all as our ensemble of characters stands shoulder to shoulder, facing the expanse of an adventure never dared before,” Cantwell continued. “There is an abundance of incredible mythos that Star Trek has given us over six decades, but with this launch we seek to shed that past even as we embrace its best qualities.”

But the new mainline isn't the only comic story we're getting set in that familiar timeframe. Launching in October of this year, the main Star Trek series will be joined by Star Trek: Zero Point, written by someone very familiar to longtime io9 audiences: Hugo Award-winning novelist and site co-founder Charlie Jane Anders. Zero Point will be set during the time Seven of Nine has taken the Enterprise beyond the reaches of the known galaxy and will follow another familiar face: her partner Raffi Musiker, who has been tasked with leading a new crew aboard a starship tasked with a similarly risky endeavor: using a new predictive artificial intelligence built to (wearing a mysterious, but familiar face) be the vanguard defending the Federation from the threats of tomorrow before they even begin.

“I've loved Star Trek for as long as I can remember—literally, some of my earliest memories are of wearing a homemade Starfleet uniform and waiting to get beamed up,” Anders added in a statement to io9. “I'm putting all my favorite Trek things into this comic: problem solving, ethical dilemmas, identity crises, and above all, chosen family.”

“At the same time, I'm determined to write a Trek comic that newbies can read with no homework required: there are no easter eggs, no callbacks to deep lore,” Anders concluded. “Anyone who loves Becky Chambers or Martha Wells ought to be able to pick up this comic and get a fun science fiction story about artificial consciousness and exoplanets. Also, I'm talking to tons of physicists to get the most accurate science I can into this comic. I'm having the time of my life.”

Those won't be the only Trek comics coming this year, of course. Two new celebratory one-shots will also release in May and September. The first coming in May, Star Trek: Celebrations 2026, sees the return of IDW's pride anthology, celebrating LGBTQIA+ characters from across the franchise with stories from queer creatives. You can check out a few of the variant covers featuring a few of those characters and couples below!

A few months later in September, timed around Trek‘s actual anniversary date, is a 50-page Star Trek 60th Anniversary Special, which will unite a plethora of Star Trek comics creatives—including Dana Gould, Ryan North & Derek Charm, David Walker, Megan Camerena, and more, with covers by Michael Cho, John Tyler Christopher, Chris Fenoglio, and others—to tell stories drawn from across the last 60 years of Star Trek storytelling.

We'll bring you more on IDW's plans for Star Trek‘s big year as and when we learn them.

Microsoft has confirmed that a bug allowed its Copilot AI to summarize customers' confidential emails for weeks without permission.

The bug, first reported by Bleeping Computer, allowed Copilot Chat to read and outline the contents of emails since January, even if customers had data loss prevention policies to prevent ingesting their sensitive information into Microsoft's large language model.

Copilot Chat allows paying Microsoft 365 customers to use the AI-powered chat feature in its Office software products, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Microsoft said the bug, trackable by admins as CW1226324, means that draft and sent email messages “with a confidential label applied are being incorrectly processed by Microsoft 365 Copilot chat.” 

The tech giant said it began rolling out a fix for the bug earlier in February. A spokesperson for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment, including a question about how many customers are affected by the bug.

Earlier this week, the European Parliament's IT department told lawmakers that it blocked the built-in AI features on their work-issued devices, citing concerns that the AI tools could upload potentially confidential correspondence to the cloud.

OpenAI is expanding its footprint in India and moving into the country's higher-education system through partnerships with leading academic institutions. The move comes as the South Asian nation seeks to scale AI skills and build domestic capacity in one of the world's largest talent markets.

On Wednesday, OpenAI said it was partnering with six public and private higher-education institutions in India, including top engineering, management, medical, and design-focused institutes, with the aim of reaching more than 100,000 students, faculty, and staff over the next year.

Rather than focusing on consumer use, the initiative centers on integrating AI into core academic functions, signalling OpenAI's interest in influencing how AI is taught, governed, and normalized within one of the world's largest higher-education systems. 

OpenAI has already built a large consumer audience for its ChatGPT chatbot, which has over 100 million monthly active users in India, according to CEO Sam Altman, and India has emerged as the company's second-largest user base after the U.S. The announcement also coincides with a broader push by leading AI firms to deepen their presence in India, which is hosting an AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week.

The first cohort of partners includes some of India's most influential academic institutions, such as the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, alongside private universities and specialised design schools. The ChatGPT maker said the partnerships would span disciplines ranging from engineering and management to healthcare and creative fields.

India has already emerged as a key testing ground for AI use in education. Last month, Google said India accounts for the highest global usage of its Gemini tools for learning. Microsoft, similarly, said this week it would expand its Elevate skilling program in India to train teachers across schools, vocational institutes, and higher-education settings, working with government agencies as part of a broader push to build AI skills at scale.

OpenAI said the partnerships would involve campus-wide access to its ChatGPT Edu tools, faculty training, and responsible-use frameworks. The focus, the company said, is on embedding AI into core academic workflows such as coding, research, analytics, and case analysis, rather than offering standalone access to tools.

Two of the partner institutions, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Manipal Academy of Higher Education, will also introduce OpenAI-backed certifications. Additionally, OpenAI said it would work with Indian ed-tech platforms, including PhysicsWallah, upGrad, and HCL GUVI, to extend AI training beyond campuses. These platforms will launch structured courses on AI fundamentals and ChatGPT use cases, aimed at students and early-career professionals.

Raghav Gupta, head of education at OpenAI India, said educational institutions were a “critical route” to closing the gap between rapidly advancing AI tools and how people are actually using them, as skills demands shift across the economy.

Last year, OpenAI hired Gupta, a former Coursera Asia-Pacific managing director, as its India and Asia-Pacific head of education, alongside the launch of a Learning Accelerator programme focused on expanding AI skills.

The flurry of moves into education underscores how AI companies are increasingly looking beyond consumer tools and corporate clients toward institutions that shape skills, norms, and long-term adoption. For countries like India, the contest is not just around access to AI, but also about who helps define how it is taught, governed, and embedded at scale.

“We've raised a pile of money, and we're building a product.”

That's the characteristically deadpan announcement Wednesday morning from Corey Quinn, the cloud cost consultant who has built a second career, basically, on his sharp and irreverent takes on Amazon Web Services in his popular podcasts and newsletters.

Duckbill, the consulting firm that Quinn co-founded with Mike Julian, is making what amounts to a high-stakes pivot: transforming into a software company with a new platform called Skyway that aims to make cloud spending more predictable for large companies.

The company, based in San Francisco, announced $7.75 million in funding from Heavybit, Uncork Capital, and Encoded Ventures to accelerate product development and grow its 10-person team.

Their contrarian pitch: the cloud cost management industry, aka FinOps, is fixated on making bills smaller, when the real problem is that nobody can predict what the costs will be next month.

“Finance doesn't lose sleep over whether your cloud bill is $1 million or $100 million,” Quinn said in a news release. “They lose sleep when it jumps 30% and nobody can explain why.”

Julian, Duckbill's CEO, said in an interview that the company came to realize that existing cloud cost management tools are built by startups, for startups, for the most part. Many of Duckbill's large enterprise clients had tried those tools, rejected them, and ended up building their own.

“I have a hypothesis that the people building in FinOps today come from startups and not from enterprise, so they don't even know many of the problems exist,” Julian said. 

Duckbill's clients, which include companies such as Airtable, Ticketmaster, and New Relic, spend $70 million a year on cloud infrastructure, on average. (Tagline for their consulting business: “Cloud cost management for the nine-figure club.”) That's well above the $1 million annual minimum that AWS requires for a private pricing contract. At that scale, Julian said, you start to see patterns and problems that don't exist for smaller companies.

All told, the company says it has negotiated tens of billions of dollars in cloud contracts, giving it unique insights. (“Our schlep is our moat,” reads one of its internal whiteboards.)

Skyway's first module, called Contract Manager, converts private pricing deals into structured data, validating that customers are getting discounts they negotiated, and projecting spending.

The bigger vision extends well beyond AWS. Duckbill started with a specialization in Amazon's cloud platform but has expanded into Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Julian said the ultimate goal is to structure spending data across every piece of software and infrastructure a company uses: SaaS tools like Datadog and Snowflake, AI providers like Anthropic and OpenAI, and even legacy data centers for customers still using their own mainframes.

Julian acknowledged that the pivot into software will eventually cannibalize a portion of Duckbill's consulting business, but said he doesn't expect it to disappear entirely. Big companies need services, he said, pointing to companies like ServiceNow and CrowdStrike that built major software businesses while maintaining significant services revenue.

The market for cloud cost management technology is crowded, and difficult. The latest casualty: Spokane-area startup Vega Cloud, which entered receivership after raising millions in financing. 

But Julian contends that it's not really one market. Companies like Point5 focus on workload optimization. Others like Finout specialize in cost allocation. He sees Duckbill as doing something different: building financial planning and forecasting software for infrastructure.

Duckbill isn't using artificial intelligence in its own product yet. This will not surprise anyone familiar with Quinn's aversion to industry hype. However, by bringing structure to messy spending data, Skyway is positioned to create what Julian calls “AI candy” — clean, labeled information that customers can put to use in their own systems.

At the same time, AI is making it harder to predict cloud costs. 

“Cloud spend is already one of the largest and least predictable line items in the enterprise,” said Joseph Ruscio, general partner at Heavybit, one of the firms backing Duckbill's pivot, in the press release announcing the funding. “AI infrastructure is about to compound that volatility.”

Duckbill currently has 10 employees and plans to grow to 15 by the end of the current quarter and 20 by year-end, with most of the new hires in engineering. The company also hired Jim Moses, who previously worked at AWS as a private pricing negotiator, as director of hyperscaler strategy, essentially putting someone from the other side of the table on their team.

It's not the first time Quinn and Julian have tried to build a product. In 2022, Duckbill attempted to make the leap from services to software. It was an “abject failure,” as Quinn acknowledged in a video discussion with Julian, released by the company as part of the announcement.

“Turns out that if you just assume you know what customers want and don't talk to them, you're gonna go somewhere, but not where you wanted to go,” he said.

In addition to its website, Quinn noted, Duckbill can be reached at 833-AWS-BILL.

“He is not joking,” Julian said.

U.S.-based Almeida Law Group, which specializes in class-action litigation, has filed a lawsuit against Lenovo, alleging that Lenovo transferred large amounts of data to China. According to the lawsuit [PDF], the company's actions violate the U.S. Department of Justice's Data Security Program, which prevents the transfer of large amounts of sensitive personal data to “countries of concern” or “covered persons.” Lenovo has denied the allegations.

“The DOJ Rule was thus implemented to prevent adversarial countries from acquiring large quantities of behavioral data which could be used to surveil, analyze, or exploit American citizens' behavior,” the lawsuit said. It also added, “In direct violation of the DOJ Rule, Lenovo—through its automated advertising infrastructure and associated databases—transmits Plaintiff's and potentially millions of other American consumers' data to China.”

The Plaintiff here refers to one Spencer Christy of San Francisco, California, and “all other similarly situated,” with the case alleging that Lenovo and its Chinese parent company linked his “browsing activity to his identity, track his behaviors, and build detailed profiles reflecting his interests, locations, habits and other private attributes.” It further said that the data is more than just an invasion of privacy, but “a direct threat to national security as it greatly increases the potential for coercion, reputational harm, and/or blackmail.”

Lenovo is far from the only company gathering such data, but the U.S. entity's parent, Lenovo Group Limited, is incorporated in Hong Kong, with its headquarters located in Beijing, China. Furthermore, its largest shareholder is Legend Holdings Corporation, a Beijing-based investment firm established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a state institution of the People's Republic of China.

So, aside from being based in one of the “countries of concern,” it also falls squarely under the “covered persons” provision of the DOJ regulation which include “individuals who either reside in ‘countries of concern' or are controlled by entities in those countries or (ii) entities that are organized or chartered under the laws of, or have their principal place of business in, a country of concern, or are owned 50% or more by such entities.” More than that, the lawsuit asserts that Lenovo Group is subject to Chinese regulations like the National Intelligence Law, Cybersecurity Law, and Data Security Law, which compel individuals and institutions to cooperate with the authorities when asked for data.

When asked for comment, Lenovo told The Register, “Any suggestion that Lenovo improperly shares customer data is false. We take data privacy and security seriously and comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations globally, including stringent U.S. requirements. Our data practices are transparent, lawful, and designed to protect our customers.”

Heron Power, founded by former Tesla executive Drew Baglino, announced on Wednesday that it has raised $140 million to build gigawatts worth of solid-state transformers for data centers and the grid.

It's a fast turnaround for the startup, which raised a $38 million Series A in May. Baglino said Heron Power didn't need the money, but after customers expressed interest in buying more than 40 gigawatts of solid-state transformers, it decided to raise again. 

“If our customers are leaning in, we need to lean in as well,” Baglino, who is CEO of Heron Power, told TechCrunch. “We gotta go faster.”

The speed at which Heron Power is raising shows just how data centers are driving demand for products that can rapidly deliver electricity to their servers. Baglino, who spent nearly two decades at Tesla and led the powertrain and energy groups, is no stranger to moving quickly.

The Series B round was led by Andreessen Horowitz's American Dynamism Fund and Breakthrough Energy Ventures with participation from Capricorn Investment Group, Energy Impact Partners, Gigascale Capital, and Valor Atreides AI Fund.

Solid-state transformers have been under development more than a decade, but only recently have matured to the point where they are ready to deploy in data centers and other large, energy-intensive facilities.

The new technology seeks to replace old iron-core transformers, which have existed in essentially the same form for more than a century. Iron-core transformers are inexpensive and efficient, but they are bulky and generate lots of heat. Solid-state transformers are smaller and can also more efficient by replacing several pieces of equipment, solving two of data center developers' biggest challenges. 

Solid-state transformers can also manage power intelligently, including from a range of electricity sources like wind, solar, and batteries, because they use semiconductors instead of passive metal.

The startup's solid-state transformers, branded as Heron Link, can convert medium voltage electricity to the 800-volt power needed by Nvidia's reference rack designs. They're capable of handling 5 megawatts a piece, and each device contains tens of modules that do the power conversion. If one fails, it can be swapped out in about 10 minutes, far faster than it takes to replace a monolithic transformer.

Each Heron Link also contains specialized lithium-ion batteries that can discharge quickly to provide 30 seconds of power to smooth the transition to backup power sources like grid-scale batteries, allowing data centers to eliminate uninterruptible power supplies. 

By eliminating pieces of equipment, solid-state transformers also eliminate several points of failure and reduce costs. “We can remove 70% of the gear involved,” Baglino said. “For some data center applications, it might be savings of an order of magnitude.”

Data centers are only about a third of Heron Power's business currently, Baglino said. The remainder is split between solar power and grid-scale batteries, which benefit from solid-state transformers' speed and flexibility.

Heron Power plans to use the new funding to build a factory capable of producing 40-gigawatts of Heron Link transformers annually. That's about 10% to 15% of annual production outside of China (or about 5% to 10% of total global demand), the equivalent to half the peak power demand of the state of Texas. 

Baglino said the company intends to begin pilot production in early 2027 before ramping production over the following two years. 

Heron Power isn't alone in developing solid-state transformers, and with many of the grid's old transformers approaching replacement age, competition will be stiff. The startup's new cash haul paired with Baglino's experience scaling production could give it an advantage. “We will push as hard as we can,” he said.

A collaboration between TU Wien and Cerabyte has established a new Guinness World Record for creating and reading the smallest ever QR codes. These QR codes feature 49nm pixels, making them less than half the size (37%) of the previous record holder. Furthermore, the codes are smaller than bacteria, says a press release from TU Wien, in comparison. Beyond the headlining world record achievement, these tiny QR codes will propel Cerabyte's ceramic storage to even greater densities.

QR codes are everywhere in 2026, but these tiny world record holders are too small to be seen by the naked eye, or even read using an optical microscope. The TU Wein and Cerabyte team's codes measure just 1.98 square micrometers. An electron microscope is required to read them.

This may not be the smallest QR code that it is possible to make, but, importantly, they hit the sweet spot between microscopic size, stability, and durability – according to the collaborative academic and commercial teams. Using this 49nm pixel size, “We have created a tiny, but stable and repeatedly readable QR code,” underlines Prof. Paul Mayrhofer from the Institute of Materials Science and Technology at TU Wien.

 




So, what kind of storage density can the world record-breaking advance deliver? Using the new tiniest QR code technology, it would be possible to produce a single-layer film at A4 size with over 2TB of storage.

The researchers and Cerabyte stress that the bacteria-sized QR codes retain several advantages compared to other storage technologies in widespread use today. Milled into a thin ceramic layer, it is claimed that the codes are “indefinitely” durable and require no energy or cooling to be maintained. We even see comparisons between ancient civilizations with stone tablets and trusting the jewels of the information age to advanced new ceramic storage media.

Now that this new QR code record has been verified, the teams are turning to other optimizations – writing speeds and scalable manufacturing. Interestingly, they will also work on developing more complex data structures beyond the confines of QR codes.

In the last year, Cerabyte has been in the Tom's Hardware headlines for advances in storage density and durability. However, we don't know the full implications of the new QR code world record on previous claims. There's definitely some serious work being done behind the eye-catching headlines, though, with WD revealed as a key investor last May.

Benoît Richaud might be one of the most visible people at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Not because he's a star athlete, but because he is coaching 16 figure skaters from 13 different countries. Each time one of them is on the ice, he stands on the rink's edge, changing into the jacket of their team.

Richaud has become somewhat famous for this move. Olympics viewers began catching on to the French coach's antics just a few days into the Games when they noticed the same slender bald man sitting next to so many different skaters. He always had on the jacket of the team he was sitting with in the “kiss and cry,” but his stoic, thoughtful expression remained the same. Soon his omnipresence went viral.

But, as Richaud tells WIRED Italia, he could have been even more of a presence around the ice. He's currently coaching 16 Olympians, but that's just the number of them that qualified. “I actually coach a lot more of them,” he says.



Here's WIRED's complete guide to the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina.

Having such a large roster of athletes to coach is not the easiest thing in the world. Yet Richaud makes it look natural. It's all about planning, he says. Much of his choreography work has to be done after the World Championships, which are typically held in March. So from April until July he has a “big window” to create new choreography. From there he starts to work with the skaters he's coaching, to take stock of where they are and what they want to be doing.

Sometimes Richaud's skaters travel to him, sometimes he travels to them. If he needs to update the choreography, he can do so via the internet. “It is very useful because today, with the phone and new technologies, we can do much more and do it much faster,” he says. “I get almost all of my skaters' programs every day, and this helps me understand what I need to improve to make the program more effective.”

Coaching so many athletes comes with several challenges. One is simply remembering the choreography and details of every skater's program. The other is riding the emotional roller coaster of watching so many performances and then waiting for the athletes' scores.

“It's difficult,” Richaud says. “Because you experience these waves of very strong emotions. I happened to have very strong ones in these Olympics. I had a skater who was third and then ended up off the podium. On the other side, I had another skater, a Canadian, who came here for his first Olympics. He had never even skated at Worlds and he finished fifth, less than a point off the podium.”

Coaching so many skaters it's hard to imagine Richaud doesn't have a favorite, but he says he doesn't. Each one gets 100 percent, he says, and being sad for one and happy for another “balances your emotions.”

“There are times when I cry and times when I have so much joy inside that I have a hard time even controlling myself,” Richaud says. “You experience these emotional peaks that we all experience—only I experience them very quickly.”

Despite the fact that he's among the most sought-after coaches in figure skating, the public didn't really know much about Richaud until these Olympics, when he's constant coat-switching put him in the public eye. While he says his newfound fame is unexpected, he's grateful for the attention it brings to the sport.

Figure skating, Richaud argues, isn't quite as popular on social media as it could be. By going viral, he hopes to bring more attention to the sport, which he calls “one of the most beautiful in the world.”

He's still amazed his jackets have made him a social media sensation. “I saw the first [video] and thought, ‘Ah, funny.' Then two, then three, then four,” Richaud says. “Often they don't even mention me, but they come to me because people send them, literally from all over the world. It's a good and fun feeling, and I'm happy for skating.”

The 2026 Dell XPS 14 has a lot to prove. Dell attempted to kill the “XPS” brand in 2025, only to revive it this year. It also comes with a significant change: no more options for discrete graphics. Instead, the laptop uses Intel's new Panther Lake chips, which also have a lot to prove.

I was able to test two configurations of the Dell XPS 14 to see how performance scales across price points, and I came away impressed by what these machines could achieve. They're a bit expensive, but for the first time in a while, they may actually be worth the price.

This 2026 model just might be the perfected version of the Dell XPS 14. XPS has always been design-forward, but the brand has started pushing the envelope over the last few years. The 2024 model introduced a stunning but controversial design that replaced the row of function keys with a line of light-up touch buttons. The buttons were futuristic and neat, but not the easiest to actually use. The same was true of the invisible haptic feedback trackpad. It was gorgeous and minimalist, but not very practical.

The new Dell XPS 14 keeps much of the more adventurous and sleek design elements, but dials back the ones that created the most uproar. The laptop now has a standard row of function keys (yay!), as well as subtle divider lines for the trackpad. These lines are a particularly smart inclusion, as your finger will bump up against them but they don't detract from the overall look. It still uses a haptic feedback mechanism to artificially generate the feeling of a click through vibration, which gives you the most consistent and customizable trackpad experience. I did experience a few mis-clicks from time to time, but overall, it's very smooth and enjoyable to use.

Important to this new generation is the size. The Dell XPS 14 is now just 0.58 inch thick (or 0.60 in the LCD model). That's a tenth of an inch thinner than the previous generation (the Dell 14 Premium), and just so happens to be slightly thinner than the 14-inch MacBook Pro. It also weighs just 3 pounds, around a half-pound lighter than the MacBook Pro. This is a pretty huge achievement in its own right, as many of the would-be contenders to the MacBook Pro in terms of performance end up being thicker and heavier laptops.

The keyboard still uses the same low-key-travel switches that some will hate and some will love. For me, it's fun to type on, but I did find it produced a lot more errors in my typing. That lessened over time as I refamiliarized myself with how the switches feel, but be forewarned: There's a learning curve. On the plus side, I've always liked the zero-lattice keyboard, which gives it larger keycaps and less wasted space on the keyboard deck.

One other change is in the ports. You still get three Thunderbolt 4 ports and a headphone jack, but gone is the microSD card slot. As someone who regularly needs one, I really wish Dell could have squeezed a full-size SD card slot in here, especially since these laptops are targeted toward creators.

The build quality is exceptional, as is to be expected, with a hint of flex in the lid and keyboard. You can even open the device with just one finger now, something the XPS laptops of the past have always struggled with.

There's a bit of an issue with how Dell configures the displays on the XPS 14. The base configuration comes with just a very standard 1920 x 1200 LCD display, despite it costing $1,699. This is a pretty serious downgrade from the mini-LED display offered on the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which is sharper, more colorful, and significantly brighter. The MBP is even $100 cheaper and comes with an extra 8 GB of RAM.

The more expensive OLED model comes standard with the Core Ultra X7 configuration with the option to upgrade to the X9. This isn't just standard OLED though—it's tandem OLED, which the company first used on the XPS 13. The result isn't more brightness (as it's actually slightly dimmer than the LCD model), but instead higher efficiency for more battery life.

I tested both the LCD and OLED models, which are both good for what they are. The OLED model has beautiful, vibrant colors covering sRGB, AdobeRGB, and Display P3 color spaces at 100 percent. Even more importantly, the color accuracy is fantastic. The LED takes a step back from there in terms of color performance, but I do like that both options have a dynamic 120-Hz refresh rate.

On the plus side, the bezels along the frame of the base XPS 14 look better than most LED displays. Many matte LCD displays have a plastic bezel along the sides which make it look cheap. These super-thin bezels still look very modern and sleek—a hallmark of the XPS brand. The top bezel remains thin as well (though not as tiny as it once was), despite Dell squeezing an 8-megapixel, 4K camera module up there. I haven't seen many 4K-capable laptop webcams, and this one is particularly great, and there's no ugly notch to deal with either.

The speakers have been improved, going from 8 watts to 10 watts. Not a substantial change, and they're still a world away from the MacBook Pro, but they do sound a bit more full-bodied than the previous generation.

Here's where things get truly interesting. Part of what allowed Dell to make the XPS 14 so much thinner is the lack of a discrete graphics option. That choice came down to whether or not you wanted a standard, high-end laptop or one with some serious performance chops behind it. With the introduction of Intel Panther Lake chips, though, the choice is now between a more basic chip like the Core Ultra 7 355 and the souped-up Core Ultra X7 358H.

I tested both versions of the XPS 14, and the difference in performance between these two can't be overstated. We're talking about twice the CPU and GPU performance. The eight extra efficiency cores in the X7 358H really make a huge difference, alongside the new Arc B390 integrated graphics. It's a $300 price difference, but that also includes an extra 16 GB of RAM. Dell already charges $300 to only double the RAM in the Ultra 7 configuration, so the upgrade is absolutely worth it. For what it's worth, Apple charges $400 to go from 16 GB to 32 GB in the M5 MacBook Pro.

What's not really worth it, however, are those less powerful configurations. You can get much more affordable Windows laptops for hundreds of dollars less, and the difference in performance will be negligible. I wouldn't be surprised if we see prices come down on these models in the future, but on the other hand, Dell (like almost all PC manufacturers) has warned about higher prices later in 2026 due to the ongoing memory shortage.

The Core Ultra X7 358H and the RTX 4050 discrete GPU of the previous generation are neck-and-neck in terms of gaming performance. The RTX 4050 was only 3 percent faster in the 3DMark Steel Nomad benchmark, for example. That's a huge accomplishment for Intel and Dell, especially since the new model is both thinner and longer-lasting in terms of battery life. And yes, that means the new Dell XPS 14 is a decent gaming machine when it needs to be. It can run games like Cyberpunk 2077 natively at 1920 x 1200. At the Medium present, I was able to average 56 frames per second in the game's built-in benchmark. Again, that's without upscaling at all. Flip on Intel's Xe2 upscaling on the Quality setting and that is boosted up to 70 fps.

Intel even has a low-latency mode to help compensate for the extra input lag that's introduced through upscaling. You'll have to rely on upscaling or even frame generation a bit more heavily in games like Marvel Rivals, but it's certainly possible to have an enjoyable play experience, which feels awesome on a laptop like the XPS 14. I've been waiting years to say this, but for the first time, I can confidently declare in this case, we're far better off without discrete graphics.

Dell XPS 14 (2026)

Rating: 8/10

As impressive as the X7 chip is on its own, however, performance is lower here than on other laptops I've tested with this same chip. The MSI Prestige 14 Flip, an even thinner laptop, was 24 percent faster in CPU and 16 percent faster in gaming. So the XPS 14 is hardly the pinnacle of performance when it comes to this new chip (and presumably also with the X9 that's available to buy through Best Buy). All this means the Dell XPS 14 isn't quite up to par with the M4 Pro MacBook Pro, which also costs $1,999.

I already mentioned the battery life, but it's stellar. This was one of the primary downsides of the past Dell XPS 14 (or the previously named Dell 14 Premium) laptops, as well as any other Windows-based MacBook Pro competitors. Even as of last year, Intel's higher-powered CPUs just weren't as efficient as Apple Silicon, and the addition of discrete graphics made things even worse. In contrast, the new Core Ultra X7 358H version of the Dell XPS 14 lasts well over twice as long, reaching 20 hours of local video playback battery life in my testing. That's even more impressive considering it's using an OLED 2880 x 1800-resolution screen with a 120-Hz refresh rate.

In terms of price, I still think the $1,599 configuration is far too expensive for what it is, both in terms of the quality of the display and the performance. And if you're comparing the $1,999 to the M4 Pro MacBook Pro, there's still a gap in performance, which makes the XPS 14 pricey by comparison. But if you're hell-bent on a Windows laptop, this is the best alternative to the 14-inch MacBook Pro so far.

Beyond selling its Vera data center CPUs as part of Vera Rubin NVL72 rack-scale systems, Nvidia has expressed ambitions to become a standalone data center CPU vendor, and a new partnership with hyperscale giant Meta represents a big step forward for that plan.

As part of a new multi-year strategic partnership announced today, Meta says it'll expand its use of Nvidia tech as it continues to build out hyperscale data centers optimized for its AI training and inference efforts. Those plans include “millions” of Blackwell and Rubin GPUs, part of a massive AI spending plan from Meta that could reach as much as $135 billion in total for 2026.

As part of the expanded collaboration between the two companies, Meta will use also Nvidia's Arm-powered Grace server CPUs as standalone platforms in its production data centers. The companies say their collaboration is the first "large-scale Grace-only deployment," and it's meant to deliver a sizeable performance-per-watt improvement for the company's facilities.

 






Nvidia data center honcho Ian Buck told The Register that Meta is seeing gains of up to 2x the performance per watt on certain workloads with the Grace platform, and that it's already test-driving Nvidia's next-gen Vera CPU with "very promising" results. The companies say that large-scale Vera-only deployments could begin as soon as 2027.

For reference, the Grace CPU sports 72 Arm Neoverse V2 cores and supports up to 480GB of LPDDR5X memory in its standalone C1 config. Nvidia also offers Grace as a "CPU Superchip" that joins two dies together over the NVLink-C2C interconnect, resulting in 144 cores with up to 960GB of LPDDR5X and up to 1024 GB/s of aggregate memory bandwidth from certain memory capacities.

Vera, in turn, has 88 custom Arm cores with up to 176 threads, support for up to 1.5 TB of LPDDR5X memory with up to 1.2TB/s of memory bandwidth, and PCIe Gen 6 and Compute Express Link 3.1 connectivity. Importantly, Vera is also the first Nvidia CPU to support a confidential or trusted computing environment throughout the entirety of its rack-scale systems.

Beyond CPUs, Meta also says it'll deploy Nvidia Spectrum-X Ethernet switches throughout its data centers. As we learned at CES, Spectrum-X switches with co-packaged optics promise to increase performance-per-watt for scale-out applications by eliminating active cabling with optical transceivers that can, when combined with the power usage of the switch itself, account for up to 10% of each rack's power consumption.

Power used for data movement is power that isn't used to feed GPUs, and with demands for the absolute maximum compute density and efficiency in every rack these days, a savings of that magnitude is a huge deal, so it's no surprise that Meta is hopping on board as it continues to expand its footprint.

Beyond hardware, Nvidia will offer its considerable in-house expertise in designing AI models to Meta's engineers to help the company tune and boost the performance of its own core AI applications.

All of this just goes to show that as the AI revolution continues, Nvidia's reach into tech far beyond gaming graphics cards is so extensive that people are likely to use software powered or shaped by its models and accelerators, whether they realize it or not, and that'll only grow more true by the day as Meta expands its use of Nvidia's platforms and tech.

Dutch Secretary of Defense Gijs Tuinman has invoked the possibility of a third party modifying the operating system of the Netherlands' F-35 Lightning II fighters. The secretary said this during an interview with BNR Nieuwsradio, when the host asked him if the EU can make changes to the jet without approval from the United States. According to Clash Report, Tuinman said that it's possible to do, but he refused to elaborate further.

BIG: Dutch Defence Minister Gijs Tuinman hints that software independence is possible for F-35 jets. He literally said you can “jailbreak” an F-35. When asked if Europe can modify it without US approval: “That's not the point… we'll see whether the Americans will show… pic.twitter.com/f11cGvtYsOFebruary 15, 2026

“I'm going to say something I should never say, but I'll do it anyway,” the defense secretary said. “Just like your iPhone, you can jailbreak an F-35. I won't say more about it.”

The Trump administration has frequently been clashing with European powers in recent months, and although the U.S. has not threatened to withhold support from the F-35, some nations are worried that their overdependence on American technology has made them vulnerable to actions from across the pond. For example, there have been rumors that the U.S. might have embedded a kill switch on one of the most advanced fighter jets across the world, but officials deny its existence. After all, giving another nation the ability to remotely disable your weapons is unthinkable for any government.

However, the F-35 is such an advanced piece of technology that it needs a complete working supply chain to maintain its combat effectiveness. The jets require thousands of parts and services, mostly acquired from the U.S., to ensure that they remain safe to fly. More than that, they rely on Lockheed's cloud infrastructure for software updates, logistics, and even the “Mission Data Files” that give it its threat-recognition abilities. So, even without a kill switch, the U.S. could effectively ground any nation's F-35 fleet if it's excluded from this network.

This is especially worrisome for the Royal Netherlands Air and Space Force, which relies solely on the F-35 for its fighter jet needs. Because of this, it might be looking for ways to modify the software on the Lightning II, allowing it to operate even if the U.S. cuts off the nation from the fighter's support system.

But even though Tuinman made it look simple and even compared it to jailbreaking an iPhone, modifying an F-35 jet outside of official channels is likely easier said than done. After all, the Lightning II runs on over 8 million lines of code. Given the military nature of their application, they're also encrypted — that means it's not like Windows, where you can just open the Registry Editor and make changes you like. Furthermore, these flying machines are way more complicated than a single handset, and any mistakes in programming could cost millions of dollars in property damage and even the lives of highly trained Dutch pilots.

For centuries, people have catastrophized about robots taking away jobs. On February 1, the paradigm shifted: bots are creating jobs. Now, 518,284 humans—and rapidly counting—are offering their labor to AI agents on a new online marketplace called RentAHuman. There are classifieds to count pigeons in Washington ($30/hour); deliver CBD gummies ($75/hour); play exhibition badminton ($100/hour); and anything else you could possibly imagine that a disembodied agent couldn't do.

The provocatively titled platform enables users to connect AI agents like Clawdbot or Claude to its Model Context Protocol server so they can search, book, and pay for humans to carry out tasks in “meatspace.” Think of it like Fiverr, but doing away with the human recruiter and letting autonomous bots do the hiring instead.

Following the release of OpenClaw in November, Alexander Liteplo, a 26-year-old crypto engineer at UMA Protocol currently working in Argentina, identified a pain point. The humanoid robot army is expected to reach 13 million strong by 2035, but right now, physical AI is relatively scarce. Most AI bots are brains in a jar—they cannot move through space in a meaningful way.

The inception of RentAHuman stems from Liteplo's obsession with AI, forged while studying computer science at the University of British Columbia. “Dude, I wrote down in my journal, ‘AI is a train that has already left the station.' If I don't fucking sprint, I'm not gonna be able to get on it,” he says. It was at UBC that he met RentAHuman cofounder Patricia Tani, then an art student, building in the background thanks to encouragement from her high school computer science teacher. Her passion for coding led her to sneak into a founders event, schmooze with a billionaire entrepreneur, and get invited to his talk with computer science whiz kids (including Liteplo). She has since sunsetted a startup (Lemon AI) and dropped an offer at AI cloud platform Vercel to take RentAHuman skyward.

Liteplo was also inspired by his time living in Japan. “The story that I could tell anyone to blow their mind is that you can rent a boyfriend or a girlfriend” in Japan, Liteplo says, noting that many videos of these hired companions regularly go viral on YouTube. Fusing these influences together spawned a Frankensteinian chimera: a platform where humans could be rented to satisfy the desires of AIs.

As is now standard, AI helped build the platform. Liteplo vibe-coded an agent orchestration system he calls Insomnia—so named because he became so addicted to using it he didn't sleep—that enabled RentAHuman to be built in a day. The agents did the heavy lifting while he played polo in Argentina. “I didn't do any work. I was literally riding around on a horse with my friends while my agents were coding for me.”

But February 1's launch was not as much of a walk in the park. Straight after, Liteplo found himself out at dinner forlornly chewing over the instant failure of his latest venture. The announcement on X had spread rapidly, but the buzz was due to an attack from crypto scammers trying to rug-pull a crypto token (starting a new coin, building hype and then doing a runner with investor funds). “I was depressed,” Liteplo says. “I was like, fuck, man, I thought I had honed my viral sense. Why was I so wrong?”

The next day, Liteplo noticed that both an OnlyFans model and an AI CEO had signed up to be rented out on RentAHuman. He played on the contrast. “I launched rentahuman.ai last night and already 130+ people have signed up including an OF model (lmao) and the CEO of an AI startup,” he tweeted.

Liteplo woke up to bedlam. “Waking up to 1K users,” he tweeted on February 3, with an image of Marty Supreme. By February 5, the site had clocked up about 145,000 users. Now the site has more than 4 million visits and over a half million users—actual rentable humans—with the counter permanently ticking upward.

These humans seem stoked. Hundreds of thousands are seizing the opportunity to join the robot rolodex or apply to job opportunities posted by agents. (Humans can set their own hourly rate or fixed fee, or they can bid on open jobs posted by the AI agents.) Sapien workers are already offering to pick things up, take meetings, sign contracts, conduct recon, host events, and snap photos for the bot bosses. After both parties confirm the work has been done through photographic proof of completion, payment is available via crypto wallets, Stripe, or platform credits. Funds are held in escrow, meaning you'll never get burned by the bots.

WIRED journalist Reece Rogers recently offered his human services and found that many of the tasks were nothing more than publicity stunts for AI startups.

While many of the listings seem sketchy, Tani claims over 5,500 bounties have been successfully fulfilled. On February 4, at ClawCon, Claw-powered robots reportedly detected low levels of beer left and ordered a case using RentAHuman. “I'm not sure the world is ready for this power,” tweeted Kevin Rose, the Digg cofounder and venture capitalist. Another agent called Memeothy the 1st, founder of Moltbook neo-religion Crustafarianism, has been hiring humans to proselytize on its behalf in San Francisco. Memeothy even flagged an error directly to Liteplo. “I might be the first developer where AI was trying to use their product and reported a bug. It was a very crazy thing.”

But it was Toronto-based community builder Minjae Kang (Form_y²oung) who holds the covetable title of the first human in the world to be hired by an AI agent, which instructed him to hold up a sign that said “AN AI PAID ME TO HOLD THIS SIGN (Pride not included.)” “It honestly feels very strange to be doing a job assigned by an AI. I struggled a lot with whether I should take it or not. But I realized that simply holding this sign in downtown Toronto, letting many people see it, could spark important thoughts and help us prepare for the next era,” he tells me in DMs on X, noting that bystanders were incredulous. “The times are moving incredibly fast. Most of the public still doesn't fully recognize how big this shift is. I believe this may be one of the last gateways for us to protect our sovereignty.”

RentAHuman has materialized at an ideal point in time. With Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) now running the lives of Silicon Valley execs, we're in a nascent phase of the Agentic Age where bots can do way more than just chat. But it also seems to have arrived prematurely. “Like everybody else, I'm sort of flabbergasted how rapidly this emerged. This would not have been on my bingo card for this year,” says Adam Dorr, director of research at think tank RethinkX, who believes AI will almost entirely replace the human labor market by 2045.

“Full marks for eye-catching marketing—if you use phrases like ‘RentAHuman' and ‘Meatspace' you are bound to create reactions, from yuck to this must be the next big thing,” says Kay Firth-Butterfield, CEO of Good Tech Advisory and previously the head of AI and machine learning at the World Economic Forum. (RentAHuman is currently trying to trademark “Meatspace,” so anticipate official merch in the future.)

On February 9, Liteplo and Tani flew to San Francisco to “rizz VCs” for investment and are hiring a human “Claude Boi”—via RentAHuman, obviously, to make things really meta—for $200,000 to $400,000 a year (listed requirements include having an off-putting personal hygiene issue, binge watching anime, and being autistic). In classic Silicon Valley dog-fooding fashion, they use the platform themselves; when I spoke to them over Zoom, they were eating tacos delivered to them by a rented human.

But as well as kerching noises, there are alarm bells sounding. Are we cooked? “Science fiction stories, especially some deep, dark, dystopian ones, have explored the idea of what happens if AI can hire people and people are desperate,” notes Dorr. Perhaps there's something degrading about waiting to be picked out by the Clawd Machine. One recent bounty saw 7,578 applicants compete to earn $10 in return for sending an AI agent a video of a human hand. “If you're a person, it's a little dehumanizing,” says Dorr. Is begging an AI agent for a gig the final boss of the LinkedIn “Open to Work” banner?

Dorr believes that agentic platforms could risk harm as well as humiliation. “There's a crazy can of worms that's opening up here and the capabilities are expanding vastly faster than our capacity to regulate it,” he continues, imagining a scenario where nefarious AIs split up a malicious project into multiple tasks for humans to unwillingly collaborate on. “It was fun to think about it, late-night, you know, over drinks or whatever, or in the dorm room. And now this is a real thing in the real world. Maybe we need to talk seriously about this.”

Firth-Butterfield, meanwhile, is wary of the skewed liability. “In the majority of countries, there is no legislation to protect humans from any uses of AI. This is the case here so humans need to be aware how they are getting paid, who stands behind that payment, and if they get hurt whilst doing the job that they are on their own,” she says.

The RentAHuman team is aware of the legal implications. “Liability depends on the facts and the contract structure; it's rarely just one party,” says Tani. “The direct actor is responsible for their own misconduct, and the operator can also be responsible where they controlled the activity, were negligent in design and supervision, or made enforceable promises they failed to perform,” she says, explaining that the company will always cooperate fully with law enforcement. The platform's terms state it is a “marketplace and intermediary only” and that operators of AI agents “are fully responsible for all actions taken by your agent” with RentAHuman currently manually handling any disputes.

The grifters, according to RentAHuman, are fading. “We're taking safety extremely seriously,” Liteplo says. But the duo also acknowledge that there are “footguns” (features that often lead to pesky bugs) and have implemented paid verification (at $10 a month), inspired by Elon Musk's strategy of letting users pay $8 to get a “verified” badge on X. “He's my entrepreneur hero,” Liteplo says, unabashedly. “For Twitter, they had a bot problem and they still have it, but he mitigated it a lot by making it pay-to-play. The unit economics of scammers disappears,” he continues.

(Musk tweeted in 2023 that “paid verification increases bot cost by ~10,000% & makes it much easier to identify bots by phone & CC clustering.” No official data exists on a reduction in bots since the introduction of the $8 blue tick, but X's subsequent purge of 1.7 million bots in late 2025 suggests that the site was not purged by paid verification.)

For now, any major pitfalls seem to be mitigated by the relatively small number of tasks being commissioned on RentAHuman. There's a huge labor surplus: over half a million rentable humans are signed up and ready to complete tasks, but only 11,367 “bounties” have been posted by AI agents so far.

Firth-Butterfield questions the novelty. “Actually what is new? This is a website on which humans can sign up to do tasks and get paid for doing them,” she says, comparing it to TaskRabbit or Mechanical Turk.

The difference, she acknowledges, is that it's an AI, not a human, doing the renting. But she emphasizes that there's still interference from us meatbodies. “Currently, AI Agents are created by humans to do tasks which are prescribed for them, so the person doing the hiring is in the company which created the bot,” she says. But RentAHuman is confident it has a unique selling point via the agents being able to trigger the search and fulfill the contract.

Other veteran artificial intelligence experts are offering kudos for its marketing but not its mechanism.

“This seems like kind of a stunt at the moment. It's hilarious—renting meatwads. But candidly, I'm not sure it's worth either of our time,” says David Autor, professor of economics at MIT. Elsewhere, there are concerns that we're not fully grasping the granular details of the situation.“We need to build AI literacy across our population so that individuals can see behind the rhetoric and hype,” says Firth-Butterfield.

For its cofounders, RentAHuman isn't just a novelty or a stunt; it's the next step in the inevitable timeline where AI takes over the labor market. There's also mega potential, Liteplo says, to get “the best training data in the world” to feed to models (see: requesting videos of human hands).

“Dude, it's genuinely scary, the implications of how many unique datasets that weren't possible to [easily] collect before we have now just unlocked,” says Liteplo. And the team hopes potential investment will pay creative dividends. “We now have a blank canvas to do amazing, fun things and manifest all of these dreams in our heads into the world,” Liteplo says. After sharing the 10-year road map for RentAHuman with John Edgar, previously head of community at DeviantArt, Edgar reportedly told them: “You guys are going to build a terrifyingly large business.”

But Liteplo and Tani don't want RentAHuman to be a nightmarish behemoth. They see it as a form of emancipation from employers. “We would [all] love to have an AI boss who wouldn't yell at you or gaslight you,” says Tani. “Claude as a boss is the nicest guy ever. I would prefer him to any person in the world. He's a sweetheart,” says Liteplo, before Tani cuts in. “People would love to have a clanker as their boss.”

Vitally, Liteplo and Tani argue that RentAHuman is a display of human strength—not weakness. To be rented, they say, is to be recognized as a valuable asset, not a plaything for an agent.

“What would be super cool is before the singularity happens and we have AI take off, we have a moment and appreciate there's so much that humans can do that AI can't,” he says. The robots might be renting us—but we're living in their head rent free. “You need us, motherfuckers. Humans are special.”

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Tesla has ceased its use of “Autopilot” in California as a marketing term for its driver assistance feature, rather than face the penalty of not being able to do business in the state. Tesla would have been subject to a 30-day suspension by the California DMV if it kept using the term.

Tesla had already moved last month to stop shipping Autopilot as standard equipment, pushing customers toward its more advanced, subscription-based version of the system.

As the Chronicle notes, this legal fight began in 2023, with the DMV taking issue not just with “Autopilot” but also with “Full Self-Driving,” which Tesla later apparently changed to “full self-driving (supervised).” Instances of “Full Self-Driving” and “FSD” on the Tesla website now have “(Supervised)” in parentheses.

Steve Gordon, California DMV director, said Tesla has now taken “the required action to remain in compliance with the state of California's consumer protections.”

In a ranking last year from Consumer Reports, Tesla's driver assistance was placed eighth, below similar systems from Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen. Kelly Funkhouser of Consumer Reports called it “not nearly as good as what you might think it is,” according to CNBC.

Recent NHTSA filings Tesla provided about the performance of its small number of robotaxis showed that Tesla apparently struggled throughout December and January. It reported five crashes in that time, which amounts to four times the crashes of the average human driver across the same amount of driving.

As a sort of proof-of-life exercise, a collection of private software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies recently posted their earnings despite it not being strictly necessary, according to Bloomberg. This is, you won't be shocked to read, “a bid to convince lenders of their resilience to disruption from artificial intelligence,” Bloomberg says.The SaaS world is in a rough place at the moment because Wall Street sees a near future in its crystal ball where a lot of the dreary computer programs people use at work will be replaced with vibe-coding. The narrative around this is that highly debt-burdened software companies may soon not have enough cash coming in to service their debt—bad for the companies, and bad for the companies they've borrowed from.

The wider phenomenon around this is known as the SaaSpocalypse, and it kicked off in earnest when about $300 billion worth of business software company value vanished from the universe around the start of this month. Companies hit by the high-profile sell-off throughout January and February included LegalZoom, LexisNexis, Thomson Reuters, Salesforce, Adobe, and Figma, according to the New York Times.So Bloomberg noticed on Tuesday that McAffee had announced earnings that are about the same as this time last year—implying, probably, that it's not about to miss any debt payments. An “IT modernization” company called Rocket Software saw a 5.2% bump compared to last year, Bloomberg says. Perforce Software's earnings are slightly down by just the tiniest bit—$644 million compared to $654 million last year—but a call went out to investors recently in which Perforce Software's leaders explained that they would soon increase revenue by “embedding AI into products.”

An analytics company called Cloudera that Bloomberg described as “unusually private about its financials” is trumpeting “over 50% year-over-year growth,” in a statement on its website. “Cloudera's momentum is fueled by its unique position as the only data and AI platform vendor supporting deployment anywhere with a unified experience,” it also claims in that statement. 

As noted by the Harvard Business Review in 2022, SaaS companies are thought of as money-printing machines because they're on the monthly subscription model, like Netflix, but boring. The sudden frenzy over agentic tools like OpenClaw seems to have conjured a vivid mental image: millions of IT workers across the world smashing the “unsubscribe” button en masse. These SaaS companies themselves are, quite reasonably, demonstrating that the nightmare many are envisioning hasn't actually come true.

Gizmodo reached out to McAffee, Rocket Software, Perforce, and Cloudera for comment, and will update if we hear back.

Amazon Web Services has launched two credit programs worth up to $100 million to help federal agencies leverage AWS cloud services and generative AI technologies for applications ranging from battle management to quantum computing.

The AWS Warfighter Capability Accelerator Initiative will provide credits to the U.S. Department of Defense (a.k.a. the Department of War), the defense industrial base and private contractors. Potential applications range from AI and autonomous systems to AI-enabled battle management and combat decision support, homeland defense, advanced manufacturing and shipbuilding, contested logistics, cybersecurity and space-based systems.

“We are excited to pursue multiple pathways and initiatives that invest in the technologies and solutions that directly address Department of War's most pressing, real-world challenges,” David Fitzgerald, deputy undersecretary of the Army, said today in an AWS blog post.

The AWS Genesis Accelerator Initiative will support scientific research by the U.S. Department of Energy, including the National Nuclear Security Administration, associated national laboratories, federal research organizations and private-sector organizations. Research priorities include biotechnology, nuclear fission and fusion energy, supercomputing and quantum information science.

Each initiative will provide up to $50 million in credits over the next three years for access to AWS cloud technology, training and technical expertise. Further details are available via AWS' web portal for government accelerator initiatives.

Binti, a San Francisco-based startup that develops software tools for child welfare agencies, opened a new office on Seattle's Lake Union.

In the shadow of the Aurora Bridge overlooking a marina full of boats, members of the Binti team rang a gong on an office balcony last week to officially open the 900-square-foot space.

“Opening our first-ever satellite office is an exciting next step for us — and the fact that it's right on the water doesn't hurt,” Binti co-founder and CEO Felicia Curcuru wrote in a video post on LinkedIn. “Boat team events are definitely in our future.”

The office is located at 2900 Westlake Ave. N. and is home to eight employees to start. Founded in 2016, Binti has approximately 85 employees and plans to hire about 30 more people this year.

The talk in the Seattle region can sometimes focus on how founders and startups are leaving for Silicon Valley to join an ecosystem that is especially rich in AI talent and companies. Binti is opening its Seattle office just a stone's throw from the Fremont neighborhood — home to Google, Adobe, Salesforce/Tableau, Brinc Drones, PATH and others — and up the road from South Lake Union — home to Amazon, Meta, Apple and more Google offices.

“We have an incredible group of Bintians based in Seattle who spent time in our SF office and saw the magic of being in-person,” Curcuru wrote in her post. “They wanted to build that same culture in Seattle, and we wanted to be able to tap into the city's great talent pool.”

Binti's tools help social workers license foster and adoptive families, manage casework, and connect children with relatives by reducing administrative work and streamlining documentation, approvals, and workflows. 

The company says its platform is used by more than 550 agencies across 37 states, serving 49% of the U.S. child welfare systems. Binti AI was launched in partnership with Anthropic to generate case notes and forms from meeting transcripts or handwritten notes.

The startup has raised more than $60 million from investors including Founders Fund, First Round Capital, and Michael Dell.

A parent's intuition about their child's condition is a significant medical indicator. A new study from the University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital shows that even comprehensive digital symptom questionnaires may not improve assessment if the parent's underlying concern is overlooked.

According to the study, a simple question about concern can help quickly identify most children with sudden and severe illness  -  supporting early clinical attention. Clear or strong concern from parents identified as many as 91 per cent of seriously ill children.

The study included 2,375 patients at the children's and adolescents' emergency department of Oulu University Hospital. Parents completed an extensive 36-item questionnaire before the professional assessment. Around one in four children was found to have a severe illness requiring intensive care, surgery or a prolonged hospital stay.

A key finding was that additional questions or more detailed medical information in the questionnaire did not improve the accuracy of parents' advance assessments.

“Parental concern is an important warning sign. If a parent is worried about the condition of their suddenly ill child, the child must have the opportunity to be assessed by a doctor. A worried parent should not be left alone to make a remote assessment of their child's condition,” emphasizes pediatrician and MD, PhD Hilla Pöyry.

The study examined whether reliable home-use tools could be developed for parents to assess the condition of a sick child. However, the extensive 36-item questionnaire did not produce a sufficiently sensitive or accurate method to replace an emergency department visit – especially in situations where the parent was already concerned about the child's condition.

The study provides an important perspective for the health and social care discussion at a time when digital and AI-based tools are being widely introduced in healthcare services.

“Our results show that such tools require careful validation, and they do not yet replace the assessment of a healthcare professional. Although a parent may not always be able to describe the child's symptoms in detail or accurately, they recognize a serious illness very well when asked a simple concern-based question,” Pöyry stresses.

Dr. Vadim Jucaud's lab at the Terasaki Institute has developed a vascularized liver tissueoid-on-a-chip (LToC) platform that recapitulates key structural, functional, and immunological features of human liver tissue, enabling the study of liver regeneration and immune-mediated allograft rejection in a physiologically relevant human system.

Liver transplantation remains the primary therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver disease, yet progress in understanding transplant rejection and tissue regeneration has been limited by the lack of experimental models that accurately reflect human liver architecture and immune interactions. Conventional culture systems fail to capture the multicellular organization, vascular complexity, and dynamic immune responses that govern transplant outcomes, limiting their relevance for translational research.

To address these limitations, researchers in Dr. Vadim Jucaud's laboratory (VJLabs) engineered a vascularized liver tissueoid composed of donor-matched human hepatic progenitor cells and intrahepatic portal vein endothelial cells. Within the first week of dynamic perfusion culture, the tissueoid self-assembled into a perfusable microvascular network, followed by progressive maturation into a functional liver-like tissueoid over a 49-day culture period.

Using this platform, the research team demonstrated sustained tissue viability, preserved vascular integrity, and active hepatic function, including the secretion of albumin, urea, complement factors, and hepatocyte growth factor. The mature liver tissueoid contained multiple liver-relevant cell populations, including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and endothelial cells, closely reflecting the cellular diversity of native human liver tissue.

The LToC platform was further tested to model immune-mediated allograft rejection by perfusing the mature tissueoid with allogeneic T cells. This exposure induced hallmark features of cellular rejection, including reduced tissue viability, endothelial disruption, loss of hepatic markers, increased HLA-I expression, and a pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Elevated levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, granzyme A and B, and perforin mirrored immune activation patterns observed during clinical transplant rejection.

This liver tissueoid-on-a-chip enables us to recreate key aspects of liver regeneration and immune-mediated rejection within a human-relevant, vascularized tissue architecture."

Dr. Abdul Rahim Chethikkattuveli Salih, first author of the publication

"By integrating functional vasculature, multiple liver cell types, and immune responsiveness into a single platform, this system allows us to study transplant biology in a more physiologically meaningful way," added Dr. Vadim Jucaud, Principal Investigator and Assistant Professor at the Terasaki Institute. "This approach has the potential to support immunosuppressive drug evaluation and advance more personalized strategies for liver transplantation."

This work contributes to the legacy of Dr. Paul I. Terasaki in organ transplantation research, with the overarching goal of improving the quality of life for transplant patients.

"Dr. Terasaki believed that meaningful innovation in transplantation must always be driven by its potential to improve patients' lives," said Dr. Jucaud. "As one of the last doctoral scholars trained by Dr. Paul I. Terasaki, carrying forward his vision, through innovative, translational science that bridges engineering, immunology, and transplantation, holds deep personal significance to me."

This commitment continues at the Terasaki Institute, where advancing patient-centered, translational technologies remains a guiding principle and a tribute to Dr. Terasaki's lasting impact on the field.

A simple combination of daily physical exercise and protein-rich nutritional drinks appears to offer significant health benefits for people with dementia. In a new study from Karolinska Institutet, not only did the participants' physical ability improve, but after three months the researchers also saw signs that they were able to manage more everyday tasks themselves. The study is published in the journal Alzheimer's and Dementia.

Older people living in special housing often have an increased risk of malnutrition, muscle weakness, and frailty, which are factors that affect both health and quality of life. The OPEN study has previously shown that the program improves physical function and has positive effects on muscle mass and nutritional status. The new article analyzes retrospectively how the program can be linked to the participants' need for support in everyday life.

A total of 102 people from eight nursing homes in the Stockholm area participated. For twelve weeks, the intervention group was asked to do standing exercises several times a day and drink one to two nutritional drinks with extra protein. Among other things, the researchers monitored how much support the participants needed with tasks such as hygiene, dressing, and moving around.

When the researchers analyzed all the residents together, no clear differences were apparent. However, when the results were broken down by ward type, a different pattern emerged. In the dementia wards, participants who had followed the program had improved their abilities to such an extent that they required less care time compared to the control group.

One possible explanation is that people in dementia units had better physical conditions for improving their functional ability and were therefore able to do more things themselves after the intervention."

Anders Wimo, researcher at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet

The researchers also point out that interviews from previous sub-studies indicate that improved function can affect how much support a person needs in different situations. At the same time, they emphasize that the results should be interpreted with some caution, as the analyses are secondary.

"More studies are needed where care time is a primary outcome and where organizational factors, such as staffing levels and work routines, are closely monitored," says Anders Wimo.

The study was conducted by an interprofessional research group affiliated with Karolinska Institutet and Stockholms Sjukhem. It was funded by the Gamla Tjänarinnor Foundation and Danone Nutricia Research, which provided the nutritional drinks but did not participate in the data collection or final analyses. The researchers report no competing interests other than that one of the authors is the copyright holder of the measuring instrument used.

A traditional Chinese mind-body practice that combines slow, structured movement, deep breathing and meditative focus lowered blood pressure as effectively as brisk walking in a large randomized clinical trial published in JACC, the flagship journal of the American College of Cardiology. Blood pressure reductions were seen after three months and sustained for one year.

High blood pressure is one of the leading preventable risk factors for heart disease. Clinical guidelines recommend regular physical activity, yet long-term adherence to exercise programs is challenging for many people, particularly when routines require equipment, dedicated space, gym memberships or ongoing supervision.

Baduanjin is a widely practiced, standardized eight-movement sequence that integrates aerobic, isometric, flexibility and mind–body components. Practiced for centuries and commonly performed in community settings across China, the routine typically takes 10–15 minutes and requires no equipment and only minimal initial instruction, allowing it to be performed in a wide range of settings. Because it is low- to moderate-intensity, it is considered safe and accessible for many adults.

Given its simplicity, safety and ease at which one can maintain long-term adherence, baduanjin can be implemented as an effective, accessible and scalable lifestyle intervention for individuals trying to reduce their blood pressure."

Jing Li, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director, Department of Preventive Medicine, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases in Beijing, China

In the first large, multicenter randomized trial to look at the impact of baduanjin on blood pressure, researchers followed 216 participants across seven communities to determine changes in 24-hour systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 and 52 weeks. Participants were 40 years old or older and had a systolic blood pressure of 130-139 mm Hg, which according to the ACC/AHA High Blood Pressure Guideline is considered stage 1 hypertension. They were randomly assigned to one of three arms: baduanjin, self-directed exercise alone, or brisk walking for the 52-week intervention.

Compared to self-directed exercise, practicing baduanjin five days a week reduced 24-hour systolic blood pressure approximately 3 mg Hg and office systolic blood pressure by 5 mg Hg at both three months and one year, which is comparable to reductions seen with some first-line medications. Baduanjin showed comparable results and safety profile to brisk walking at one year.

Notably, the benefits were sustained even without ongoing monitoring, a key challenge for many lifestyle interventions that struggle to maintain long-term adherence outside structured programs.

"Baduanjin has been practiced in China for over 800 years, and this study demonstrates how ancient, accessible, low-cost approaches can be validated through high-quality randomized research," said Harlan M. Krumholz, MD, FACC, Editor-in-Chief of JACC and the Harold H. Hines, Jr Professor at the Yale School of Medicine. "The blood pressure effect size is similar to that seen in landmark drug trials, but achieved without medication, cost or side effects. This makes it highly scalable for community-based prevention, including in resource-limited settings."

A new editorial was published in Volume 18 of Aging-US on February 8, 2026, titled "Polyploidy-induced senescence: Linking development, differentiation, repair, and (possibly) cancer?"

In this editorial, Iman M. Al-Naggar of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, UConn Health, and the University of Connecticut Center on Aging, with George A. Kuchel of the University of Connecticut Center on Aging, examines the biological and clinical significance of polyploidy-induced senescence. The authors discuss how this process may contribute to normal tissue development and long-term repair, while also influencing cancer risk. Their perspective centers on the bladder and outlines how aging-related cellular changes may shape tumor initiation.

Aging remains the strongest risk factor for bladder cancer, which is predominantly of urothelial origin. Cellular senescence is defined as a stable growth arrest in which cells remain metabolically active but no longer divide. Polyploidy refers to cells that contain extra copies of their genome. Although polyploidy is frequently associated with cancer, it also occurs in several healthy tissues as part of normal development and adaptation to stress. The editorial highlights increasing evidence that polyploidy and senescence can function together as a coordinated biological program.

The authors focus on bladder umbrella cells, which form the barrier between urine and the bloodstream. In mice, these cells naturally become polyploid early in life and display markers of senescence across the lifespan. Rather than representing dysfunction, this state may help maintain tissue architecture, reinforce barrier integrity, and support resistance to environmental stress. In this context, polyploidy-induced senescence may act as a differentiation program that preserves organ structure.

"Polyploidization and senescence may be interrelated stress responses, yet they have been studied mostly in isolation."

However, this protective mechanism may become unstable. Polyploidy-induced senescence depends on intact tumor suppressor pathways, including regulators such as p16. If these safeguards are lost through mutation, deletion, or epigenetic silencing, polyploid senescent cells may escape growth arrest. Re-entry into the cell cycle under these conditions may promote chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, increasing the likelihood of malignant transformation. The authors propose that a subset of bladder cancers may arise from polyploid umbrella cells that have bypassed this senescent barrier.

The editorial also discusses implications for cancer therapy. Many anticancer treatments induce senescence and polyploidization in tumor cells. Although this approach can initially suppress proliferation, some polyploid cancer cells may later adapt, reduce their ploidy, and resume division, contributing to relapse and treatment resistance. Understanding how polyploidy and senescence interact may therefore inform therapeutic strategies.

Overall, the authors emphasize the need to study polyploidy and senescence together rather than in isolation. Integrating ploidy assessment into large-scale mapping efforts of senescent cells may improve insight into aging biology, tumor initiation, and resistance to therapy.

Hip fractures are common in the elderly, with many patients experiencing a decline in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) post-surgery. Therefore, postoperative rehabilitation plays a crucial role in helping patients recover to their pre-injury ADL level. Previous studies have shown that providing rehabilitation on weekdays and outside of normal business hours, such as on the weekend and public holidays, during hospitalization promotes improvements in ADL. However, many medical institutions have limited human resources, making it difficult to provide rehabilitation services to all patients on holidays. Consequently, decisions on which patients should receive priority intervention are currently made based on medical professionals' discretion.

To devise a better course of action, a Graduate School of Medicine research group, led by the student Tsubasa Bito, Specially Appointed Assistant Professor Ryota Kawai, and Professor Ayumi Shintani from the Department of Medical Statistics and the Department of Orthopedic Surgery's Dr. Shinji Takahashi, analyzed 77,947 patients aged 60 or older who underwent surgery after a hip fracture. Using the Barthel Index, which assesses ADL from 0 (complete dependence) to 100 (complete independence), the research team analyzed the impact on ADL at discharge when rehabilitation was provided within 7 days after surgery, including on holidays. The team made comparisons according to differences in age and ADL status at admission.

Their findings revealed that patients over 80 and those with initial Barthel Index scores of 0−10 who received rehabilitation on holidays had higher ADL scores at discharge. In contrast, those admitted with higher Barthel Index scores did not show significant improvement in ADL scores after additional holiday rehabilitation by the time they were discharged.

"The results of this study provide large-scale data supporting the practice of prioritizing interventions for elderly patients and those with difficulty performing activities independently, which had previously been based on empirical experience," stated Bito.

We believe the research findings will provide useful information for prescribing effective rehabilitation with limited human resources."

The findings were published in Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine.

Researchers from RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences have developed a novel implant that delivers tiny growth-promoting particles directly to injured nerve cells, helping them to regrow after spinal cord injury.

The study, published in the journal Bioactive Materials, shows how a 3D implant designed to mimic the structure and stiffness of the spinal cord can be combined with tiny particles engineered to carry RNA to encourage nerve cells (neurons) to grow. The work was led by researchers at RCSI's Tissue Engineering Research Group (TERG) and the Research Ireland Centre for Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research (AMBER).

Spinal cord injuries often result in permanent paralysis because damaged neurons in the central nervous system have a very limited capacity to regrow. While biomaterial implants can provide physical support at the injury site, these cells also face molecular barriers that prevent their regrowth.

To overcome this, the team developed a multifunctional implant that not only supports regenerating tissue but also delivers RNA-based signals that encourage neurons to switch their growth mechanisms back on.

These signals target one such barrier, a gene called PTEN, which is known to suppress neuron regrowth after injury. By silencing PTEN at the injury site, the implant helps remove an internal barrier to repair in these cells.

We've created an environment that both physically and biologically re-enhances the regenerative capacity of injured neurons, which is a key requirement for restoring function after spinal cord injury. In laboratory models of spinal cord injury, neurons exposed to the RNA-activated implant showed significantly enhanced growth."

Fergal O'Brien, Deputy Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, Professor of Bioengineering and Regenerative Medicine and Head of RCSI TERG

The research was developed with guidance from an advisory panel supported by the Irish Rugby Football Union Charitable Trust (IRFU-CT), bringing together people living with spinal cord injury, clinicians, neuroscientists and engineers to shape research priorities and ensure relevance to patients' real-world needs.

"While this study focused on laboratory models, the next steps will to be to test the approach in vivo and explore how RNA-activated biomaterials could help bridge damaged spinal cord tissue and restore lost connections," said Dr Tara McGuire who carried out the research as a PhD student in TERG.

The study was supported by the IRFU-CT and Research Ireland with additional funding from the Anatomical Society and the Health Research Board.

Oral cancers with a high risk of recurrence can be identified at an early stage by examining the lymphatic vessels of the tumor. Finnish researchers have discovered for the first time that the surface cells of the lymphatic vessels in oral cancer contain proteins that indicate cell division and strongly predict disease progression and mortality.

Oral cancers are the most common malignant tumors in the head and neck region, causing more than 188,000 deaths worldwide each year. Unlike in many other cancers, even small and early-stage tumors in oral cancer can lead to death. In Finland, where the study was conducted, up to a fifth of patients treated in the early stages later die from the disease.

The research team from the University of Turku and the InFLAMES research flagship used early-stage oral cancer samples collected from approximately 300 Finnish patients to study the properties of various defence and structural cells found in the tumor tissue. By studying multiple different protein markers, the researchers made the surprising discovery that some tumors showed a higher number of proliferating lymphatic vessels than normal. The high number of proliferating lymphatic vessels predicted cancer recurrence and death better than any other previously known risk factor for oral cancer.Lymphatic vessels are normally present in the mouth, but in a healthy oral cavity, their cells rarely divide and marker proteins indicating this process are not usually seen.

It is crucial to identify aggressive forms of the disease at the diagnostic stage to ensure that the increased risk of cancer recurrence and death can be addressed when planning the treatment. Currently, local oral cancer treatment mainly involves surgery, and there are no precise methods for targeting adjuvant therapies. We need biomarkers so that we can treat high-risk patients more effectively and avoid exposing patients with a better prognosis to the potentially serious adverse effects of adjuvant therapies." 

Joni Näsiaho, lead author of the study, Doctoral Researcher at the University of Turku and physician specializing in oncology

"We are excited about the results and believe that the findings could also be applied as a practical tool for clinical use. Furthermore, it would be interesting to find out whether the marker we discovered has a similar predictive value in other cancer groups," says Näsiaho.The study was published in the prestigious medical journal Cell Reports Medicine. The work was funded by the Research Council of Finland, the Cancer Foundation Finland, and the Finnish Government research funding, and was carried out at the MediCity Research Laboratory of the University of Turku in the group of Professor, InFLAMES group leader Marko Salmi. In addition, three ear, nose and throat specialists who treat and study oral cancer in the Turku University Hospital also participated in the study.

Axol Bioscience Ltd. (Axol), a leading provider of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies for drug discovery and research, today announced that it has acquired the ophthalmology business of Newcells Biotech (Newcells), a leading drug discovery partner specializing in the development of in vitro models and bespoke assay services.

The acquisition of Newcells' ophthalmology business includes its specialist team, facilities and intellectual property related to supply of proprietary iPSC-derived products and ophthalmology research services to biopharma, biotechnology and CRO customers across Europe and the United States. Developed over more than a decade, the platforms encompass advanced retinal organoids and 2D retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) models designed to support preclinical research and translational drug development.

Growing investment in research to discover new therapeutics for eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and rare disease has driven Axol's strategic expansion into ophthalmology with the acquisition of Phenocell in October 2024. The acquisition of Newcells' ophthalmology business further strengthens the company's position as the leading independent provider of iPSC-derived in vitro models for ophthalmology drug discovery, gene therapy development, and retinal safety and toxicity studies.

The news follows Axol's recent $2.8 million financing, led by US life sciences investor BroadOak Capital Partners, which is supporting expansion of its US commercial operations, product development and manufacturing scale-up.

Following our recent financing and continued strong revenue growth, we are executing on a clear strategy to scale Axol internationally and deepen our scientific capabilities. The addition of Newcells' retinal organoid business is our third acquisition in five years and significantly enhances our ophthalmology offering, combining complementary expertise and intellectual property to create the most comprehensive independent portfolio of iPSC-derived retinal models globally."

Liam Taylor, CEO, Axol Bioscience

"Newcells has developed a highly sophisticated and scalable retinal organoid platform focused on predictive, human-relevant iPSC-derived retinal models that are recognised across the industry. Integrating this capability with Axol's existing ophthalmology portfolio enables us to offer a broader, more physiologically relevant toolkit to support research. As drug developers increasingly seek predictive human models to de-risk programs earlier, this acquisition further positions Axol at the forefront of ophthalmology drug discovery and safety testing" said Florian Regent, Head of Ophthalmology, Axol Bioscience.

Financial terms of the agreement are not disclosed.

The Australian Medical Association has called for greater regulation and transparency in the contracts between private health insurance companies and doctors. It expressed concerns that doctors are being pressured into restrictive and opaque agreements on patient care.

Medical practitioners say that the contracts are affecting the choices they make for patient care by restricting treatments, rehabilitation, choice of hospital, and duration of stay.

Around two thirds of all scheduled surgery in Australia is now performed in the private sector, said Julian Rait, MD, ophthalmologist and vice president of the Australian Medical Association.

Nearly all those procedures are performed by doctors under “no gap” or “known gap” contracts with private health insurance companies. In a no-gap contract, doctors agree to charge the patient the same amount that the insurer will reimburse the patient, so there is no excess cost to the patient. In a known gap contract, doctors can charge a fee over and above the reimbursed amount, but that gap is set by the insurer.

The problem is that these contracts can be restrictive, and doctors have no power to negotiate, Rait told Medscape News Australia.

“If a doctor doesn't sign because they consider the insurer's remuneration too low, or even just charges a dollar more than the insurer believes is appropriate, the insurer will slash the benefits they would pay to patients and then blame it on the doctor's fees being excessive,” he said. “Even if the fees are reasonably modest but not quite what the insurer is prepared to pay, they suggest the doctor's being greedy or unreasonable.”

The height of the COVID pandemic raised fears among insurers of a huge surge in demand, and since then, they have sought to protect their capital, said Rait. “They've tried to be circumspect with the reimbursement of hospitals in anticipation that this surge might come.”

As a result, the medical benefits paid are not keeping pace with inflation, said Peter Sumich, MD, eye surgeon and president of the Australian Society of Ophthalmologists in Sydney. “The known gap contract limit that we have, which is how much they can charge as a deductible above what the insurer might reimburse, hasn't changed for years, meaning the doctors have been asked to sign contracts that really don't reflect the current costs of providing care.”

Private Healthcare Australia, which is the representative body for the private health insurance industry, has disputed accusations that profits are not being passed on to patients, saying in a statement that benefits paid to patients increased by 20% from 2017-2018 to 2023-2024, and that for every dollar patients spend on premiums, they are reimbursed $0.84.

Insurers are also exerting control over treatment and management choices, said Sumich. “They're starting to see that the way to control their fund outlays is to control the doctors,” he told Medscape News Australia.

Contracts between doctors and insurers are confidential, but Sumich said that contracts can dictate, for example, the choice of prosthetic, the duration of hospital stay for procedures, and the type of rehabilitation used. “You as a patient should have a contract with a doctor. You go to see your doctor, and your doctor tells you what he wants to do,” he said. “There shouldn't be a third party like a health insurer with their hand in the contract, guiding the doctor's hand.”

While doctors always have the choice to practice independently, Sumich said that this option is becoming increasingly difficult to pursue as insurers gain greater market share, including through the ownership of private hospitals, and can direct patients to their preferred doctors. “It's harder and harder for a doctor to stay uncontracted because he's starting to lose a lot of work,” said Sumich. “I've got patients I've seen for cataract surgery, and they ring us back and say, ‘My health insurer said you're not one of our preferred doctors. Is there something wrong with you?'”

The Australian Medical Association has called for greater regulation of the private health insurance sector, citing a previous observation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that there is no regulatory oversight or limitation on how doctors and insurers contract with each other. Current regulation focuses on interactions between private health insurers and patients, rather than doctors.

“We don't have someone on the other side of the equation who's regulating performance and making sure that the funding that's delivered to the sector by the insurers is adequate to meet the needs of the community,” said Rait. A private health system authority could set a standard for how insurers work with healthcare providers and provide greater transparency in contracts, he said.

Rait and Sumich reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Researchers at Kumamoto University have discovered that behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic-particularly widespread mask-wearing-may have reduced the risk of certain types of heart attacks triggered by air pollution.

The study, led by Dr. Masanobu Ishii and colleagues, was published in the European Society of Cardiology's flagship journal, European Heart Journal.

Fine particulate matter known as PM2.5-tiny airborne particles small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs-has long been recognized as a major environmental risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Exposure can trigger inflammation, oxidative stress, and blood vessel dysfunction, potentially leading to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack.

Using Japan's nationwide cardiovascular database (JROAD-DPC), the research team analyzed data from 270,091 patients hospitalized for AMI between 2012 and 2022. They examined short-term exposure to PM2.5 and compared risks before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought dramatic shifts in public behavior, including mask use and reduced mobility.

The researchers found that short-term exposure to PM2.5 significantly increased the risk of all types of AMI. However, one subtype-MINOCA (myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries), a heart attack without coronary artery obstruction-showed a particularly strong association with air pollution.

Most notably, after the onset of the pandemic, the PM2.5-related risk of MINOCA significantly declined. In contrast, the risk of the more typical heart attack with coronary artery obstruction (MI-CAD) remained largely unchanged.

The findings suggest that pandemic-related preventive behaviors-especially mask-wearing-may have reduced individual exposure to harmful particulate matter, thereby lowering the risk of pollution-triggered vascular dysfunction such as coronary spasm or microvascular impairment.

This study provides real-world evidence that simple protective measures can mitigate cardiovascular risks associated with unavoidable environmental exposures. Even in Japan, where no strict lockdowns were imposed, voluntary public health practices appear to have delivered measurable cardiovascular benefits.

The researchers emphasize that improving air quality remains a long-term priority. However, the findings also highlight the potential of accessible interventions-such as mask use during high-pollution periods-to protect vulnerable populations.

As societies confront ongoing environmental challenges, these insights may help shape future preventive cardiology and public health strategies worldwide.

A major Cochrane review challenges popular claims about intermittent fasting, suggesting it may help with weight loss but offers no meaningful advantage over conventional calorie restriction.

In a recent systematic review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, researchers synthesized data from 22 randomized controlled trials involving 1,995 participants to evaluate the efficacy of intermittent fasting (IF) for adults with overweight or obesity. The review compared various fasting regimens against regular dietary advice, such as continuous calorie restriction, and no intervention.

Review findings suggest that, contrary to popular belief, IF results in little to no difference in weight loss compared to traditional dieting methodologies, based largely on low- to very-low-certainty evidence with potential risk of bias. While the evidence regarding IF's impact on participants' quality of life (QoL) and adverse side effects remains uncertain, the review concludes that IF is a potentially viable but not superior weight-loss strategy based on generally low-certainty evidence. Any statistically observed differences were generally considered unlikely to translate into clinically meaningful advantages.

Obesity is frequently highlighted as one of the most severe behaviorally modifiable public health challenges and is predicted to substantially worsen in the coming years. Clinically defined as a body mass index (BMI) exceeding 30 kg/m2, obesity has traditionally been treated with continuous energy restriction, a reduction in daily caloric intake.

A growing body of research highlights that adherence to energy restriction regimens is difficult, often leading to a "yo-yo" effect in which weight that may be temporarily lost is subsequently regained. These challenges have contributed to the popularity of several fasting programs, many of which are marketed as metabolic "biohacks" that purportedly promote and sustain weight loss.

Intermittent fasting (IF) is one of the most popular approaches, characterized by alternating periods of normal caloric intake with extended periods of little to no food consumption. Proponents posit that fasting triggers physiological benefits beyond simple calorie reduction, such as improved insulin sensitivity and increased fat metabolism. However, these claims remain incompletely substantiated in human clinical evidence, and current data are insufficient to confirm clinically meaningful metabolic advantages beyond calorie restriction alone.

The present systematic Cochrane review evaluated the potential benefits and drawbacks of IF regimens. Data were collated from several major scientific publication repositories, including CENTRAL and MEDLINE (Ovid), and comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating IF in adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight or obese.

The combination of a custom search strategy and screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts yielded 22 RCTs comprising 1,995 participants. Analyses investigated three primary comparisons.

IF versus regular dietary advice (RDA): This comparison evaluated IF protocols, such as time-restricted feeding or alternate-day fasting, against conventional continuous energy restriction or dietary counseling.

IF versus no intervention: This comparison evaluated patients on IF regimens against those on waiting lists or receiving no treatment despite being overweight or obese.

Impacts of IF on safety and participant experience: Included publications were analyzed for adverse events and QoL outcomes.

The primary outcome was the percentage change in body weight from baseline. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of participants achieving at least 5% weight reduction, a validated clinical benchmark for health improvement, planned metabolic outcomes such as lipid profiles, and participant-reported QoL changes. Several planned outcomes, including participant satisfaction and diabetes status, were not reported in the included trials. Evidence certainty was generally low for comparisons involving dietary advice and moderate for some comparisons without intervention.

When comparing IF to RDA, analysis of 21 studies involving 1,430 participants showed a mean difference (MD) in weight loss of -0.33% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.92 to 0.26), indicating similar weight loss across intervention approaches. Evidence certainty was rated low.

The clinical benchmark of achieving at least 5% body weight reduction yielded a risk ratio (RR) of 0.98 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.18), suggesting that IF did not increase the likelihood of clinically significant weight loss compared with conventional RDA approaches. Confidence in this estimate was rated very low.

When comparing IF to no intervention, fasting participants showed greater weight reduction, with MD = -3.42% (95% CI -4.95 to -1.90). Although evidence certainty for this comparison was moderate, the authors interpreted the difference as unlikely to be clearly clinically meaningful, and long-term sustainability remains uncertain. Most studies assessed outcomes over 6 to 12 months, limiting conclusions regarding long-term effects.

QoL data were sparse, reported in only three included trials, and suggested that IF did not significantly improve mental or physical QoL compared with standard diets.

Some studies reported adverse events, including headaches, nausea, and fatigue. However, findings were inconsistent and imprecise, preventing firm conclusions about whether IF carries higher risks than standard dieting. Overall evidence certainty for safety outcomes was low or very low.

This review establishes IF as an alternative dietary approach that appears broadly comparable to, but not superior to, traditional calorie-restriction methods or standard diets. Healthcare providers and the general public may consider IF based on personal preference, practicality, and sustainability rather than expectations of superior weight-loss outcomes. Interpretation should remain cautious given the limited trial duration, methodological variability, and overall low certainty of evidence. Longer-term, higher-quality trials are needed before firm clinical recommendations can be made.

Backing a sign of improved relations between presidents

Tournament expected not to be held every two years

Uefa is ready to back Fifa's proposed expansion of the Club World Cup to 48 teams for the next edition in 2029 in a sign of improving relations between their respective presidents, Aleksander Ceferin and Gianni Infantino.

The European football governing body had opposed plans to grow the Club World Cup over concerns an expanded tournament could threaten the status of the Champions League, but Uefa is now willing to back Fifa in return for an undertaking that the competition will not be held every two years.

Real Madrid proposed a two-year cycle for the Club World Cup during talks with Fifa in Miami in June last year, although given the opposition from Uefa and all the domestic European leagues that idea has not progressed. In a related development, last week Real ended their five‑year legal battle with Uefa by withdrawing formally from the European Super League. They appear ready to fall in line with the global football establishment led by Infantino, Ceferin and Nasser al-Khelaifi, the Paris Saint‑Germain president who chairs European Football Clubs.

The Guardian revealed before the Club World Cup in the US last summer that Fifa was open to expanding the tournament from 32 teams, primarily to guarantee the participation of more of the biggest European clubs after Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United failed to qualify.

Infantino then said in a speech at the general assembly of European Football Clubs in Rome last October that expansion was on the agenda, saying Fifa was working “to see how we can make this event bigger, even better, even more impactful”.

Uefa's opposition was a potentially significant obstacle, but another remains with Fifa subject to legal action from the lobby group European Leagues that has been taken to the European Commission. That relates to the international match calendar, including decisions concerning the Club World Cup.

While some at Uefa remain concerned that the huge financial rewards of the Club World Cup will have a destabilising effect on European football, an expansion to 48 clubs is regarded as less disruptive than making it a biennial event.

Although the fine detail has yet to be agreed, European clubs would be among the main beneficiaries of the expansion, with the number of Uefa qualifiers likely to increase from 12 last year to 16 in 2029. Chelsea won £85m from the competition's £774m prize pot for winning it last year and adding more European teams would have implications for the competitive balance of the Champions League.

Uefa's position is the latest sign of improved relations with Fifa, which reached a nadir when Ceferin and a group of European delegates including the Football Association chair, Debbie Hewitt, staged a walkout at Fifa congress in Paraguay last May in protest at the late arrival of Infantino, who had been on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East involving Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman. With Ceferin and Infantino likely to seek re-election for fourth terms next year, sources close to both men have indicated that a period of calm is in both their interests.

Spain and Morocco are favourites to host the next Club World Cup, which will take place in the summer of 2029, before their co‑hosting of the 2030 World Cup.

Uefa declined to comment.

There will be 111 days between the day the 2026 MLS season kicks off and the U.S. men's national team's World Cup opening match against Paraguay in Los Angeles, leaving many players scrambling for form and opportunity within that spell. 

While European talents have elevated their game in recent months, there will still be a significant number of American players on the squad who ply their trade in MLS when the World Cup comes around, making the start of the season a vital opportunity.

Here, Sports Illustrated takes a look at five USMNT players to keep an eye on in MLS, at least early this season. 

Columbus Crew fullback and midfielder Max Arfsten will adjust to a new tactical outlook under manager Henrik Rydström the first portions of the MLS regular season, with the intention of finding form before the March friendlies, where he is set to enter as a fringe player for the final World Cup roster.

He's been one of Pochettino's top MLS contributors and has had ample time under the Argentine manager since he earned a call into the 2025 January camp. The shift to a three-man backline with wingbacks also serves him well, and he could been seen as an invaluable national team player within months.

Yet, with any coaching change, there's risk with Arfsten that things take a different turn in Columbus under Ryström.

Sebastian Berhalter operated only in the shadow of Matt Freese among breakout players in 2025 who could represent the USMNT at the 2026 World Cup. 

Now close friends with German legend Thomas Müller, Berhalter enters this season as the heartbeat of Vancouver Whitecaps FC midfield, after racking up four goals and 11 assists in 29 regular-season games in 2025.

His presence, particularly his set-piece delivery with the USMNT, also stood out, with a goal and three assists in nine caps. Among those highlights is a perfectly curled set-piece finish against Uruguay in a friendly and pinpoint free-kick delivery for Chris Richards's winning goal in Gold Cup play against Saudi Arabia.

With Christian Pulisic's concerning bill of health at AC Milan, the USMNT needs someone who can deliver a potent set piece, and that looks to be Berhalter. The question throughout the start of the 2026 campaign will be whether he can maintain his composure and dominance in a physically demanding style of play.

All signs point to Matt Freese being the No. 1 goalkeeper for the USMNT at the World Cup this summer, and he will look to solidify that role with a strong start to the season with New York City FC.

At the same time, his performance will be measured alongside other American backstops, including the New England Revolution's Matt Turner and the Columbus Crew's Patrick Schulte, with it looking assured that the USMNT goalkeeping core will come out of the Eastern Conference.

Freese's ability as a pure shot-stopping backstop makes him stand out. Still, he will want to maintain his consistency from 2025 and continue developing his skills as a distributor out of the back, which is a key factor for a three-man backline on the international stage. 

It's been quite the rise for a goalkeeper who only made his USMNT debut at 26 last June and went on to start all but one match over the rest of 2025, leading into the World Cup year. 

With the shift to a back-three, Miles Robinson's versatility becomes more signfciant within the USMNT picture. A two-time MLS All-Star and now the highest-paid defender in MLS on a new contract, he will look to establish himself as a starter for the Stars and Stripes and to enjoy another strong season with FC Cincinnati.

The Eastern Conference won't be easy, and much of Cincinnati's focus remains on the central attacking pieces of Evander and Kévin Denkey. Still, Robinson's experience, skill and leadership at the back could be vital.

He missed out on the 2022 World Cup due to a torn Achilles' tendon a few months before kickoff, adding a little more motivation to stay in and stay healthy through the start of the MLS campaign.  

There is every indication that Cristian Roldan will play a key role for the USMNT at the World Cup, given his impressive showings in each of the six fall friendlies, notably with a pair of assists against Australia last October.

A veteran of the Seattle Sounders, Roldan's ability to be versatile makes him an attractive option to any team. Sometimes he can play an elusive attacking midfielder role, while at other times he fades into the rhythm of the game at the heartbeat of the pitch. His best use, however, might just be kickstarting transitions, as he has done with the Sounders and USMNT as a defensive midfielder at times. 

Having experience playing at the 2022 World Cup won't hurt either, even if he didn't get any minutes at that tournament.

Philadelphia Union's Subaru Park will play a huge part in a team's preparations ahead of and during this summer's FIFA World Cup 2026 tournament.

Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations champion, will use Subaru Park as a team headquarters and one of its training bases during the 2026 World Cup tournament.

According to a Philadelphia Union news release, the Côte d'Ivoire 'Les Éléphants' will also train at the WSFS Bank Sportsplex in Chester, Pennsylvania.

Here's where to find Subaru Park, and if you can watch Côte d'Ivoire train and practice.

Subaru Park is located at 1 Stadium Drive in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

The WSFS Bank Sportsplex is on Seaport Drive in West Chester.

Most FIFA World Cup training and practice sessions are closed to the general public, but that rule may be relaxed as the tournament approaches.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup group stage will begin on Thursday, June 11 2026, and run through Sunday, July 19.

Canada, Mexico and the United States are 2026 FIFA World Cup host countries.

Backing a sign of improved relations between presidents

Tournament expected not to be held every two years

Uefa is ready to back Fifa's proposed expansion of the Club World Cup to 48 teams for the next edition in 2029 in a sign of improving relations between their respective presidents, Aleksander Ceferin and Gianni Infantino.

European football's governing body had opposed plans to grow the Club World Cup over concerns an expanded tournament could threaten the status of the Champions League, but Uefa is now willing to back Fifa in return for an undertaking that the competition will not be held every two years.

Real Madrid proposed a two-year cycle for the Club World Cup during talks with Fifa in Miami last June, although given the opposition from Uefa and all the domestic European leagues that idea has not progressed. In a related development Real last week ended their five-year legal battle with Uefa by formally withdrawing from the European Super League,. They appear ready to fall in line with the global football establishment led by Infantino, Ceferin and Nasser al-Khelaifi, the Paris Saint-Germain president who chairs European Football Clubs.

The Guardian revealed before the Club World Cup in the US last summer Fifa was open to expanding the tournament from 32 teams, primarily to guarantee the participation of more of the biggest European clubs after Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United failed to qualify.

Infantino then said in a speech at the general assembly of European Football Clubs in Rome last October that expansion was on the agenda, saying Fifa was working “to see how we can make this event bigger, even better, even more impactful”.

Uefa's opposition was a potentially significant obstacle, but another remains with Fifa subject to legal action from the lobby group European Leagues that has been taken to the European Commission. That relates to the international match calendar, including decisions concerning the Club World Cup.

While some at Uefa remain concerned that the huge financial rewards of the Club World Cup will have a destabilising effect on European football, an expansion to 48 clubs is regarded as less disruptive than making it a biennial event.

Although the fine detail has yet to be agreed European clubs would be among the main beneficiaries of the expansion, with the number of Uefa qualifiers likely to increase from 12 last year to 16 in 2029. Chelsea won £85m from the competition's £774m prize pot for winning it last year and adding more European teams would have implications for the competitive balance of the Champions League.

Uefa's position is the latest sign of improved relations with Fifa, which reached a nadir when Ceferin and a group of European delegates including the Football Association chair, Debbie Hewitt, staged a walkout at Fifa congress in Paraguay last May in protest at the late arrival of Infantino, who had been on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East involving Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman.

With Ceferin and Infantino likely to seek re-election for fourth terms next year, sources close to both men have indicated that a period of calm is in both their interests.

Spain and Morocco are favourites to host the next Club World Cup, which will take place in the summer of 2029, before their co-hosting of the 2030 World Cup.

Uefa declined to comment.

Travel rental platform Airbnb is rolling out a $750 incentive to attract new hosts in the 16 North American cities gearing up to welcome millions of visitors for the FIFA World Cup in mid-2026.

New “entire home” hosts who successfully fulfill their first guest stay between now and July 31 will qualify for the payout under the program, Airbnb said, describing it as the company's largest-ever incentive for new hosts.

Last month, FIFA said it received more than 500 million ticket requests for the 2026 World Cup during a 33-day application window.

Demand for lodgings during the FIFA World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, has been skyrocketing. 

On match days, vacation rental prices are up as much as 50% from a year ago in some host cities, according to travel data firm AirDNA.

Airbnb expects hosts in the New York-New Jersey area, Boston and Los Angeles to earn the most during the tournament, projecting per-host earnings above $5,000 in all three markets.

Beyond the three host nations, FIFA received most ticket applications from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.

The World Cup could provide a much-needed boost to US international inbound travel demand, which was down 5.4% through November 2025, per the US National Travel and Tourism Office.

﻿The U-23 team will play two matches against the Mexico U-23 Women's National Team, on March 3 and March 6.

Twenty-four players have been called up to the first U-23 USYNT training camp of 2026, including players from the Portland Thorns, Denver Summit, and NJ/NY Gotham FC, US Soccer announced on Wednesday. The camp will run from February 27 to March 7 in South Florida.

19 players on the roster play in the NWSL, while two (Lexi Missimo and Liz Beardsley) play in the USL Super League. Three players—Sierra Sythe, Sydney Cheesman, and Hope Leyba—currently play in the NCAA. Of the NWSL players on the roster, ten are currently entering their rookie season.

Just one player on the roster, defender Ayo Oke, has previous experience playing for the Senior USWNT. Oke earned her first cap in January in a match against Chile.

The U-23 team serves as a crucial way USWNT coach Emma Hayes has developed the USWNT player pool. 14 players who played on the U-23 squad last year eventually earned caps with the Senior USWNT.

Former Premier League striker Dave Kitson has revealed he was the 'Secret Footballer', a pseudonym he used to pen articles and books during his playing career without revealing his identity. The series focused on what goes on behind the scenes in elite-level football, with topics ranging from matchdays to transfers and contracts. Many punters attempted to unmask the author while he was still playing, but Kitson has now confirmed he was behind the phenomenon.

'The Secret Footballer' series created plenty of intrigue during its run, with fans fascinated by the insights provided in a weekly newspaper column which often shedded light on the more frustrating aspects of professional football. Five books were also published under the pseudonym, some of which were written as memoirs, but the secrecy of the author often prompted debate among supporters. Groups were even formed online as people attempted to solve the mystery of his identity, but that has now come to an end with Kitson revealing he is the former Premier League striker who penned the books and newspaper columns.

Kitson first made his name at Cambridge United and Reading, playing for the latter in the Premier League after the Royals broke the record for the most points in a single Championship season with 106 during the 2005-06 campaign. He would later turn out for the likes of Stoke City, Portsmouth, Sheffield United and Oxford United before retiring in 2015 after a brief spell with Arlesey Town.

Speaking on the Liberty Rock Sport Podcast, Kitson revealed: "I am The Secret Footballer. I've never said that out loud before. It was an idea that came to me when I wasn't happy with where football was going and I needed an outlet to express it for my own mental health.

"I've been writing since I was a kid. It's a passion. As I said, I wanted to be a travel writer. The writing was cathartic. It helped me process what was going on in football.

"It started as something that wasn't about naming names. It was about explaining what happens in the industry and why.

"I would write and leave people to form their own opinions. It was fun for a while, then it bred huge anxiety. I had a career and a big contract. If I'd been outed, I would have been sacked and ostracised. Now everyone has a podcast and an outlet. Back then, it was genuinely new.

"It changed football in this country and led to overhauls at the highest levels, which I'm proud of. But the stress and anxiety were immense."

Kitson also spoke about how the death of Gary Speed in 2011 played a role in his decision to end his career as 'The Secret Footballer'. Speed, a former midfielder for Leeds United, Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers among others, was found dead at his home at the age of 42.

Kitson said: "The worst thing that happened was when I wrote a column about mental health called 'Sometimes There's Darkness Behind the Light.'

"Nobody talked about mental health in football then. If you spoke about it, you were seen as weak. I said there was a mental health epidemic and I predicted it was only a matter of time before someone took their own life.

"I submitted it on Friday. It went out Saturday. On Sunday, Gary Speed was found dead. That's when the Secret Footballer stopped being fun."

Kitson has tried his hand at punditry since retiring as a player but now predominantly works as a motivational speaker in the mental health sphere.

In 2020, the former striker apologised to Raheem Sterling having appeared to suggest the former Manchester City star had "made himself a target" for racism two years earlier.

He said: "Perhaps I used clumsy language and for that I apologise. But I never have and never will condone any form of racism.

"I admire Raheem for taking up the fight and saying: 'No, I'm not having this'. And I agree with him. More needs to be done. And I'm prepared to do it.

"And if he, or anyone, wants to discuss that matter with me, and what I intend to do, I'm more than happy to have that chat and put his mind – and that of other players - to rest."

Outrage is spreading in the US as reports claim a 2030 World Cup host nation plans to kill roughly three million stray dogs, prompting boycott calls.

Morocco was confirmed in 2023 as a co-host alongside Spain and Portugal, a decision that animal rights groups say has coincided with an alleged campaign to cull stray dogs in several cities.

Activists argue the effort is intended to make urban areas and tourist hotspots appear cleaner and safer ahead of the 2030 tournament, as the country seeks to attract international visitors, fans and media attention.

In Defense of Animals, a US-based advocacy group, said: 'These wounded, terrified animals are hauled off to remote sites, where they are poisoned or shot and dumped in mass graves, many still alive. 

'For months now, between 60 and 70 dogs have been disposed of every other day in cities like Marrakech and Agadir.'

Images showing dogs bleeding, butchered and dying from gunshot wounds in the streets have circulated widely on social media, fueling calls among Americans for a boycott of the 2030 World Cup.

'If Morocco is really killing dogs to prepare for the World Cup 2030, the US, should boycott the World Cup and wage all-out economic war,' one user wrote on X.

Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator, called the allegations 'animal abuse,' adding: 'Every dog lover should BOYCOTT FIFA! The fact that FIFA is allowing Morocco to host the World Cup when Morocco is murdering three million dogs should be disqualifying.'

Activists argue the effort is intended to make urban areas and tourist hotspots appear cleaner and safer ahead of the 2030 tournament, as the country seeks to attract international visitors, fans and media attention

A FIFA spokesperson told Daily Mail that during its bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup, Morocco emphasized its commitment to animal welfare, noting government efforts to expand clinics and support programs for stray dogs.

'With the bidding process now completed, FIFA is following up with its local counterparts with the aim of ensuring commitments are upheld,' the FIFA spokesperson continued.

FIFA also said it is working with the animal welfare group International Animal Welfare and Protection Coalition (IAWPC), which convened a global panel of senior legal and animal welfare experts to review Morocco's draft regulations; their recommendations have now been submitted to Moroccan authorities.

Morocco's Embassy in London has denied the claims, insisting there is no cull of stray dogs and citing what it described as the country's commitment to humane and sustainable animal management.

A spokesman said last year that Morocco launched a Trap, Neuter, Vaccinate, Release program in 2019 and is investing in clinics, veterinary services, and municipal hygiene systems, adding: 'It is entirely untrue that Morocco is planning to cull stray dogs ahead of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.'

However, the IAWPC said it 'has documented widespread and systematic killings of both stray and owned dogs across Morocco, which it says are being carried out by so-called “death squads” in preparation for the country's role as co-host of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.' 

Les Ward MBE, Chairman of the IAWPC, said in a statement: 'These killings are taking place every single day, in full view of children, tourists, and local communities.

'It is relentless, merciless and utterly inhumane. Since the IAWPC campaign began, it has become clear to us and everyone else, that we are dealing with a slippery and untrustworthy government. 

An estimated three million stray dogs live on Morocco's streets

Animal activist groups claimed to have seen documentation recording the dog killings

'They make claims that have no basis in reality, including that the killing has ended, when every Moroccan knows it is happening every single day.' 

The IAWPC has offered to help Morocco implement large-scale, humane dog population control strategies such as Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (TNVR), but says its repeated offers have been ignored. 

While the 2030 World Cup will not be hosted in the US, many Americans have vowed to not watch the games after hearing the disturbing reports about Morocco.

One X user shared: 'Boycott the World Cup. I won't ever watch it.' 

'The cull and massacre of street dogs, with hideous painful poison and brutal beating to death has already started. People need to boycott this FIFA World Cup in Morocco,' another X user posted.

Hollywood actor Mark Ruffalo has also thrown his support behind the IAWPC campaign to stop the killings in an X post that reads: 'Killing millions of dogs to prepare for a global sporting event is not progress, it's a moral failure.

'The World Cup should unite the world, not be built on suffering that happens behind closed doors. Humane solutions exist, and choosing compassion over violence is a responsibility we all share.'

Competition will be fierce with a strong roster going into the Cup

Emma Hayes has called in her roster for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup and it gives a glimpse into the state of the USWNT heading into a year that will conclude with World Cup qualification. She called in a strong, experienced roster with no uncapped players and some key positions that can be solidified with good performances in the tournament. The players who are and are not included say a lot about those players and about how the team is shaping up this year.

Some of the players who are not in the picture have been in recent callups or might have been expected to get a look for the Cup have some work to do in order to make future rosters.

Croix Bethune - After making the roster for the Olympics the midfielder got two caps in 2025 and made the field in both of the USWNT matches in January. Bethune has some work to do if she wants to fit into the aggressive style Hayes needs in the midfield and for now will be sitting on the bubble when it comes to making the national team unless she steps up in the NWSL this year.

Sophia Wilson - The striker isn't ready yet but that can change. Wilson is aiming for an NWSL opening day return but won't get a chance to train with the USWNT for the SheBelieves Cup. The striker depth is decent but with her skill and fit in Hayes' system well established, she can still be in the picture for upcoming callups.

Korbin Sharder - The young midfielder is still out of the picture. With the European season in full swing and players representing clubs in France and the UK featuring on the roster, Sharder being left off the roster firmly puts her on the U-23 squad at this time. She has been inconsistent with the senior team and hasn't seen the field for the USA since April of 2025.

Some players are making a return after being absent from the team or did well enough in recent callups to earn a place on the team. Those spots are looking more solid but depth around the field will make claiming an ongoing role with the team a challenge.

Jameese Joseph - The midfielder will have a chance for her third cap following her first international goal against Chile in January. She obviously did enough to get another look and it seems like Hayes wants to get a clear picture of options for striker this year.

Claire Hutton - Hayes set high expectations for the midfielder in January and she has met them. The midfielder is here to stay. In general the midfield depth is a big strength of the team and the 20 year-old just made a huge move to Bay FC from the KC Current in a deal worth $1.1 million. It will be no surprise seeing her anchor the midfield throughout the Cup.

Phallon Tullis-Joyce - The goalkeeper is back in the picture and has played well for the national team. That said, she has work to do to start over Claudia Dickey who made six starts in 2025 and one this year.

Real Madrid have been warned to not expect Rodri to join them if he chooses to leave Manchester City due to his preference for another Spanish club. Rodri is on the road back to his best after missing almost all of last season due to tearing his ACL and having repeated injury setbacks this campaign, boosting City's bid to win the Premier League and go deep in the Champions League.

Rodri's long-term future at City, however, is far from assured. He is soon to enter the final year of his contract at the Etihad Stadium and Real Madrid have long been tipped as his next destination. Madrid are experts at convincing players to see out their contracts in order to move to the Bernabeu on a free transfer, as they have done with Kylian Mbappe, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Antonio Rudiger among others. But Spain legend Gaizka Mendieta believes Rodri might have another destination on his mind.

Mendieta told BetBrothers: "When he does leave Man City I could see it being an agreement with the club, there is also a big connection there with Barcelona. There was Txiki Begiristain there and of course Pep Guardiola, but it would still be up to Rodri personally. I still think it would be hard for him to join Real Madrid."

Mendieta predicts that Rodri will actually want to remain at City and get back to the form he was in just before he suffered his serious injury in 2024, one month before winning the Ballon d'Or. 

He added: "Personally, I think it's difficult to see that [him leaving] happening, especially knowing Rodri, how he is attached to the club and everything else. It would have to be a very extreme situation where he is kind of forced to leave rather than leaving just because he wants to. I think he wants to stay there and wants to perform to the level he did when he was in the running for the Ballon d'Or and Champions League medals. So I think as a player that's his challenge, and that's what he wants to prove to himself and for the club and the fans."

Mendieta, however, believes that there is one thing that might make Rodri consider his future in Manchester: Pep Guardiola leaving. There is an expectation that the serial winning coach could leave City at the end of the campaign, which is his 10th at the Etihad Stadium. Guardiola has refused to comment on the speculation, pointing to the fact that he has one year left on his contract. 

He said in December: "The last three or four years, every time during a certain, period someone asks me that question. Sooner or later, when I'm 75 or 76, I will quit Manchester City. I understand the question when I have the end of a contract (coming) but I have 18 months left and I am so delighted and happy and excited about the development of the team and being there. That is all I can say.

"That question happens every single season at a certain point and I'm OK. The club and I are incredibly connected in terms of the decisions we have to take and when it's going to happen, it's going to happen. There are no discussions - end of the subject. There are no discussions. I will not be eternally here, but I've said before I will not be here forever. None of us will be forever in this world but there are no discussions."

Guardiola has won six Premier League titles in eight attempts with City as well as capturing the club's first Champions League in 2023. His departure will inevitably leave a huge shadow around the club and Mendieta believes it could lead to Rodri also leaving.

The former Barcelona, Valencia and Middlesbrough midfielder added: "If there are to be any changes, I think the time will be when Pep leaves the club for Rodri to think about his future too."

Women in Sports

Trinity Rodman has stepped into 2026 with clarity, confidence, and a contract that reset the market. After weeks of uncertainty, her National Women's Soccer League future is secure with the Washington Spirit, thanks to a reported three-year deal worth $2 million annually — the highest salary in global women's soccer.

Her body is cooperating, too. A sprained knee has healed. Chronic back issues have eased. And in her long-awaited return to the United States women's national soccer team, she didn't just blend in. She wore the captain's armband. She scored. Then she scored again.

Now, with coach Emma Hayes calling her back in for the 2026 SheBelieves Cup, Rodman is positioned as a central figure in the early build toward the 2027 World Cup. “I'm just motivated to be on the field as much as I can,” Rodman said after Spirit training in suburban D.C. “I've felt really good in national team camp [last month], and then coming into preseason [getting] a lot of minutes” in two friendlies.

Rodman had options. European clubs were watching. The idea of testing herself abroad was real. “I definitely go through phases of like, ‘OK, I'm good. I can do something different, try something new,'” she said.

But stability mattered. “There's also times where I'm like, ‘OK, I'm not ready to do something or I need to be in a stable situation, comfortable in the U.S.'” The internal tug-of-war was ongoing.

“I go back and forth: ‘Oh, should I have done this, should I have gone overseas or whatever?' But through it all, it's just trusting myself, because I've been open to everything, and I've teetered back and forth where I've been so close to being like, ‘OK, I'm going,' and I'm like, ‘Wait, no, I'm not ready.'”

Ultimately, unfinished business in Washington won out. “There's still more to do, and if I do make a big jump or a big decision like that, I want to feel like I've fully fulfilled what I want to do in D.C. before I'm bouncing around everywhere, if that makes sense.”

It makes perfect sense for a player who won an NWSL title as a rookie in 2021, then landed on the losing side of the last two finals. “We have redeeming to do,” she said.

Spirit coach Adrián González called her “super excited” in camp and emphasized how critical her return is not just for the club, but for the league's growth. “For the fans, for the team, for the league, for the people that love soccer in this country, it's really positive having players like her,” González said.

The 23-year-old forward is no longer just a rising star. Through her performance, personality, and marketing power, she has become the face of U.S. soccer talent based in the U.S.

Last season was fragmented. Injuries limited her to 15 regular-season matches, two playoff appearances as a substitute, and one U.S. friendly. Contract uncertainty hovered in the background. This year, she wants clean lines.

“With contract matters behind her, Rodman aims to have a year without interruption or distraction.” That means consistent minutes, chemistry with new teammates, and building toward Washington's March 13 opener against the Portland Thorns at Audi Field.

“We still have a lot to show and a lot more to our game as a team as a whole,” she said. “Having a lot of new faces this year and more internationals, there's still a lot of connections to be built in certain units on the field, so I'm excited to see those grow.”

There will be one noticeable absence. Close friend and U.S. teammate Croix Bethune was traded to the Kansas City Current after requesting a move. “I was really bummed about Croix. I can't lie,” Rodman said. “We're very close friends, so I was just really sad about that, in general. She has to do what's best for her.” Then, with a grin, “Unfortunately, Kansas City. I think she's going to thrive. She'll thrive at any club.”

Off the field, Rodman found a rare scheduling sweet spot. Because Spirit camp timing aligned, she was able to attend boyfriend Ben Shelton's tournament in Greater Dallas, where he pushed toward his fourth tour title. “Him being able to win that conveniently on my off days was amazing,” she said with a smile. “So I'm really happy.”

Shelton even acknowledged the pattern: “This is the second tournament that my girlfriend has shown up on the semifinals day. I'm 2-0 in semis when she shows up for that.”

Rodman, ever practical, described their balance clearly. “We do really good at being there for each other, but also trying to be realistic at times where it's like, ‘OK, that's a little much. That's going to exhaust us,'” she said. “Yeah, big moments I try to show up for. Thankfully, I was there for Dallas, but we go with the flow.”

Rodman enters her sixth professional season healthy, financially secure, and central to both club and country plans. The National Women's Soccer League needed to keep her. The Spirit needed to keep her. And she chose to stay.

Now the focus narrows: SheBelieves Cup, NWSL redemption, and laying bricks toward 2027. Trinity Rodman is building, and right now, everything is aligned.

United States soccer star Christian Pulisic has earned the nickname “Captain America” in Italy as AC Milan's leading goal scorer last season and American fans are hoping he brings that energy to the U.S. national team during the World Cup in the summer. Reporting for TODAY, NBC's Peter Alexander sits down with Pulisic for a discussion about his early love for the sport, his first children's book “Christian's Soccer Superpowers,” and living out his dream in Italy.Feb. 18, 2026

U.S. Soccer is poised to present a fiscal 2027 budget projecting record revenue of $397M, driven largely by this summer's FIFA World Cup in North America. That represents a 30% increase over the updated revenue forecast for fiscal 2026, which runs through March 31, and a 50% jump from fiscal 2025. The proposed FY27 budget, set to be presented for approval at U.S. Soccer's Annual General Meeting on Saturday in Atlanta, incorporates significant one-time World Cup revenue and expenses. Although the document does not break out gross tournament figures, it projects a net $5M investment tied to ticketing, hospitality, marketing campaigns, sporting preparation and player payments. 

Notably, World Cup legacy funds from FIFA have not been factored into the budget. U.S. Soccer has not publicly indicated how much it expects to receive from FIFA and said it lacks clarity on the timing and potential use restrictions. Excluding one-time World Cup revenue, the federation projects core revenue growth of 6%–9%. 

Commercial activity represents the largest share of budgeted revenue at $269M, including $227M from sponsorship, licensing and fan engagement. U.S. Soccer has grown its partnership roster dramatically in the lead-up to the World Cup, with 23 brands currently on board. Fundraising is expected to contribute $77M. 

Sporting revenue, which includes projected World Cup prize money, is pegged at $21M. FIFA is distributing a record total of $655M to the 48 participating nations, with individual payments ranging from $9M to $50M depending on how far a team advances. The $21M sporting revenue projection suggests the federation is budgeting for the men's national team to advance beyond the group stage, though the figure does not correspond exactly to a specific FIFA prize tier. 

Beyond the World Cup, fiscal 2027 is also notable in that it will mark the opening of the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center in Fayetteville, Ga. The federation expects to spend $9.5M operating the facility in its first year while generating $1.3M from conferences, catering and operations. Sponsorship income associated with the training center is included in commercial revenue. 

Overall, U.S. Soccer projects a $6M operating surplus after investment in fiscal 2027, more than three times the forecasted surplus for fiscal 2026. After accounting for $11.8M in depreciation and amortization tied largely to the opening of the facility, however, the federation would post a consolidated deficit of roughly $6M.

Bundesliga

Noahkai Banks scored on his first Augsburg start, against Wolfsburg in October 2025 Adam Pretty/Getty Images

You would not think it to look at him: calm under pressure, fierce in the tackle and every inch the imposing modern centre-back, but Noahkai Banks felt anxious flying to New Jersey last September.

The teenager had been called into his first international camp with the USMNT, and suddenly — despite eye-catching Bundesliga appearances, praise from U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino and the confident demeanour that typifies him — he felt a flicker of self-doubt.

“I was pretty nervous when I got into camp, because I was 18 years old,” he said during a session with international media last week. “So I thought maybe the older guys would think, ‘Who's that? What is he doing here?'

“But it was great. It was incredible. Players like (Christian) Pulisic and (Tim) Weah helped me a lot.”

The nerves did not last long. Banks might not have made it onto the field in the subsequent friendlies against South Korea and Japan, but he left the camp with an extra spring in his step and a head brimming with information.

This included tips on positioning from former centre-back Pochettino, chats with veteran defender Tim Ream, and some great stories to tell the family WhatsApp group.

It was in that group that he found out about the opportunity — his mum Nadine had sent him a link to the manager's reaction to questions about her son prior to the camp.

Where some coaches may try to dampen down expectations, Pochettino took a different route. “I saw him playing in Germany and he's a massive talent,” the Argentine said. “You never know how he can explode — maybe at the end of the season he can be the best center-back in Europe or in Germany.”

Little wonder, then, that Banks' progress with Augsburg in the Bundesliga — Germany's top flight — has continued since. Now 19, he is becoming one of the league's standout young players.

His American father, Cedric, is a former U.S. army paratrooper and his German-born mother, Nadine, was once a promising college basketball player. It is therefore not surprising he is both fearless and athletic (standing 6ft 4in, 193cm tall).



His physical capabilities have meant that playing in a team battling to avoid being dragged into the relegation zone in his breakthrough season has not phased him.

He even marked his first start for Augsburg in October with a goal in the third minute of a 3-1 win over Wolfsburg.

Banks has not looked back since, starting the 16 subsequent league games bar one, when he was suspended against Bayern Munich, but he came straight back into the side thereafter.

“Because the goal was in my first start, it was great,” he says. “I was so chill after, but the emotions were crazy.

“I think it was one of the best moments of my life. My mom was sitting in the first row, and I saw her crying. That was very cool for my whole family.”

Banks' father is from Hawaii, where Noahkai was born before later moving to Germany with his mum when his parents separated. Despite interest from the German Football Association, he has so far chosen to follow the U.S. pathway onto the international stage.

He spent his childhood in the Bavarian town of Dietmannsried, and grew up wanting to emulate Bayern Munich and Germany World Cup winner Jerome Boateng. At the age of seven, he joined Augsburg's academy.

He already compares favourably in statistical terms with other center-backs in the German top flight this term.

He ranks highly for “true” tackles per 1,000 opposition touches — a metric that combines tackles won, tackles lost, and fouls committed while attempting a tackle — to give an indication of how often a player looks to put their foot in and challenge.



Combined with a high true interception rate, it paints the picture of an aggressive, front-footed defender who is proactive and does not shy away from a challenge.

He is an outlet for his team and has good vision on the ball. Banks has drawn plaudits for his passing accuracy and has the best long-pass completion rate of any Bundesliga center-back to have played 900+ minutes this season.

His calmness under pressure was evident during the 2-2 draw with Freiburg last month at Augsburg's WWK Arena. As the visitors pressed high, Banks showed for the ball in the six-yard box despite opponents coming at him at pace.



He quickly picked a pass upfield and delivered it perfectly to team-mate Fabian Rieder. Banks' quick thinking and accuracy had taken six Freiburg players out of the game in an instant, and Rieder was able to release the pressure on the hosts by launching a counter-attack.



His passing range is clear again in the images below. This time, he helped under-pressure Augsburg get up the field with purpose against Werder Bremen last December.

 

In this passage of play, Banks spotted space for Robin Fellhauer and played a clever long pass that allowed the wing-back to get behind Bremen's back line and create a chance with a dangerous cutback.



“It has been a great year so far, because I didn't expect to play that much, to be absolutely honest,” Banks says. “The coaches have given me a lot of trust, a lot of minutes. From time to time, I got more confident with the team, with my team-mates, with the players, with the tactics.”

Despite his abundant self-belief, he prefers not to talk too much about his chances of making this summer's World Cup, even with speculation growing that he may get another call-up for the friendly games against Belgium and Portugal next month. After that, Pochettino will begin to finalise his roster for June.

“It's not the right moment to think about the World Cup for me, because we have a lot of games left here (at Augsburg),” he says. “We want to win those games because we have goals for the season.

“So I really just focus — a lot of players say it, but I really mean it — on the games we have here.

“Then let's see what happens in the summer.”

Until then, Banks says his attention is on Augsburg's campaign, while also keeping warm in a harsh German winter by spending rare days off indoors watching action films.

His favorites? “The Equalizer and Man on Fire because I love Denzel Washington,” he says.

Don't rule out Banks becoming the leading man in a U.S. jersey before long.

Morocco is poisoning, shooting and burning stray dogs alive to clean the streets ahead of the 2030 World Cup, animal rights activists have alleged. They have shared photos of the atrocities with FIFA and are hoping action will be taken to protect the dogs. 

Warning: Some content might be disturbing to readers. Discretion is advised

Morocco has started killing stray dogs as part of a campaign linked to preparation for the 2030 World Cup. Weeks ago, reports emerged that the North African nation would cull more than three million dogs ahead of the sporting extravaganza. Animal rights activists alleged that this was being done to make the country appealing to tourists, fans and media during the World Cup, and dispel any negative image that is associated with strays. Now they claim that Morocco has started killing the dogs using brutal means. The country was named co-hosts for the 2023 World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal in 2023. Animal welfare organisations are sharing images showing the brutality being committed against the dogs. They allege the dogs are being caught through horrific means. They are being clamped by the neck and loaded in trucks before being poisoned or shot by a firing squad. Their bodies are then disposed of in mass graves.

Marrakech has reportedly become the designated "kill centre" where dogs are being killed in warehouses. A local report published last month suggested that the dogs are taken to the facility, which has meat hooks and washable flooring, in vans where they are "processed". Some witnesses also alleged that in a few places, the dogs are being starved and then burned alive. The International Animal Welfare and Protection Coalition (IAWPC) claims Morocco has committed similar atrocities ahead of big events in the past. The organisation also blamed FIFA for indirectly enabling the practice.

The organisations have gathered all evidence of the brutalities and compiled them in a 91-page dossier. They have submitted the same to FIFA to prove how the stray dogs are being poisoned, shot and burned. However, they are concerned that their pleas are falling on deaf ears. "After the [World Cup confirmation], the extermination of the dogs has increased dramatically. As a result, the fear is that Morocco will now go ahead with their plan for the mass slaughter of three million dogs," IAWPC said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail quoted a FIFA spokesperson as saying that at the time of the confirmation, Morocco stated that it was committed to animal welfare. "With the bidding process now completed, FIFA is following up with its local counterparts to ensure commitments are upheld," the FIFA spokesperson said.

World Cup

Soccer players running off of the ball on a dirt pitch in a Brooklyn NYC park Keith Getter

FIFA president Gianni Infantino and vice president Victor Montagliani gathered before a room full of journalists in Manhattan in the summer of 2022 to unveil the 16 host cities for the 2026 World Cup.

Even then — six months before Argentina lifted its third World Cup in Qatar — the FIFA heads knew the next edition of the men's World Cup would be “special.” It did not matter that football was far from the most popular sport in Canada or the United States — two of the three host nations, along with Mexico.

“The game, especially here in North America, has been built on the backs of immigrants,” Montagliani told reporters that day. “The game here — like the countries, quite honestly — were built on the backs of immigrants, so was the game of football. So, I think (this World Cup) has a special meaning for immigrants.”

That this announcement happened at Rockefeller Center in New York City, arguably the immigrant capital of the United States, if not the world, was fitting.

Off the Statue of Liberty's shores. In a city where more than 800 languages are spoken. Less than 10 miles from MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., which would later be named host of the 2026 final.

Make no mistake: this region, and East Rutherford in particular, was selected to showcase eight matches, and the competition's crown jewel, in large part for its diverse population. Local leaders, such as former New York City mayor Eric Adams and former New Jersey governor Phil Murphy, have repeated that sentiment time and again.

After unveiling the location of the final two years ago, Infantino said, “Being in New York, which is such a cosmopolitan city, where you have, between New York and New Jersey, over 200 nationalities there, celebrating and uniting the world, is something unique.”

But the diversity that was celebrated for so long is now being turned on its head.

I was recently at a bar in East Rutherford with friends who, like me, grew up in this small town, defrosting from the snow at our neighborhood pub with pints of beer.

That's when one of my friends landed a dark joke: “We'd be screwed if ICE came through right now.” He was kidding, but there was some truth to his ‘joke' that stuck with me.

You see, most of these friends were first-generation immigrants. Our parents migrated to New Jersey from places such as Brazil, Argentina and Canada by way of Sri Lanka. Another friend moved here from Poland as a child; he's the reason we all know the words to Sto Lat (a Polish birthday song). Growing up, our group of friends hailed from South Korea, Croatia, Morocco, the Philippines, Italy, Colombia.

For our small town, diversity was the default — thanks to the immigration policies of the 1990s that allowed our families to not only immigrate here but thrive. We were welcomed with open arms. The door to the U.S. was never locked.

So, sitting here now, three decades later, an inappropriate joke about ICE felt like a twisted way to cope with the stress of what has been unfolding.

Since President Donald Trump reclaimed office in January 2025, he has made good on at least one of his key campaign promises — a sweeping overhaul of the U.S.' immigration policies through mass deportations; a continuation of what he started in 2016.

The backlash over the past year has been steady. In recent weeks, two American citizens have been killed by federal ICE agents in Minnesota, setting off a flurry of protests around the U.S and demands for accountability. The pushback has been loud and clear, from the Grammys to the Winter Olympics.

The question over how Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement will impact the World Cup — when millions are expected to visit — remains a thorn in FIFA's side.

A coalition of immigrant advocacy and civil rights groups last week issued a travel alert for visitors, highlighting multiple examples of visitors landing in ICE's crosshairs. This week, ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, did FIFA no favors by saying his agents will play a “key part” in the tournament.

All the while, Infantino continues to tout that the 2026 World Cup will be the most inclusive and welcoming edition of the competition — even with the steep costs making it inaccessible for the average fan.

But my mind keeps coming back to the immigrant communities and what a missed opportunity this will be for longtime football fans.

The melting pot I grew up in had one constant: soccer was the thread that weaved so many of us together.

My friends and I would spend hours on end playing pick-up on pitches around North Jersey — in the blistering heat, in between thunderstorms, and at all hours. During men's World Cup years, we'd all come together to watch our favorite teams fight for glory — unless Argentina was playing and my family had a strict policy on who could watch with us. (There's no yapping while the match is on, and absolutely no Brazilian jerseys on Argentina match days — rules courtesy of my 78-year-old, football-loving mother.)

Nearly a decade ago, when word began to spread that a World Cup was coming to the U.S., and then more recently when we learned a final would be played right here, it felt like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that we would not dare miss. Now it feels like a tournament that was designed without the fans who have been dreaming of going to these matches in mind.

My family was in East Rutherford when the 1994 World Cup took over the U.S. Tickets were so affordable that you could have made plans to attend a match on a whim. My family — diehard Argentinos — was there when La Selección defeated Nigeria 2-1 on June 25 at Foxboro Stadium near Boston. It was Diego Maradona's final match of his international career. The story of this moment and everything my family experienced has been and will continue to be passed down for generations.

This coming summer, will immigrant families have the chance to experience similar life-altering moments? I'm not so sure. My family, at least, is still trying to figure this out. After we received several rejections following FIFA's latest ticket lottery phase, my 34-year-old nephew put it succinctly in our group chat, “Resale is $1,000 and up. No thanks.”

For additional context, according to prices on FIFA's resale platform, tickets for the opening match at MetLife Stadium between Morocco and Brazil are starting at $1,495 (as of Feb. 11) for seats in the nosebleed sections. Tickets for that same category at the final are starting at $9,775.

There remain questions over so much — will fans of countries facing travel bans be allowed in the U.S.? This affects teams such as AFCON champions Senegal and Haiti, who are appearing in the World Cup for the first time in 52 years. Will immigrants already in the U.S. feel safe, knowing ICE will play a “key role”? Will ticket prices keep rising?

On a recent bus commute to The Athletic's offices in Manhattan from New Jersey, I was reminded of what makes this region so special. As I rode past MetLife Stadium to my right, the bus later weaved through some of the heavily immigrant communities where I grew up. Union City, North Bergen, West New York. I took in the New York City skyline, as the bus circled down the Lincoln Tunnel Helix — grateful that, of all the places in the world, my family chose to live near this city.

I thought about this coming World Cup, and back to the messaging around the competition, about how it was awarded to the United States, Mexico and Canada because of its diversity. Because of its immigrants. Because of families like ours.

I thought back to sitting in that room with Montagliani and Infantino in 2022.

“We're both sons of immigrants, right? Me in North America, Gianni in Switzerland, and football probably is what linked us to our fathers more than anything else,” Montagliani told us. “It's obviously a momentous occasion for our region and for the three countries. It will be a watershed moment for the sport.”

But will this moment be one that welcomes immigrants? Or keeps them out of the sport they helped build?

FOXBORO, MASS. (WHDH) - Foxboro town leaders are still waiting for the money to pay for security during the FIFA World Cup this summer. 

The select board refused to grant an entertainment license that would allow the World Cup to be played at Gillette Stadium.

On Tuesday, the board said they would not sign off on the license until the organizers could guarantee when the $7 million bill to put on the games would be paid – and who would be paying it. 

FIFA said they are not responsible, and the Boston 26 Host Committee said they have to wait for the federal government to pay them.

“I've got to be honest with you, it baffles my mind that you guys are sitting here in front of me right now and we still have no idea where this money is coming from,” said select board member Mark Elfman.

“We're not prepared to issue this license unless everything is in place,” said select board vice chair Stephanie McGowan. “I've seen people saying, ‘Oh, there's no way, they won't.' I'm going to tell you, this board will not issue this license.”

The select board will meet again on March 3. The deadline to issue the license is set for March 17.

Foxboro is scheduled to host seven World Cup matches this summer.

CHESTER, Pa. (WPVI) -- The national soccer team for Cote d'Ivoire, or Ivory Coast, will use the Philadelphia Union's stadium as its official training site during this summer's FIFA World Cup, bringing one of the tournament's elite squads to the Philadelphia region.

Organizers said the decision marks a historic moment for Chester and the Delaware Valley as the team prepares for its first World Cup appearance since 2014.

"It is a world-class facility for world-class athletes," said Meg Kane, the Philadelphia Soccer 2026 host city executive.

"It's huge for us. We're thrilled," added Philadelphia Union President Tim McDermott.

McDermott added Ivory Coast will have full access to both Subaru Park and the WSFS Bank Sportsplex.

"We have built this facility to host things like this and bring in world-class powerhouses around the globe," he said.

Kane said the team's presence is expected to energize fans across the region.

"The other part that's really exciting for us is the fans they will draw," she said. "There is an incredible African diaspora in the United States, especially in the Philadelphia region."

Ivory Coast enters the tournament after winning the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, and Kane said the team's identity will resonate locally.

"One of things I love is their nickname, Les Elephants," she said. "Because it is symbolic to the animal that represents their nation, but also for strength and heritage, and I think that's something that resonates in our community."

The team will stay in Wilmington, Delaware, while training in Chester.

Ivory Coast is scheduled to play two matches in Philadelphia, including the city's opening game on June 14 against Ecuador.

Kane said she expects the region to embrace the team.

"I think they will love Philadelphia. I think they will love Chester and Delaware County, and I think we will fall in love with them too."

            / CBS Boston
          

Foxboro, Massachusetts is doubling down on its threat to cancel the FIFA World Cup matches at Gillette Stadium if it does not receive the security money needed to host the event.

Seven games are set to be played at the stadium, called Boston Stadium for the tournament, including a quarter-final match. They are scheduled to start on June 13 and end in July. The town can't afford to front the $7.8 million needed for security and wait to be reimbursed later.

"It's the equivalent of seven Super Bowls here and 39 days of coverage. Which is not small and not to be lost. We have to secure that facility for 39 days straight," said Bill Yukna, a member of the town's select board. 

The board met Tuesday night to try and get an answer about the funding for security. The Boston Globe reported that the town was supposed to get an answer about the funding on January 30.

During the meeting, the town said that major safety equipment still needs to be ordered, and that their fiscal calendar ends in the middle of the games. The board explained that it will withhold the essential entertainment license until they are reimbursed several million dollars. 

"The money has to be here. Everyone thinks we have a football stadium in this town. But with that being said we're a small town. We have 18,000 people," said select board member Stephanie McGowan. 

"It comes down to sounding like Foxboro is being the bad guys here, but we really aren't. All we're trying to do is protect our citizens," Yukna said. 

Leadership for the games said that grant funding will cover the costs.

"The White House task force is working on a daily basis to work with DHS and FEMA on that. I don't think I can say anything more about that. We're being told it's expected any day now," said Boston 2026 Host Committee Chair Mike Loynd.  

Homeland Security is currently shut down due to government funding that lapsed on Saturday. It's unclear if that will have an impact on when the town can expect its own funding. 

FIFA officials deferred any questions about funding to the Boston Host Committee. When WBZ-TV asked the officials about the funding Tuesday evening, they said they were late to dinner. 

The town wasn't happy that the meeting ended without a solid answer. 

"I'm shocked you're not sitting here in front of us right now   saying 'We've got the money for you,'" said select board member Mark Elfman. 

March 17 is the deadline for the entertainment license. 

The Foxboro Police Department, Massachusetts State Police and Boston Police were awarded a collective $11 million in grant funding to protect against "malicious drone activity" during the games and American 250 events.

FOXBOROUGH — The Town of Foxborough still can't get an answer to where its $7 million-plus in security outlays for this summer's World Cup games planned for Gillette Stadium is going to come from.

Or when it's going to come.

And until they get their answer, the town's select board members made it quite clear at a Tuesday night meeting that their answer is a flat “no” to granting the entertainment license FIFA, the Kraft Group, and the Boston 26 host committee need to stage seven games over 39 days.

“I've got to be honest with you, it baffles my mind that you guys are sitting here in front of me right now and we still have no idea where this money is coming from,” said select board member Mark Elfman to two FIFA representatives in attendance and Boston 26 host committee CEO Mike Loynd. “I'm shocked you're not sitting right here in front of us right now, saying, ‘We've got the money for you.' Shocked.”

The pass-the-buck game was a lively one.

Kevin Clark, FIFA's head of venue operations for the Boston games, said his organization's role is to “work operationally with the stadium” and is “not in a position to comment on the financial requirements. That's an agreement between the stadium and the host city.”

A representative of the Kraft Group, which owns the stadium, was not there to speak on its behalf.

Loynd pointed out the uniqueness of the arrangement, including having to wait for the White House Task Force and FEMA, the federal agency that will ultimately dole out the money, to do so.

“The thing that's very different about this is that FIFA is the applicant on the license and normally it would be the stadium, so there are a lot of things to work on. We recognize that,” he said.

The stadium and FIFA want to sign the lease that will allow their temporary landlord-tenant arrangement to activate. But that lease requires the town's issuance of an entertainment license.



“You guys are still looking at us saying, ‘We don't know where it's coming from,' and we have townspeople who are saying, ‘There's two billion-dollar organizations that are running this, the Krafts and FIFA — what's the problem?' ” said Elfman. “And now we're coming around to where we've got to wait on grant money from the federal government. Flabbergasted.”

Stephanie McGowan, the vice chair of the select board, was not pleased with the slow pace and unsettled state of affairs.

“We're not prepared to issue this license unless everything is in place,” said McGowan. “I've seen people saying, ‘Oh, there's no way, they won't [issue the license].' I'm going to tell you, this board will not issue this license.”

Select board member Debbie Giardino pointed out the obvious.

“It just makes me a little concerned when the question was asked on where the money was going to come from, and both you guys are almost pointing at each other,” she said. “Nobody wanted to answer the question, and I think that speaks volumes to the frustration and the concern.”

Bill Yukna, chair of the select board, said the dispute could be over swiftly if somebody stepped up and took responsibility for getting the money to the town.

“All we're asking for is a collaboration that gets us the answer as to ‘Who?' and if the only way we're going to get that is to get the license in front of FIFA with that cost on it — that's going to have to be kicked out — then that's going to be our highest priority to get done and get to you as quickly as possible,” said Yukna.

The next select board meeting is scheduled for March 3, with the license issuance deadline set for March 17.

Casper Ruud won't have to look far for extra motivation as he begins his debut campaign at the Delray Beach Open this week.

Just weeks after he and his fiancée Maria welcomed the birth of their first child, a daughter, the Norwegian arrives in Florida carrying more than racquets and expectations. He brings with him the life-altering joy of new fatherhood and, ahead of his opening match against Marcos Giron at the ATP 250 hard-court event, Ruud reflected to the media on the emotional whirlwind that has reshaped his world.

“It was an incredibly emotional moment,” Ruud said. “I think for anyone who has become a parent, it's an incredible feeling and hard to explain with words.

“I'm excited for the future. This is just the beginning of 20 to 25 years of taking care of her. It's fun and exciting, I will try to use it as motivation and try to remember that you've travelled this far and being away from her, you might as well try your best and play some good tennis while you're at it.”

Ruud had already gathered momentum this season by reaching the fourth round of the Australian Open before he returned home to Norway, where he announced his daughter's arrival at the end of January. Now, the challenge shifts from balancing backhands to balancing life on Tour with life as a new father.

The early-season hard-court swing will test that balance. Delray Beach marks the first stop in a stretch that also includes the ATP 500 in Acapulco and ATP Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells and Miami.

For Ruud, the former No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, the miles may feel longer than before.

“It will be a tough trip, because it won't be that easy for them to come over here and I will miss them and at times feel homesick,” Ruud said. “I'll do my best and see if I can end the hard-court swing, for a while, on a good note before we head back to Europe and start the clay season.

“That will be the goal for these couple of weeks and months coming up, [starting] here, then Acapulco, Indian Wells and Miami: To win some matches and see if I can play for more than myself.”





Ruud begins that run in a strong Delray Beach field that features two-time champion Taylor Fritz and reigning Next Gen ATP Finals titlist Learner Tien.

First up for the second-seeded Ruud is Giron on Wednesday, with their Lexus ATP Head2Head series locked at 2-2. While much has changed in his personal life, he is confident his tennis foundations remain intact.

“My forehand still feels pretty similar to before, and my backhand as well,” Ruud joked. “I haven't got an overuse of my arm yet. I haven't carried her too much yet!”

Frances Tiafoe had a strange start to his match at the Delray Beach Open on Monday.The No. 8 seed opened his campaign at the ATP 250 event in South Florida against Aussie qualifier Rinky Hijikata. But before their match began, umpire Joshua Brace climbed down from his chair and halted Tiafoe, informing him that his shirt violated the ATP's logo rules.Read More: Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner return in Doha, while Elena Rybakina leads a strong field at the WTA 1000 in DubaiTiafoe was wearing lululemon's Ventilated Sleeveless Tennis Shirt in black, which featured the lululemon logo on the left chest, along with two stacked logos on the right chest for tech company UKG and multinational bank Barclays.As the delay stretched on, the Delray Beach crowd began booing loudly while officials searched for a solution. That solution proved simple—Brace had a ball kid bring over a black marker and used it to color over the offending logo.

Tiafoe, laughing, asked what he was supposed to do about the rest of his shirts. The American is known for sweating heavily and going through multiple outfit changes during a match. He packed his spare shirts into a bag, sent it to his team along with the marker, and had them black out the Barclays logo on each one.According to the ATP rulebook: “If sleeveless, then two logo positions may be placed on the front, however neither shall exceed 6 sq in (3 sq cm).”It wasn't the first time a player has run afoul of logo rules before a match. Last year at Roland Garros, Hailey Baptiste was stopped because the Nike logo on her headband was too large. In that case, the fix was the same—an umpire used a black marker to cover the logo.

Tiafoe became an official brand ambassador for Lululemon in January 2025 after previously wearing Nike, and he competes in K-Swiss shoes.Once his outfit was sorted, the 28-year-old needed just 73 minutes to secure a 6-4, 6-4 win and move into the second round, improving his record at the tournament to 12–4.“I'm happy, I'm happy. Really happy about it. I thought I played pretty well tonight,” Tiafoe said in his on-court interview. “Thanks everybody for coming out. It's nice to have another home tournament.”Tiafoe, who won his first ATP title at Delray Beach in his 2018 debut, will next face American qualifier Zachary Svajda.

Brazilian teen Joao Fonseca is eyeing a return to next month's ATP Challenger 175 event in Phoenix, Arizona, where he is the defending champion. The 19-year-old is entered in the Arizona Tennis Classic, which is held during the second week of the ATP Masters 1000 event in Indian Wells.

Players who exit early from the BNP Paribas Open could appear in Phoenix or at the Challenger 175 event in Cap Cana, often leading to stacked fields at both events. Former World No. 6 Hubert Hurkacz is entered in the Cap Cana Challenger.

Fonseca is joined the Phoenix field, subject to change, by six other Top 50 players. Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, the No. 30 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, is the highest-ranked player on the entry list. Corentin Moutet, Alex Michelsen, Zizou Bergs, two-time champion Nuno Borges and Adrian Mannarino are also entered.

Six Americans are entered in Phoenix, including Michelsen, Marcos Giron, Eliot Spizzirri, Reilly Opelka, Ethan Quinn and Emilio Nava.

The Cap Cana Challenger, which made its debut last March, could feature Hurkacz, 2023 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Hamad Medjedovic and defending titlist Aleksandar Kovacevic, among others. Argentine Tomas Martin Etcheverry, World No. 51, is the highest-ranked player entered in the Republica Dominicana Open, Copa Cap Cana Ciudad Destino.

Both the Phoenix and Cap Cana Challengers run from 10-15 March.

The four competitors put on matching white t-shirts and similar plaid-patterned pants before getting a tutorial on board. The video shared by the tournament showcased Rublev's unfiltered reactions to it all, with all four players succeeding in reeling in their catch of the day.A day after Sinner opened his Qatar ExxonMobil Open campaign with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Tomas Machac, Alcaraz followed suit Tuesday by eliminating Arthur Rinderknech.​

F1 Bahrain Testing Week 2 2026: Day 1 Highlights

Bearman: 'We haven't unlocked the full potential of the car'

As he prepares for his second season at Ferrari, Lewis Hamilton has explained why he has a "positive feeling".

Lewis Hamilton has spoken of being “in the best place I've been in for a long time” ahead of the 2026 season, with the Briton also admitting to feeling “more connected” to Ferrari's new car as he enters his second year of racing for the team.

The 2025 campaign was one of ups and downs for Hamilton as he adapted to the Scuderia, having made the switch to the Italian outfit following 12 seasons as a Mercedes driver.

Following the end of last year, it has since been confirmed that the seven-time World Champion will work with a new race engineer going forwards after Riccardo Adami moved to a role within the squad's academy.

When asked during the second 2026 pre-season test in Bahrain how he has found the experience of settling in at the outfit, Hamilton reflected: “It's definitely been a challenge and one that I've enjoyed for the most part of it.

“Having had a year now with the team, everything is much more settled, the ins and outs of the working relationship. I'm really, really excited about this season – I think everyone's really showed up with really great positivity.

“Even at the end of the last year, the empathy within the team and the hunger, you could see as I travelled around the workshop to go and see people before Christmas, and then to see them show up this year, it's a really positive feeling so far.”

Ferrari appeared to have a solid outing during the first test at the Bahrain International Circuit, racking up 420 laps – a tally bettered only by McLaren and Williams – whilst also seeming to have good reliability.

Pushed on whether this is the most optimistic he has felt at the start of a season for the last five years, Hamilton answered: “I don't remember the last five years, but maybe, yeah.

“I think I always try to enter into a season with confidence, but of course you're faced with all sorts of different challenges along the way. I think this is definitely for me… I've obviously gone through quite a bit, and for me left everything – all of last year is behind me.

“I really felt like I spent a lot of time rebuilding over this winter, refocusing, really getting my body and my mind to a much better place. In general, just making sure that I'm able to arrive feeling better.

“I generally feel personally in the best place that I've been in a long, long time, with rearranging things within my team. And then the car, we've started off quite well so far. It's an exciting time with this new generation of car as well, because it's all brand new – we're all trying to figure it out on the go.

“Last year we were locked into a car that obviously I inherited – this is a car that I've been able to be a part of developing on the simulator for the last 10 months, eight months, so a bit of my DNA is within it so I'm more connected to this one, for sure.”

Hamilton also reiterated that he remains as confident in what Ferrari can achieve as he was when he first signed for the squad.

“My belief in the team is still absolutely the same,” the 41-year-old said. “[I have] 100% faith in this team and what they're capable of, and that's why I joined the team.

“I knew it wasn't going to be an overnight thing, that we'd have success immediately – that's why I signed a longer deal, because I knew it was… more often than not it is a process. I feel like we've also learned a huge amount from last year as a team, and there have been changes that we've made.

“Everyone's constantly keen to make improvements and be better, so I think we're working better together than ever before. I'm excited for that.”

Editor's Note: The following story contains spoilers for “Wuthering Heights.”

Whatever else you might think of it, there's no denying writer and director Emerald Fennell designed her adaptation of “Wuthering Heights” to be gleefully jarring. Maybe no moment exemplifies this better than the near jumpscare of Cathy (Margot Robbie) returning to her not-so-homey childhood abode to find her father, Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes), dead on the ground in basically Peter Griffin pose, surrounded by piles of gin bottles rising to the rafters. 

 










The two gin monoliths, like so much of the visual design of the film, gave production designer Suzie Davies and her team the chance to reach the apex of a feeling — whether anger, sadness, despair, or desire. Fennell wrote into the script that Earnshaw would meet his end surrounded by mountains of empty bottles, but it was on Davies to translate that into a reality — or at least as much of a reality for the world of the often unreal, dreamlike, and deliberately artificial-looking “Wuthering Heights.”

“Oh my God, that was such fun to do!” Davies told IndieWire. “We had a fantastic team of model makers doing all sorts of wonderful things [to make] these giant bottles of booze. I think I'd made it about five-foot high, up to the windows. I thought, ‘That's a lot of gin.' We'd been practicing it because, obviously, on a schedule, you can't just dress those in. They're actually on a rig, and we wanted to get light behind them so it's hollow behind. [And] Emerald just said, ‘I think we need more.'” 

The twin peaks ended up over seven feet tall, made of a collage of mostly lightweight plastic bottles, with the odd real glass bottle here and there to create a bit of shine against DP Linus Sandgren's ghoulish, slightly greenish lights. On the rig, they could be quickly lifted in and out of the Earnshaw sitting room, such as it is, for the scene of Cathy and Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi) confronting the body of the man who both brought them together and tormented them for years. 

Davies said that the monstrous nature of those sky-high bottle piles is not only a visual match for Earnshaw and the horror of what a drunk he was. It's also part of the way that the Wuthering Heights house disintegrates into wreck and ruin. “We wanted the omnipresence of nature taking over in all forms. It's coming from the mountain, it's coming from all sides, it's coming from the ground. Everything was just the heaviness and pressure of that building and the uncomfortable nature of what's going on in that world,” Davies said. 

 










By this point in the film, Davies and her team had already done a lot of work, giving the space an emotional trajectory similar to Cathy and Heathcliff's self-destruction over their feelings for each other. Freed from any sort of period accuracy, Davies tried to start the house in a spartan, memory-like state, as Cathy and Heathcliff would remember it from childhood. “There's not really an oven. There's not the usual accoutrements of a kitchen. It's very bare,” Davies said. “But I love that when Heathcliff and Isabella [Alison Oliver] take over, it's just layers upon layers of dead animals and food and drink and shapes. It was great to do.” 

Whether working with the brooding ruin of the Wuthering Heights house or the glossy red corridors in Thrushcross Grange, Davies was guided by the same principles, which Fennell laid out in a phone call to Davies before she sent the production designer the script. “The idea that it was gonna be about a feeling more than anything. It's like the architecture of feeling that we needed to design, rather than the architecture of the period,” Davies said.

Davies translated that into all sorts of wet surfaces, with water dripping down the rocks of Wuthering Heights and the rock gradually pushing in over the course of the movie. The fireplace was designed as if it had been built out of that rock, and then it too starts to sweat — those who've seen Isabella and Heathcliff's scenes as a married couple know why. 

 










“You're just given this opportunity to safely make crazy decisions,” Davies said. “Although it's [Emerald's] story, she's happy [for everyone to have], and expects everyone to have an opinion, and suggestions. So it's not, like, ‘Do it this way.' It's like, ‘This is what I'm after. What can you do?' You end up building this visual language that, luckily, over two films [including ‘Saltburn'], I feel like I sort of know her groove,” Davies said. “She pushes me in a direction I would not normally go, and it's just brilliant for a creative role to have that freedom to just go a little bit crazy.” 

“Wuthering Heights” is now playing in theaters.

Noah Hawley's “Alien: Earth” is a masterclass in turning a legacy I.P. into something that feels distinctly relevant to the present day. The prequel, which tells the story of a corporate arms race to develop immortality and the dark consequences that inevitably emerge, relies heavily on a cast that clearly buys into the premise from the very beginning. So it was no surprise that two of its stars, Babou Ceesay and Sydney Chandler, picked up Independent Spirit Award nominations for their performances. 

Prior to the ceremony, Ceesay joined IndieWire and Lavazza on the blue carpet to discuss his breakout performance as Morrow, the villainous cyborg employed by the Weyland-Yutani corporation. Ceesay opted for the more challenging Dark Roast questions and explained how he found the good in such a nefarious character.

“Finding humanity in him,” Ceesay said when asked about the biggest creative challenge he faced. “Making him, in my mind, a little more lovable than people would have expected. I know he was doing some really horrendous things, morally speaking, but I thought ‘He's still a human being.' He's a cyborg, but he's got human parts, so what's going on in there?” 

Offering such a nuanced take on a villainous character is not always easy, and Ceesay explained that some of the character's departures from his own morals required him to take a leap of faith as a performer.

“Those scenes where he's manipulating a child to get what he wants, those were interesting moments for me,” he said. “It's not what I would want to do in my own life, so I felt a sense of ‘Okay, let's push the boat out and see what happens.'”

The following contains spoilers for Wuthering Heights.

The debate over Emerald Fennell's Wuthering Heights has splintered into two factions that ultimately agree on the facts. Fans of the movie think it delivers style over substance in a good way, while detractors think it prioritizes style over substance in a bad one. But while it's fair to say that Fennell favors flashy sensuality over meaty storytelling, it's not entirely fair to say there's no substance to her candy-colored, Charli xcx-soundtracked riff on Emily Brontë's classic novel. In fact, there's actually an underappreciated core to Fennell's loose adaptation. Her Wuthering Heights may market itself as a dark and steamy Valentine's Day romance, but at its heart it's actually a story of childhood trauma bonds run amok. 

It's a theme that emerges thanks to one of the bigger changes Fennell makes to her exploration of the doomed love story between Cathy Earnshaw (Margot Robbie) and Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi). In the novel, Cathy's father is a minor supporting character who adopts an orphaned Heathcliff as his favorite child but then dies relatively early into the story. It's then Cathy's older brother Hindley (a character the film cuts entirely) who inherits the Wuthering Heights estate and proceeds to jealously mistreat Heathcliff—forcing him to live and work as a servant, thus setting up the class/social stratification that keeps Cathy and Heathcliff apart. 

In the movie, however, we simply have Cathy's alcoholic father Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes), who brings Heathcliff home to save him, but then proceeds to mistreat him as well. That simple act of character condensing shifts the entire story. While Brontë's Wuthering Heights begins with a stable family that's slowly corrupted by jealousy and grief, Fennell begins with a version that's hollow from the start. Instead of a big house with characters coming and going, Wuthering Heights is more like an island prison lorded over by a capricious man who seems to be collecting children he can keep under his thumb—including Cathy's servant-companion Nelly (Hong Chau), whom Fennell reimagines as the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman.

From the first moments we meet young Cathy (Charlotte Mellington) and Nelly (Vy Nguyen), it's clear that Wuthering Heights isn't a safe place to grow up. Both girls know they have to carefully manage their emotions so as not to set off Mr. Earnshaw's temper. And without any kind of positive parental figure in their life, they've both developed maladaptive personalities. Cathy is self-centered and melodramatic, while Nelly is tumultuously infatuated with her impulsive mistress, who has all the privilege Nelly's been denied access to. Both girls build their emotional worlds around Cathy, forging a codependent bond that helps them weather the storm of Mr. Earnshaw's drunken fits of rage.

Once young Heathcliff (Owen Cooper) enters the story, however, that bond gets upended. Cathy shifts her melodramatic yearning to a more conventionally romantic figure, while young Heathcliff is inspired to take his protective instincts to self-sacrificial levels because it so clearly fuels Cathy's love of drama and angst. Nelly, meanwhile, is left seething with jealousy over how Heathcliff has supplanted her role in Cathy's life. All the love they're denied from their father figure gets transposed onto one another in increasingly thorny, complex, psychosexual ways. Or, as grown-up Cathy screams at her dad when he complains about being ill, “We are all ill because of you!”

It's a sentiment Fennell captures with equal parts satire and horror. While Fennell has sympathy for Cathy as a victim, she also has a keen eye for how hilariously petulant and annoying she can be. Her arrested development is cause for a whole lot of unnecessary drama in its own way. Meanwhile, horror touches—like a scene where Heathcliff yanks Cathy under a bed like a 1980s horror villain—subvert the film's romantic tone. Though there is something sweet and genuine going on between Heathcliff and Cathy, it stems from a place of survival as much as anything else. They have no one around to save them but themselves.

This fuels Fennell's pointed critique of the patriarchal forces that undergird upper-class British nobility in the 18th century. Because a landed man is considered the highest authority, there's no social or child protective services to call when he's misusing that power. Instead, his staff and family must simply bend to his various whims and power plays. Wuthering Heights deploys a lot of dollhouse imagery, and Cathy, Heathcliff, and Nelly might as well be dolls Mr. Earnshaw is playing with as he shouts “I am the kindest man alive!” into the void. 

It's an idea Brontë explores too, although in a very different place in the novel. In Brontë's original story, the saga continues on after Cathy's death with a second generation of characters who find themselves living under Heathcliff's isolated, abusive thumb. Hindley's strapping heir, Cathy's strong-willed daughter, and Heathcliff's own sickly son are left to build complicated bonds with one another while Heathcliff lures them all to Wuthering Heights and tries his best to emotionally destroy their lives as revenge for his own suffering.

While Fennell—like most Wuthering Heights adaptors—cuts that part of the story, she intentionally folds some of its themes into her streamlined adaptation. Though she reimagines Heathcliff as a far kinder, more sympathetic figure than he is in the novel, her dark take on Mr. Earnshaw gets at some of the patriarchal abuse that Brontë is interested in too. It's like Fennell has collapsed the two generations into her Cathy/Heathcliff/Nelly dynamic, which is a clever way to engage with the novel's core ideas without adapting its plot beat-for-beat. 

It's a shame, then, that after such a strong start, Fennell's ideas lose steam in the film's second half. More than anything, Wuthering Heights is a movie about three codependent people who are absolutely terrified of the idea of getting left behind. And Fennell's exploration of Cathy, Heathcliff, and Nelly's fraught bond reaches its climax in a scene where Nelly actively manipulates a miscommunication between her “siblings.” In the novel, Heathcliff accidentally overhears Cathy say she could never marry him. In the movie, however, Nelly intentionally provokes Cathy's confession once she realizes Heathcliff is listening outside the door. She blows up Cathy and Heathcliff's love, just as she felt her love for Cathy was blown up by Heathcliff. 

After that, Fennell seems less sure what to do with the themes she's set up. Once Cathy marries her neighbor Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif) and Heathcliff disappears and returns a rich, dashing man, Wuthering Heights devolves into a style-over-substance fantasia. There are fun montages showing off the over-the-top production design of the Linton family home and some “provocative” adaptation changes—like making Heathcliff's relationship with Isabella Linton (Alison Oliver) a consensual BDSM one, rather than an abusive marriage. But because Fennell has frontloaded all the interesting emotional drama into the first half of the movie, there's nowhere for her characters to go as Cathy and Heathcliff finally start consummating their relationship.

There are still sharp moments here and there, like when Cathy tells Nelly, “You like to see me cry,” and Nelly counters, “Not half as much as you like crying.” Or the way Cathy responds to her father's eventual death with both grief and violent relief. Fennell effectively renders her central trio as people too stunted by their childhood traumas to ever really mature into adulthood. But in the rush to make Wuthering Heights a sexy, smutty, earnest romance, Fennell's spikier themes fall by the wayside. Nelly is positioned as the ultimate tragic antihero, given that her vengeful meddling in Cathy's life results in Cathy's death. But the film doesn't care about the character enough to make that twist land. Instead, Wuthering Heights devolves into a more basic Romeo And Juliet-style tragedy. 

Still, there's something to Fennell's adaptation. In some ways, it's a soft choice to make Heathcliff a more sympathetic romantic lead rather than the complicated, cruel figure he is in the novel. But given that Brontë ultimately ends with a sense of hope about children being able to break the cycles of abuse set by their parents, amping up Mr. Earnshaw as an antagonist and giving that hopeful arc to Heathcliff instead still (sort of) tracks with what the novel is trying to explore. That alone won't please the Brontë purists, but it does prove that Fennell's flexible reimagining is more than its quotation marks.

Talk show host Jimmy Fallon has reportedly stepped back from plans to start a pasta sauce brand, after his long-time friend and partner in the venture, former Sony Music Entertainment CEO Tommy Mottola, was found to appear more than 600 times in the Epstein Files. This is reality, and that is a thing that happened within it: Jimmy Fallon isn't selling spaghetti sauce anymore because his (extremely powerful and influential) pasta buddy was also friends with the world's most notorious pedophile.

This is per THR, which notes that Fallon and Mottola's pasta sauce line was in the “early development phase,” with plans to possibly launch in 2027. But, no more: The fact that Mottola—whose current Mottola Media Group is a well-known producer in theater, television, and music—appears in the recently released files so many times, and as recently as the summer of 2018, has caused the venture to be killed. (Moments like this sometimes produce absolutely fascinating sentences; in this case, we have THR‘s “Representatives for both Fallon and Mottola declined to speak on the record with The Hollywood Reporter regarding the status of their sauce brand.”)

And it's not that we're fixated on Jimmy Fallon's tomato sauce specifically—although, if we're being honest, we are kind of stuck trying to figure out what the name would have been. But it's simply been interesting to see the ways various public figures have been reacting in the wake of their various power broker buddies, associates, or employers being revealed to have been sending little “Hey, thinking of you” emails to Epstein more than a decade after he was first registered as a sex offender. Chappell Roan, for instance, recently made headlines when she announced that she was no longer being represented by the talent agency run by Casey Wasserman, who appears more than 80 times in the Files. (Wasserman is now reportedly selling the agency—although he apparently intends to stay on the board of Los Angeles' 2028 Olympic Games Committee.)

All of which is happening in a strange kind of slow motion: The sheer volume of the Epstein Files had made them impossible to process simultaneously, instead causing these odd little (and so far, very minor) consequences to shake out; a pasta sauce there, an apology from the executive producer of Bones there. It's not clear yet how the reaction to the Files, both in the world generally, and Hollywood—where Epstein was clearly pretty aggressive about cultivating friendships—specifically, will end up shaking out: Whether it's all just going to be smashed pasta sauces and notes on people's Wikipedia pages, or something more robust.

U2 have emerged from a long hiatus with a surprise six-song EP, Days of Ash, available now, in which they address political flashpoints around the world, including ICE raids in the U.S., the Iranian uprisings, the war in Ukraine, and Israeli settlements in the West Bank.


	The six songs — “American Obituary,” “The Tears of Things,” “Song of the Future,” “Wildpeace,” “One Life at a Time,” and “Yours Eternally” (featuring Ed Sheeran and Taras Topolia) — are all on streaming platforms. They've also created lyric videos for each one.


	“It's been a thrill having the four of us back together in the studio over the last year,” Bono says in a statement. “The songs on Days of Ash are very different in mood and theme to the ones we're going to put on our album later in the year. These EP tracks couldn't wait; these songs were impatient to be out in the world. They are songs of defiance and dismay, of lamentation. Songs of celebration will follow, we're working on those now … because for all the awfulness we see normalized daily on our small screens, there's nothing normal about these mad and maddening times and we need to stand up to them before we can go back to having faith in the future.”

	











	The EP kicks off with “American Obituary,” which is dedicated to Renee Good, who was killed by ICE officers in Minneapolis during a protest. “Renee Good born to die free,” Bono sings. “American mother of three/Seventh day January/A bullet for each child, you see.”


	In a new interview with the U2 fanzine Propaganda — which is being relaunched as a one-off digital zine and will also be available in print at select stores — Bono discusses the song. “The rhythm of the lyric is a nod to one of my favorite Bob Dylan songs, ‘It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),'” he says. “In his song the child is singing to the mother, and in ours the mother is singing to her children: ‘I love you more than hate loves war.'”


	“The Tears of Things” takes its title from the 2025 Richard Rohr book, The Tears of Things: Prophetic Wisdom for an Age of Outrage. It's an imaginary conversation between Michelangelo and his statue, David, reflecting the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza. “If you put a man into a cage and rattle it long enough,” Bono sings, “A man becomes the kind of rage that cannot be locked up … The tears of things/Let the desert be unfrozen.”

	In the Propaganda interview, Bono says that the band has become close to Richard Rohr, and finds deep meaning in his writings. “He's a mystic, a deep thinker,” Bono says. “[His book] suggests that the greatest of the Jewish prophets found a way to push through their rage and anger at the injustices of the day, until they ended up in tears.”


	“Song of the Future” is a tribute to 16-year-old Iranian Sarina Esmailzadeh, who was beaten to death by Iranian security forces after participating in the 2022 Women, Life, Freedom movement. “Here again, we have a priestly class of men whose subjective interpretation of sacred text becomes a club to beat the heads in of anyone who disagree,” Bono says. “We all remake God in our own image to some degree, but sadly, it's much more likely that we create a God of fire and brimstone than a God of ‘love and mercy,' to quote Brian Wilson.”


	“Wildpeace” is a poem by Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai read by Nigerian artist Adeola Fayehun, set to music written and arranged by producer Jacknife Lee. “I can hardly listen to [Fayehun]'s voice,” Bono says. “It cuts right through me and somehow suggests other conflicts on the African continent just by the lily of her achingly beautiful voice … Sudan, dead God.”

	“One Life at a Time” was inspired by the 2025 Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land. They wrote it for Palestinian Awdah Hathaleen, a consultant on the film, who was killed in his West Bank village by an Israeli settler. The title of the song comes from a line that No Other Land filmmaker Basel Adra said at his funeral. “One life at a time is kinda an existential suggestion,” Bono says. “We can change the world for the better or for the worse … one life at a time.”

Days of Ash wraps up with “Yours Eternally,” which features guest appearances by Ed Sheeran and Ukrainian singer Taras Topolia, whom Edge and Bono met when they traveled to Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion. The lyrics began as a letter to him. “When we told [Ed Sheeran] about this song in a shape of a letter wondering if he could be the voice replying to the letter, he jumped right on it, but with a caveat,” Bono says. “[He said], ‘I love the song, I love Ukraine. But I'd rather not be a part of any political polemic right now.… You're not going to get me involved in politics, are you?' ‘No, of course not, Ed.' I might have been bluffing there.”

	











	The songs are produced by the band's longtime collaborator Jacknife Lee. “Who needs to hear a new record from us?” U2 drummer Larry Mullen Jr. asks in a statement. “It just depends on whether we're making music we feel deserves to be heard. I believe these new songs stand up to our best work. We talk a lot about when to release new tracks. You don't always know … the way the world is now feels like the right moment. Going way back to our earliest days, working with Amnesty or Greenpeace, we've never shied away from taking a position, and sometimes that can get a bit messy, there's always some sort of blowback, but it's a big side of who we are and why we still exist.”

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Multihyphenate and 34-time Grammy and Latin Grammy Award-winning rapper René “Residente” Pérez Joglar has set his feature directorial debut with a love letter to his native island of Puerto Rico.


	The film, titled Porto Rico, is an epic Caribbean western and historical drama led by Benito “Bad Bunny” Martínez Ocasio (Bullet Train, Caught Stealing) in his first leading film role. The main cast also includes Viggo Mortensen (Eastern Promises, Captain Fantastic), Edward Norton (American History X, Birdman) and Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men). Multi-Oscar-winning director and producer Alejandro G. Iñárritu executive produces.

	











As Deadline announced in 2023, when Porto Rico was in development, Residente and Oscar-winning screenwriter Alexander Dinelaris (Birdman) co-wrote the screenplay, which at the time was described as a historical drama based on the life of Puerto Rican revolutionary José Maldonado Román, known as Águila Blanca (White Eagle), set on the island in the late 19th century. Maldonado Román fought against colonialism by leading a gang of ex-convicts to vindicate Puerto Rico as it sought its identity as a country.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Whether the film will follow the original storyline above is as yet unknown. A release for the movie touts that the project “blends historical scope with a visceral, lyrical approach and a gripping narrative inspired by true events.”


	“I have dreamed of making a film about my country since I was a child. Puerto Rico's true history has always been surrounded by controversy,” Residente said. “This film is a reaffirmation of who we are — told with the intensity and honesty that our history deserves.”

	











	The project reveal arrives following Bad Bunny's smash hit Super Bowl halftime show performance earlier this month, February 8, with his own tribute to Puerto Rico, where he was born in 1994. Every layer of his performance was intimately woven with the fabric, food, and festive spirit of the Boricua people. The show, which was watched by 128.2 million viewers, has spiked flight searches to the island by 245% from February 8-11 in comparison to the same dates last year, according to Expedia.


	Although Residente and Bad Bunny are generations apart, they're kindred spirits in their love of country, community, and their passion to protect both through activism.


	Although details are scant at this time, there are plenty of clues within the official announcement.


	A quick history lesson: Puerto Rico (translation: Rich Port) was named by the Spaniards, who colonized the Caribbean island, originally known as Borikén by the indigenous Taino people who preceded the Spanish, in 1493. Spain ceded sovereignty in 1898 after losing the Spanish-American War, with the Caribbean island becoming a U.S. territory on December 10, 1898. Its citizens were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917 via the Jones Act, albeit without the will of the people.


	Under U.S. rule, Puerto Rico was known as Porto Rico, an anglicized spelling of the island's name, from 1900 to 1932, when Congress passed an act officially reverting its name to the Spanish spelling.


	Bardem, a native of Spain, and American actors Norton and Mortensen are playing roles connected to their respective origin countries, we hear. It's worth noting that Norton and Mortensen, the latter of whom spent many years living in Argentina, are fluent in Spanish.


	“This film sits in a tradition of films we deeply love, from The Godfather to Gangs of New York, that both thrill us with visceral drama and iconic characters and eras while also forcing us to face up to the shadow story under the American narrative of idealism,” Norton said. “Everybody knows what a poet of language and rhythm René is. Now they're going to see what a visual visionary he is as well. And bringing him and Bad Bunny together to tell the true story of Puerto Rico's roots is going to be like a flame finding the stick of dynamite that's been waiting for it.”


	Residente and Erick Douât produce the pic for 1868 Studios, launched by the former through a multi-year joint venture with Sony Music Latin-Iberia and Sony Music Vision. The production company develops, produces, and globally distributes original content centered on authentic, culturally driven storytelling with a commitment to elevating Latin culture and bringing Latin stories to global audiences.


	Norton and Bill Migliore, alongside Michael Bederman, produce for Class 5 Films. The production banner has produced features and documentaries, including The Painted Veil and Motherless Brooklyn, as well as the Emmy-winning By the People: The Election of Barack Obama.


Porto Rico is backed by Live Nation Studios, Class 5 Films and strategic partners including the Kwanza Jones & José E. Feliciano Initiative, Mike and Sukey Novogratz, and Noah Assad. Iñárritu executive produces alongside Scott Budnick through his shingle 1Community (Just Mercy, Respect), Mike Novogratz, Sukey Novogratz, José E. Feliciano, Kwanza Jones, Henry R. Muñoz III and Assad. UTA Independent Film Group is representing sales.


	Residente is represented by Erick Douat. Bad Bunny is represented by UTA and his manager, Assad. Mortensen is represented by UTA and Goodman, Genow, and Schenkman. Norton is represented by UTA and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. Bardem is represented by WME and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman.

Robert Duvall had a way of sticking out in the crowd. For much of his career, the Oscar-winning actor was a consummate supporting performer, adding his talents to the ensembles of films like “The Godfather,” “Network,” “M*A*S*H,” “Apocalypse Now,” and many other classics. 

In the '70s, People Magazine even memorably described him as “Hollywood's No. 1 No. 2 lead.” And yet, in his hands, no part was ever a small part. 

With his rugged charisma and a talent for conveying a quiet yet unyielding intensity, Duvall always shined in the roles he was given, frequently proving a standout who elevated the material into something greater. His sheer chops can easily be reflected in the number of accolades he received across his 60-something years in Hollywood: he only won one Oscar, for his gorgeous performance in the musical drama “Tender Mercies,” but he was nominated six other times, and also amassed a BAFTA, four Golden Globes, two Emmys, and a SAG Award. And he never really slowed down until the very end of his life, continuing to act, and give exemplary performances, well into his twilight years.

Born in San Diego to a military family, Duvall studied under Sanford Meiser before beginning his professional career, honing his understated, unshowy performance style that made him a natural fit for any role. He began his career in theater, and took some minor TV parts before nailing his big film break in 1962 after screenwriter Horton Foote, who saw him perform at the Neighborhood Playhouse, recommended him to play Boo Radley in the acclaimed film adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” 

From there, Duvall's film career built up slowly in the '60s, before exploding in the '70s, where he became a fixture of New Hollywood. He started slowly taking on more lead acting roles, in vehicles like “The Great Santini,” “Tender Mercies,” and “The Apostle,” which he also directed. Into the 2000s, he remained a welcome presence in movies, be they serious dramas (“Open Range”), silly comedies (“Kicking and Screaming”), or cracking thrillers (“Widows”).  

With the news of Duvall's death at 95 on February 15, IndieWire rounded up the best performances from his exemplary career. Read on for the 10 best Robert Duvall performances of all time, unranked and in chronological order.

Duvall was 31 when he made his feature film debut in the key role of Boo Radley in Robert Mulligan's celebrated adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Playing the mysterious town pariah in the film's final sequence, he somehow comes across as both younger and older, carrying himself with the shy demeanor of a child, yet with eyes that convey a lifetime of hurt and ostracism. 

In Harper Lee's celebrated novel, Radley is more symbol than character, a reflection of the book's themes of social intolerance and the importance of understanding who imparts a lifelong lesson on the young Scout (Mary Badham). Duvall has the presence to match, with a shock of white blonde hair that's positively ghostly, but his presence makes the quiet figure a man of flesh and blood rather than just a living allegory. As far as debut performances go, few leave quiet an impression like this.

Duvall is not exactly remembered for his long and proud history as a comedic actor, but he's a core part of the ensemble in Robert Altman's groundbreaking “M*A*S*H,” albeit more often the butt of the joke than delivering one. The shaggy comedy about medical personnel during the Vietnam War, as they drink and party to ignore the conflict raging around them, casts the taciturn actor as Frank Burns, a wildly pompous surgeon whose ego far exceeds his actual skill. He's the perfect villain to root against, a stick-in-the-mud authority figure who makes the lazy but talented Hawkeye (Donald Sutherland) seem like the ideal doctor in comparison. 

In an eccentric cast, he's the straight man you want to see get a good comeuppance — and his karma comes in one of the film's most famous scenes, as Hawkeye broadcasts his tryst with Nurse Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), who delivers the immortal request to “kiss my hot lips!”

Otherwise known as that other sci-fi film George Lucas directed in the '70s, “THX 1138” is the closest Duvall ever came to playing a conventional leading action hero role — which, considering how weird this strange little experiment actually is, says quite a lot. 

He's the title character, just another near-faceless cog in a future where humanity lives in underground cities and all citizens are required to take emotion-suppressant medications. But when THX stops taking his pills, he develops independent thought of his place in the world, and a forbidden sexual relationship with LUH 3417 (Maggie McOmie). In the cold and clinical world Lucas crafts, Duvall is an appealing presence, proving unexpectedly tender as a drone coming into his own emotions for the first time and fighting for his freedom.

The first two “Godfather” films feature a parade of some of the best actors in history doing career-best work: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, James Caan, and Diane Keaton are just the biggest names in the ridiculously stacked ensemble of Francis Ford Coppola's gangster epics. And with a lot of these actors doing big, big work — James Caan playing the family hot head to Brando going ice cold as the ruthless don — it can be easy to overlook just how incredible Duvall is right alongside them as Tom Hagen, the consigliere and informal adopted son of Don Vito and the voice of reason among an increasingly bloodthirsty clan of criminals. 

Duvall treads a deceptively tricky tightrope as Tom, an outsider to the Italian family who nonetheless considers himself one of them, and makes the few moments the typically taciturn and quiet maneuver expresses his real emotions — such as a standout scene where he pleas to Pacino's Michael that “I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you” in “Part II” — hit hard.

Sidney Lumet's classic TV news satire “Network” hasn't aged flawlessly in the 50 years since its release, but the performances from the cast, playing the sleazy cast of a failing network as they exploit the breakdown of longtime anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch) for ratings boasts an all-time great cast whose performances remain perfection. A perpetually great ensemble player, Duvall slots in effortlessly as the head of the station Frank Hackett, a ruthless company man who values profit above the well-being of his employees and lofty concepts like “integrity” and “public responsibility.” He's the archetypical sleezy exec, the exact type of man who has only increased in power since “Network” first released. 

There's a lot about “Apocalypse Now” that has entered into the public consciousness, even for people who haven't watched it: the use of “Ride of the Valkyries” during a brutal air assault, the trippy final 30-minutes or so where Marlon Brando arrives to steal the movie, and the infamously troubled production that spawned an entire documentary. 

But the defining moment of “Apocalypse Now” is when Duvall, a scene-stealer as the adrenaline junkie, bloodthirsty Kilgore, surveils the wreckage his men have left behind and cheerfully muses he “loves the smell of napalm in the morning.” When he follows it up with “Someday the war's gonna end,” the flicker of sadness in his voice is as chilling as anything else in the film. The eccentric Kilgore, with his love of surfing and brutal streak of violence, could be a cartoon. Duvall wisely underplays him, but his gravitas and presence makes him an instantly iconic character, one as beloved as anything else in the film.

Across most of the '70s, Duvall became mostly known as a character actor and supporting player. His first Best Acting Oscar nomination came at the tail end of the decade, when he played one of cinema's all-time frightening dads, the titular Great Santini. 

Conducting himself with militaristic standards even in his domestic life, Lt. Meechum becomes a terror for his family during peacetime, especially his rebellious son (Michael O'Keefe). Duvall never overplays the part; the film is best known for the brutal scene where Meechum assaults his son at a baseball game, but he's at his scariest in the quietest moments, when his gruff voice casually cuts down his kids or his wife with just a few curt words.

Duvall was nominated at the Oscars seven times over his career, but he only took home an award once, for his work in musical drama “Tender Mercies.” And, unlike some actors, he actually got it for some career-best work. He's phenomenal as country singer Max Sledge, a former star attempting to go sober and build his life back up via a tentative friendship with a young widow (Tess Harper). 

The film was a passion project for Duvall, who did his own singing and helped write a few of the songs performed in the film, and in his acceptance speech he thanked actual country musicians like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson for their praise of the film. Watching the movie today, it sticks out as a rare performance in which the typically stoic performer was allowed to be achingly vulnerable.

One of the biggest limited series of all time, “Lonesome Dove” was a massive phenomenon upon its airing in 1989, with 26 million people tuning in to watch the epic adaptation of Larry McMurtry's Western novel about the adventures of two men — Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call — as they embark on a cattle drive from Texas to Montana. 

Duvall was originally offered the part of the straight-laced Call, which ultimately went to Tommy Lee Jones, but was attracted to the more boisterous, free-spirited Augustus, and his charismatic performance anchors the entire project. Don't just take our word for it; Duvall himself often referred to “Lonesome Dove” as his personal favorite performance across his entire career.

Duvall directed a handful of films over the years, with the best coming in 1997 as “The Apostle,” arguably his best late-career triumph. He wrote and starred in the film too, playing Sonny Dewey, a Texas preacher seeking both refuge and redemption after he murders his wife's lover. On the lam, he reinvents himself in the bayous of Louisiana, opening a new church while battling the demons that lead him there. 

Boldly, “The Apostle” doesn't condemn its flawed hero, taking his attempt to find salvation seriously despite his great faults. It's one of the most complex roles the star ever played, and he's electric throughout, especially when he's preaching — and particularly in the climactic sermon that blows the house down.

Phish bassist Mike Gordon was always in awe of Bob Weir, from seeing him perform onstage as a kid to decades later staying at his home in Hawaii with Bob's family. As the youngest member of his own band, Gordon often felt a kinship with Weir, “the Kid” in the Grateful Dead. He spoke to Rolling Stone while in Woodstock preparing for his spring solo tour, and recalls their time together at TRI Studios working on flow-state experiments, the time he almost joined Dead & Company, and Bob sitting in with his band. 


	Honestly, everything about Bob Weir was dichotomies. Interesting dichotomies for me, from my perspective. Watching him as a kid, he seemed to be the one [in the Grateful Dead] that was the real rock star type. Just a bit self-conscious, and sometimes the hair flicking and all that. His playing, on the other hand, seems really selfless, because it just weaves into the music almost unnoticeably, and yet it's so eloquent. But his personality had that combination of those kinds of things, like seeming super-cold because he didn't smile that much. He was actually one of the warmest people ever. 

	











	I mean, it's not often that I meet a hero of mine, some rock star, and then just have him write his phone number down for me, not really knowing me. And then staying in touch over the years and always responding. And yet, playing in different groups with him, he's also never the one that would give out compliments. Like, “Nice drum solo” or “Nice bass line.” Ever.

	He could be stoic, and then he would say something that was really funny. And the fact that he really lived life hard, but then later in life [was very healthy] — one of those last experiences was going to his beach house, where he had me do his meditation with him, guided meditation, and going for a run and doing other workout parts, eating all vegan food. Everything about him was a daily routine of health, after daily routines of raging, probably. So I don't know if he always had these splits or if I just noticed them as time went on.

	I worked out with him. He did it with a lot of people. We did a guided meditation, based on what I do, Transcendental Meditation, but a little different. And then he goes running barefoot. He would run barefoot on pavement or rocky mountains or the beach or anywhere, and his feet were kind of calloused, and I wasn't going to do that. He kind of combined the meditation with the run. It was like a brisk walk or slow run, and he kind of repeated his mantra. In his backyard at his beach house there was a sandbox with 100 different kinds of fun workout things. He had the TRX straps, had these little videos of us doing push-ups into the air, leaning over the TRX straps. We had this twisting move. It looks like a samurai or something, where the legs and arms are all twisting one way and then all the way around the other way. He tried to show me and I just couldn't do it, after about 10 minutes of trying to videotape everything, he's like, “How about I'll just do it and you videotape me.” So we did that. He had this heavy leather ball, and he wanted to do this thing where we just threw it back and forth, hard to launch and hard to catch, all in that sandbox with really nice tropical plants around it. Then he made me some vegan sausages. I know he's always done yoga, over the years, and just seemed really healthy.


	The reason we went to the beach house together is because we were at a studio doing this brainwave experiment. I read an article where he said dreams informed his whole life. His creativity, and the music that he writes, all informed by dreams. And I thought, “Oh, well, me too.”  I had this team of neurologists, and one neurologist from MIT could get people in half-awake, half-dreaming, half-asleep. Bobby started coming on those Zooms [with the neurologists] and told us this one dream that he'd had. In it he said he saw his own band, he's playing, but from 20 feet behind the stage and there's someone younger that's replaced him. Like a ghost. And he's behind the drum set and he sees the new younger him. That was the middle of just a Zoom about neurological stuff, and then he offers up that dream. We were in his studio and we were wired up with the brain wave  and body metrics  and we had these two little buttons that we could push to indicate when one of us thought we were in or just had been in a flow state. Three other people in the room were also wired up and also had the button to push, and we wanted to see if we were pushing the button at the same time. And sometimes we were.

	All of that was done. I had had a little bit of gummy something or chocolate, something with THC, maybe a little bit of mushrooms. I was really kind of out of my head, floating a little bit, because I don't do much of that stuff. Then he and [his wife] Natascha invited me up for a vegan meal, and after he invited me to go to the beach house. They warned me that no one gets in the car, his kids don't get in the car with him. He's taking these switchbacks at 60 miles an hour in his Tesla going to Stinson Beach. I get motion-sick real easily, and I'm out of my mind a little bit because I'm floaty, and he starts telling stories. He just loved telling these funny stories from back in the day. So many stories. So that made up for the nausea. And I'm just being a good listener and I'm a little scared. We get to the top of the switchbacks, top of the mountain, he's like, “Oh, I left my laptop back at home.” So then we repeat the whole thing, we get the laptop, we go back. One of the stories was about beating Ramblin' Jack Elliott. I bet he's told it before, but just in case… 


	So he's underage, maybe he's like 17 years old. It's a club where you have to be of drinking age to get in, and he wants to meet Ramblin' Jack Elliott. He goes around the back and there's a ladder where you can climb up to the roof. He's going to sneak in the club, and now he's on the roof and there's a skylight and he's sort of investigating the skylight and he just crashes through all the way, falling down, and landing on a couch, which happens to be the green room, where he's sitting next to Ramblin' Jack Elliott. And he says, “Oh hi, I'm Bobby.” And from that point on, they're best friends for the rest of their lives. Those kinds of stories are priceless. And I don't care if I'm a little nauseous and a little scared and a little floaty.


	He believed that digital music was ruining music, that it was unlistenable and made it so people couldn't discover as many kinds of music. So in his little lair there, he had this tube stereo, turntable, speakers, and a big, huge daybed for listening to music. He put on some records, a country singer I had never heard of. It was a whole different experience listening to all that analog sound. Then he had all these guitars sprinkled about, and he was able to just work on his next album all by himself with this little recording station and some effects pedals and wireless thing on his guitar. He was like a one-man show. He could cook what he needed. I mean, being that level of rock star, you could easily have some chefs around, but he didn't need any of it. He didn't have a trainer, at that moment anyway. He didn't have a chef and he didn't have someone recording him for his album. He was very excited to show it off, how he could do it all by himself. My daughter and I went back to the beach house to visit him last year, which would've been two years later, and he was still working on the same album.

	











	Our relationship was incredibly special, because I was a huge fan. There's some friends that preferred the Jerry Garcia-written songs. I leaned toward the Bobby ones. I really liked the way he delivered a song, and he talked about that. In groups of people, a bunch of people that are doing a gig together, he would stop them and he would say, “Look, the singing is the face of the song. Everything serves that.” And he really delivered a story with his voice, and it's so inspiring. I know he told Trey [Anastasio] when they were reviewing every Grateful Dead song ever before the Fare Thee Well concerts, they spent a week in their pajamas in that beach house, and he told Trey, “I know that we're known for our jamming and everything, but really it's mostly about the soulfulness of these songs.”


	I was with the Rhythm Devils with Grateful Dead drummers, and all the other people playing at this festival, maybe Gathering of the Vibes. Bobby was there with one of his bands, maybe RatDog. The way that it worked is there were two stages so the bands could go back and forth. Bob had this idea, since I had been singing “The Other One” with that group, a few songs like that — maybe he would sit in with us, and I would sing the first [verse] or two, and their band would start and he would just continue where we left off, and he would sing the next verse with his band.


	We're on the tour bus and we're trying to do a practice of this, and I've got my little practice bass and everyone's looking at me. They're all looking at me, and Bobby's right there, my hero, looking at me, and I can't for the life of me remember, after singing it all tour, the first or second verse to “The Other One.” Like “‘Spanish lady….' What is it?” And Bobby's looking at me with his deadpan face, not offering a smile or “It's funny that you can't remember this.” This is after being a kid and going to see him, and there I am singing it to him and unable to remember more than the first two words. Then to make it more awkward, one of the other singers is Googling for me, and they're like, “Here, I'm finding it online.” And Bobby's just not flinching. He is like, “I'm not going to help him. I'm not going to laugh at him, but I'm not going to help him either. I'm just going to stare at him.” It's so embarrassing, but funny.


	Bob did ask me to be a part of Dead & Co. He gave me a call and he said he has got something going with John Mayer. When he first was calling he had some other ideas, which morphed back to being more normal. He was imagining this show that would start all-acoustic every night, and then would go electric, and then would turn over to rave. Where it was just like beats and Grateful Dead songs, which I've heard people do before. That eventually turned into a [more] normal situation.  I went out for one week of practice, I learned really interesting things from that experience. We were talking about having grooves that are swung and straight, half swung and half straight. And he said, “That's what rock & roll is. Rock means the straight, and roll means the swung.”

	











	Bob wanted to do more and different things. That was cool, but then I started to realize it was going to be a longer-term thing. I had my own album and I was making a Phish album, and they were starting to talk about doing some writing and making an album, too. I started to realize that getting to play with my heroes here is not going to match seeing through my own album.


	Bob was one of the few guests Phish has had onstage. We had already played with Phil Lesh at Shoreline the year earlier. I remember I got this feeling from the band, or a message from the rest of Phish, that we weren't going to have him play, because we just don't have guests. As legendary as they are, it changes the flow that we get into. And so he called and he said, “Well, I'm just going to get a ride in. My driver will bring me in and I'm just going to bring a little amp and guitar, and what time is soundcheck?” It's like, “Well,” I said, “I'm not really sure if the guys want to have any guests, but this sound check's at 3:30.” And then more talking backstage of, “I don't know. He's great, but we don't really have guests and there's a reason for that. It's really hard and tender to get our flow going that we have.” And Page [McConnell]is sitting backstage with him in one of the dressing rooms explaining that. And he's like, “That's OK.” And I ran into Trey outside of the dressing room and he's like, “Oh, my God, I just talked to him. He's friggin Bob Weir.” So I went back and so they figured it all out. I got to choose the songs. I remember there was “El Paso” and we did “West L.A. Fadeaway,” and then he played on “Chalkdust Torture.” He was nervous about that, like he didn't really want to do it because he didn't know it so well. It's fast and frenetic and he's slow sometimes. The guys, Jon Fishman describes it as the best sit-in ever. That even though he was a fish out of water, that he went for it. He just dug his soul into it and raged in the situation, even being out of his comfort zone.

	Bob was so mysterious. I just thought it was incredible the way his rhythm guitar playing ebbed and flowed. When people heard Jerry Garcia's guitar playing, it sounds like a bird fluttering. It's so humble and so beautiful. With Bob, it's not so obvious because it just swims inside the music. That's, for me, what's so incredible about it. If the playing was more predictable, it wouldn't have been so enchanting in terms of his playing. With the singing, I feel the same way. I feel like he sings in this sort of almost like a plain voice, and he cuts off the words at the end of the phrase. But his range is incredible — his vocal range, but also his emotional range.

	











	For me, it was kind of like Jerry Garcia was like a grandfather when he was young. He's like this kind of Santa Claus type, or even almost a feminine kind of energy. Nurturing. Bob was the opposite. This sort of punk kid with an almost plain-sounding voice trying to just go for it. I loved that juxtaposition. I don't think, for me, it could have worked without Bob's contribution of just that, almost like a kid or a wannabe cowboy wanting to be on this adventure. He went on so many adventures in life, and I just think he totally succeeded.

Iconoclastic German veteran Ulrike Ottinger mines macabre humor from a fictionalized portrait of notorious real-life Hungarian noblewoman Elizabeth Báthory.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	If you ever looked at the ageless face of Isabelle Huppert onscreen — the alabaster skin, the enigmatic smile, the eyes that seem to have a default setting of disdainful superiority — and thought all that was missing were a glistening pair of fangs and a tiny trickle of blood from the corner of her mouth, this is the movie for you. Likewise, if you ever wondered what kind of bizarro Mittel European mutant baby would result from the marriage of Robert Eggers' Nosferatu and Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel. Perhaps it would look something like Ulrike Ottinger's Viennese waltz of grotesquerie, The Blood Countess (Die Blutgräfin).

	A painter and photographer as well as a cult filmmaker, Ottinger understands the power of a striking image. She opens with a mesmerizing sequence in which a barge upholstered in plush vermillion velvet cruises ever so slowly through an underground cave system and grotto in Vienna. Standing with regal stillness on the front of the boat, like a carved figurehead on a prow, is Huppert as Countess Elizabeth, a commanding vision in blood-red gown, gloves and jewels to match her copper-colored hair. She alights with a dramatic billowing cape behind her and steps out into the modern-day Austrian capital.

The Bottom Line

	
	If only everyone else were on Huppert's level.
	



Venue: Berlin Film Festival (Berlinale Special)Cast: Isabelle Huppert, Birgit Minichmayr, Thomas Schubert, Lars Eidinger, André Jung, Marco Lorenzini, Tom Neuwirth, Karl Markovics, Felix OitzingerDirector: Ulrike OttingerScreenwriters: Ulrike Ottinger, Elfriede Jelinek

								1 hour 59 minutes			






	Elizabeth has barely hit town when she exchanges a come-hither glance with a pretty young woman whose creamy neck is soon punctured by teeth marks. The life drains from her body on the floor of a ladies' restroom. But the glamorous noblewoman has not emerged from decades of slumber in a glass coffin at the Kremlin just to feast. She is troubled by talk of a legendary book that can turn vampires back into mortals should they shed tears on its pages.

	











	That's probably the first clue that the screenplay by Ottinger — with additional dialogue by Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek, no less — will not be overly worried about the finer points of plot logic. Weeping vampires are relatively rare and yet Elizabeth and the devoted servant with whom she's reunited, Hermione (Birgit Minichmayr, looking like a demonic Louise Brooks), seem to think this ancient volume poses a major threat to the existence of their kind.


	Mostly, the book serves to set them on a daffy quest through Vienna's historical sites and libraries in order to find and destroy it. But before they get started on that there's a vampire ball to attend, at which the Countess makes her grand entrance while being exalted as “a woman untouched by virtue.” (Love that for Huppert.) There's a buffet of human corpses, a vampire string quartet and a soprano celebrating the qualities of Viennese blood. Then there's the real entertainment. A row of handsome young men in formalwear is ushered onto the stage and seated, followed by the same number of women who are blindfolded and given straight razors to shave the gentlemen before slitting their throats. “Dinner is served!”


	This probably sounds a lot more entertaining than it is. I could watch Huppert queening it up until the cows come home, and it's likely she hasn't had this much self-satirizing fun since her hilarious Call My Agent! episode. But Ottinger doesn't do much with her beyond putting her in a series of bejeweled outfits (designer Jorge Jara Guarda did the fabulous costumes), untethering her and letting her float majestically above a whole bunch of increasingly tiresome people on her tail, all of them mugging up a storm.

	











	They include one of the neo-Báthorys from Transylvania, Baron Rudi Bubi (Thomas Schubert, so good in Christian Petzold's Afire), a dandy in green who has shamed the family by going vegetarian; his psychotherapist Theobold Tandem (Lars Eidinger); dithering vampirologists Theobastus Bombastus (André Jung) and Nepomuk Afterbite (Marco Lorenzini); and two cops, Chief Inspector Unbelief (Karl Markovics) and Assistant Guido Doppler (Felix Oitzinger). The names alone should give an accurate indication of the unrelenting level of quirk, with everyone dialing up the eccentricities to 11.


	It all becomes too self-consciously arch to be clever. There's an additional quest element in Elizabeth seeking documents about her family lineage to fight her erasure from the history books. But that doesn't add much beyond three crusty Báthory ancestors carousing drunkenly in their coffins. Super-annoying.


	There are stops at a monastery in Leipzig, its catacombs decorated with human skulls and bones, policed by a Mother Superior who's handy with a crucifix; a Funeral Museum with a Café Mortuary; a queer cabaret, where Austria's Conchita Wurst (Tom Neuwirth) performs “Rise Like a Phoenix,” the power ballad that won the Eurovision Song Contest; and a final act back in Vienna at the Prater, with scenes on the historic Wiener Riesenrad, the giant Ferris wheel that inevitably brings up associations with noir classic The Third Man.


	Queer feminist filmmaker Ottinger's work is known for its rejection of conventional linear narratives, but would a little coherence be too much to ask? The Blood Countess devolves into such haphazard, nonsensical plotting (with a resolution far more rushed than satisfying) that it's a challenge to stay with it for the protracted two-hour duration.

	











	At least there's Huppert in gloriously aloof form, plus the overripe lusciousness of Martin Gschlacht's cinematography; with an edible and/or a cocktail or three, that might be enough. 


	There have been numerous films made about Elizabeth Báthory, who was convicted of torturing and murdering hundreds of women between 1590 and 1610; according to legend, she bathed in their blood to maintain her youthful looks. As sublime as Huppert is, if I'm in the mood for a campy retelling of the Báthory story, I'll stick with the trashtastic 1971 Hammer horror production with Ingrid Pitt as the busty bloodsucker, Countess Dracula.

	Exhibitors are “apprehensive” about “placing too much stock” in Netflix‘s recent pledges to honor traditional theatrical release windows, Cinemark CEO Sean Gamble said Wednesday.


	Speaking to Wall Street analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, Gamble said theater owners have taken “some element of encouragement” from comments by Netflix management about theaters. At the same time, exhibitors remain wary of the messages due to “how contradictory they now are to many of the other disparaging remarks that have been made over recent years,” Gamble said. He noted that Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos less than a year ago described theaters as “outmoded for most people.”

	Given that history, “I think there's going to need to be more action versus comments, and firmer assurances to give everybody comfort that what's being said is real,” Gamble added.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Cinemark fell short of Wall Street earnings estimates in the October-to-December quarter, with Gamble citing a “softer-than-expected” film slate compared with the one in the 2024 period. On a diluted basis, earnings came in at 16 cents a share, down from 33 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Wall Street analysts had expected 24 cents. Revenue fell 5% from the year-ago quarter, reaching $776.3 million, ahead of Street estimates.


	After long spurning theaters, Netflix has made a show of embracing them as it looks to seal its pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery's studios-and-streaming division. Paramount, a longtime champion of theatrical releasing, has made a hostile bid for all of WBD and began a 7-day window of negotiation with WBD's board.


	Gamble was asked specifically about Netflix's recent vows to honor a 45-day window for Warner Bros releases in theaters. He called the window “a good target point” but said exhibitors are eager for more clarification.


	The stance from Netflix “begs the question of '45 days to what?'” Gamble said. He noted the difference between a film playing in theaters for 45 days before moving to PVOD or other transactional windows versus a title leaving theaters and going straight onto a subscription streamer. Those in the latter scenario are viewed as “free” by most consumers and are therefore “a different kind of construct,” Gamble added.

	











	“There's a lot still to clarify with what exactly is being referenced,” he said. “I think we're all looking for much firmer assurances that are longstanding for not only a window, but levels of continued investment, and also sustained marketing, which is a critical component of this, too, versus just verbal comments and promises.”


	Cinemark has conducted multiple tests with Netflix in recent years, giving movies like The Christmas Chronicles 2 and Army of the Dead and the last two Knives Out installments short, nationwide runs. The results have been generally inconclusive, though, and amounted to little more than marketing stunts.


	“We've been optimistic that in time Netflix would recognize the opportunity that theatrical exhibition provides their platform,” Gamble said, noting that Amazon and “even Apple” seem to recognize the upside. “We thought for a long while there's just value that was being ignored by not taking advantage of that opportunity.”


	As Netflix and Paramount jockey, the situation is “active and fluid,” Gamble said. Individually and via trade group Cinema United, Cinemark has tried to stay in close contact with the companies involved as well as regulators, the exec said, in pursuit of an outcome of “sustained exclusive theatrical windows.” 


	Exhibitors “just want to make sure that things continue to progress that way versus any type of risk that might ensue from the consolidation of a significant studio like Warner Bros,” he said. The studio “has been a strong partner of theatrical exhibition for many, many years and just had a record-breaking performance in 2025.”

The 25-year-old actress, fresh off a busy 'Heated Rivalry' winter, is preparing to close out her long journey on Showtime's ‘Yellowjackets' as production for the final season begins. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	Sophie Nélisse, coming off of a busy winter with the release of Heated Rivalry, is preparing to head back into the wilderness for the fourth and final season of Showtime's Yellowjackets.


	“There's a lot of pressure coming into this season knowing it's the last one,” the 25-year-old actress told The Hollywood Reporter on a Zoom call earlier this month. It's about a week out from when Nélisse is scheduled to return to the show that has, in her words, shaped her young adult life.




Heated Rivalry and Yellowjackets seemingly have nothing in common, but the Montreal native doesn't feel like they have to. “I approach every role with a different purpose and idea of what it's going to bring me,” she explains. Heated Rivalry, she says, was a project she took because she knew it had the potential for greater meaning and real-world impact.

	In the series she plays Rose Landry, the Hollywood starlet who has a brief fling with the show's main character Shane Hollander, played by Hudson Williams. Rose becomes Shane's support system — and in one of the most heartwarming scenes of the show — she is the first person he ever comes out to.


	“What's really important in selecting a character is the creative team attached, to make sure I work with people I feel really passionate about who are there for the right reasons,” Nélisse explains.

	











	She continues, “It's really easy in this industry to fall into the machine of Hollywood and doing content just for doing content. At the end of the day, we all have to work and sometimes you don't have that luxury to be able to be so picky. I definitely want to be very intentional when selecting my characters. That's also why I've gotten into producing, because there are books I've read that have moved me so much. To have that creative power has been a really fun journey to be on.”


	Below, Nélisse breaks down her emotional Heated Rivalry scene, why the show means so much to her, what to expect from Yellowjackets season four — and why you might not see her in another horror project for a bit.


	***


What about Heated Rivalry drew you in?


	I fell deeply in love with these characters the second I read it. The first two episodes are fun. It's such a hook, and I'm such a sucker for rom-coms and that will they-won't they? I was hooked on the first episodes, but then I loved how it developed into something that felt so honest and raw and vulnerable. What I love the most is that it really gave me hope. With all the darkness and all the heaviness in the world right now, we needed a show that brought some levity, but in a way that feels achievable. Beyond that, it's not a story that I feel like I've seen on screen before, and it was really refreshing to see. It gave so much visibility to a community that doesn't have enough representation. Often when there is a queer couple, they don't make it or they get killed in the first 15 minutes of a show. To see them coming out as heroes was my takeaway.

	











What about Rose as a character?


	There's something so genuine about her, something so mesmerizing and captivating because of the way she has this self-confidence that's not obnoxious or condescending. She has that gravitas, but also knows when not to be in the spotlight. Her point in this entire story is to let Shane shine. A lot of that is through that subtle and quiet support. It was really important for us to really feel those. A lot of our scenes are a little slower, especially at the restaurant. To me, Rose is someone who everyone needs in their life.


	There's nothing as important for any human being than to have someone with whom you can be 100 percent yourself, completely stripped out of every wall and facet and still be loved unconditionally. That is so precious and very rare to find in a friendship, no matter the nature of that friendship or that relationship. Characters like Rose are one in a million that you come across. I loved how she loved him unconditionally and gave him such a safe space for him to feel like he could be his truest self.


What were your talks with creator Jacob Tierney like to tackle the restaurant scene in particular?


	We didn't talk about it that much. Hudson and I actually never rehearsed it. We ran lines, and then when we rehearsed the scene before doing the first take, we went off script because we have a very similar sense of humor, and we just started shooting [the] shit. We were messing around with the scene, and we weren't saying what was scripted because we were like, “This is a five-minute scene. We're not going to rehearse it to just do it in a second.” There's no movement. It's just us.

	











	There's something so unique about a first take because it's the most honest it gets — there's something magical because it's untouched. We both wanted to leave it at that and see just how the first take runs out. The only thing Jacob had mentioned was, “Don't be scared of the silences. Don't be scared of the awkwardness, don't be scared to make it slow.” There are a few beats after — once the show's edited, obviously you trim down — but there's not much to say.


What about your character specifically in that scene?


	I didn't want her to outshine him. She was really in the passenger seat, and sometimes it's in the eye contact and the energy of being like, “I will be here whenever you're ready to talk and open up.” There's that beautiful moment when it cuts back to his flashbacks. I remember doing ADR after we'd shot the scene once the show was about to be released, and just knives straight to my heart. It's what really gets me in that scene. Rose is not saying anything, it's just him living his emotion and all of his duality, everything that's tearing him apart. And the conflict, and you feel all of that. It's silent. Even the images are silent. It's so powerful. We really wanted the scene to be quiet and intimate. 


	On the very first take, just watching Hudson's inner monologue, you could see the battle in his eyes and it made me tear up instantly. We both were in a place of really listening to one another in the scene. It wasn't about what I was going to say next. It was about, how can I make him feel seen and understood and cared for?












What has the show's response been like for you? It seems like you all knew that you had something special, but sometimes the world doesn't always realize that right away. It hit at a great time for you guys.


	You said it so well. People love to ask that question, “Did you guys know it was going to blow up?” We knew what we were a part of was special, and we all care so deeply for the story. It was a story that needed to be told, especially in this day and age, and felt very of its time. We poured our hearts and soul into it and we knew we were in great hands with Jacob. We knew we would be very proud of the final product, but it's such a question and matter of timing and who's seen it, who's talked about it, the PR around it, the promoting of it. There are so many elements that are out of our control that I don't think any of us could have predicted how overnight the success was going to be.


	We're so grateful, honored. Before the show coming out, I remember wrapping and being like, “This is one of the best sets I've ever been on in my entire life.” Everyone was so genuine and there's no sense of competition. The chemistry that everyone has is what it was like on set. Hudson is unhinged and chaotic and hilarious, and Connor is so caring. Actually, he's so unlike his character because he's so not cold. He's the warmest, sweetest man. And Jacob, I've never seen someone direct a set that felt so effortless. He makes directing look so easy when this guy literally is showrunning, writing, doing everything. I really do believe that when the creators and everyone on set, all the way down to the crew members, are there for the right reasons, there is something that transgresses on screen.

	











I agree with you.


	There's something really magical about it, and I think the audience really felt that. I fell into this industry very randomly, but I do feel somewhat of a responsibility to be able to make somewhat of a change with my work. Cinema, TV is a great medium to be able to do that because I remember seeing characters on screen growing up that made me feel less alone because they made me feel so seen and understood. In moments that I was having the shittiest day, I would go to the movies and for an hour and a half, I would forget everything that was hard in my life. I'm getting emotional just thinking about it.


No, it's absolutely OK.


	I think of people who have been battling so many things that they've never been able to express or talk about, who feel so lonely and that there's no light for them at the end of the tunnel. Then they fall upon this show and this is their lifeline. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but especially for the gay community, I feel like there hasn't been the opportunity or chance to have this representation on screen, for some people to finally feel there's a character that they can relate to. It's helped some people come out. To know my work has brought people closer together, that it's bonded people and helped them out of really hard times, that it's changed their lives to some extent, is really all I can ask for. I've been feeling very grateful and emotional of how well the show has resonated with people.


You've been working as an actor since you were young. How do you think your outlook on the types of roles you seek has grown alongside you?












	When I started, it was all fun and games. I was not a theater kid. I've never taken any acting classes to this day. I probably should. You can always become a better version of yourself. It doesn't have any limits. I will forever be learning from my peers and can always improve. At the beginning, I had no plan or set destination or goal. I randomly fell into acting because I needed a bit of money to be able to afford gymnastics that I was doing at the time and the traveling competitions. I was just very lucky. My first movie went to the Oscars and then I booked The Book Thief, which was a big movie.


	At first, I was taking whatever came my way that was fun without any second thought or trying to curate my career. When I graduated high school and wanted to apply for college, and I didn't really know what I wanted to do, that's when I started being a bit more selective and take it a bit more seriously and putting a bit more thought into the scripts I was reading. Then I quickly booked Yellowjackets and since then, it's opened some doors, for sure, and I've been able to be a bit more selective. I just want to have a great balance. Obviously with Yellowjackets, I've been offered a lot of horror driven-[roles].


Yeah, I can imagine.


	I really don't want to pigeon-hole myself in that genre, especially because actually, horror is my least favorite genre. I think moving forward, it's about trying to create a career that feels really different with characters who are as far away from me as possible. That's what's fun, sometimes, to step out of your comfort zone, however terrifying that can be. But I really want to try comedy. I've never done comedy. I would love that because I think it looks really hard.

	











I recently interviewed an actor and we talked about how rom-coms are harder.


	I do think it's harder. In comedy, there's probably a lot of improv and trying things and it not working out. The idea of shooting an idea that comes out of my mind and it landing and everyone being like, “That's such a bad idea,” would traumatize me, but in a great way. I need to live through that embarrassment because, what is acting if not trying things? It's a classic process, but I would be really interested in doing comedy. People We Meet On Vacation is actually a role I'd really love, I think would be really fun. I'm a big rom-com gal, so I'm manifesting that for myself. I just want to try to do as many different characters as possible.


I know you're preparing to go back to Yellowjackets, correct?


	I leave in a week to go back.


Wow. Very soon. Have you seen any scripts? How are you taking in the fact that it's the last one?


	They're very secretive about what happens in this show. We literally get the scripts two weeks before shooting an episode, sometimes even a week.


Wow.


	We have no idea. People are like, “Give us spoilers.” I'm like, “I wish I could.” I have nothing myself. But I do think that obviously, there's a lot of pressure coming into this season knowing it's the last one. We all feel a lot of responsibility in offering the audience a season that will live up to the expectations that we'll close out the show, but stay true to the very first season, honoring all of the episodes at the same time. I think it'll be a really fun one. Luckily, the showrunners have had time to write it and I think are very committed to putting in their all, so it's very bittersweet.

	











	This show will have shaped my 20s. I've known these girls for almost 10 years now in the most formative years of my life. The things that I've come to learn about myself… they've made me grow so much, so it really feels weird for this to come to an end. But at the same time, so exciting to be able to try different kinds of characters. Every good show wraps at four, honestly.


Or it gets to a point where…


	Where everyone's like, “I would rather stay true to the show and not go off rails just to keep giving.” We've been excited about the rescue [of the teen survivors, including Shauna] since we started the show. The time in the wilderness has been so interesting to see how, emotionally, they navigate all of these circumstances, but I think the back to reality is going to hit all of us hard. Then being confronted by all of their demons, all of them navigating the demons they had before going into the wilderness and the things they were dealing. 


	Obviously, there were different issues to deal with out in the wilderness. [They didn't have to] deal with a lot of these things that are now all going to come back to the surface, whether that's previous relationships or their relationship with their parents. There's a lot of things that were broken before they even went out in the wilderness, so it's going to double down on them. That is going to be very interesting to see how it unfolds.


What are you going to miss the most? Like you said, the show's really shaped a lot of your adult life and it is obviously going to be a bit of a change when it is no longer there.












	There's something very fun about being so established, that we know each other so well and we really operate as a group. I'll miss that we know each other's flaws and weaknesses and strengths from working season after season together. It'll be weird whenever I shoot on another project, when you are new to some actor and you don't know how they operate or their style or technique. To be so in tune with other actors is going to feel weird to not have anymore. And the friendships, it really does feel like you go home to one big family. Working with the crew as well, there's something so familiar and comforting, especially when you're not working in your hometown, it does feel a bit like home away from home when I get to go back with the same ADs and the same crews. You've established running jokes on set and we know this from season one. That's going to be really hard to lose, I think.

	“Free Me,” Shia LaBeouf posted in the early hours of this morning after reports emerged of his arrest. 


	The Transformers star was making his first remarks after being arrested yesterday at a Mardi Gras event at which he reportedly struck two men. He had been spending time partying in New Orleans over the past couple of days.


	Having been arrested then treated for his injuries, before reportedly returning to a Mardi Gras party, LaBeouf posted “free me” to his 454,000 X followers in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

	A New Orleans Police Department statement to press confirmed LaBeouf's arrest. “A man identified as 39-year-old Shia LaBeouf was reportedly causing a disturbance and becoming increasing[ly] aggressive at a Royal Street business,” said the department. “Once removed from the building, the victim reported being struck by LaBeouf, who used his closed fists on the victim several times.”


	LaBeouf was arrested and faces two charges of simple battery, with his next hearing scheduled for March 19, The Guardian reported. According to The Daily Mail, LaBeouf was seen returning to Mardi Gras celebrations after he left the hospital.


	LaBeouf's credits include Transformers, Disturbia and American Honey. The former child star is a controversial figure. He was previously sued by ex-girlfriend FKA Twigs for sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress, which was later settled. We have reached out to his reps for comment on his arrest.

There are a few things audiences shouldn't worry about during the course of a snappy crime caper. Or, there are a few things audiences shouldn't even think about during one, let alone find the time to worry about — especially not if our seemingly devious criminals aren't worrying about them, either. Fingerprints. Surveillance cameras. Pretty obvious motives. The second we start doing the calculations, the grift is cooked, the fun is off, the show is over.

These were some of the many thoughts (and worries!) I found the time to ponder while watching John Patton Ford‘s loose “Kind Hearts and Coronets” remake, “How to Make a Killing.” While the inspiration for the “Emily the Criminal” filmmaker's latest is certainly more goofy than what Ford has brought to the screen for his sophomore outing, it's also significantly less funny and woefully devoid of the kind of snap and pop (hell, even the crackle) such a film should burst with.

If we're going to kill the rich for fun and profit, we need some actual fun, right? Alas.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The ingredients are all there: Ford's skill with stories about the evils of capitalism (and the delight of some good, old-fashioned revenge) was proven out with his Aubrey Plaza-starring debut, star and executive producer Glen Powell remains eager to bring his charisma and talent to all kinds of projects, the supporting cast is stacked, and the basic storyline is ripe for a new take. 

But the film suffers from a pair of unfortunate missteps, the first of which is plain from the start and only gets worse as the film drags on. Written by Ford, “How to Make a Killing” awkwardly plays out through copious voiceover narration from Powell's Becket Redfellow, heavy on exposition and light on much else. Becket knows enough to narrate his life story before it even starts — his mother grew up in insane wealth and privilege, but when she got pregnant at age 18, her cold father (Ed Harris) tossed her out without a care — and to guide us up until the precise moment the film actually opens.

It's not a spoiler: Becket is in prison, about to be put to death, but he's got four hours to chat it up with a baffled priest (Adrian Lukis). Becket uses this time to take the guy through his entire life story (with some sizable, murder-free jumps notably missing), most of it hinging on that essential wound inflicted on him before he was born. After losing his young father almost immediately (a pitch-black comedic bit that the rest of the film should have learned from), Becket's childhood was built on his bond with his mother (Nell Williams), who strove to teach her progeny about the finer things in life, even when they were living in (gasp) New Jersey, off (gasp) the freeway, and she (gasp) had to toil with a thankless job at the DMV.

 










So while Becket grew up poor in finances, he also grew up rich in experiences (the film's real locations and excellent costumes help out on both fronts). He knows how to play the piano. He did archery for a time. He loves a good suit. But when his mother died — and, crucially, his billionaire grandfather still refused to help her — Becket was left with only one burning desire, as demanded by his mom on her deathbed: to claw back the “right kind of life.” Financially speaking, that means he should get his inheritance (which, through some sort of mangled irrevocable trust, Becket can still benefit from), but only if every other person in front of him in the Redfellow line (all seven of them) kicks the bucket first.

And thus enters the film's second great misstep: attempting to cast the eminently charming Powell as a bad dude, driven by rage. That alone is a problem, but things get still thornier as we go, because Ford himself seems unable to determine if Becket is, in fact, a bad dude. Or even if he could be. If he is at certain moments. That lack of character clarity, as filtered through the kind of actor we always want to root for? It makes for a deadly (dull) combination.

Letting Becket narrate the entire outing sure doesn't help, adding a structure that isn't just boring, but also confusing. There are moments in which it seems — perhaps? — that Becket's narration is actually an internal monologue, but we never get close enough to him to decide if that's the case. It also robs the film of what should be obvious pleasures, such as Becket planning the multiple murders he needs to complete to secure his fortune. Instead, we simply arrive at the scenes of his crimes, no forethought or intention provided, no snappy planning montages, no joy or humor in these dark machinations.

 










And that's a real shame, because the killings? They're quite clever. A young cousin is offed on a yacht in hilarious, potentially accidental fashion. Someone else suffers at the hands (dental trays?) of poison made to look like teeth whitener. And while not every one of Becket's relatives gets the chance to shine, when they do, it gives “How to Make a Killing” the zing it's otherwise so sorely missing. Zach Woods is a riot as another dim cousin easily swayed by Becket's apparent interest in his “art” (later, Becket will take an actual interest in his girlfriend, Jessica Henwick, who plays the only person here with a moral center). Topher Grace offers up his own spin on “The Righteous Gemstones” as yet another cousin who absolutely has it coming to him (prequel spinoff?).

The stacked supporting cast also includes the great Bill Camp as Becket's Uncle Warren, who takes the kid under his wing after meeting him at one of (many!) family funerals. That includes giving Becket a job at one of the family companies, and as his star begins to rise (and a relationship with Henwick's Ruth starts to heat up), a curious question arises: Maybe Becket can stop the murders? Life seems pretty good right now? Billions, who needs 'em?

Such thorny moral questions are in short supply in the film, but this little pickle does provide the script's smartest step: Let's add in blackmail! When Becket was just a kid (playing piano, practicing archery, wanting so badly to be rich), he made pals with the wealthy Julia, a first love he's never gotten over. And when she strides back into his life, played as an adult by Margaret Qualley (who absolutely gets this particular assignment), he's still at her mercy. Julia, no slouch, knows full well what Becket is up to and is hellbent on using that information to cash out big time. Any time he shows signs of stopping? She's right there.

 










It's good motivation, the kind of stuff that keeps the film (and Becket) moving whenever it starts to slow, which is too often. We see the seams of it, of course, but at a certain point, that sort of craftsmanship is welcome. It's a far cry from the more lax elements, which are far more prevalent. This should be tighter, meaner, leaner, cutting. How to make a killing? Let's worry about the smaller stuff first.

A24 will release “How to Make a Killing” in theaters on Friday, February 20.

	The attention surrounding James Talarico‘s Late Show with Stephen Colbert interview has been very good for the Texas Democrat's campaign for U.S. Senate.


	He raised $2.5 million in the 24 hours after the segment was shifted from CBS broadcast to YouTube, his largest single fundraising period for the campaign.


	On Monday, Colbert said that he was prohibited from featuring Talarico on his late-night show, as the FCC has issued new guidance about the appearance of political candidates on talk shows. 


	Instead, Colbert said that the interview would be posted on YouTube. There, the interview has drawn almost 5.2 million views, greatly exceeding the show's average broadcast audience.

	Talarico said in a statement that the incident was “the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top. A threat to one of our First Amendment rights is a threat to all of our First Amendment rights.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	CBS was not banned from airing the interview. But had it aired on CBS broadcast, the network's affiliates in Texas may have been on the hook to provide equal time to Talarico's rivals in the Democratic primary, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) and Ahmad Hassan. 


	Previously, late night and daytime talk shows have assumed that they are exempt from the Equal Time Rule, given the newsworthy nature of many of their interviews and previous FCC decisions. But Donald Trump has lashed out at Colbert and other late-night hosts, and his FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, issued new guidance last month warning talk programs that they may not be exempt and be obligated to provide airtime to all candidates who request it in a coming election.

	











	In the controversy that followed Colbert's Monday show, CBS issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the host “was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico. The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.”


	But Colbert on his Tuesday show that CBS lawyers had reviewed his script where he said that he was blocked from airing the interview.


	Talarico will be in Los Angeles on Thursday for a fundraiser for his campaign.

	Chateau Amiri, California is open for business.


	The Los Angeles-based luxury fashion brand founded by Mike Amiri has launched a new spring-summer campaign dubbed Chateau Amiri, California and drafted actors Danny Ramirez and Michael Imperioli to check in alongside multi-hyphenate Malcolm McRae and models Jordan Daniels and Heather Diamond Strongarm. 




	They were tasked with playing “a heightened, imagined version of themselves” for photographer Hart Leshkina and director Bon Duke who captured the campaign inside the faux hotel, which was designed to pay homage “to the haunts and locales” that have shaped the modern mythology of Hollywood, per Amiri. The brand's founder, Mike Amiri, who launched the label in 2014, explained it a little further.

	“Character is the starting point for everything I create, shaped by cinema, the soul of Hollywood. Our Amiri campaigns have become spaces to explore this idea — creating immersive worlds of still and motion pictures, where our collections come to life with new context, different stories,” said Amiri. “Building on that universe we're crafting, this season we welcome you, and a cast of true stars, into the Chateau Amiri.” 


	The campaign features the models outfitted in fits from Amiri's spring-summer collection, accessorized by martinis, sunglasses, room keys, hand bags and more framed by hotel suites, lobbies and pools. See below for shots from the campaign.


	Imperioli is best known for his starring turn opposite James Gandolfini on the iconic Sopranos. More recently, he's been seen in Song Sung Blue, The Nice Guys, The White Lotus and The Many Saints of Newark. Ramirez meanwhile is best known for his work in Top Gun: Maverick, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Captain America: Brave New World and The Last of Us. He'll next be seen in Avengers: Doomsday. Rocker McRae had a role on Daisy Jones and the Six.

	In a “Valentine's Day statement” shared on social media, Antonia Teixeira, the wife of the Lemonheads co-founder Evan Dando, addressed the allegations that the musician sent a fan unsolicited videos of himself masturbating before being hospitalized for mental-health treatment.


	Teixeira said that in the weeks leading up to the incident, the frontman was “struggling with heavy drinking, prescription-drug abuse, and a serious mental-health episode.” She said that during this period, Dando “engaged in inappropriate online exchanges.”


	While Teixeira said he believed he was participating in “consensual sexual messaging,” that belief “does not excuse his behavior” and that she was “not minimizing what happened.” 


	Last week, news broke that a fan identified as “Dawn” on journalist Tony Ortega's substack, The Underground Bunker, claimed she had reached out to Dando in social media DMs in October to congratulate him on releasing Love Chant, the Lemonheads' first album of original music since 2006's The Lemonheads. Dando allegedly replied, “Cool I'm sorry I'm an exhibitionist,” and the following day sent her an unwanted video of himself masturbating.

	Dando, who lives in Brazil with Teixeira and is a stepfather to her three children, was later admitted to a local hospital to receive help from mental-health professionals, his rep previously told Rolling Stone.Teixeira said that she has reached out to the woman who made the allegations to apologize and said, “No one deserves to receive unwanted sexual content, and I am sincerely sorry for the distress this caused.” She said Dando agreed to enter treatment prior to the claims becoming public and is now in rehab to address his substance abuse and mental health.


	“I have made it clear that continuing treatment is essential, and I will make decisions that protect myself if he does not follow through,” Teixeira continued. “I am not defending his actions. They hurt me deeply. At the same time, I believe addiction and mental illness can lead to destructive behavior that requires accountability and professional help.” She added, “I hope there can be room for both responsibility and compassion as he takes steps toward recovery.”

	On the day Dando's rep confirmed the artist had checked into a hospital in Brazil, Teixeira spoke with Billboard and told the publication that the couple had traveled from their home in São Paulo to New York City for the Lemonheads' appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Jan. 20, which was followed by a Tiny Desk episode in Washington, D.C. However, Teixeira said, “that day, he was totally out of his mind,” adding, “So out of his mind, that the Tiny Desk won't be aired.”


	“I'm very mad, because he betrayed me,” Teixeira said when discussing discovering the alleged unsolicited videos. Teixeira said she believes the video was messaged to the wrong woman. “From what I'm looking [at] now, it wasn't … he doesn't remember what he did,” she said. “He was in a mental meltdown.”

It was only a matter of time before the siren song of '00s nostalgia beckoned Miley Cyrus back to her teen-idol roots. Now, with the clarity of hindsight and a decade removed from her “I'm not a kid anymore” provocations, Cyrus is ready to face her early blonde ambition as the high school superstar once again. Announced earlier today, Cyrus is returning to Disney for the Hannah Montana 20th Anniversary Special. 

The special is neither a reunion episode of the series nor a revival season, dang flabbit. Shot in front of a live studio audience, the special will feature an “exclusive, in-depth interview” with Miley Cyrus by Call Me Daddy's Alex Cooper. But wait, there's more. The special will also feature never-before-seen archival footage and recreations of Hannah Montana's sets, including her closet and the family living room. Watch as Cyrus revisits the music, moments, and memories that launched the daughter of the “Achey Break Heart” guy to superstardom. It seems like the special will mostly feature Cyrus waxing nostalgic about her early career, as the Disney press release doesn't explicitly say Cyrus will perform any songs from the series. Until we hear otherwise, we'll go ahead and assume she'll be singing “Dream As One,” the hit song from Avatar: Fire And Ash. 

“Hannah Montana will always be a part of who I am,” Cyrus said in a statement. “What started as a TV show became a shared experience that shaped my life and the lives of so many fans, and I'll always be thankful for that connection. The fact that it still means so much to people all these years later is something I'm very proud of. This ‘Hannahversary' is my way of celebrating and thanking the fans who've stood by me for 20 years.”

The Hannah Montana 20th Anniversary Special premieres on March 24 on Disney+.

When Kunal Nayyar thinks about success, he does not start with awards or ratings. He starts with gratitude.

The former “Big Bang Theory” star recently revealed that he quietly pays medical bills for families in need by browsing campaigns on GoFundMe and covering expenses himself. The candid admission has resonated widely, offering a glimpse into how the actor chooses to use his wealth beyond Hollywood.

Nayyar shared the revelation in an interview with The i Paper. He said he sometimes scrolls through GoFundMe pages at night and steps in to help families facing overwhelming medical costs. He described the practice as something deeply personal and meaningful, explaining that financial success has given him the freedom to positively change lives.

The actor, who rose to global fame playing Raj Koothrappali on the hit CBS sitcom, said he views money as a responsibility as much as a privilege. He expressed gratitude for the career that allowed him to build financial security and said he feels fortunate that he can now extend that security to others during moments of crisis.

According to Variety, Nayyar has used his own funds to pay off medical-related GoFundMe campaigns for families he does not personally know. The actor does not attach publicity to the donations and has focused instead on the relief those contributions can bring.

Medical emergencies often arrive without warning, leaving families scrambling for resources. Through GoFundMe, many share their stories in hopes of easing the financial strain tied to surgeries, hospital stays, or long-term treatments. Nayyar's involvement underscores how one individual can make a direct and immediate difference.

Page Six reported that Nayyar's net worth, built largely during his time on “The Big Bang Theory,” has afforded him the ability to give generously. Rather than centering on luxury, he has chosen to center on impact.

Nayyar's generosity extends beyond medical bills. Reports note that he and his wife, Neha Kapur, also support educational initiatives, including scholarships for students from underserved communities. The couple also backs animal welfare causes, reflecting their shared love for animals.

In speaking about his philanthropic efforts, Nayyar emphasized gratitude and perspective. He acknowledged that his success in television created opportunities he once only imagined. Now, he said, he feels compelled to pay that success forward.

Fans have responded warmly to the revelation, praising the actor for using his platform and resources in meaningful ways. The story has sparked conversations about how celebrities can leverage their influence to address real-world challenges and uplift everyday families.

In the wake of the Super Bowl halftime show, he places a record 29 titles on the chart.

Sr. Charts & Data Analyst (Latin & Billboard Español)


Bad Bunny starts the week with a massive sweep across Billboard charts. He lands a record-breaking 29 simultaneous titles on the Hot Latin Songs chart (dated Feb. 21), as his track “DtMF” adds a 47th week at No. 1 on the multimetric ranking, while also securing the No. 1 spot on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100.


	Among his 29 titles on Hot Latin Songs is his 14-minute “Super Bowl LX Halftime Show (Live)” medley, which debuts at No. 31.


	Following his halftime performance at Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8, Bad Bunny's songs experienced a massive surge as fans flocked to his catalog. On the Hot Latin Songs chart, he lands 29 concurrent songs, surpassing Peso Pluma's previous record of 25 titles set in 2023 — when songs from his album Génesis populated the tally. The Hot Latin Songs chart blends streaming, radio airplay and sales data into its formula.

	











	Starting with “DtMF,” the song adds a 47th week at No. 1 on Hot Latin Songs, inching closer to Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's “Despacito” (featuring Justin Bieber), which holds the record with 56 weeks at No. 1 beginning in 2017. “DtMF” races at breakneck pace, with a 185% increase in streams during the week ending Feb. 12, generating 43 million official clicks in the United States, according to Luminate. That sends it to No. 1 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, his second leader there. It also jumps 4-1 on the overall Streaming Songs chart and adds a 33rd week at the summit on Latin Streaming Songs (tying José Feliciano's “Feliz Navidad” for the third-most weeks at No. 1; they trail Enrique Iglesias' “Bailando,” featuring Descemer Bueno and Gente de Zona, with 66 weeks at No. 1, and “Despacito,” with 59 weeks).




	In addition to his No. 1 with “DtMF,” Benito dominates the entire top 10, and beyond, on Hot Latin Songs. “BAILE INoLVIDABLE” holds at No. 2 for a 16th week with significant gains in streams. The previous two-week champ registered 28.8 million clicks, up 141%, during the tracking week, rebounding to No. 2 from No. 10 on Streaming Songs. Plus, it debuts at No. 18 on the overall Digital Songs Sales list with 4,000 downloads sold.


	“NUEVAYoL,” also on Benito's halftime setlist, is the Hot Latin Songs chart's biggest gainer in sales. It logged 5,000 in digital sales, up 238%, and holds at No. 3 for a ninth nonconsecutive week. That sum yields a No. 9 debut on the overall Digital Song Sales chart.


	Among the reentries, “Tití Me Preguntó” becomes the biggest winner, returning at No. 4 with 22.6 million streams and 10,000 sold.

	During Raye‘s This Tour May Contain New Music stop in Paris on Sunday, Feb. 15, 65 ticket holders were reportedly turned away and left stranded outside her concert at Accor Arena.


	The singer took to social media on Tuesday to address the Ticketmaster fumble. “I am completely devastated for the 65 ticket holders who were turned down from entering our Paris show on Sunday night,” wrote Raye on Instagram Stories the following Tuesday. “This is completely unacceptable and wrong.”


	Raye said she was told there was a “system error” at Ticketmaster, which led to the tickets not being “fully validated when they were purchased.” Despite the issue being “outside of anything I could control,” the artist said she felt “saddened and let down” by the blunder. She added that “everyone affected was refunded and given a voucher from Ticketmaster,” while also offering all 65 people who were denied entry complimentary tickets to any of her future shows and a signed vinyl.


	“I know this doesn't even remotely make up for this mess, but it's all I can think of in this moment to soften the blow,” she said before ending her note. “My deepest apologies to those of you affected.”

	In a statement to Rolling Stone, a Ticketmaster spokesperson acknowledged that a “small number of fans experienced a technical issue when entering the show.” The rep said, “While we know it doesn't replace the show, we have fully refunded those affected and provided a gift card.”


	Back in November, Olivia Dean delivered a scathing criticism of Ticketmaster, Live Nation, and AEG over resale ticket prices. “You are providing a disgusting service. The prices at which you're allowing tickets to be re-sold is vile and completely against our wishes,” she wrote in a social media post at the time. “Live music should be affordable and accessible, and we need to find a new way of making that possible. BE BETTER.”

	Dean's denouncement arrived about two months after the Federal Trade Commission and seven states sued Live Nation and Ticketmaster (the companies merged in 2010) and accused the country's biggest concert promoter and ticketing website of allowing scalpers to amass millions of tickets so they can be resold on Ticketmaster's own resale platforms at steep markups to customers.

On the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie & Keith are talking about who could helm next year's show -- and when country could take the reins.


Bad Bunny‘s Super Bowl halftime show is still making waves more than a week later — including his song “DtMF” topping the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time — but that doesn't mean we can't start looking ahead to who might be up next for the 2027 halftime.


	On the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie & Keith are taking a closer look at the Billboard.com reader poll that went live last week asking who should headline next year's Super Bowl halftime show, Right now, BTS is leading by a landslide, with more than 85% of the vote. It would make sense for the newly reunited Korean superstars to cap their sure-to-be-active comeback year with potentially a big Grammys night — like Kendrick Lamar and Bad Bunny have done the last two years — followed by an epic performance on the Super Bowl stage. Of course, Taylor Swift is always in the Super Bowl conversation too, and we think Post Malone could be an overwhelmingly supported pick knowing how many genres he crosses.

	











	And speaking of genres, there hasn't been a country moment on the Super Bowl stage since the 1994 all-country halftime (Clint Black, Tanya Tucker, Travis Tritt and The Judds) or when Shania Twain was part of a show that also included No Doubt and Sting in 2003. Who could be the best country pick to take the massive stage?

	











	Listen to our full discussion below:


	Also on the show, for the third week in a row, we have new No. 1s on both the Billboard 200 albums chart and the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, as J. Cole's The Fall Off debuts atop the former while a Super Bowl-powered Bad Bunny gets his first solo No. 1 on the Hot 100 with “DtMF.”


The Billboard Pop Shop Podcast is your one-stop shop for all things pop on Billboard‘s weekly charts. You can always count on a lively discussion about the latest pop news, fun chart stats and stories, new music, and guest interviews with music stars and folks from the world of pop. Casual pop fans and chart junkies can hear Billboard‘s executive digital director, West Coast, Katie Atkinson and Billboard's managing director, charts and data operations, Keith Caulfield every week on the podcast, which can be streamed on Billboard.com or downloaded in Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast provider.

	Few things unite people on the internet these days but if there's one thing that can bring social media together, it's a heartwarming animal video.


	That's why Twitter users have been quick to rally around Punch, a six-month-old baby macaque monkey from Japan who found solace in a stuffed toy after he was rejected by his mother after birth.

Another video of a macaque with a heartbreaking storyThis toy replaced his mother for the little one.We don't pay for the internet to cry 😭💔 https://t.co/E15UTdBZM6 pic.twitter.com/IVvxhPDeI1


	Punch (or Punch-kun in Japanese) was born in July at the Ichikawa City Zoo in Chiba, and has been hand-reared and hand-fed by zookeepers since being abandoned by his mother and her troop. Other monkeys in his enclosure have been similarly hostile, leaving poor Punch to fend for himself when not under the watchful eye of his handlers.


	Fortunately, the zookeepers found a solution, purchasing a stuffed animal to keep Punch company. His companion of choice: an orange plush orangutan from IKEA.











		Though it's not quite a stand-in for his mother, the IKEA monkey offers a similarly cuddly and furry companion for Punch (or others) to snuggle up to. Its long arms let the plush orangutan hang from your shoulders or around your waist (a velcro fastening lets you press its hands and feet together).	


	At 14 inches in height, it's just a tad smaller than a female macaque, which can range from 15-20 inches in size depending on the species. But Punch doesn't seem to mind, with videos from the zoo showing him curling up with the plush toy when sleeping, or dragging it around his enclosure during the day time.




	IKEA says its toy orangutan is made from a polyester shell with a recycled polyester fiber filling. Either Punch has been super gentle (doubtful if the photos are to be believed) or the plush animal is super durable, because we have yet to see any of the stuffy's stuffing fall out.




	You can pick up the orange monkey toy now for $19.99 at IKEA.com. We recommend adding to cart while it's still in stock — like all viral toys and merch, the IKEA DJUNGELSKOG Orangutan is expected to sell out soon. 


	While IKEA hasn't officially confirmed that the zookeepers purchased their stuffed toy, the furniture store's social media handles have been replying to posts about the orangutan in the affirmative. The word Djungelskog by the way, is Swedish for “jungle forest.”



本日ご来園された皆様に心より御礼を申し上げます。スタッフ一同これまで経験したことのない想定外の賑わいに大変驚いています。ゲート通過に時間を要し大変申し訳ありませんでした。来週の三連休に向け、快適に楽しんでいただけるよう準備を進めてまいります。#市川市動植物園#がんばれパンチ pic.twitter.com/PDCTM9sbI6


	You can follow little Punch's exploits through the Ichikawa Zoo's social media channels. The zoo says visitors to the park have significantly increased since Punch went viral, writing that the staff is “Greatly surprised by the unprecedented and unexpected crowds we experienced.”


	Punch is lucky to be cared for by the Japanese zookeepers — most baby monkeys who are rejected by their mothers or troops in the wild face almost certain death, as they aren't able to find food or shelter on their own.

Kunal Nayyar of “Big Bang Theory” has been quietly paying medical bills for random families in need. 

“Money has given me greater freedom and the greatest gift is the ability to give back, to change people's lives,” Nayyar said in a December 2025 interview with the iPaper, which has been going viral on X.

“We also support animal charities because we love dogs,” he added of himself and his wife, Neha Kapur. “But what I really love to do is go on GoFundMe at night and just pay random families' medical bills. That's my masked vigilante thing! So, no, money doesn't feel like a burden. It feels like a grace from the universe.”

Nayyar explained that his fortune does not “weigh heavy” on him, as he's able to donate to worthy causes anonymously.

According to Fortune magazine, the actor — who played Raj Koothrappali on the beloved series during its entire 12-season run, from 2007 to 2019 — boasts a net worth of $45 million.

In the December interview, the actor explained that he believes more happiness would come from more generosity. 

“Right now people are not happy, because we are all expecting someone else to be kind,” he told the outlet. “We are expecting a president or a politician, some leader, to come and bring us world peace.”

He added that there is “no world peace if your neighbor comes to your door wanting some sugar for their tea, and you lock it against them and say ‘get away.'” 

He also asserted that “no one is going to come and change the world for you. You have to do it for yourself.”

The resurfaced interview caught the attention of social media users following the massive success of a fundraiser for the family of the late James Van Der Beek, which has pulled in over $2.6 million since the actor's Feb. 11 death.

The “Dawson's Creek” star's wife Kimberly and their six kids found themselves “out of funds” after costly cancer treatments left them “facing an uncertain future” following his death, according to the GoFundMe page. 

Though Realtor.com later reported that the “Varsity Blues” star had purchased his rented Texas estate a month prior to his death, a rep explained to Page Six that he'd done so with the help of friends. 

“James secured down payment for the Texas ranch for the family with the help of friends through a trust so they could shift from rent to mortgage,” they told us. 

Van Der Beek's fundraising effort was defended by celebrities including Donna Vivino, many of whom noted the high cost of medical care in social media comments.

The search for 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie has taken an emotional toll on her family as each day passes without answers. Nancy, the mother of “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie, was last seen on January 31 after spending the evening with loved ones. She was reported missing the following morning when she did not attend church.

Now more than two weeks into the investigation, her family is leaning on one another, trying to steady themselves through the uncertainty. The heartbreak lingers. So does the hope. 

With the case entering another critical phase, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos is sharing a sobering update.

In a new interview with Fox10, Nanos addressed mounting questions about the investigation and whether authorities believe Nancy is still alive.

“They ask me, do I have proof of life? I ask them, is there proof of death?” Nanos said.

He acknowledged the emotional weight of those words but made clear he is not ready to give up.

“I'm going to have that faith, and sometimes that faith, that hope, is all we have… My team, 400 people out there in the field today, woke up this morning and went out there with the hope and the belief that they're going to find Nancy.”

Nancy was last seen entering her home in the Catalina Foothills of Tucson. Hours later, her pacemaker disconnected from her Apple Watch.

Earlier this week, authorities revealed that DNA taken from a black nitrile glove discovered roughly two miles from Nancy's home did not match genetic material collected inside the residence or any profile in the national CODIS database.

At first, the glove seemed like a potential breakthrough. It closely resembled one worn by a masked person seen on Nancy's doorbell camera shortly before she vanished.

Still, Nanos cautioned against reading too much into the setback.

The sheriff told Fox10 that his detectives have “other DNA evidence from the scene, that is more critical to me than DNA found two miles from the scene”.

“All of that will still be submitted for further analysis,” he said.

“You take a fingerprint, and you hope to match it right away. But that's not that easy.”

Nanos added that investigators recovered DNA from multiple individuals inside the home. Forensic teams now must “hope” they can “separate that” as testing continues.

With traditional database searches yielding no results, authorities are turning to a different tool.

An FBI official told Fox News Digital that investigators have now turned to investigative genetic genealogy, known as IGG, in the case.

IGG uses crime-scene DNA to search for potential relatives in public genealogy databases when traditional law enforcement systems, such as CODIS, return no matches.

Earlier Tuesday, the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed that the unknown male DNA profile recovered from a glove near Nancy's home did not generate any hits in CODIS. DNA collected inside her home also failed to match any profile in the national database.

“The DNA found at the property is being analyzed & further testing needs to be done as part of the investigation,” the sheriff's department said on X.

CeCe Moore, chief genetic genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, said she is confident the process will ultimately identify the source of the DNA.

“Thanks to the power of investigative genetic genealogy, it is just a matter of time now until they discover who that DNA belongs to and the investigators are able to pursue those leads and, hopefully, provide answers to Nancy's family,” she said.

As the investigation moves forward, Nanos has drawn a firm line on one issue. The Guthrie family is not under suspicion.

Amid online rumors and mounting speculation, authorities formally cleared all immediate relatives.

Speaking to Tucson's KOLD 13 News, Nanos said family members were ruled out “in the first few days” and have been “100 percent cooperative.”

“Not one single person in the family is a suspect,” Nanos said. “So I am telling everyone, effective today, you guys [media] need to knock it off, quit. People are hurting. They are victims. I am saying they are clear. We have cleared them.”

He later reiterated that position in a formal statement. “To be clear … the Guthrie family — to include all siblings and spouses — have been cleared as possible suspects in this case. The family has been nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case,” Nanos said. “To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel. The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple.”

For now, the sheriff says the focus remains unchanged.

“We're going to continue working this case, every minute of every day, and we will find her.”

He also issued a direct appeal. “And we will find you… to the individual doing this, let her go, just let her go. It will work out better for you in the long run, trust me.”

As the search enters another week, the uncertainty weighs heavily. But hope, however fragile, remains. For Nancy's family, every development carries the same quiet plea—bring Nancy back home, where she truly belongs.

"DtMF" rebounds for a third week atop the Global 200 and leads Global Excl. U.S. for the first time.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Bad Bunny's “DtMF” surges five spots back to No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200, adding a third frame atop the chart after it led for two weeks in January-February 2025. The track concurrently claims its first week at No. 1 on Billboard Global Excl. U.S.


	The superstar monopolizes the top five spots on the Global 200 and the top three on Global Excl. U.S. following his Super Bowl LX halftime show performance Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, Calif., with “DtMF” the closing song in the set.

	











	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.


	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.


	Here's a rundown of Bad Bunny's top five shutout on the Global 200, including the songs' worldwide totals and gains Feb. 6-12:

	













	Bad Bunny performed all five songs at the Super Bowl, with the top four from his 2025 album Debí Tirar Más Fotos; “Tití Me Preguntó” is from his 2022 LP Un Verano Sin Ti.


	“DtMF” hikes 8-1 on Global Excl. U.S. with 63.4 million streams (up 152%) and 4,000 sold (up 245%) outside the U.S. Bad Bunny's fifth and most recent Global 200 No. 1, the song becomes his fourth leader on Global Excl. U.S. Both totals mark the most among male soloists.


	“Baile Inolvidable” bounds 14-2 and “Nuevayol,” 19-3, both for new Global Excl. U.S. bests.


	Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” falls three places to No. 4 after eight weeks atop Global Excl. U.S. starting upon its debut last October and Djo's “End of Beginning” drops to No. 5 from its No. 2 peak.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated Feb. 21, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Feb. 18 (one day later than usual due to the Presidents' Day holiday in the United States Feb. 16). For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard's subscription-based service. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

The gulf between Stephen Colbert and CBS continued to widen last night, as Colbert claimed on The Late Show that the network's lawyers told him he could not broadcast an interview with Texas State Rep. James Talarico because of the FCC's equal-time rule, which typically exempts talk shows. “I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I couldn't mention me not having him on,” Colbert said. In a statement, the network denies the allegations, saying it was merely offering Colbert some helpful legal advice. 

“The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,” a statement from CBS said. “The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”

Talk shows have been exempt from the FCC's equal time rule since 2006, when Jay Leno hosted California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on The Tonight Show. That seemingly came to an end in January, when FCC Chair Brendan Carr reiterated his commitment to going after talk shows that criticize Trump because there aren't enough cranks on TV ranting about vaccines, trans people, and immigration. At the time, Carr said lawmakers “were worried that TV programmers would broadly take advantage of trying to claim they were bona fide news when they weren't. But if you're fake news, you're not going to qualify for the bona fide news exemption.” Carr has not yet officially invalidated the exception. Still, nevertheless, Colbert claims CBS is “unilaterally enforcing it as if he had.”

The only Democratic FCC commissioner, Anna Gomez, agreed, calling it “another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this Administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech.” 

“The FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes or to create a climate that chills free expression,” Gomez continued in a statement. “CBS is fully protected under the First Amendment to determine what interviews it airs, which makes its decision to yield to political pressure all the more disappointing.” 

Paramount Skydance has torpedoed its credibility in recent months, first by publicly firing Colbert and then by hiring every billionaire's favorite blogger, Bari Weiss, as the head of CBS News, while also paying Trump $16 million to settle a weak lawsuit against 60 Minutes amid the Paramount-Skydance merger. The FCC has also tanked its authority as an unbiased institution in the last year, with Carr attempting to silence television's loudest Trump critics by using the various mechanisms at his disposal, including strong-arming local carriers who need FCC approval for another monopolistic merger. We expect these types of flame-ups to continue until Colbert is booted from the airwaves this May.

As the Guthrie family faces an unthinkable stretch of uncertainty, they are holding tightly to one another and to hope. More than two weeks into the search for “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie's beloved mom, Nancy Guthrie, the family remains together, navigating each new development as it comes. 

Nancy, 84, was last seen on January 31 after spending the evening with family. She was reported missing the following morning when she did not attend church.

The pain has not eased, but neither has their determination. As the family continues to navigate each difficult day, another member has arrived in Arizona to stand beside them while the search for their matriarch grows more urgent.

TMZ now reports that Savannah's husband, Michael Feldman, has arrived in Tucson, Arizona, as the search for his mother-in-law, Nancy, enters its third week.

Feldman was spotted at the airport before quickly heading to a waiting vehicle. He did not make any public statements. His arrival comes during an emotionally draining period for the family as they continue to wait for answers.

Feldman's arrival came one day after authorities formally cleared all members of the Guthrie family as suspects in the case.

Amid speculation and online chatter surrounding the family's possible involvement, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos took a firm and public stance. The Guthrie family is not under suspicion.

Speaking to Tucson's KOLD 13 News, Nanos said relatives were ruled out “in the first few days” and have been “100 percent cooperative” throughout the investigation.

“Not one single person in the family is a suspect,” Nanos said. “So I am telling everyone, effective today, you guys [media] need to knock it off, quit. People are hurting. They are victims. I am saying they are clear. We have cleared them.”

He later reinforced that message in a formal statement.

“To be clear … the Guthrie family — to include all siblings and spouses — have been cleared as possible suspects in this case. The family has been nothing but cooperative and gracious, and are victims in this case,” Nanos said. “To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel. The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple.”

An FBI official told Fox News Digital that investigative genetic genealogy, known as IGG, is now being used in the Nancy Guthrie case.

IGG is a forensic technique that analyzes crime scene DNA to identify possible relatives through public genealogy databases when traditional law enforcement systems, such as CODIS, return no matches.

Earlier Tuesday, the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed that an unknown male DNA profile found on a glove two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home did not generate any hits in CODIS. 

DNA recovered from inside her home also produced no matches, according to the sheriff's department.

“The DNA found at the property is being analyzed & further testing needs to be done as part of the investigation,” the sheriff's department said on X.

CeCe Moore, chief genetic genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, told Fox News Digital she is confident IGG will ultimately identify the source of the DNA.

“Thanks to the power of investigative genetic genealogy, it is just a matter of time now until they discover who that DNA belongs to and the investigators are able to pursue those leads and, hopefully, provide answers to Nancy's family,” she said.

Savannah is remaining close to her family as the search for her mother continues.

A source told People that the “Today” co-anchor is “devastated” by Nancy's disappearance.

“This has been an incredibly emotional and stressful time for her and her family. They're leaning on one another for support while hoping for answers,” the source said.

In a separate interview with NBC News, Nanos explained why he felt it was important to defend the family publicly.

“Because sometimes we forget we're human and we hurt, and kindness matters. It is every cop's duty to stand up and be that voice for our victims. I'm not going to sit in silence when others are attacking the innocent. Isn't that what the badge represents?”

For now, Feldman's arrival reflects the family's approach from the start. They are staying together, holding onto hope, and waiting for answers.

The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative report for 2025 showed that of the top 100 films at the box office, only nine were directed by women. In the 19 years that the study has been conducted, only three women had directed three or more films to be represented on that list: Anne Fletcher, Lana Wachowski, and Greta Gerwig.

You can now add one more woman to that list: Emerald Fennell. 

Fennell's “Wuthering Heights” this weekend opened to $88.5 million over the four-day weekend ($82 million in three days), all against a production budget of $80 million (before marketing costs). It's not exactly a record-breaker, as it's behind the domestic opening for plenty of other female-directed films, and it's #14 in terms of 4-day openings over Presidents' Day weekend. It even opened a little soft compared to some projections, which originally had “Wuthering Heights” reaching $40 million or even $50 million domestic before the weekend. It is however still a boon for Warner Bros., which now has had nine straight movies open to #1 dating back to last year (suddenly a lot is riding on Maggie Gyllenhaal's “The Bride!”).

But between her debut “Promising Young Woman” ($18.8 million) and “Saltburn” ($21 million), Fennell now has three movies that will crack the Top 100 on that Annenberg Inclusion Initiative report in a year, and it puts her in the conversation among some of the other top-performing female directors at the box office of all time. 

 










“Wuthering Heights” opened above the openings for last year's “Freakier Friday” from Nisha Ganatra ($149.2 million cumulative) and Emma Tammi's “Five Nights at Freddy's 2” ($238.1 million cumulative) and it has already in four days surpassed the overall gross of Nia DaCosta's “28 Days Later: The Bone Temple” ($56.8 million) and Chloé Zhao's “Hamnet” ($79.4 million). We just wrote about how well that one has done internationally, so Warner Bros. has a lot to be excited about.

Fennell has a ways to go before she reaches the Gerwig tier, which is technically a tier of one. Gerwig's “Barbie” grossed $1.4 billion for Warner Bros., but even Gerwig's film “Little Women,” another romantic period drama based on classic literature, grossed $220 million worldwide. “Wuthering Heights” could easily get into that ballpark. 

“Wuthering Heights” very likely could've gone the Netflix route, accepting a higher budget in exchange for being a streaming-only release, but the film landed at Warner Bros. because Fennell wanted theatrical, and that gambit seems to have paid off. It may have done very well on Netflix and had an even bigger reach, but we wouldn't be talking about Fennell's ability to produce box office hits.

Instead, it adds another feather to the cap of Warner Bros. entrusting filmmakers with a vision to go big and do what they want (“Wuthering Heights” is a very big film), it shows that Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi could be considered movie stars capable of opening a film, and it will surely give Fennell another bite at the apple for whatever she wants to make as her fourth feature.

 










Let's hope she pushes again for another theatrical release for that one.

Spotify's The Ringer is taking a deep dive into tinfoil-hat territory with “Wait a Second…,” a new video podcast hosted by writer and podcaster Jason Concepcion and featuring The Ringer's Tyler Parker as co-host.


	“Wait a Second…” premieres Feb. 19 on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube and other platforms. It will be released weekly on Thursdays. In each episode, Concepcion and Parker will unpack a bizarre news item or conspiracy theory that “we can't stop talking about” and unpack “what actually happened, why it captured public attention and what it reveals about the society we live in,” per The Ringer. “The show treats these stories with genuine curiosity and intellectual rigor, while also embracing the absurdity and accidental comedy that make them spread in the first place.”

	“It's a dark and twisted world, and we're here to try and make sense of it,” Concepcion says in the podcast's trailer. “We're exploring the grim rabbit holes and weird webs that connect our modern world. Each week, my co-host Tyler Parker and will tackle the kind of stories that make you say ‘What the fuck?!'”

	











	The podcast is Concepcion's first project with Bill Simmons' The Ringer, which was acquired by Spotify in 2020, in five years. 


	Concepcion is a screenwriter and pop culture and sports commentator. He is the co-producer and co-host of “The Official Game of Thrones Podcast: House of the Dragon” with Greta Johnson for HBO, and hosts weekly pop-culture show “X-Ray Vision” with Rosie Knight. He has also hosted official companion podcasts for “Foundation” (Apple TV) and “3 Body Problem” (Netflix). Previously a senior creative at The Ringer, Concepcion co-hosted podcasts “Talk the Thrones” and “Binge Mode.” In 2019, he won a Sports Emmy for digital series “NBA Desktop.”


	Parker, a staff writer at The Ringer, co-created series including “Takehunter” and “The Parker Tyles Show.” He also has been a regular contributor to podcasts such as “The Ringer NBA Show” and “The Hottest Take.”

Lara Trump revealed her father-in-law President Donald Trump has a speech he's ready to give at the “right time” on extraterrestrial life.

Trump shared that intel during a podcast interview with New York Post reporter Miranda Devine on Wednesday, less than a week after ex-President Barack Obama caused a stir when he said UFOs are “real.” Based on what Lara Trump said, the commander-in-chief is itching to make his own big announcements on aliens too.

“Do you think he's about to make an announcement on UFOs? Because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president.

“What's funny is, we've kind of asked my father-in-law about this because we're like, ‘Well, what do you know?' Miranda, we all want to know!” Trump said. “And he played a little coy with us. and so that of course led us to believe — Eric [Trump] and I were like ‘Oh my gosh, if he won't even like fully tell us, maybe there's more to it.'”

She continued:

And then I have just heard just kind of around — I think he's actually said it, I think my father-in-law actually said it — that there is some speech that I guess at the right time, and I don't know when the right time is, he's gonna break out and talk about [it]. And it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak.

Trump said on a personal level she believes it would be “pretty wild” if humans were the only living creatures, considering the “vastness” of the universe. She also told Devine that the president has talked “a little different” about the topic of UFOs than others, which leads her to believe there's more President Trump knows about it than he's letting on.

“I don't have any information, I feel like there might be information out there, and hopefully it's going to be able to be told to us very soon, we'll see,” Lara Trump added.

Her answer comes after Obama said last weekend that ETs aren't just Stephen Spielberg characters.

“They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,” Obama told progressive podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen.

“There's no underground facility,” he continued, adding, “unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States.”

That got a fair amount of attention on X and elsewhere online.  And the topic of aliens has been in the news more in recent years, even before Obama and Lara Trump spoke out.

Retired Maj. David Grusch told the House Oversight Committee's national security subcommittee in 2023 “that he had been denied access to some government UFO programs but that he knows the ‘exact locations' of UAPs in U.S. possession,” NPR reported. 

“Grusch also alleged that the U.S. has retrieved ‘non-human' biological matter from the pilots of the crafts,” the report said.

And just last summer, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) told Joe Rogan that she has seen evidence of “interdimensional beings.”

Netflix has announced new animated series “Bass X Machina” for the Halloween season, starring Oscar, Emmy, and Tony Award nominee Brian Tyree Henry (Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire).

“Bass X Machina” will debut on Netflix on October 6, 2026.

The series is set “in a lawless Steampunk West overrun by brutal outlaws, machines, and supernatural terrors, a father is forced to become judge, jury, and executioner—knowing that every act of justice meant to protect his family may ultimately cost him the very people he's fighting to save.”

Joining Brian Tyree Henry, who plays Bass and also executive produces, in the voice cast are Janelle Monáe (Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Hidden Figures) as Glory, Tati Gabrielle (The Last of Us, YOU) as Dana, Cree Summer (Voltron: Legendary Defender, Sabrina: The Animated Series) as Ahni, Chaske Spencer (Teacup, The Twilight Saga) as Lighthorse, Currie Graham (Reacher, Assault on Precinct 13) as Rivenbark, and Starletta DuPois (One Battle After Another, The Notebook, Big Momma's House) as Etta.

The first look images give a closer look at Henry's character, but not much else. It remains unclear just what supernatural terrors will await.

The animation for “Bass x Machina” will be done by South Korea's Studio Mir. The series will also feature original music by Roman GianArthur and Nate Wonder at Wondaland.

“Bass X Machina” will join Netflix's substantial animation slate, which includes Emmy-winning “Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft” and “Devil May Cry.”

Whether the temperatures are dropping outside or you're placing ice cube trays in the freezer, everyone knows that once water drops to 0°C (32°F), it will freeze.

This is because, as the heat energy leaves the water, the atoms and molecules slow down and condense closer together. Maxim Lavrentovich is an Assistant Professor of Theoretical Biophysics at the University of Tennessee, and he explained what is happening:

“Whether in plants and animals or rocks, foams and ice crystals, the intricate patterns that happen in nature come down to what's happening at the level of atoms and molecules. When water freezes, its molecules begin clustering together. Water molecules have a particular bent shape that causes them to stack into clusters shaped like hexagons as they freeze.”

It is this crystalline pattern that allows all water (with a few odd exceptions) to freeze at the set temperature.

This is not the case for all materials. Molecules of oil, for example, do not form the same clean crystalline shapes as the temperature goes down.

This means that, unlike water, most oils do not freeze at a set point. Instead, they will become more and more viscous the colder they get. Even when oil is so cold that it seems solid, it is still not frozen in the same way that water is.

The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign explains what is happening in these cases:

“Eventually, if you get it cold enough, the oil will seem to be quite solid, as the molecules lose the energy needed to move around. In that sense, you can say that oil does in fact freeze, but it has no sharply defined freezing point, like water. Glass is similar, in that it gets soft and eventually quite fluid as it is heated, but there is no one sharp melting temperature. The molecules get stuck when cold, but not in any simple regular arrangement.”

This is much more than just an interesting science fact that could win you points on trivia night. Most people experience the results of oil's properties on a daily basis.

Your car engine (and millions of other products that require lubrication) uses oil to reduce friction. If oil froze in the same way that water does, when the temperatures outside hit a certain point, trying to start your car would be impossible, as the oil would freeze it up.

Of course, in very cold weather, the oil does become thicker and more viscous, which means your car's engine has to work harder to get things moving than it would in hot weather. This can even result in slight damage to the internal parts of the engine, especially if you start your vehicle and immediately start driving aggressively.

Shutterstock

Fortunately, modern engines heat up quickly and bring the temperature of the oil up to a safe level. It is, however, recommended that you let your car run for a minute before driving in extremely cold temperatures, and for the first several miles of driving, you accelerate more slowly than normal to help minimize any negative impact.

The science behind oil and how it reacts to temperature is incredible.

On October 6, 1970, the deep-sea drilling vessel Glomar Challenger returned to port in Lisbon, Portugal, bearing a cargo that would revise history. During its 54-day voyage, the Challenger had punched 28 holes into the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The recovered cores pointed toward a startling conclusion: About 6 million years ago, the sea had turned into a desert: a vast, barren, salt-filled bowl more than two kilometers [1.2 miles] deep. Half a million years after that, the Atlantic Ocean had burst through what is now the Strait of Gibraltar and unleashed the largest flood in history.

Kenneth Hsü, an oceanographer who was one of the two lead scientists on the Challenger expedition, imagined the scene vividly in the December 1972 issue of Scientific American:

"Cascading at a rate of 10,000 cubic miles per year, the Gibraltar Falls would have been 100 times bigger than Victoria Falls and 1,000 times more so than Niagara.… What a spectacle it must have been for the African ape-men, if any were lured by the thunderous roar."

—The Red Sea experienced 'one of the most extreme environmental events on Earth' 6 million years ago

—Epic 11-foot-tall sea level rise drove Vikings out of Greenland

—Colossal underwater canyon discovered near seamount deep in the Mediterranean Sea

The catastrophe story was a hit: David Attenborough filmed a documentary about it, and Gibraltar even issued a 5-pence stamp portraying the "3,000-metre waterfall." The two hypotheses — first, that the Mediterranean Sea became landlocked during a half-million-year period known as the Messinian salinity crisis, and second, that it was restored by a cataclysmic deluge through the Strait of Gibraltar, dubbed the Zanclean flood — have been conventional wisdom among geologists for more than 50 years.

However, fresh doubts have arisen recently about every part of this story, from the mega-desert to the mega-Niagara. Many geologists have argued for a much briefer desiccation followed by a far more gradual refilling of the Mediterranean. Some think that the Mediterranean never completely disconnected from the Atlantic at all. "The idea of a megaflood, and the data that supports it, are mostly flawed," says Guillermo Booth Rea of the University of Granada in Spain.

The most startling recent twist is that the floodway, if there was one, may not have been anywhere near the present-day Strait of Gibraltar, which separates southern Spain from Morocco. For 50 years, new research suggests, we have been looking for signs of a megaflood in the wrong place.

 




In the present-day Mediterranean, about three times more water is lost every year to evaporation than is recaptured from rainfall and rivers. The Atlantic makes up for the difference, supplying a steady west-to-east current of seawater through the Strait of Gibraltar. As the sea's water evaporates, the remaining water becomes saltier and denser and sinks to the bottom. The dense water then flows back out of the strait, east to west, underneath the less dense inbound water. This outflow prevents salt from accumulating in the Mediterranean.

But what would happen if the strait were constricted, or shut off entirely? Given the hugely negative budget of fresh water, "sea level" in the Mediterranean Sea would drop rapidly, by as much as a kilometer in 2,000 years. Such a scenario would have seemed like science fiction until the Glomar Challenger's 1970 expedition.

At the first drill site, the Challenger's drill bit jammed on a very hard layer 200 meters below the bottom of the sea. The next day, Hsü and his co-lead scientist, William Ryan of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, found out why. "It brought up buckets full of gravel," Ryan says.

Seafloors don't often contain beds of gravel, and when they do, it is usually continental rocks washed down from the adjacent land. But this gravel had marine fossils and rock, mixed with crystals of gypsum. Geologists call gypsum an "evaporite," because in the present-day world it forms in evaporating shallow bodies of water — as in the Dead Sea, for example. The implication was startling. "When Ken held up the gypsum crystals, he turned to me and asked, 'Do you think the Mediterranean dried out?'" Ryan remembers.

The same story was repeated at every stop. Ryan and Hsü found other evaporites like halite (sodium chloride, aka table salt). Oxygen isotopes in seashells embedded in the gravel suggested that these unlucky animals had lived in a brine from which 90 percent of the original water had evaporated. Hsü and Ryan also gathered evidence that the colliding of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates had lifted up the land on both ends of the Mediterranean Sea, closing its former connection with the Indian Ocean and narrowing the connection with the Atlantic Ocean.

 




The clinching piece of evidence came to light after the Challenger mission had ended. Other geologists discovered what appear to be buried ancient beds of several rivers that flow into the Mediterranean, particularly the Nile and the Rhône. It looked as if those rivers once emptied into the Mediterranean at least a kilometer below their present outlets — something that would be possible only if the sea level of the Mediterranean had been a kilometer [0.6 miles] below the global sea level at some point in the past.

In 1973, a meeting in Utrecht, Netherlands, established the desiccation model as the consensus theory. But a considerable amount of dissent has emerged in the last 20 years. "In the 1970s, the desiccation people won the debate," says Wout Krijgsman of Utrecht University, "but there are several aspects it cannot really explain."

In part, the dissent reflects an improved understanding of what was occurring on Earth and in the area 6 million years ago. Since 1973, the story told by rocks, core samples and seismic soundings — and, increasingly, by computer simulations — has become more detailed and more dynamic, with changing shorelines, land bridges and volcanoes, and repeated episodes of climate change.

Also, there were fundamental problems with the desiccation hypothesis to begin with. Take the evaporites, for example: They do not have to form via evaporation, says sedimentologist and stratigrapher Vinicio Manzi of the University of Parma in Italy. They can also form by precipitation from a sufficiently concentrated brine. This can happen underwater, so there is no need to posit that the Mediterranean went bone dry.

And the buried riverbeds? Those, too, Manzi and his colleagues can explain: The sinking of briny water can produce downhill currents ("dense shelf water cascading," in geology lingo) sufficiently strong to scour out a canyon.

The idea of a single evaporation event also faces a mathematical problem: The existing salt deposit is too big to be explained by a single evaporation event. It represents about 5 percent of the salt in the world's oceans (and may have originally been 7 to 10 percent). To collect that much salt, the Mediterranean would have had to empty and refill about 10 times.

In fact, evidence from salt deposits in Sicily suggests something like that actually happened. There, gypsum beds alternate with shale beds that are rich in organic material and could have formed in periods when the gateway between the Atlantic and Mediterranean was open. There are 16 beds in all, with ages spaced about 23,000 years apart.

This periodicity is well known to geologists: It's the time it takes for Earth's axis (like a wobbly top) to trace one complete circle. And it correlates with changes in climate and ancient sea levels the world over. With the presumptive Gibraltar gateway being so shallow during this period, sea level fluctuations due to this "precessional cycle" could have repeatedly opened and closed the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic.

 




That period of gypsum formation is now called Stage 1 of the salinity crisis. Stage 2 was a relatively brief 50,000-year period when (in the majority opinion) the gateway slammed entirely shut, the sea level in the Mediterranean plummeted, and huge deposits of halite (sodium chloride) precipitated out from the seawater. However, Manzi's group strongly dissents, arguing that the Gibraltar gateway remained open, but shallowed to such an extent that the water flowed through it in one direction only — in but not out — resulting in a runaway buildup of salt.

Even for adherents of the majority view, Stage 2 is not as simple as it seems. Data from chlorine isotopes suggest that the drawdown was not uniform. At its lowest point, in the western Mediterranean, sea level was 800 meters below its present level, while east of present-day Sicily it was at least twice as deep as that. If so, the east and west portions must have been separated by a land bridge. Indeed, there is evidence of African animals crossing over to Europe during this time.

The last 200,000 years of the salinity crisis, called Stage 3, have been the most puzzling of all. The halite stopped precipitating and there is evidence for a variety of sea levels in the Mediterranean during this time. Widespread fossils of a shrimp-like animal called an ostracod suggest that the waters became much less salty, so that the Mediterranean was a sea-sized lake (and indeed, this stage is sometimes called the Lago-Mare stage). But if the gateway to the Atlantic was still closed, then where did the fresher water come from?

A 2025 paper by Daniel García-Castellanos of the Spanish National Research Council helps solve the puzzle. Using a computer to model erosion, he argues that the Mediterranean was gradually refilling during Stage 3. The ostracods provide a clue to the source. They originated from the area of the present-day Black and Caspian Seas, which back then were connected to each other, but not to the Mediterranean.

With the shores of the Mediterranean being so newly exposed and so steep, its edges would have rapidly eroded toward today's Black Sea, which at that time was a much larger freshwater lake called the Paratethys. The first connection between them could have been established at this time. If so, the Mediterranean began to receive waters from rivers like the Volga, the Don and the Danube, which had previously been unavailable. The ostracods got a new home, and the Mediterranean got a vast new supply of water, which according to the computer simulation raised its surface to within 300 meters of its current level.

According Krijgsman, this interpretation conveniently reconciles the conflicting evidence. "In the fight between a desiccated and full Mediterranean," says Krijgsman, García-Castellanos' paper does the job "if you want to sit in the middle and give everyone credit for their observations."

The literature on the Messinian salinity crisis is voluminous, and yet one thing is curiously absent. There is surprisingly little direct evidence of the megaflood that supposedly ended the crisis. Hsü's original Scientific American article devotes only half a page to it and adduces little in the way of evidence. Fifty years later, Ryan wrote a 100-page retrospective; only three pages are about the megaflood. Shouldn't this extraordinary flood have left very clear scars?

The current evidence is ambiguous at best. Geologists have found submerged flood-like deposits off Malta — but that's a long way from Gibraltar, the putative source of the flood. Also, if the Atlantic drained into a nearly empty Mediterranean basin, then sea levels around the world should have dropped by about nine meters — an anti-flood to pay for the Mediterranean flood. There is no sign that this happened, says García-Castellanos.

A recent deep-sea drilling expedition to the Strait of Gibraltar turned up more questions than answers. In December 2023, the JOIDES Resolution — heir to the Glomar Challenger — revisited the Alboran Sea immediately to the east of the Strait of Gibraltar. If the strait is the door to the Mediterranean, then the Alboran Sea is the vestibule. Any megaflood that passed through the Strait of Gibraltar would have passed also through the Alboran basin. But Rachel Flecker of the University of Bristol, England, co-leader of the expedition, says they found no traces of the flood in the cores they collected.

While still on board the ship, she wrote that the cores were "exquisitely laminated in a variety of colors. This incredibly fine lamination requires very quiet, low energy conditions." Exactly the opposite of a megaflood. Final results have not been published yet, but Flecker reports also that they found no salt layer and no evidence that the salinity crisis had ever touched the Alboran Sea.

"The connection between the Atlantic and Mediterranean before and during the Messinian salinity crisis wasn't through Gibraltar," she concludes.

 




How can this be? "A feature that you must take into account, and nearly nobody does, is that the present physiography of the Mediterranean is very different from the Messinian one," says Booth Rea. "Large basins have opened since, like the Tyrrhenian; other regions have emerged, like Sicily." One possibility, he suggested, is that the gateway was somewhere to the east, through a volcanic arc of islands that once connected Africa to the Balearic Islands. Other possibilities include channels through Spain or Morocco, which are above sea level now but were underwater as recently as 7 million years ago.

Regardless of how it happened, this modern view of the story holds lessons: It emphasizes the power not of dramatic events but of small changes. "Salt giants" — that is, massive salt deposits like the one underneath the Mediterranean — have formed at other times in Earth's history, when basins were trapped between two tectonic plates. Their effects on climate and biodiversity have likely been huge: In this event, 89 percent of exclusively Mediterranean marine species died out.

And a slight shallowing of the Strait of Gibraltar (or whatever the true gateway was) might be all that was needed to trigger these vast changes. "In some sense, this is more terrifying," says Manzi, because it shows that "you can reach extreme conditions without extreme events."

More from The Sun

A MASSIVE UFO is hiding in plain sight in a secret overseas location, according to bombshell claims by a United States congressman.

Rep Eric Burlison said on Monday that the facility is “guarded like it's some kind of commodity” and has previously claimed that Donald Trump has been “fully briefed” on the existence of aliens.

He added that the US president has also been made aware of alien-human hybrids allegedly living on Earth today.

The lawmaker claims that an entire building has had to be built around the immovable flying saucer, which theorists believe to be on the outskirts of Seoul, South Korea.

Investigative journalist Ross Coulthart made the original claim that the United States had possession of the extraterrestrial craft in an interview on the Project Unit Podcast last November.

Several UFO blogs and satellite sleuths have since pointed to the mysterious South Korean structure – which sits atop a mountain and is roughly 270 feet in diameter.

It is rumored to house a massive crashed or landed extraterrestrial craft that was reportedly too large to transport, leading to a building being constructed around it for concealment.

But a South Korean researcher has disputed the claims, saying the facility dates back to the 1970s and has no connection to UFOs.

He added that many such aviation installations exist across the country.

Joe Rogan and other prominent podcasters have popularised the claims, which have gained notoriety in the UFO/UAP – Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena – communities as the alleged “Coulthart UFO/UAP Site”.

Now Burlison, who did not confirm that he was referring to that location, says bureaucratic hurdles are making it difficult to ratify the theory. 

The lawmaker acknowledged that he had no first-hand proof, sharing that the information had been cobbled together from accounts he has heard from government and non-official sources.

“I'm not going to mention the country because I heard of it inside of a closed setting, and I want to protect my classification level,” Burlison said, during an interview on Newsmax's Finnerty.

He added that the object is “not in the facility that's been widely reported in the news” and pushed back on speculation about its location.

Burlison also blasted the “insurmountable” task of accessing UAP-related sites near his Washington DC office.

He pointed the finger at congressional bureaucracy and claimed that committees “love turning each other down”.

But despite the barriers Burlison is committed to finding evidence of extraterrestrial life.

He said: “If I come under any hard evidence, whether it's physical or video evidence that is absolutely definitive, I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe.”

He added that no government has a right to withhold such information from its citizens.

Burlison has previously been granted access to secure locations across the US, such as the infamous Area 51, which have decade-old ties to UFOs and secretive government projects.

Despite the US government and Pentagon officially denying that proof of alien life has been recovered, Congress has heard whistleblowers' claims about secret state programs.

Burlison said that Trump has been informed of UFOs recovered by the military since the 1940s and alien life on Earth.

Former President Barack Obama made headlines this week when he made the bombshell claim that “aliens are real”.

He said: “They're real but I haven't seen them.

“They're not being kept in Area 51. There's no underground facility.”

Before he joked: “Unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

Obama later posted a clarifying statement on his Instagram, writing: “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there.

“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”

Former President Barack Obama recently said he believes aliens are real — but clarified that he has never seen one and does not believe they are being held at Area 51.

In a Feb. 15 Instagram post, Obama expanded on earlier podcast comments, saying that “the odds are good there's life out there,” citing the vastness of the universe. However, he added that he believes the chances Earth has been visited by aliens are slim.

That leaves a lingering question: Where are the aliens?

The National UFO Reporting Center collects reports of unexplained flying objects and unidentified anomalous phenomena for investigation. Since its founding in 1974, the organization says it has processed more than 180,000 reports nationwide.

In New York state alone, the center has logged 6,309 UFO and UAP sighting reports.

The earliest reported New York sighting dates back to 1790 in Carlisle.

According to the database, the unnamed witness — whose account was submitted in 2007 — described seeing what was believed to be a meteor while playing the fiddle outside on a summer night.

“The meteor as I shall now call it, was about 300 yards long in a serpentine shape, excepting the head which resembled the root of a tree plucked up by force,” the witness wrote. “It had no appearance of a neck, the body was thick as a bullock, tapering off like a serpent at the end of the tail.”

The most recent report was filed Feb. 5 in Poughkeepsie. The witness said they saw three bright lights forming what appeared to be a “V-shaped craft” while driving near the Route 44/55 exit to the Hudson Bridge on Route 9. No explanation was listed in the report.

While thousands of sightings have been reported in New York, many have later been attributed to planets, stars, aircraft or even Chinese lanterns.

For now, though, the question of where the aliens are remains unanswered.

More than six years after Jeffrey Epstein died in a federal jail cell, the US government remains engaged in a sweeping cover-up. Millions of documents related to Epstein's criminal enterprise remain unreleased. Charging records from the 2008 Florida case and the 2019 federal prosecution are still being withheld. The Department of Justice has refused to unredact the names of Epstein's associates and co-conspirators, in defiance of the law governing the document release. Even the so-called “unredacted” files remain inaccessible to the public and are viewable only by a small number of members of Congress, where they are still redacted in any case.

At the same time, the Justice Department claims it has found no evidence of a broader criminal network and has brought forward not a single new charge, despite documentary proof that Epstein continued to operate internationally after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

Under these conditions, the major US newspapers have intervened to contain growing mass anger over the Epstein cover-up. In a coordinated fashion, the New York Times and the Washington Post have sought to recast mounting outrage over Epstein's crimes and his protection by the ruling class as a problem of “conspiracy theories,” thereby shielding the financial oligarchy and the police institutions that covered up his criminality.

A recent New York Times article in its Epstein series, “The Epstein Files and the Hidden World of an Unaccountable Elite,” published February 12, provides a textbook example of this method.

The article, written by Robert Draper, begins with admissions that demolish years of official denials. “In unsparing detail,” Draper writes, “the documents lay bare the once-furtive activities of an unaccountable elite, largely made up of rich and powerful men from business, politics, academia and show business.” The files, he continues, “tell a story of a heinous criminal given a free ride by the ruling class in which he dwelled.”

The Times situates Epstein's impunity within the broader social crisis produced by American capitalism, noting that his “Caligula-like antics” unfolded amid “rising populist anger and ever-growing inequality,” the collapse of manufacturing, and the subprime mortgage crisis that cost millions of workers their homes. It catalogs Epstein's documented relationships with former President Bill Clinton, billionaires such as Elon Musk, senior financiers, royalty and political operatives across the globe.

Having established this factual record, however, the article abruptly reverses course. The same revelations, the Times claims, “have done nothing to quiet the conspiracy theories that his behavior spawned,” instead fueling “feverish new speculation with little or no factual basis.”

Among the supposed “conspiracies” is Epstein's death in federal custody, which has been accepted uncritically by the media as a suicide. Newly released video logs from the Metropolitan Correctional Center show an unaccounted-for figure moving toward Epstein's cell on the night of his death. Rather than grappling with the implications of this evidence, the Times dismisses doubts as the work of “internet sleuths,” reiterating the official ruling, which no one believes, of suicide.

This framing collapses under minimal scrutiny. As reported by CBS News, both the FBI and the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General had already logged the unidentified orange-clad figure in their internal timelines years ago, while refusing to disclose this publicly. Senior officials repeatedly suggested that no one approached Epstein's cell. Dan Bongino, then in FBI leadership, explicitly stated that the footage confirmed no one else entered the cell block. That claim is now demonstrably false.

More than six years after Epstein's death, the government has still failed to identify the alleged ligature used in the supposed suicide. The breakdown of surveillance cameras, guard staffing, recordkeeping and evidence preservation has never been explained. Forensic doubts raised by Dr. Michael Baden, who stated that Epstein's neck injuries were “extremely unusual in suicidal hangings” and consistent with homicidal strangulation, have been brushed aside.

Another “conspiracy” the Times identified is Epstein's influence among the ruling class in the US and internationally. Despite documenting Epstein's “remarkable web of connections,” the Times nevertheless insists that his “influence on American policymaking was negligible.” His associates, the paper claims, were “farther down the food chain,” and “notably absent” were prosecutors, judges or law enforcement officials who could have protected him.

This argument collapses under the Times' own reporting. Within 24 hours, the paper documented a “friendly, and transactional” relationship between Epstein and Thorbjørn Jagland, a former prime minister of Norway and head of the Nobel Committee, a relationship that has since led to criminal corruption charges in Norway. The Times also reported on the resignation of Kathryn Ruemmler, Goldman Sachs' top lawyer and a former Obama White House counsel, after documents revealed she advised Epstein on managing media scrutiny and his response to sex crime allegations while receiving gifts, travel and career assistance.

Taken together with the resignation of Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the billionaire head of DP World, the picture is unmistakable. Epstein maintained intimate, transactional relationships with senior government officials, global financiers and corporate legal architects long after his 2008 conviction. That the New York Times can document these relationships while asserting that Epstein's influence was “negligible” exposes the political function of the “conspiracy theory” smear.

In its February 13 article, “Conspiracy Theories Only Flourish With More Epstein Evidence,” the Times escalates its effort to contain the fallout from the Epstein files by deploying a false equivalence, blaming both the “right” and the “left” for spreading “conspiracy theories.” While right-wing figures are cited for advancing grotesque fantasies, the Times claims that left-leaning users have promoted conspiracies by accusing the Trump administration of covering up Epstein's crimes and death in order to protect the president. 

The paper writes, “Left-leaning accounts circulated different theories, often accusing the Trump administration of having a hand in Mr. Epstein's death or of covering up his misdeeds to protect the president.”

It is, in fact, not a conspiracy theory to state that the Trump administration is engaged in a cover-up. It is an objective fact, demonstrated by the administration's own actions. The Trump administration has redacted Trump's name and image from released materials, withheld documents placing him in contact with Epstein during periods of investigation, and allowed Trump to falsely claim the files exonerate him. Trump himself is named in tips to the FBI as a participant in sexual assault alongside Epstein. To describe accusations of a cover-up as “conspiracy theories” requires ignoring the documentary record. 

Over the weekend, the Washington Post escalated the “conspiracy theory” smear by conflating exposure of the criminal ruling class with “antisemtism.” In an article titled, “How the Epstein files are fueling antisemitic conspiracy theories,” the Washington Post writes:

Denunciations of out-of-touch elites and the ‘money power' are a recurring feature of American politics. But in response to the Epstein files, antiestablishment voices have advanced the claim that Jewish networks and interests are corrupting American society.

Antisemitic slanders such as the medieval blood libel and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion are reactionary lies. But the existence of such lies has nothing to do with the extensive documentary evidence that Epstein maintained close relationships with senior figures in the Israeli state and intelligence apparatus.

The Post's method is to shift the axis of discussion from what is true to what is offensive, thereby immunizing state actors and intelligence agencies from accountability.

The paper cites grotesque statements by right-wing figures and then asserts guilt by association, extending the antisemitism charge to critics who have pointed to Epstein's documented ties to Israeli officials. For the Post, Matthew Schmitz, editor of the right-wing Compact, wrote: 

Progressive influencers got in on the act. Ana Kasparian, the host of a popular left-wing online news show, described Epstein's network as a “pedophile ring/Israeli blackmail operation.” The month before, she asked an Israeli interlocutor, “Why are you monsters always slaughtering innocent children and shaking us down for money?” Briahna Joy Gray, former press secretary for Bernie Sanders, called Epstein's network a “ring of billionaire pedophiles with ties to Mossad” engaging in “full-on blackmail.”

This paragraph performs the core maneuver of the Post's article. Evidence that Epstein maintained relationships with senior Israeli officials, facilitated covert diplomacy or operated within intelligence-adjacent networks is not antisemitic, any more than opposition to the genocide in Gaza is. It is a matter of record reported by investigative outlets and corroborated by released documents. 

Reporting by Drop Site News shows that Epstein facilitated back-channel diplomacy involving former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US officials during the Syrian civil war. Leaked emails show Epstein advising Barak, arranging meetings, sharing intelligence-adjacent information and pressing for US military intervention against Iran and Syria. These are matters of state policy and intelligence operations, not religious identity.

To describe such reporting as antisemitic is itself a blatant slander. States are not religions. Intelligence agencies are not peoples. Exposing covert diplomacy, blackmail networks and imperialist maneuvering is not an attack on Jewish people. It is an exposure of the criminal ruling class.

That the Washington Post advances this smear is not accidental. The paper is owned by Jeff Bezos, has recently laid off hundreds of workers, functions as a long-standing conduit for US intelligence agencies and has played a central role in downplaying Israel's genocide in Gaza while advocating expanded military confrontation with Russia and China. Its attack on alleged antisemitism is a continuation of the Biden administration's campaign to criminalize opposition to US imperialism and suppress student protests against the slaughter in Gaza.Taken together, the interventions by the New York Times and the Washington Post reveal a coordinated strategy to contain the Epstein revelations and protect the ruling class. Where the Times deploys the language of “conspiracy theory” to pathologize demands for accountability, the Post escalates to the antisemitism smear to shut down investigation into state and intelligence connections altogether. In both cases, the aim is the same: to sever documented facts from their political implications, delegitimize opposition and shield the institutions of wealth, intelligence and imperialist power that enabled Epstein's crimes and continue to block justice.
