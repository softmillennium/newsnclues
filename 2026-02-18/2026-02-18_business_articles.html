                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American tech companies should "worry a little bit" about the subsidies their Chinese competitors receive from their government in the AI race, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC. But, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India, he also said: "I do think we always have to think about, maybe even worry a little bit about Chinese subsidies." Chinese AI companies have been supported by their government with measures such as a multi-billion-dollar national investment fund and vouchers for cheaper energy for their computing needs. Smith's warning comes after Chinese firms released a slew of models over the past two weeks, and their lower-cost AI models could be attractive in developing nations. Smith said subsidies from Beijing to Chinese companies were "the fundamental approach that China successfully took to disrupt the telecommunications market," when state money and support helped companies like Huawei and ZTE expand. European companies like Ericsson and Nokia were thrown on the defensive," Smith added. Smith said data centers from Chinese firms Huawei and Alibaba exist around the world and "it will not be difficult for China to subsidize those." "I think for the rest of us, we have to compete with that, and we have to be good at competing with that, with the support of our governments," Smith said. CNBC approached Alibaba and Huawei for comment about whether they have accepted Chinese state subsidies but had not received a response as this article went live. Alibaba's cloud computing division, through which it sells its AI services, operates globally. But outside China, it doesn't always build data centers, instead partnering with other infrastructure players. Cities across the country, from Shanghai to the tech hub of Shenzhen, have offered "vouchers" to reduce the cost for companies looking to rent computing power. Cheap energy has been another advantage for Chinese companies that are trying to build out the power-hungry infrastructure needed to train and run AI models. Microsoft on Wednesday said it was on pace to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring AI to developing countries in the "Global South," which includes investments in infrastructure and reskilling. Rory Green, TS Lombard's chief China economist, told CNBC this week that a "China tech sphere" could easily form in developing countries. "For these economies, I think the choice is fairly simple, and you could see easily a world where maybe most of the world's population is running on a Chinese tech stack in five to 10 years' time," Green said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moderna said on Wednesday the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to review its experimental mRNA flu shot, reversing the agency's earlier decision to refuse to accept the application in a move that stunned Wall Street and the medical community. "Pending FDA approval, we look forward to making our flu vaccine available later this year so that America's seniors have access to a new option to protect themselves against flu," said Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel in a release. Shares of the biotech company rose more than 6% on Wednesday. Moderna said it had a "constructive" meeting with the FDA and proposed a revised regulatory approach that addresses criticisms the agency made when refusing to accept the application last week, tailoring its new proposal to an older population. Under the new approach, Moderna is seeking full approval for the shot in adults ages 50 to 64 and an accelerated approval of the shot for people 65 and up. The latter means that upon approval, Moderna will have to conduct an additional post-marketing study in older adults to confirm its benefits. In a statement, Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon confirmed that the FDA has accepted the modified application. The agency specifically took issue with Moderna's decision to compare its product to a standard, approved flu shot in a phase three trial, arguing that it "does not reflect the best-available standard of care" in the U.S. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday before the announcement, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary did not indicate that the agency would reverse course. But he emphasized that the FDA reviewed the application and the initial late-stage trial on the shot when it came in, so "it's a little bit of a misnomer to say that it was not looked at." Makary said the agency's guidance to Moderna on its mRNA-based flu shot "was pretty clear." Moderna has disputed that reasoning, noting that FDA rules and guidance do not actually require trials to use the most advanced or highest-dose vaccine as a comparator in clinical studies. The saga follows sweeping changes to U.S. immunization policy and regulation over the past year under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. Prasad, who heads the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has been vocal about tightening regulations for vaccines and recently linked child deaths to Covid shots without evidence. Last week, Moderna released a so-called Refusal to File letter from the FDA that was signed by Prasad on Feb. 3. HHS does not typically share those letters, and has not provided any details on who drove the decision-making on the company's application. When asked about his stance on mRNA technology, which Kennedy and some of his supporters have criticized as unsafe, Makary told CNBC on Wednesday that he's "hopeful and optimistic" about the platform but would also "like to see the data." "We're not going to get ahead of the game," he said. "We're going to basically say, we'd like to see the data, how far mRNA technology can be applied is a question where we'd love to see it applied, as far as it can be applied, but it's got to meet our scientific standards, so we'll see what it gets with cancer, with other infectious diseases ..."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Wednesday that the authors of a recent New York Federal Reserve paper that found U.S. companies and consumers are shouldering most of the tariff burden should be "disciplined." In a CNBC interview, the National Economic Council director ripped the report, saying that central bank researchers ignored key aspects of how the duties worked and instead simply focused on prices. Hassett said the research also should have included the upward impact on wages and benefits that U.S. companies see by bringing more production onshore. "I mean, the paper is an embarrassment," Hassett said during the "Squawk Box" interview. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class." Essentially, the researchers looked at whether countries that export products to the U.S. were lowering their prices, or in effect eating the tariffs, or raising their prices and passing them onto consumers and companies. However, Hassett insisted that the tariffs had little impact on prices and were responsible for a better standard of living. Import prices dropped a lot in the first half of the year, that leveled off, and real wages were up $1,400 on average last year, which means that consumers were made better off by the tariffs," he said. "So consumers couldn't have been made better off by the tariffs, if this New York Fed analysis was correct. I can't imagine who signed off on it." The consumer price index in January rose 2.4% from a year ago and is up nearly 2% from April 2025, when President Donald Trump first announced the tariffs. The sore CPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.5% in January, its lowest annual gain since March 2021. Import prices in December were flat from a year ago while export prices rose 3.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A New York Fed official declined comment. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora addressed the recent downdraft in software stocks, telling analysts in an earnings call that artificial intelligence won't replace cybersecurity "anytime soon." "I'm still confused why the market is treating AI as a threat to at least cybersecurity," he said Tuesday. "I can't speak for all of software, but one thing we're definitely seeing is that customers have figured out that they need to drive more consistency in their security stack to be able to respond faster using AI." Shares sank 7% Wednesday following the cybersecurity company's fiscal second-quarter results, which topped Wall Street estimates. However, third-quarter earnings guidance fell short of expectations. These new tools, from the likes of Anthropic and OpenAI, have left investors fretting over whether AI will permanently disrupt their business models. So far this year, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has slumped more than 23%. But Arora believes AI is far from displacing the security products. "Every one of us is working hard. Almost every AI, every security product has some version of a copilot that now runs in tandem with the product." Palo Alto has been betting big on AI in recent months and launched a suite of new agentic tools in the fourth quarter. The company has also invested heavily in new acquisitions to scale cybersecurity capabilities for customers in the age of sophisticated AI. Earlier this month, the company closed its massive $25 billion acquisition of identity security company CyberArk and completed its purchase of AI observability platform Chronosphere in January. Palo Alto announced on Tuesday that it's buying Israeli cybersecurity startup Koi. "These investments are a direct response to the inflections we see taking shape in the market," Arora told analysts.

Tech's elite are taking their talents to South Beach — again. In January, David Sacks, the venture capitalist and crypto and AI czar, proclaimed that Miami will soon replace New York City as America's financial capital. Stripe's Patrick Collison has been marveling at the city's "boomtown" vibes. With California flirting with a one-time tax on billionaires, said billionaires like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg are buying oceanfront mansions. And on Tuesday, Palantir announced that it's moving its headquarters from Denver to Miami. The pandemic sent waves of coastal workers to the city, turning it into a Zoomtown full of online venture capitalists like Keith Rabois and Delian Asparouhov, bitcoin bull runners, and purveyors of the finest NFTs. Billboards went up in San Francisco featuring a mock tweet from then-Miami mayor Francis Suarez: "Thinking about moving to Miami? Here's the thing: It's easy to fall for Miami when a big chunk of the workforce is stuck at home and online. Five years later, it's a lot harder to build companies there. Silicon Valley practically runs on a conveyor belt from Stanford and Caltech to Y Combinator's Dogpatch offices. Miami, meanwhile, lacks a major university to pipe in tech talent. Alligators may be all around in Miami, but unicorns are hard to find. In January, Cast AI, a startup that helps companies cut cloud costs, crossed the $1 billion valuation mark, becoming the region's first homegrown unicorn in years. Before that, Adam Neumann, the ousted WeWork cofounder, debuted his Miami residential real-estate venture, Flow, at a $1 billion valuation in 2022. Even Garry Tan, the Y Combinator president and gadfly who's usually first in line to dunk on San Francisco's politics, has been blunt about where the breeding grounds are best. Tan recently said on X that the accelerator still hasn't opened offices outside the Bay Area because founders are simply more likely to build unicorns there. Patrick Murphy, a former Florida congressman and entrepreneur, says that Miami's tech scene is growing, it's just being built in "reverse order." Silicon Valley, he says, emerged from an if you build it, they will come approach: Engineers built great companies first, which eventually created fortunes that cycled back into the community to fund the next generation of companies. Miami, however, has a more if you come, they will build it tact. Finance heavyweights like Citadel and Thoma Bravo arrived early. Vanguard, one of the world's largest asset managers, is eyeing an expansion in Miami as it targets more Latin American wealth. This dynamic has established Miami as a "control center" for decision-makers, Murphy argues, but not yet the "factory floor" where the actual work gets done. Murphy says that despite running a successful construction-tech startup, Togal.AI, his engineering team has been offshore from the beginning because the local talent pool simply "didn't exist" when he started in 2019. Still, Miami's flood of wealth is creating demand for startups built on the city's local economy, especially in property tech and fintech, Murphy says. Togal.AI's annual recurring revenue has grown 1,000% over the past two years, Murphy says, and is now raising fresh venture funding in order to hire dozens of new employees this year. Maya Bakhai, a Fort Lauderdale resident and founder of the early-stage venture firm Spice Capital, tells me that the city will flourish alongside "net new" industries that are still taking shape and where the center of gravity isn't locked in yet. Crypto firms like MoonPay and QuickNode still treat South Florida as a home base, she notes. Bakhai's bigger bet is that just as New York became the hub for e-commerce, Miami could become the place where creator businesses get built. And then there's Palantir, the strongest signal flare yet that tech is taking America's Playground seriously. It's hard to know what the data giant's HQ move will mean in practice — Palantir hasn't said how many employees it plans to relocate, or whether it will offer moving packages to lure talent south. The company did not respond to an email request for comment. If Palantir does move a meaningful slice of its workforce, it would give Miami something it's been short on: a marquee tech employer that can recruit and keep technical workers on the ground year-round. On X, Palantir's move immediately became a kind of Rorschach test for Miami's future. "Florida is the future," cheered Andreessen Horowitz investor Katherine Boyle. Turning Miami into Silicon Beach is a long game, Bakhai argues. For the first time, she says, ambitious graduates can launch careers in Miami instead of treating New York or San Francisco as the default. The payoff, she says, comes years later, when they eventually spin off to start their own companies.

Crypto firms like MoonPay and QuickNode still treat South Florida as a home base, she notes. Bakhai's bigger bet is that just as New York became the hub for e-commerce, Miami could become the place where creator businesses get built. And then there's Palantir, the strongest signal flare yet that tech is taking America's Playground seriously. It's hard to know what the data giant's HQ move will mean in practice — Palantir hasn't said how many employees it plans to relocate, or whether it will offer moving packages to lure talent south. The company did not respond to an email request for comment. If Palantir does move a meaningful slice of its workforce, it would give Miami something it's been short on: a marquee tech employer that can recruit and keep technical workers on the ground year-round. On X, Palantir's move immediately became a kind of Rorschach test for Miami's future. "Florida is the future," cheered Andreessen Horowitz investor Katherine Boyle. Turning Miami into Silicon Beach is a long game, Bakhai argues. For the first time, she says, ambitious graduates can launch careers in Miami instead of treating New York or San Francisco as the default. The payoff, she says, comes years later, when they eventually spin off to start their own companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A judge on Wednesday threatened to hold anyone using AI smart glasses during Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony in contempt of court. Recording is not allowed in the courtroom. The tech CEO said during his testimony that some users lie about their age when signing up for Instagram. Zuckerberg was responding to questions about documents from previous testimony before Congress, which stated that 4 million kids under 13 used the platform in the U.S. "You expect a 9-year-old to read all of the fine print," a lawyer for the plaintiff questioned. The comments came during testimony in a landmark trial about social media and safety that's being likened to the industry's "Big Tobacco" moment. Lawyers also questioned whether Zuckerberg previously lied about the board's inability to fire him in a courtroom on Wednesday. If the board wants to fire me, I could elect a new board and reinstate myself," he said, in response to remarks he previously made on Joe Rogan's podcast. During his interview with the podcaster last year, Zuckerberg had said he wasn't worried about losing his job because he holds voting power. Zuckerger said he is "very bad" at media. The CEO walked into Los Angeles Superior Court just before noon ET Wednesday. The trial, which began in late January, centers on a young woman who alleged that she became addicted to social media and video streaming apps like Instagram and YouTube. Lawyers representing the plaintiff contend that Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Snap misled the public about the safety of their services and knew that the design of their apps and certain features caused mental health harms to young users. Meta has denied the allegations and a spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that "The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff's mental health struggles." Last week, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri testified that while he thinks there can be problematic usage of social media, he doesn't believe that's the same as clinical addiction. "So it's a personal thing, but yeah, I do think it's possible to use Instagram more than you feel good about," Mosseri said. Meta is also involved in a major trial in New Mexico, in which the state's attorney general, Raúl Torrez, alleged that the social media giant failed to ensure that children and young users are safe from online predators. "What we are really alleging is that Meta has created a dangerous product, a product that enables not only the targeting of children, but the exploitation of children in virtual spaces and in the real world," Torrez told CNBC's "Squawk Box" last week when opening arguments for the trial began. This summer, another social media trial is expected to begin in the Northern District of California. That trial also involves companies like Meta and YouTube and allegations that their respective apps contained flaws that fostered detrimental mental health issues in young users.

Five-time Olympic medalist Eileen Gu just shut down a reporter's question asking if she'd "lost" two gold medals by finishing second in her events. The 22-year-old Olympic freeskier, who was born in the US and is representing China in the 2026 Winter Olympics, was responding to a reporter who asked whether Gu felt disappointed not to win gold in Milan. the journalist asked a press conference following her second silver at these games. Gu immediately laughed off his question and, without hesitation, said: "I am the most decorated female freeskier in history. I think that is an answer in and of itself." "Doing it five times is exponentially harder, because every medal is equally hard for me, but everybody else's expectations rise, right? And so the two medals lost situation, to be quite frank with you, I think it's kind of a ridiculous perspective to take," she added. She looked him in the eye said that was a "ridiculous perspective" without any hesitation or fear. Alvin Foo, venture partner at Chain Valley Capital, reposted the clip on his X feed, writing, "You got to give lots of credit to Eileen Gu for responding brilliantly back to the reporter with great confidence. "She looked him in the eye said that was a "ridiculous perspective" without any hesitation or fear," he added. Other posts praising Gu for being confident and poised gained thousands of views. It's been an Olympics full of public statements and oversharing, Yen wrote. This has included a Norwegian biathlete who confessed to cheating on his ex in a slopeside interview, and American figure skater Amber Glenn addressing discrimination against the queer community under President Donald Trump.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jay-Z has been name-dropping luxury timepieces in his songs for decades. References to Rolex, Audemars Piguet, and Hublot are scattered throughout his music catalog. He doesn't just rap about watches, though. The billionaire mogul has amassed quite a collection of statement timepieces. Here's a look at some of his watch collection. Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, is a big fan of Patek Philippe watches. He wore one with a rose-gold case and dozens of diamonds for the 2025 Grammys. Its face includes several functions, such as days of the week and moon phases, that help keep a perpetual calendar for tracking the date. In 2012, his wife and fellow artist Beyoncé gifted Jay-Z a $5 million Hublot Big Bang in 18-karat white-gold for his 43rd birthday, according to jewelry blogs. The watch was encrusted with 1,282 diamonds, and it took more than 14 months to assemble, the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève, a foundation that highlights contemporary watches with awards and exhibitions, reported. It also took more than a year to source all the diamonds. Jay-Z's custom Blueprint Richard Mille 56 watch required more than 3,000 hours to produce, GQ said in 2019. What was the price of that Richard Mille 56 watch? Or at least, that was its retail value. It was custom-made for Jay-Z and featured rare green sapphire crystals. He did so with an RM011 Felipe Massa Chronograph in rose gold. The watch was originally released in 2007 and was designed with its namesake, F1 driver Felipe Massa, the brand said on its website. Mille is no longer making this model, but you can get a used one for $215,000. Jay-Z wore the Richard Mille RM027 Rafael Nadal to watch its namesake take on Novak Djokovic at the 2011 US Open championships. It was designed to be as lightweight as possible and take on all the wear and tear a tennis superstar like Nadal might put it through, Richard Mille said. Nadal referred to it as his "second skin" timepiece. There were only 50 of these watches made at the time, according to Mille. You can buy one on the secondary market for $1.95 million. Nadal collaborated with Richard Mille on several additional versions of this timepiece that the rapper later acquired. Jay-Z shouted out Audemars Piguet in his 2011 "Watch the Throne" track "N—s in Paris," saying: "Ball so hard, got a broken clock / rollies that don't tick-tock / Audemars that's losing time / hidden behind all these big rocks." Included in his collection is the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar Openworked 26585CE. It has an openwork sapphire dial, rose gold dial markers, a black ceramic band and case, and a titanium clasp. You can buy one from the watchmaker, but it's "price upon request" — or, in other words, wildly expensive. It's one of the most technically complicated Patek Philippe watches, and its price is only available "on request." Jay-Z wore his model to Lebron James' 39th birthday party. Days after the watches sold out, one was auctioned off for $6.5 million, CNBC reported in 2021. Jay-Z and Beyoncé were named Tiffany ambassadors that year. It's a popular style in its own right, but the Yves Klein version is especially rare. Few are rarely found on the resale market. Jay-Z sported the Perpetual Calendar Split Seconds Chronograph 5004P watch during a decadent, seafood tower-filled lunch meeting with DJ Khaled in 2023. The particular watch that Jay-Z has, the 5004P model with a silver link band, is nearly impossible to find, but it was valued at $600,000 in 2022, according to IFL Watches. The Grandmaster Chime is considered Patek Philippe's most complicated watch, with more than 1,500 individual components. Patek Philippe then went on to make the Grandmaster Chime in other fabrications. Jay-Z has the white gold version, which runs around $2.5 million, according to reports. Patek Philippe produced this watch in limited quantities from 1950 to 1985. Jay-Z's Patek Philippe 2499 was previously owned by Swedish watch collector and dealer Tony Kavak, who had a yellow-gold band specially made for the piece. As Kavak tells it, the watch wasn't initially for sale. "The watch is so exclusive that I often chose not to wear it in public, and I always wear my watches, that's my philosophy," Kavak told watch site Bezl. "You should have seen his happiness," Kavak said in an interview with watch blog Hodinkee. Neither Kavak nor Jay-Z would reveal the deal's cost, but in 2022, a similar watch sold at auction for $7.68 million. His first FP Journe Tourbillon Souverain was set with 93 baguette diamonds circling it and even more across its face, according to Celeb Watch Spotter. Jay-Z wore the piece for a meeting with Tom Brady. His wife Beyoncé later shared photos from Super Bowl weekend on her website. They included a close-up shot of another FP Journe Tourbillon Souverain watch, this one in green, on Jay-Z's wrist.</p>

Veteran broadcaster Anderson Cooper said Monday that he is leaving his role as a correspondent on CBS News' "60 Minutes" after nearly 20 years. His exit comes at an already turbulent time for CBS News under its new editor in chief, Bari Weiss. Sports broadcaster Keith Olbermann shared the news about Cooper's departure on his Bluesky account, posting: "Anderson Cooper has left the sinking ship that is Idiot Bari Weiss's New Stormfront CBS." Olbermann later added, "Now, people will only be able to NOT watch AC on cnn." Brian Lowry, a longtime media columnist and current Hollywood correspondent at Status News, a media newsletter, wrote on X: "Have worked around Hollywood long enough to know nobody ever really leaves a job to spend more time with their family." Tom Jones, senior media writer at The Poynter Report, wrote in his newsletter that Cooper's departure marked "the end of a journalism era." Jones said that Cooper's exit "certainly adds more uncertainty in a news division that is very much in flux under relatively new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss." He added: "It also raises questions about '60 Minutes,' the previous gold standard of TV news shows." Lydia Polgreen, a New York Times opinion writer and the former editor in chief of HuffPost, posted to X on Tuesday: "I don't watch much TV news, but @andersoncooper is in a league of his own as a television journalist. CNN's chief media analyst, Brian Stelter, wrote in his "Reliable Sources" newsletter Tuesday that there are open questions about which other correspondents might leave, "and on what terms." Trish Regan, the former Fox Business Network anchor, said on her YouTube channel on Tuesday that she "didn't buy" Cooper's statement that he was leaving to spend more time with his family. Regan said that Cooper's exit raised the bigger question of what would happen with Weiss, adding that it seemed like she was an unpopular figure at CBS News. Regan added that she admires the moves Weiss has made so far at CBS News, including bringing in "more diverse political voices."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigerian industrialist Abdul Samad Rabiu is taking his place among Africa's elite yacht owners, commissioning a 60-meter superyacht from renowned Italian shipbuilder Baglietto, according to a post on his Facebook page. #ASR,” signaling the project is underway or in early planning stages. The yacht, a large-scale luxury build, positions Rabiu within a select group of Nigerian tycoons who regularly commission bespoke assets in Europe. At 60 meters, the vessel falls within Baglietto's upper-tier offerings, typically designed for long-range cruising with charter-level amenities. Industry insiders note that such projects require custom naval architecture, extensive engineering, and a multi-year construction period, depending on specifications and yard capacity. Baglietto, headquartered in La Spezia on Italy's northwest coast, has a long-established reputation for crafting yachts between 40 and 60 meters. The company has delivered numerous high-end builds across Europe, making it a top choice for wealthy African clients seeking prestige and performance. Luxury superyachts are increasingly popular among Africa's high-net-worth individuals, often serving as both status symbols and functional assets for family travel, corporate hosting, and leisure. Observers say these builds underscore the region's growing engagement with bespoke European and Gulf markets, highlighting the intersection of wealth, industrial influence, and lifestyle aspirations. The project exemplifies how Africa's industrial magnates continue to translate business success into high-profile personal assets, showcasing both status and international connections.</p>

Jason Chinnock, who has been with the Italian luxury motorcycle company for over 20 years and served as its North American CEO for a decade, said being a motorcyclist is a core part of his identity. He told Business Insider in an interview that a self-driving motorcycle would "take away the entire reason to ride a motorcycle." Autonomous cars, he said, are useful for mobility — they transport people in a "safe, smooth, efficient, and carefree way." "If it takes away the ability to operate it and experience it, then just get in a pod and go from point A to point B." There are no commercially available self-driving motorcycles. Some companies, such as Japan's Yamaha and the Singapore-headquartered Omoway, have started work on self-balancing bikes. However, Ducati is not entirely dismissing autonomous features, adding them where necessary for safety. For instance, Chinnock said some of Ducati's models come with electronic cruise control, traction control, and an anti-lock braking system. Its motorcycles cost more than $10,000 in the US, with some models exceeding $40,000. Tesla's robotaxis and Alphabet's Waymo both offer autonomous taxi services in San Francisco and the Bay Area, with Uber set to join the fray this year.</p>
