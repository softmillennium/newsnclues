                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The shutdown, now in its fourth week, will result in the loss of at least $7 billion of gross domestic product by the end of 2026 as a result of furloughed federal employees working fewer weeks, the CBO said. And the cost will grow the longer the shutdown drags on, CBO Director Phillip Swagel told U.S. House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, in a letter. A six-week shutdown will cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown will cost $14 billion, Swagel said. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told NBC News on Wednesday that he saw no evidence of a breakthrough. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said it will stop paying for food assistance, known as SNAP, on Nov. 1 if the shutdown is not resolved. More than two dozen states have sued the Trump administration to maintain SNAP benefits. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach a short-term funding agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding that would reopen the government.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday, and wealthy U.S. households may benefit most. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. It could fall to 3.1% by the end of 2027, according to a September forecast from the Federal Open Market Committee. "That really sets the floor for all other interest rates," said Michael Wagner, co-founder of Omnia Family Wealth in Aventura, Florida. "We ultimately start earning less money on cash, which makes it less attractive versus other investments." For example, cash held in high-yield savings accounts typically earns less money soon after a reduction in the federal funds rate. The change in short-term interest rates can also potentially lead to cheaper terms on longer-term loans, such as mortgages. Lower interest rates can speed up economic growth and lead to an increase in hiring, experts say. But they are also associated with rising levels of wealth inequality. "The Fed's easing cycle could unintentionally widen the generational wealth gap, lifting the net worth of retirees, baby boomers," said Kathryn Rooney Vera, a chief market strategist at StoneX Group. That's because asset price booms tend to follow Fed rate cuts, and older, wealthier consumers — who own more stocks — disproportionately benefit from those market gains. Meanwhile, younger and less advantaged households with more of their assets in cash may see their returns diminish. The top 0.1% wealthiest households own over $23 trillion in financial assets as of the second quarter of 2025, according to Federal Reserve data. That's a 46.6% increase from the start of 2020, when this segment held just $6.93 trillion in assets. Watch the video above to see how the Fed's decision to lower interest rates affects your wealth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is "losing a self-inflicted trade war" with China, leaving the United States with a "weak hand" going into his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Senate Democrats said Wednesday in a new report on the effects of Trump's wide-ranging tariffs. "Trump's trade wars have imposed significant costs" on U.S. consumers and businesses, "sold out American farmers," and the president "has strengthened China's hand while weakening America's leverage," the report says. CNBC received the report by Democrats on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs a day before Trump is set to meet Xi in South Korea. Trump is "putting America's long-term prosperity and security at risk," Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in a statement to CNBC. "Trump needs to change course on his trade war with China now and stop hurting American families, farmers, and businesses," Warren said. Warren's comments came before Trump, speaking at the Asia Pacific Economic Forum in Gyoeongju, South Korea, said he was optimistic of reaching a trade deal with Xi, which could include reducing tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese goods. The report points to inflation data and other economic metrics in the wake of Trump's implementation of global tariffs in April. "Between January and April, year-over-year Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was falling, but it has rebounded since May — after Trump announced his universal tariffs," the report said. "Last week, CPI data showed that inflation increased by 3 percent year-over-year in September, the highest rate since May 2024," the report said. Core goods inflation, which includes physical products such as clothing, furniture, electronics, appliances, and cars, but excludes food and energy, also increased 1.5 percent over the year in September. "Studies suggest that President Trump's tariffs are costing American families around $1,500 more per year and disproportionately harming lower- and middle-income households that spend a greater share of their incomes on essential goods," the report said. In addition to inflation data, the report also pointed to jobs data as evidence that Trump's trade policy is not reaping rewards. "Rather than reviving manufacturing as promised, Trump's strategy has also caused the sector to shed 42,000 jobs and manufacturing employment has contracted for four straight months — the longest monthly streak of losses since early 2020," the report said. Warren and the other committee Democrats said that despite Trump's talk about an impending deal with Xi, it is clear China has the upper hand and continues to impose pain on American businesses and farmers. The report cited rare earths export controls imposed by China, and that nation's refusal, since May, to buy U.S.-grown soybeans. China purchased $12.6 billion worth of American soybeans in 2024, but just $2.5 billion worth in the first half of 2025 before the effective boycott began. "Simultaneously, Trump's tariffs have raised costs on farm inputs like fertilizer and equipment, squeezing farmers from both sides," the report noted. "China's exports continue growing despite U.S. tariffs, reaching record trade surpluses by routing goods through third countries. In a statement to CNBC responding to the report, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, "It's hard to tell if Democrats are delusional or wishcasting more doom for the American people, on top of their idiotic government shutdown." "The reality is that the President's trade and tariff agenda has already secured historic trade deals with countries that in total have an over $30 trillion economy and one billion people," Desai said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>General Motors laid off roughly 1,700 workers at manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio on Wednesday, citing a slowdown in the electric vehicle market. The company confirmed there were around 1,200 layoffs at Detroit's electric vehicle plant and 550 cuts at Ohio's Ultium Cells battery cell plant, in addition to 850 temporary layoffs at that site in Ohio. The company also said it would temporarily lay off 700 at Ultium Cells' Tennessee plant. "In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity," the company said in a statement. "Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our U.S. manufacturing footprint, and we believe our investments and dedication to flexible operations will make GM more resilient and capable of leading through change." GM also said battery cell production at its Ohio and Tennessee facilities will be temporarily paused beginning in January. It anticipates resuming operations at both battery cell sites by the middle of 2026 and will use the pause to upgrade its facilities. Wednesday's layoffs follow the company saying last week that it would cut more than 200 salaried employees, mostly engineers at its global tech campus in metro Detroit, as part of a restructuring effort. Though sales for plug-in vehicles soared to records for many automakers in the third quarter, that demand is expected to decline following the discontinuation. GM previously reported a more than doubling of sales for electric vehicles during the third quarter from the year prior, a trend other automakers like Ford Motor and Hyundai saw as well. "We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles," CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during "Squawk Box" last week. Still, GM's third-quarter results last week included a $1.6 billion impact from its all-electric vehicle plans not playing out as anticipated, signaling it was undergoing a reassessment of its EV capacity and manufacturing processes.

Nvidia became the first company ever to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization at the open on Wednesday morning. The tech giant's stock was up around 4.4% to almost $210 in the opening minutes of trading, giving it a valuation of roughly $5.1 trillion. Nvidia's upward move was also bolstered by President Donald Trump saying in a Wednesday press conference in South Korea that he could discuss Nvidia's Blackwell chips with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a meeting on Thursday. Nvidia also gained after a Tuesday announcement that it would invest $1 billion in Nokia to develop 6G technology. That news pushed the Finnish telecommunications' stock up to its highest level in almost a decade. The chip firm's stock has risen more than 50% so far in 2025 and has climbed a staggering 1,500% in the past five years. "The Q3 earnings season will reach its apex this week with key reports due from Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta on Wednesday as well as Apple and Amazon on Thursday," Jim Reid, head of macro and thematic research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note on Monday.</p>

Tech Reviews:

Amazon's new Echo Studio is priced at $220.

Review: The $100 Echo Dot Max outshines the pricier Echo Studio.

“Alexa, what new things can you do?” That's the first question I posed to Amazon.com Inc.'s latest pair of Echo smart speakers. Like so many other people, I have a long history of asking these devices to play music, give me the weather forecast or control a smart light or two. But that's as far as my interactions with them have typically gone.

With the new $100 Echo Dot Max and $220 Echo Studio, Amazon hopes that'll change. And the reason is more advanced artificial intelligence.</p>

Tesla's chair, Robyn Denholm, sent a letter to shareholders on Monday warning them that Musk may choose to leave the company if they do not pass the massive compensation plan at its annual meeting next week. The package, which could be worth as much as $1 trillion if Musk hits a series of ambitious revenue and product goals over the next decade, has faced pushback. Proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have both recommended that shareholders vote against it, leading Musk to brand them as "corporate terrorists" in a fiery conclusion to Tesla's earnings call last week. The State Board of Administration of Florida, a fund that manages assets worth over $280 billion and counts former presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis as its chairman, said on Monday it would back the proposed pay package. Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and one of Tesla's biggest Wall Street cheerleaders, also expressed support for Musk's $1 trillion payday. In a note released shortly after Tesla unveiled the package, Ives said it would help keep Musk focused on the company and accelerate Tesla's "autonomous and robotics future." New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli wrote a letter to Tesla shareholders on Monday, urging them to vote against the compensation plan and criticizing the board for an "alarming lack of independence." The nation's second-largest teachers' labor union joined a group of unions, state treasurers, and investment firms earlier this month in urging Tesla shareholders to vote against the mammoth pay deal, arguing it did not secure enough commitments from Musk to keep him focused on Tesla.</p>

On a clear day from Trinidad's northern coast, neighboring Venezuela is visible in the distance, along with the hazy outlines of a gas platform tethered near an offshore field. Soon, the US's largest aircraft carrier may be part of that tableau. </p>

Self-Driving Cars:

Uber is preparing to offer driverless rides in Lucid vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Uber Technologies Inc. is preparing to offer driverless rides on vehicles developed by Lucid Group Inc. and Nuro Inc. in the San Francisco Bay Area for the first time next year, thrusting the company into direct competition with Waymo's robotaxi service.

Road testing of the vehicles — Lucid Gravity SUVs outfitted with Nuro's self-driving technology — is currently underway with drivers manually operating them, a Nuro spokesperson said. The first cars in the test fleet were delivered in September, and the number will grow to more than a hundred in the coming months, according to an Uber statement.</p>

For more than two decades, Scott Payne lived in the shadows. As an undercover FBI agent, he infiltrated violent biker gangs and white-supremacist networks. Payne joined the FBI in 1998, having worked as a police officer in South Carolina for five years. Over the next 23 years, he built false identities so convincing that criminals treated him as one of their own. He earned invitations to secret gang meetings, shared beers with white supremacists, and watched as men planned murders in front of him. He said the work demanded patience, confidence, and nerves of steel. For months, he'd been posing as a tattooed Southerner named "Tex," slowly winning over members in bars and strip clubs. "They brandished their weapons," Payne told Business Insider's Kevin Reilly. I need you to take all your clothes off. They used it to cross-check his information online. As he stripped, Payne handed over his clothes that had a hidden wire. If they found it, he'd be dead. "Being stripped in a basement at gunpoint is not a big deal if you're not wired, you're just naked. When you're wired, it's a big deal," Payne said. "A lot of people ask me, 'What would you have said if he would have found it?' Fourteen years later, Payne faced another near miss with death — this time with "The Base," a violent white-supremacist group operating out of Georgia and founded in 2018. "I thought we were getting ready to throw down," Payne said. Then, by sheer luck, another member noticed nearby power lines and suggested that's what may have caused the device to go haywire. Payne had spent months infiltrating "The Base." "We uncovered several murder plots that Luke wanted to bring me in on," Payne said, referring to Luke Lane, a group leader. "They had found a couple that they believed were an Antifa couple in a couple of counties away, and they wanted to murder 'em." Payne said he pretended to agree to keep his cover, telling them the Antifa couple plot would be "good practice." Then, he helped coordinate the sting that stopped it. He picked Lane up for what was supposed to be lunch. "I feigned that my truck had had issues and pulled over on the side of the road, got out to work on my truck, and then that's when another truck came over." As they approached, Payne said he jumped in the other truck, which then drove off. Payne retired from the FBI in 2021, but he hasn't stopped trying to help. He now trains law enforcement teams on domestic terrorism cases and has written a book, "Codename Pale Horse: How I Infiltrated America's Nazis." What saved him during his time undercover, Payne said, is what agents and investigators need now: calm under pressure, patience, and an ability to read people. For all the dangers he faced, Payne said the work is still worth doing because the threats he once saw face-to-face haven't gone away. "Do I believe that white supremacy in the domestic-terrorism realm is probably the most violent and most dangerous? Yes," he said, adding that the challenge for investigators is identifying threats before they move.</p>

In late 2021, as the housing market overheated and the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate hovered near zero, Tony Yang found an unconventional way to fund his down payment.

He logged into his Charles Schwab brokerage account, built a trade he'd discovered on Reddit — and unlocked about $650,000 to help finance a Bay Area home.</p>

Elon Musk's Grokipedia promises to be a "massive improvement over Wikipedia." Musk did not immediately claim ownership of the site, but its X account was linked to xAI, Musk's AI venture. The site's landing page listed 885,279 articles, calling it v0.1. "The goal here is to create an open source, comprehensive collection of all knowledge," said Musk, who later confirmed the domain. Business Insider examined Grokipedia's pages about some of the most contentious issues and events, from January 6 and Gamergate to Donald Trump. Both Grokipedia and Wikipedia call January 6 a "riot." Beyond that, the two entries are widely different. The Wikipedia references these claims, but repeatedly calls them "false." The Wikipedia entry calls Rudy Giuliani's claims of rigged voting machines "conspiracy theories." Wikipedia's opening references "many people" being injured, before focusing on 174 police officer injuries and the later suicides of four officers. Grokipedia, on the other hand, first references harm with the death of rioter Ashli Babbitt. It's no secret that Elon Musk has a contentious relationship with OpenAI. He cofounded the company and invested in it before leaving and founding his own venture, xAI. It referenced a Manhattan Institute study that indicated OpenAI moderated more hate speech directed toward liberals than conservatives, and a Substacker who wrote that content involving white and conservative identities was more harshly moderated. Later, the page referenced how some Sora prompts with "sexist, racist, or ableist" descriptions "often succeed without intervention, amplifying societal prejudices embedded in training data rather than being filtered effectively." The two entries were ultimately quite similar. Grokipedia covered more of OpenAI's recent controversies, but it was also almost 3,000 words longer. Musk has also had an up-and-down history with Trump. He led the Department of Government Efficiency, but began publicly feuding with the president over Trump's spending bill. Grokipedia's entry about Donald Trump is significantly more positive. On Wikipedia, Trump's legal cases related to sexual abuse and fraud allegations are given an entire paragraph in the introduction. On Grokipedia, they are only referenced further down in a section about Trump's post-presidency. In that section, Grokipedia referenced "fundraising hauls" and "procedural vulnerabilities." Across the post, Grokipedia more frequently splits its entries into critics and defenders. (Grokipedia uses the word "critics" 18 times, compared to Wikipedia's 3.) In a section on Trump's financials, Grokipedia countered criticisms that Trump was "reckless" with a defense that it "aligned with real estate and casino industry norms during boom periods." References to Musk were also widely different. Wikipedia didn't characterize his appointment, merely calling him a special government employee before describing the Department of Government Efficiency's work. Grokipedia described criticisms of Musk's appointment for "bypassing Senate confirmation norms," but also a defense for "injecting fresh perspectives free from bureaucratic entrenchment." Wikipedia calls it a "misogynistic online harassment campaign." Grokipedia calls it a "grassroots online movement" focused on "exposing conflicts of interest and lack of transparency in video game journalism." The ordering of subjects is also skewed between posts. Wikipedia focuses on the subjects of harassment before a later section on "purpose and goals." Grokipedia also framed Gamergate as an act of "decentralized activism," building a future for later movements that "bypassed traditional gatekeepers." Elon Musk's anti-Wikipedia stance dates back to 2019, when he looked at his own page. "Just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years. Wikipedia and Grokipedia both discuss criticisms of Musk in their introductions to the business leader, but Grokipedia is more defensive. It said that Musk's criticisms came from "legacy media outlets that exhibit systemic left-leaning tilts in coverage." Grokipedia did not mention Musk's controversial gesture during the presidential inauguration, which Wikipedia devoted an entire subsection to. Unlike Wikipedia, Grokipedia includes a section about his long hours and favorite exercises.</p>

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has added nine direct reports in the past year or so, according to internal organization charts viewed by Business Insider. Five of those previously worked for Google or DeepMind. Business Insider wrote about Suleyman's organizational chart a few months after the new unit came together. Now, an updated org chart shows how his team of 17 direct reports is shaping up, with nine new names and four who no longer appear. Subramanya joined Microsoft in July from Google, where he was VP of engineering for generative AI product Gemini. In a LinkedIn post shortly after he joined, Subramanya wrote the culture at Microsoft was "refreshingly low ego yet bursting with ambition." "It reminds me of the best parts of a startup: fast-moving, collaborative, and deeply focused on building truly innovative, state-of-the-art foundation models to drive delightful AI-powered products such as Microsoft Copilot," Subramanya wrote. "Health is a critical use case for AI. Patients and the public continue to face multiple pain points on their path to better health," he wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing his new role. "We're now at an inflection point where AI capabilities are already assisting with faster and more accurate diagnoses and helping people better navigate the complexity of modern healthcare." He was the senior vice president of product and growth at Snap from 2015 to 2023 and a partner at Greylock since 2023. Andreou appears to be behind Mico, Copilot's new AI character inspired by Clippy, Microsoft Office's often-hated animated paper clip. He previously spent 10 years at Meta as chief creative officer and nearly seven years at Time Warner before that in roles including president and chief creative officer. Her LinkedIn profile suggests she's in a vice president of the "Microsoft Edge Web and App Platform." Lyndersay has spent more than 26 years at Microsoft. He's been in his current role since September 2024, which his LinkedIn profile describes as being responsible for product strategy and direction for Edge, the browser. Frank joined Microsoft in January from Google, where he spent nearly 14 years most recently as senior director of product management for advertiser and customer engagement platforms. Frank describes his role in a LinkedIn post as "building the next generation of monetization for AI-first products." Suleyman hired Shankar in March to "lead a new privacy and security engineering effort focused on Copilot," he wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing the hiring. Suleyman wrote that Shankar was "involved in many foundational security and privacy projects" while at Google. He appeared on Suleyman's org chart last year with the same title. Ribas has been at Microsoft for more than 25 years. His LinkedIn profile lists his title as "CVP at Microsoft — Search & AI," leading teams responsible for engineering, product, and growth in Copilot, Bing, and Microsoft Search in Bing for Enterprise. Ribas was listed on Suleyman's org chart last year with the title of corporate vice president of "search and distribution," but a Microsoft spokesman said he effectively has the same title. Before Inflection, Simonyan was a principal research scientist at Google's DeepMind AI lab. Simonyan "is a renowned AI researcher and thought leader, who has led the development of some of the biggest AI breakthroughs over the past decade including AlphaZero," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an email to employees last year. Simonyan had the same title on last year's org chart. She's been in her current role since March 2023 leading the advertising team, which her LinkedIn says has more than $10 billion in annual revenue. Sainsbury-Carter had the same title on Suleyman's org chart last year. His previous roles include vice president of design at Twitter and founder of a news-media company called Newsvine that was acquired by NBCNews.com. His role doesn't appear to have changed since last year's org chart. Zhang is based in Beijing and has been at Microsoft for 22 years. Zhang's title appears to have changed since last year to CVP of Microsoft AI Asia from CVP of Microsoft AI ARPD (Microsoft's Asia-Pacific Research and Development group), perhaps suggesting a broader scope. Cromwell joined Microsoft along with Suleyman and Simonyan from Inflection AI, where he was the vice president of engineering. Cromwell had until then been at Inflection for about six months, having joined the company from the security-camera startup Verkada. She has been a corporate vice president since 2020, when she was promoted from a distinguished engineer who led algorithms and infrastructure teams for Bing Ads. Her title on last year's org chart was corporate vice president of "Microsoft ads engineering." A Microsoft spokesperson said Iyer has always been a CVP, but the term "monetization" is newly being used on the team.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Prakhar Agarwal, an applied researcher at Meta Superintelligence Labs. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history. I moved to Meta Superintelligence Labs this summer when a lot of folks were making the shift. Later, OpenAI, Meta, and a bunch of other companies began reaching out, so I didn't have to explicitly apply for any of those. I don't deny that experience plays a huge role. In most of these companies, the number of positions is pretty small, so naturally, they're converging more toward experienced folks. You don't have a traditional setup and hierarchy. Your role involves identifying a gap, then going to solve that problem. You define your own problems and try to come up with solutions. At OpenAI and Meta, they spend a lot of time hiring smart people. The interviews test for a couple of things. You still have to write code, but it's much more involved and related to the actual work you're doing at the job. The second thing they're trying to understand is whether you can operate in an ambiguous domain. Given an abstract problem, how are you concretizing and making it a workable metric-driven solution? It conveys that you're able to work in an abstract domain. Practical experience gives you the required skillset and a base to build on. Building that intuition will differentiate you from the crowd at interviews. At a minimum, make sure your theoretical understanding is good and work to understand the nomenclature required to do your job. You also have to use these models a lot. Once you're using them, you'll understand what they are good at and what they are not good at, which is something people may overlook. The ability to find gaps in AI models is actually one of the most important things that all of these companies are looking for. What is a gap that needs addressing in the next version of Llama? These top-tier AI companies are focusing on high-bandwidth communication. Here, you'll just go to a meeting room and discuss the problem over a whiteboard session before going to your own spaces and working on these problems. These work conversations are usually one-to-ones, one-to-twos, or three-person conversations, so you should be able to articulate the gaps and problems well to people above you and people in the same peer group. If you get stuck with something, reach out to people on Twitter or LinkedIn. They are very likely to respond and help. It might feel like a lot of information is beyond the classroom because the structured class coursework is pretty outdated. When you want to learn about these domains, don't just rely on your coursework or your professor or the books that were written probably five, 10 years ago to bring you to that level. Start following people who are sharing a lot on these domains.</p>
