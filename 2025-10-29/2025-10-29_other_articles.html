                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The following contains spoilers for Supernatural #1, on sale now from Dynamite Entertainment For instance, Marvel has had great success in the past decade of its Star Wars licensed comic books by picking a specific time period, and then having all of its ongoing comics built around that period. Currently, the Star Wars line is based in adventures following Return of the Jedi, but that lesson is important even for a series that ISN'T part of a whole line of books, and since Greg Pak is VERY familiar with this concept from his excellent work on the aforementioned Star Wars line of books at Marvel, it is unsurprising that he has learned that lesson well for this new Supernatural series, which isn't part of a line of books, of course, but still gets that it is important to pick one era and explore it as best you can. Supernatural #1 is from writer Greg Pak, artist Eder Messias, colorist Thyago Brandao, and letterer Jeff Eckleberry, and it is smartly set between the first and second seasons of the extraordinarily long-running TV series about two brothers who are part of a family of "hunters," people who hunt down demons and other supernatural forces. This was a famous aspect of The X-Files (that's where the term "Monster of the Week" came from), and it has been a regular fixture in these sorts of shows ever since. This issue kicks off with a compelling idea, as a man flat out BURSTS INTO FLAMES while drinking outside of his home. This, naturally, is very important for Dean and Sam Winchester, as Sam Winchester was brought back into the world of "hunting" by his girlfriend (likely soon to be fiancée) Jess being killed by a demon through a horrific process (similar to the one where Dean and Sam's mother was killed), burning alive after being badly wounded. It was unlike, say, Spider-Man, where his very existence means that all sorts of crazy stuff is happening in his life at any given moment, so that you could easily throw in all sorts of different adventures into his past without it affecting anything (a hallmark of the classic series, Untold Tales of Spider-Man, and the current fun miniseries, Amazing Spider-Man: Torn). Here, when the Winchesters' adventures were still "new," there was much more area for Pak to move in with new untold stories, while still giving them some heft, and not feel disposable (you know, sort of like, "Well, if this story was important at all, we'd have heard about it already, right? At the same time, it also allows Pak to dig deeper into the feelings of Sam and Dean, which are obviously still raw in the early days of their partnership. A really helpful tool for licensed comics like this is something that Pak obviously is smart enough to get, which is that you should introduce new villains, since you can't really mess too much with the show's established villains, so a new villain gives you a lot of freedom to do whatever you want with them, and Pak introduces an intriguing new villain in this issue, a billionaire who is interested in going beyond the world of science to also exploit the world of magic for legit, as well. That's a very natural enemy for the Winchesters, and the fact that she is an attractive young woman has room for some interesting entanglements between her and Dean. Messias and Brandao have the inglorious task of having to play against their instincts in this series, as Messias is a big, bold artist whose work crackles with energy, and yet here, since it is a TV show adaptation, a lot of the plot is delivered through "just" talking scenes, and Messias has to make those compelling, as well, and he uses a lot of little tricks to pull it off, with a lot of "business" in the background. Dave Gibbons is iconic for how much extra "business" he had going on in every Watchmen panel, and Messias follows that path in this issue (I don't want to mislead you, he doesn't do nearly as much as Gibbons, just saying that he takes that same basic approach to liven up the talking panels). This was a strong first issue, and it feels nice to have such a strong guiding hand like Pak leading this book. You know he will make it worth your while.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli-American Harvard University physicist Avi Loeb recently discussed employing a multi-front approach to finding extraterrestrial life in space, as the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS continued to gain attention. Loeb continued to stress the need for proper interceptors, specially-designed cameras, as well as a significant allocation of funds in the “planetary defense” fund to create a system that will protect Earth. Apart from that, Loeb suggested the tracking of artificial lights and other traditional ways of searching for intelligent life. Conversations surrounding extraterrestrial beings or an intelligent presence came to the forefront after the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, began showing multiple anomalies. The “anti-tail,” in particular, which Loeb speculated may be thrust exhaust from an intelligent life, trying to slow down the object, sparked alien theories among experts. “We need interceptors, a spacecraft that when we detect with those two observatories, we detect an object that comes from outside the solar system, then we can maneuver a spacecraft so that it will meet it along its path,” he explained. He recalled writing a paper discussing the change in the trajectory of Juno, which U.S. Representative Anna Pauline Luna read. Thus, Loeb concluded that “a potential fleet of interceptors” had the capacity to “come really close and take a close-up photograph.” According to Loeb, photographic proof of the 3I/ATLAS or any other object would automatically debunk all theories besides the truth. Consequently, he believed they needed cameras that could not only take photographs but also collect samples and bring them back to Earth. Loeb argued that once alien technology was verified, confirming that it put Earth at risk, a significant fraction of the military budget should be allocated to create a system that would protect the planet. “If we encounter a clearly technological alien object, then the budget will rise by a factor of 1,000 from the military budget portion going into it.” Loeb also suggested the search for artificial lights, as it would allow experts to get more of an understanding. While 31/ATLAS sparked concerns about being a visit by aliens and other risks, NASA confirmed that it posed no threat to the planet. “Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away. 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun around Oct. 30, 2025.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dynamite Entertainment's new Supernatural comic series returns to Sam and Dean's formative days as monster-hunters. The first issue dials the franchise back to its essence, delivering the classic Winchester brothers dynamic from before it was burdened by later seasons' metaphysics and mythology. The issue is at its best, though, in its back-and-forth between Sam and Dean, setting a strong foundation for the stories to come. As such, it deliberately strives for a “lost episode” quality. It is a monster hunt that happened between the adventures fans saw on screen. It is carefully plotted to situate itself into the context of Sam and Dean's familiar character arc. In this case, an “imp," which Sam explains is a “demonspawn.” This formula is necessarily compressed for the comic medium, but what that leads to is a lean, to-the-point Supernatural story that prioritizes Dean and Sam's brotherly dynamic over the action and spectacle of their fight with the Imp. Supernatural #1 sticks pretty close to the source material, though it does take a few interesting liberties. Most notably, the Winchesters aren't driving their trademark Impala; it is explained in the issue that the Impala is hidden, while they drive a stolen “loaner,” due to Dean's light credit card forgery. who possibly knows more about John Winchester than his sons do, and who seems poised to pop back up as the series progresses. It's possible she could be a love interest for Dean, or perhaps the new villain author Greg Pak teased. In any case, it is a solid start to Supernatural's new comic era, which returns to the original concept of the series, and the early days of Sam and Dean. Already, the comic is scratching the itch for Supernatural fans who wish there were just a few more episodes of Season 1. Supernatural #1 is available now from Dynamite Entertainment.

Dr. Greer will provide an update on government disclosure related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) and Non-Human Intelligence (NHI). Former U.S. Marine and whistleblower Michael Herrera will break his silence about witnessing an octogonal UAP craft hovering 20 feet off the ground while a clandestine recovery operation took place. Tickets are now on sale for in-person attendance and the event can be streamed live and on demand globally with a Gaia+ membership. Dr. Steven Greer will lead participants through ten comprehensive sessions covering Washington's UAP disclosure process, whistleblower testimony, CE5 (human-initiated ET contact) meditation techniques, remote viewing protocols, and Sanskrit puja ceremonies. The event will explore how to distinguish real ET encounters from manmade craft and advance peaceful contact with advanced civilizations. "We are at a critical juncture in human history where the truth about UAPs and our contact with advanced extraterrestrial civilizations can no longer be suppressed," said Greer. The whistleblower testimony you'll hear, including Michael Herrera's extraordinary firsthand account, represents just a fraction of what courageous insiders are now willing to reveal. Together, we are opening the door to a new era of cosmic citizenship and conscious evolution." General admission tickets are $699 and include both immersive days.</p>

Philip Wyatt, a Buckhead hairdresser by trade, also has a side interest that is more unusual than, say, knitting or pickleball: He seeks spirit activity as the head of Georgia Paranormal Investigations.

The volunteer group solicits clients via social media and website georgiaparanormalinvestigations.net, though Wyatt isn't even sure calling them “clients” is proper since the group doesn't charge anything for its services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have identified a statistical connection between nuclear tests and the appearance of unidentified flying objects. Researchers analyzed astronomical images from the mid-20th century and compared them with dates of atmospheric nuclear weapon explosions. As reported by BAKU.WS with reference to Phys.org publication, within 24 hours after the tests, the probability of transient objects appearing increased by 45 percent, and each UFO report was accompanied by an 8.5 percent increase in the activity of such objects. As part of the work, researchers studied images of the starry sky taken by the Palomar Observatory from 1949 to 1957. Scientists were looking for so-called transient objects - brief flashes visible in only one image and absent in subsequent ones. Researchers emphasize that the origin of these phenomena remains a mystery. Meanwhile, theories about damaged photographic plates or the presence of atmospheric debris after explosions have been ruled out. Since observations were made before the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite in 1957, scientists consider it unlikely that the objects were of terrestrial origin. The research results were published in the journal Scientific Reports. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Turkish people on Republic Day.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A psychic who claims she “saw heaven” after dying for three minutes and later began having visions says some people's soulmates “might be a ghost” and she believes singles should be “more open” to dating spirits this Halloween. Sam O'Brien, 52, a psychic medium and healer from Berkshire, claims that during an operation when she was 21, she died and was greeted by her great-aunt in heaven, before being resuscitated. Sam, a mother to Ashton, 21, says since then she has seen spirits and received visions that she believes predicted events such as the September 11 terror attack and death of Diana, Princess of Wales. She said after “a spirit guided her” to share this gift when she was 30 years old, she turned her abilities into a full-time career, launching Angels Heavenly Healings, a space where people can receive “divine guidance” and reconnect with their loved ones. “I feel truly honoured to walk this path helping others rediscover the same love, light and connection as I do with spirits.” “Then suddenly I saw the doctors literally putting a stent in my neck from up above and suddenly I was back in my body. Sam claims she was then able to see “spirits floating around” in her day-to-day life. She also said the spirits began putting images, “like a photograph or a snapshot”, into her head, which she believes predicted events. She claims she had images relating to the New York Twin Towers terror attack, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and tsunamis weeks before they occurred. When this happens she says: “I want to tell somebody about it so it can be stopped, but it's not physically possible, because the police don't want to know – they don't believe me.” Sam, who previously worked as an interior designer, has done readings through her Angels Heavenly Healings business as a full-time job since she was 30. “I had a feeling that I could save someone's life – they were in hospital and I told their mum not to turn off the life support machine, give it a few more days, and he ended up recovering,” Sam said. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Sam claims she started seeing the numbers ‘444' everywhere, and had an “intense feeling” her brother was going to pass away. “But I feel him everyday – I believe he's still with me, and it's made me less fearful of death. “Well, I'm not scared of death at all really, I think we go to a better place and it's just a case of moving on to the next life.” “I did a reading for a woman and I kept getting this spirit coming through all the time to her, and it was like the ghost wanted to date her, she felt this intense energy,” she recalled. Sam said: “Dating today can feel soulless, so why not bring in a few actual souls? “Whether you've been ghosted or just ghost-curious, Read and Buried is about breaking the dating rules, enjoying a new experience and maybe even making a supernatural connection. “Love from a spirit is just as pure as love from a person in this world, and I think people should be more open minded about dating ghosts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the tiny town of Villisca, Iowa, one house carries a sinister secret. Stepping inside 508 East Second Street takes you back to June 12, 1912, when the home belonged to the Moore family. None of them would ever wake up again. That night, all eight would be murdered with an ax. My curiosity brought me to a tour of the home led by property manager Kelly Mattson. “This is where the Stillinger girls were found. The only way they could be identified was that their names were in their Bibles,” said Mattson. “There's actually a mark here in the wall. This one led authority to believe the killer was left-handed. It's believed that the killer hid in this attic that very night when eight different murders were committed throughout this house, going room by room, person to person—and to this day, over 100 years later, we still don't know who was behind it all. What we do know is that visitors swear they come into contact with the paranormal. “If you think of haunted, it happens. It's gotten to the point that footsteps and voices are normal—which is really crazy to say,” said Mattson. KETV's assignment editor and paranormal investigator in her own right, Victoria Holley, came along to help me identify possible spirits in the house. She came prepared with equipment that would put the Ghostbusters to shame. The idea is that spirits can manipulate energy, so if something gets close to it, it'll tell you how close and how strong the electromagnetic field is,” said Holley. Now that there was a sign that spirits might actually be in the house, it was time to try and communicate. “Is anyone in the room with us?” I asked. “Do you want me to leave?” I questioned again. I was left with the sound of static. I was down to one last tool. Similar to the radio, I'd ask a question, and it would talk back. “Do you know what happened in this house?” I asked. Again, it seemed like we might be making progress, sending me the signal that something was important. I stopped receiving answers from the devices While we may not have actually seen any ghosts during our stay at the house, we felt their presence in every room.
