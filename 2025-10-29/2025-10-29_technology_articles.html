Customers can attempt to use programmatic methods (PowerShell, CLI, etc.) Our anonymous payroll tech from earlier has confirmed that system access is slowly being restored as Microsoft rolls out its fix. According to Microsoft's 2025 Work Trend Index, business leaders are already gaining a competitive edge with human-agent teams, modern cloud infrastructure, and bold transformation. As you can see that's pretty great news, and a promising sign that Microsoft is on its way to restoring normal service. We have initiated the deployment of our last known good configuration, which is expected to complete within 30 minutes. As this deployment progresses, customers should begin to see initial signs of recovery. Customer configuration changes will remain temporarily blocked while we continue mitigation efforts. We will notify customers once this block has been lifted. Some customers may also have experienced issues accessing the Azure management portal. We have failed the portal away from AFD to mitigate these access issues. Customers should now be able to access the Azure portal directly, and while most portal extensions are functioning as expected, a small number of endpoints (e.g., Marketplace) may still experience intermittent loading problems. We do not yet have an ETA for full mitigation, but we will provide another update within 30 minutes, once the deployment has completed. Customers may also consider implementing failover strategies using Azure Traffic Manager to redirect traffic from Azure Front Door to their origin servers as an interim measure.

It really makes a strong case for switching to Linux or another operating system that still respects user choice and allows local accounts." And just like that, Microsoft is working on a fix: "We have initiated the deployment of our 'last known good' configuration. This is expected to be fully deployed in about 30 minutes from which point customers will start to see initial signs of recovery. Once this is completed, the next stage is to start to recover nodes while we route traffic through these healthy nodes. Customer configuration changes will remain blocked during this time as we work towards mitigation. We will communicate to customers when this block is reverted.

Per Microsoft's own status history, today's outage would mark the third Azure incident in October alone, and the second related to Azure Front Door. On October 9 AFD experienced issued in Africa, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East. An Azure portal outage on the same day impacted approximately 45% of customers . Reader Christopher from Palm Beach, Florida, has been in touch to confirm that the ongoing outage has made it impossible to set up his new Lenovo Yoga 9i Pro. Turns out Christopher is on his third Windows laptop in a week as he tries to pry himself away from his M1 Pro MacBook Pro. Then I got the Lenovo Legion, which was powerful but too bulky for my needs — and again, the speakers were disappointing," buying advice to live by if anyone needs it. "So when the Yoga 9i Pro started acting up during setup, I almost rushed back to Best Buy in a panic, thinking it was a sign I shouldn't be switching to Windows at all." Thankfully, Christopher now knows that the Azure outage is to blame, so don't return it just yet! One reader who wished to remain anonymous has been in touch to confirm they're a tech lead on the implementation team for "one of the big payroll providers." "It's a great time with our client's processing payroll," they remarked sarcastically. Microsoft has confirmed it doesn't have an ETA for a resolution to the outage, but has one support pointer for affected customers. Microsoft has confirmed that the outage is a 'Critical' incident across all of the aforementioned regions for both Azure Front door and Network Infrastructure. A quick glance at Downdetector reveals just how many facets of the internet rely on critical cloud infrastructure that can fail at a moment's notice. For instance, Minecraft users are reporting issues connecting to servers, while BT customers in the UK can't use their emails, and for those doing online grocery shopping, it's websites that are failing. We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue. We are taking several concurrent actions: Firstly, where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services, this includes customer configuration changes as well. Customers may have experienced problems accessing the Azure management portal. Customers should be able to access the Azure management portal directly, while all portal extensions are working correctly there may be a small number of endpoints that might have a problem loading (i.e. Microsoft has confirmed that Azure is suffering 'Critical' issues in every region it serves: "Due to a global outage impacting the Microsoft Azure platform where several Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines services are hosted, we are currently experiencing a disruption to key systems, including our websites. "For our guests who are unable to check-in online due to the Microsoft Azure outage, please see an agent at the airport for a boarding pass, and allow for some extra time in the lobby. Due to a global outage impacting the Microsoft Azure platform where several Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines services are hosted, we are currently experiencing a disruption to key systems, including our websites. Indeed, there's a huge Downdetector spike on Minecraft denoting an outage, too. Microsoft 365 has confirmed that as a result of the ongoing Azure issue, it's 365 services are currently having. It says that it has identified internal infrastructure having connectivity issues and is "unblocking these systems and redistributing traffic to support recovery, as we continue our work to reroute affected traffic to restore service health." More details can be found in the Service Health Dashboard under MO1181369.October 29, 2025 We're investigating an issue impacting Azure Front Door services. Microsoft is hosting its quarterly earnings call today, which makes this Azure outage especially galling for the folks at Redmond. Hence an outage of this nature has such a large knock-on effect. Turns out early speculation of an AWS outage may have been misplaced, as an ongoing Microsoft Azure outage appears to be to blame for current internet troubles. In addition, customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal. Customers can attempt to use programmatic methods (PowerShell, CLI, etc.) We are actively assessing failover options of internal services from our AFD infrastructure. Our investigation into the contributing factors and additional recovery workstreams continues. More information will be provided within 60 minutes or sooner. This message was last updated at 17:04 UTC on 29 October 2025 You might be wondering how a large part of the internet can just suddenly break. Well fortunately we have an example from... *checks notes* four days ago to call upon. A similar number of services, including massive names, are likewise affected in the U.S.: Here's a list of the biggest ones so far: With the outage in its very early stages, there's no word from AWS's Service Health web page to denote any issues. The latest reports indicate that AWS is indeed down somewhere. This is exactly the kind of Downdetector spike we'd expect to see when something goes wrong with AWS, with services affected roughly mirroring the previous outage, which happened just a few days ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An outage on Microsoft's Azure cloud services Wednesday morning disrupted operations for customers worldwide including Alaska Airlines, Xbox users and 365 subscribers. The incident strikes just ahead of Microsoft's quarterly earnings call today and follows last week's outage at Amazon Web Services and a failure of Alaska Airlines' own data center technology. The latest outage struck at 9 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, according to Microsoft, when the system “began experiencing Azure Front Door (AFD) issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue. “We are taking several concurrent actions: Firstly, where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services, this includes customer configuration changes as well. Alaska Airlines posted on X at 10:33 a.m., explaining that the Azure outage was disrupting systems including their website function. Microsoft did not indicate when the issue would be resolved. The company operates a hybrid infrastructure, blending its own data centers with third-party cloud platforms.

The founder said that ElevenLabs plans to launch partnerships with other companies and work with open source technologies to see if the company can combine its audio expertise with some of the expertise of other models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's rare for a tech executive to cue up a video mocking themselves — but that's just what Microsoft President Brad Smith did on Tuesday at the Cascadia Innovation Corridor conference in Seattle. Smith played a clip from The Daily Show in which comedian Jon Stewart lampooned his and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's interviews about AI's impact on jobs. The segment poked fun at the idea that displaced workers might become “prompt engineers” — a new job Stewart rebranded as “types questions guy.” It was a self-aware feature of a talk that balanced enthusiasm for artificial intelligence's potential with sober reflections on its hype and potential pitfalls. He said AI will transform sectors including health, education, biotech, aerospace, agriculture, climate and others. Chris Gregoire, who leads the Cascadia Innovation Corridor group, kicked off the day by calling AI “a defining technology of our generation.” Smith, who in his three decades at Microsoft has witnessed tech bubbles and bursts, also offered a “breadth of perspective” on AI that he hinted might be lacking in Silicon Valley. “That is exciting, but I don't want to just be another tech bro who says, ‘Hey, great, here it comes. AI-driven employment threats are becoming increasingly real in the tech sector and beyond. Amazon on Tuesday announced a huge round of layoffs, slashing 14,000 corporate and tech jobs. The cuts aren't all tied to AI, but many executives are talking about worker efficiency gains thanks to the tech. Despite the recent layoffs, many industry and elected leaders in the Cascadia region, which stretches from Vancouver, B.C., through Seattle and down to Portland, see AI as a promising economic engine that can build on the area's strong tech foundation. But Smith — who manages to strike a persona blending tech evangelist, politician and favorite uncle —  also acknowledged concerns about disparities in AI access, whether looking locally at rural versus urban divides, or the gap between AI use in affluent and low-income countries that lack widespread electricity and internet connections. Are we trying to build machines that will help people become smarter and better?” he asked. “If the experience that we've all had with social media over the last 15 years teaches us anything at all,” Smith continued, “it is that the best time to ask these questions and to debate them is before technology answers them for us.” Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover? ‘We better wake up': Microsoft's Brad Smith sounds alarm as state enacts controversial tax plan</p>

A YouTube creator's videos, posted just days apart and demonstrating how to bypass Microsoft's Windows 11 limitations, were removed for allegedly violating the platform's community guidelines. However, he also said that he hoped his next video, which showed how to bypass Windows 11's hardware requirements, wouldn't get flagged. Sure enough, Rich posted another YouTube video complaining exactly about this. He changed his tune this time, though, alleging Microsoft is likely behind the action. If they don't want these types of videos on their platform, then we won't make those types of videos on their platform,” said Rich. It would just be nice to know if this is actually what YouTube wants, because again, they're unwilling to tell me what I did wrong. When he appealed the decision, the response was “Again, the warning strike you received was issued based on a violation of Harmful or Dangerous Content which prohibits content that encourages or promotes behavior that encourages dangerous or illegal activities that risk serious physical harm or death.” This reason does not make sense — after all, bypassing Microsoft's account requirement for Windows 11 and installing the operating system on a computer that does not have TPM 2.0 definitely doesn't risk physical harm or death, although the exact legality of it does vary by local law. After all, this isn't like the multiple instances where Nintendo requested emulation videos to be taken down, which are on the murkier side of copyright law. It could either be an overzealous AI working behind the scenes at YouTube or Microsoft quietly asking YouTube to remove videos that would bypass its Windows 11 requirements. But without confirmation from either company, we can only guess the real reason why they were removed. It's unfortunate timing for Microsoft, which has been encouraging its customers to upgrade from Windows 10 as the operating system's support ends. Windows 11 requirements, both hardware- and account-wise, are turning off a lot of people, with some who can afford new hardware to upgrade opting for Macs and MacBooks instead of the Copilot+ PCs that Redmond has been pushing since last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I use AI tools now and run lots of 'deep research' prompts before making decisions, but I definitely miss the 'community aspect' of niche subreddits, with their messiness and turf wars. I miss them because I barely go on reddit anymore (except r/LocalLLaMA and other tech heavy subs), most of the content is just obviously bot generated, which is just depressing. At least the response doesn't have an ad injected between each paragraph and is intentionally padded out so you scroll past more ads……yet. Wouldn't know about this thanks to old.reddit.com - once that's gone I don't see much reason to use Reddit. Deep Research is quietly the coolest product to come out of the whole GenAI gold rush.The google version of Deep Research still searches 50+ websites, but I find it's quality far inferior to that of OpenAI's version.

The problem is that eventually someone tells the engineers behind products to start "value engineering" things, and there's no way to reliably keep track of those efforts over time when looking at a product online.

If OpenAI or the other players are pushed toward expanding to ads because their valuation is too high, smaller players, or open source solutions, can fill the gap, providing untainted LLMs. It isn't like Google search where the moat is impossibly huge, it is tiny, and if someones service gets caught injecting shit like that into prompts people can jump ship with almost no impact. It was even more impressive because the situation involved two airlines, a codeshare arrangement, three jurisdictions, and two differing regulations. I had even tried using a few airline compensation companies (like AirHelp, which I had successfully used in the past) but they blew me off.I then turned to ChatGPT and explained the complete situation. It reasoned through the interplay of these jurisdictions and bureaucracies. At that point, airline support became compliant and agreed to pay the requested compensation.Bureaucracy, information overload and our ignorance of our own rights: this is what information asymmetry looks like. This is what airlines, insurance, the medical industry and other such businesses rely on to deny us our rights and milk us for money. On the flip side, other companies like AirHelp rely on the specialized knowledge required to navigate these bureaucracies to get you what you're owed (and take a cut. )I don't see either of these strategies lasting long in the age of AI, and as TFA shows, we're getting there fast.ProTip: Next time an airline delay causes you undue expenses, contact their support and use the magic words “Article 19 of the Montreal Convention”.

If the job market is representative of this then we can see that as both sides uses it and are getting better it's becoming an arms race. Looking for a job two years ago using ChatGPT was the perfect timing but not any more. The current situation is more applications per position and thus longer decision time. I'm afraid the current situation, which as described in the article is favorable to customers, is not going to last and might even reverse.

Longer term, there is a real danger that asymmetry will increase. Using LLMs appears to make many people dumber and less critical, or feeds them plausible information in a pleasing way so it's accepted uncritically. Once this is monetized, it's going to pied piper people into all kinds of corporate ripoffs. With LLMs you can know both.For most anything from kitchen renovations to A/C installation to Car servicing - you can now get an exacat idea on details and process. And you can negotiate on both.You can also know how much "work" contractors have at this time which gives you more leverage.For anything above $1000 in spend, learn about it from your LLM first.

From books and guides at the library and bookstore, to "This Old House" and "Click and Clack" we have been distributing the knowledge of how to do things for a long time.The internet just made all of that knowledge much easier to access, with the time/cost/distance dependency being removed.Have Americans become less capable over time? Or are we just more aware of the portion of the population who simply does not put in the leg work to DIY things?Maybe a bit of both, with a lean into those who do not know having a larger voice. As an example I saw a video yesterday of someone being a "full on foodie" followed up by someone who was calling an onion "garlic".Does an LLM really change what COULD have always been done, or just make it more accessible for those of us who do/want to have the tool?

Information asymmetry is only valuable if you can execute on it. HVAC, there's typically only a few legitimate licensed providers in town so they can set the price however they want. Car servicing, indie shops are always better but if you want to maintain your warranty you'll need to use a stealership which goes by a book (and it's mandatory).I'm not convinced an LLM can help with these situations. When I shopped for a new HVAC after mine gave up the ghost after 20 years most providers were within a few hundred dollars of each other. An LLM would've been useful here for warnings ("you probably dont need ducting", "you probably don't need duct cleaning") but as for the bulk of the cost there's a monopoly and there ain't nothin you can do about it. When I got my yard worked on it was a similar story. Despite every landscaper providing offers from cheap to absurd, the ones that I could sue if they hit a gas line were all within the same price range.These people are also very used to the "know-it-all homeowner". For example, an LLM could be trained on medical billing codes and be able to analyze your bills for improperly coded procedures (very common). I'm not convinced an LLM can help with these situations.

For example, an LLM could be trained on medical billing codes and be able to analyze your bills for improperly coded procedures (very common). I think, rather, LLMs will be extremely useful in bill negotiation where the data is absolutely clear, you have a copy of it, and it can be analyzed in full (no asymmetry). For example, an LLM could be trained on medical billing codes and be able to analyze your bills for improperly coded procedures (very common). But regardless, this arms race doesn't happen because the vast majority of people are bad at prompting models, and when you start writing prompts with spelling errors and other grammar issues, your model responds with low quality, wronger outputs just to punish you for your lack of attention to detail. Stuff like this can't be stopped by new technology for long. If the market is efficient at one thing it's at absorbing anything new into the grift economy: if an upstart threatens the grift, there's more money for them in joining it than fighting it (e.g almost every startup acquihire). Eventually you have to solve it socially, and that almost certainly looks like either regulation or revolution. A lot of what LLMs help with is useless processes and paperwork that exists solely and purposefully as an impediment, when regulating against something is unpopular or prohibited. Out from curiosity I ran though an LLM on it, that pointed out it was full of traps, salary frozen for three years, massive financial penalties on leaving (getting fired with reason, getting fired without reason, leaving on the wrong date, etc), half a week unpaid overwork monthly added back (it was advertised as a 35 hours position and they asked the salary expectation accordingly - then in the contract they added back 5 hours weekly, unpaid), company can deduct money from your salary based on their claims, pre-contractual intellectual property claims, etc.There were even discrepancies between the German and English text (the English introduced a new condition in a penalty clause on leaving), that could have been nearly impossible to spot without an LLM (or an expensive lawyer).In hindsight many red flags were obvious, but LLMs are great to balance out the information asymmetry that some companies try to leverage against employers.

They'll definitely give you an answer, whether it's good or correct, who knows. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zfN9wnPvU0Technology changes, but on average human-beings do not.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real life might have just created the perfect opening to a horror movie. The truck was loaded with rhesus monkeys from Tulane University when it overturned, setting them free. Soon after the incident, law enforcement officials warned residents to stay far clear of any escapees, noting that the monkeys weighed about 40 pounds (about a typical medium-sized dog) and were capable of attacking people. “Do not approach the monkeys if you see one. They do pose potential health threats and are aggressive,” the department wrote in its initial statement to the public. The department is reportedly now in contact with an animal disposal company to help handle the monkeys that were killed. Officials first stated that one monkey was on the loose. South Carolina Residents Told to Secure Their Homes After 43 Monkeys Escape Lab Jasper County officials also originally stated that the monkeys were carrying various diseases: hepatitis C, herpes, and covid-19. But in a statement to Gizmodo, a Tulane University representative said that the monkeys were not infected with anything. “Non-human primates at the Tulane National Biomedical Research Center are provided to other research organizations to advance scientific discovery. The primates in question belong to another entity and are not infectious. We are actively collaborating with local authorities and will send a team of animal care experts to assist as needed,” the spokesperson said. Whatever the case, it's generally a smart idea to not interact with escaped lab animals, even if they aren't actively carrying any dangerous germs. So if you're somewhere around the central eastern region of Mississippi, for the love of god, do not try to make friends with any monkeys you happen to spot out there. The last thing we need is a real-life remake of 1995's Outbreak, starring Dustin Hoffman, Rene Russo, and a fresh-faced Cuba Gooding Jr. New research may have narrowed down the optimal length for your daily walks. New research continues to show that many people meet the criteria for obesity and associated health problems, even if their BMI looks fine. Severe diverticulitis is becoming a bigger issue for people under 50. The link between social media use and poorer wellbeing is modest and shaped by our genetics, researchers in the Netherlands argue. There's nothing scarier than a pesky eye infection.</p>

There are a lot of good uses for this technology, we just need to solve the political problems of aggressive copyright, TIVOization, etc. The secure enclave and secure boot is perfect for this, even if my computer gets malware they won't be able to access it, and even if someone gets physical access to my computer, they won't be able to boot their OS from a USB. No need for the keys or decryption to touch easily intercepted and rowhammered RAM. Mainstream media including video games are often contractually protected: you must not let it run/play on any device without sufficient hardware protections.

LEGO sets capturing iconic locations have always commanded premium prices which makes it difficult for fans to justify spending hundreds on a single model. The Harry Potter iconic Hogwarts Castle and Grounds set normally retails at $169, putting it out of reach for many collectors who want that perfect centerpiece. Amazon just slashed the price to $135 in what appears to be an early Black Friday move (20% off) and its beats LEGO's official store to the punch: The official LEGO website hasn't rolled out its Black Friday deals yet, and gives Amazon shoppers a crucial head start on securing this 2,660-piece architectural masterpiece before stock evaporates. These include the Chamber of Secrets with its snake imagery, the Winged Key room where countless enchanted keys soar, Snape's Potions classroom with its dungeon feel, and the Wizard's Chessboard chamber where Ron makes his brave sacrifice. These mini interior sections attach to the underside of the display base and add layers of storytelling that aren't immediately visible but reward close inspection. The Beauxbatons carriage flies above on a clear stand, pulled by two Abraxan winged horses made from unexpected white leaf pieces. Olive green pieces form grassy areas around the castle, while dark tan grille slopes outline walking paths along the cliffs. The build process will take about six to eight hours and includes 22 numbered bags. Some advanced building techniques are used, including SNOT methods for the Astronomy Tower and asymmetrical details that require attention during assembly. The compact scale means many pieces are smaller than typical LEGO elements, so careful attention is needed to avoid mistakes that can be frustrating to fix later. At about 5 cents per brick with this discount, the set offers great value for a licensed Harry Potter product. LEGO Harry Potter sets usually have high prices due to the franchise's popularity, which makes this offer stand out even more. However, warning signs are flashing: LEGO advent calendars sold out within hours after their promotional pricing went live on Amazon. Harry Potter is one of LEGO's best-selling lines which means this castle will likely sell quickly once word spreads about the discount.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It was nothing special, but after pulling up a transcript, highlighting the text, and choosing from a list of preset emotions, the vocal performance completely changed. Adobe calls it “Corrective AI,” and it's one of many features the company will demo later today during its MAX Sneaks showcase, which takes place during the broader annual MAX conference. (Adobe paid for a portion of my travel expenses to attend its MAX conference.) Sneaks is where Adobe shows off future technologies and prototypes it's working on, and many of these features eventually make their way into Adobe's full creative suite within a matter of months. During MAX this year, Adobe released generative speech for Firefly, which allows you to not only use several preset voices but also add emotion tags to change inflection. This Corrective AI feature brings that functionality to a more practical workflow. Adobe's Lee Brimelow also showed me how AI can extract different parts of a single audio track to create multiple. The Sneaks prototype, called Project Clean Take, is limited to five tracks, but it can separate voices, ambient noise, sound effects, and more. Even better, Adobe showed me how you could bring it back by individually adjusting the levels of these split-up tracks. It's no secret that unlicensed music is a quick route to a copyright strike through the automated systems on platforms like YouTube. In the demo, Adobe's AI model was able to separate the music, replace it with a similar track from Adobe Stock, and apply effects to give it the reverb and ambiance of the original track, all with a few clicks. These features leverage AI to fix day-to-day problems for video editors and creators, helping restore broken audio or save the time and hassle of re-recording a vocal performance. Adobe will show off new generative AI features during its Sneaks showcase, too. For sound designers, the company showed me how its AI model can automatically analyze and add sound effects to a video, all of which it claims are AI-generated yet commercially safe to use. The AI model analyzed the video and broke it down into scenes, applying emotional tags and a description of each scene. The AI model picked up on a scene with an alarm clock, for instance, and automatically created a sound effect. The alarm sound wasn't realistic, and in a scene where two characters were hugging, the AI model added an unnatural rustling of clothes that didn't work. Instead of manually editing, Adobe used a conversational interface (like ChatGPT) to describe changes. These experimental features aren't available, but they usually work their way into Adobe's suite. For instance, Harmonize, a feature in Photoshop that automatically places assets with accurate color and lighting in a scene, was shown at Sneaks last year. Adobe's announcement comes mere months after video game voice actors ended a nearly year-long strike to secure protections around AI—companies are required to get consent and provide disclosure agreements when game developers want to recreate a voice actor's voice or likeness through AI. Voice actors have been bracing for the impact AI will have on the business for some time now, and Adobe's new features, even if they're not generating a voice-over from scratch, are yet another marker of the shift AI is forcing on the creative industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Radu Jude is the internet's favorite filmmaker. In 2021, the Romanian writer-director bagged the prestigious Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival for Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, a black comedy about a school teacher whose career is threatened when a hardcore porno she makes with her husband goes viral. His follow-up, 2023's Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World, nailed a different strain of post-Covid alienation. Its heroine, Angela (Ilinca Manolache), toils away 9 to 5 making shady workplace safety videos for a faceless multinational while moonlighting on TikTok, pretending to be a misogynist influencer (modeled after Romania's own model of toxic masculinity, Andrew Tate). Despite their regional particularities—unfolding across what he calls “the margins of Europe”—Jude's films reflect an anxious feeling that is increasingly global: the derangement of being jacked into the internet, 24/7. With their mix of high intellectual pontification and vulgar low-humor, Jude has won over audiences at film festivals and art-houses who vibe on his absurd, caustic, somewhat doomer-ish wavelength, which vibrates somewhere between Jean-Luc Godard and Beavis and Butt-Head. With his latest film, Dracula, Jude seems intent on challenging, and even alienating, his most devoted admirers. Opening in theaters October 29, Dracula takes the myth of the uniquely Romanian monster and feeds it into an AI generator—figuratively, and literally. The film is structured around a filmmaker (Adonis Tanta) tasked with making a blockbuster vampire film. Bereft of ideas, he provides an artificial intelligence app a series of prompts, and it spits out the various short (and not-so-short) films that comprise the actual movie. In one vignette, an actor in a pornographic stage production of Dracula is hunted down by a mob of tourists. In another, the Count plays as a maniacal boss overseeing a workshop of tech workers. There is plenty of blood and gore. Clocking in at nearly three hours and abounding with actual AI images (of Count Dracula, of the Romanian warlord Vlad Tepes that inspired the famous vampire, and much, much else), the film seems almost deliberately enervating. In a climate where many in the film and creative industries see generative AI as an affront to both the medium and their careers, Jude's use of the technology has proved contentious. When he appeared via Zoom following a screening at the recent New York Film Festival, framed by an AI-generated backdrop, one skeptical cinephile snarked that Jude himself was officially “on fraud watch.” Jude finds himself in the exact sort of knot his movies tend to draw tighter and tighter. His films have previously used mock-executions to explore the repression of historical memory, pornography to expose the cultural hypocrisy around adult sexuality, and misogynist posturing to grapple with the appeal of such postures. Or—as some purists believe—is stooping to use the technology at all a betrayal of cinema and the human creative spirit itself? To figure this out, WIRED spoke to Jude, who appeared from France via Zoom, backgrounded by an AI-generated image of Donald Trump brandishing an AR-15 rifle while riding a cartoon kitty cat. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Radu Jude: I used this image at a European festival, where I was asked to give an online talk. This image was shared by Trump himself, when he was campaigning as the defender of cats and dogs. Dracula opens with this director who can't think of any ideas for a Dracula movie. When ChatGPT appeared I had this idea of structuring the movie around that. I tried a few scenarios with ChatGPT, I tried to get it to make a Dracula porn film set in Auschwitz, and it rejected it. So I thought I could jump in and make things that the machine wouldn't do. I felt entitled to do it, without being aware that in some more important culture industries, like in the United States, it's a big issue. But it also came from a curiosity of how they work. Did you also feel entitled because you were satirizing AI images and even showing off how gross they are? I'm sure you know, or have at least discovered making festival appearances, that among certain people in the film industry, there's a hard line with AI. They don't want you to use it, even if you're making fun of it. You know, Romania is a tiny country with a nonexistent film industry, basically on the margins of Europe. But I respect any perspective on this. If you don't want to use this, or even reject it, that's fine. But I'm trying to put it in balance. Pissing people off a little bit doesn't seem to bother you. I wouldn't phrase it quite like that. I would say it's normal and healthy if a work of art provokes different kinds of reactions—including rejection. That's the only domain in our existence where backlash, or conflict, gives way to good things. In war, of course, it's not like that. In art, the exercise of engaging in something different—and even rejecting, or being violent against it, or accepting it with a certain gusto—is good. Every emotion is good, and there's really no hierarchy to that. I think there's a human need to be appreciated. But I also think that to be rejected is part of the appreciation, in a way. I want to know about the process of actually generating these images. Again, I can't think of a better word than “gross.” There's an irony here, because AI images always aspire to hyperrealism. But there is always an element of kitsch to them or an element of really bad taste. But if you go to the other extreme and accept the bad images, you might find some images that are not photorealistic but have a certain poetry because of their errors. You have to really spend a bit of time and say, Oh my god, this is not only ugly and gross and slimy, but it is something that has a certain digital poetry. AI poetry, maybe it can be named. Like they're the product of a monstrous mind. But the fact that it's generated by a machine doesn't change it that much. But of course it's a different ontological thing. About those ontological differences: You've talked before about the “empire of images,” where great works of cinema and Renaissance masterpieces and TikTok videos and AI slop all belong to the same domain. They're all, in some way, the same. What do you mean by the “empire of images”? Maybe I was wrong to say they're the same. The composer John Cage is a big influence on me. He had the same attitude toward sounds. [He believed] there are no bad sounds. If you listen to the rain, it's music. If you listen to traffic, it's music. To discover that sounds are beautiful like that, I think you need a certain openness. And I think that's another way to enjoy life. Instead of saying, “Oh there's so many ugly things! Where is the beauty in our world? !” If you consider all those things as worthy of interest, then I think we have a better enjoyment of life. In the film, one character quotes the line from Marx's Capital, comparing capitalism to vampirism. Do you view AI technology as similarly vampiric, taking the creative labor of other artists and sapping it? I think it's the perfect metaphor for AI. And one of the big problems that this technology has. I used AI for this film because it seemed like the perfect match. I understand there is a backlash in the United States. I'm in the middle of a new film right now that doesn't use a second of AI. But I'm also finishing the postproduction on a short film that uses an AI-generated voice reciting some Dante poems. I don't have an intention for my next project to use it, necessarily. Here there's a great suspicion about it. People here are very vigilant about AI. There's a lot of money involved, millions and billions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIT Technology Review's highly subjective take on the latest buzz about AI Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn't always easy. “Optimization,” “scaling,” and “maximizing efficiency” are convenient buzzwords bandied about to describe what AI can achieve in theory, but for most of AI companies' eager customers, the hundreds of billions of dollars they're pumping into the industry aren't adding up. This month's news doesn't exactly cast the technology in a glowing light either. A bunch of NGOs and aid agencies are using AI models to generate images of fake suffering people to guilt their Instagram followers. AI translators are pumping out low-quality Wikipedia pages in the languages most vulnerable to going extinct. And thanks to the construction of new AI data centers, lots of neighborhoods living in their shadows are getting forced into their own sort of pivots—fighting back against the power blackouts and water shortages the data centers cause. Some therapists are using AI during therapy sessions. They're risking their clients' trust and privacy in the process. Machine translators have made it easier than ever to create error-plagued Wikipedia articles in obscure languages. What happens when AI models get trained on junk pages?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instead of using text tokens, the Chinese AI company is packing information into images. Released last week, the optical character recognition (OCR) model works by extracting text from an image and turning it into machine-readable words. This is the same technology that powers scanner apps, translation of text in photos, and many accessibility tools. OCR is already a mature field with numerous high-performing systems, and according to the paper and some early reviews, DeepSeek's new model performs on par with top models on key benchmarks. Currently, most large language models break text down into thousands of tiny units called tokens. This turns the text into representations that models can understand. When a user chats with an AI for lengthy periods, this challenge can cause the AI to forget things it's been told and get information muddled, a problem some call “context rot.” The new methods developed by DeepSeek (and published in its latest paper) could help to overcome this issue. Instead of storing words as tokens, its system packs written information into image form, almost as if it's taking a picture of pages from a book. Essentially, the OCR model is a test bed for these new methods that permit more information to be packed into AI models more efficiently. Besides using visual tokens instead of just text tokens, the model is built on a type of tiered compression that is not unlike how human memories fade: Older or less critical content is stored in a slightly more blurry form in order to save space. Despite that, the paper's authors argue, this compressed content can still remain accessible in the background while maintaining a high level of system efficiency. Text tokens have long been the default building block in AI systems. Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI chief and a founding member of OpenAI, praised the paper on X, saying that images may ultimately be better than text as inputs for LLMs. Text tokens might be “wasteful and just terrible at the input,” he wrote. Manling Li, an assistant professor of computer science at Northwestern University, says the paper offers a new framework for addressing the existing challenges in AI memory. “While the idea of using image-based tokens for context storage isn't entirely new, this is the first study I've seen that takes it this far and shows it might actually work,” Li says. The method could open up new possibilities in AI research and applications, especially in creating more useful AI agents, says Zihan Wang, a PhD candidate at Northwestern University. The technique can also be used to produce more training data for AI models. Model developers are currently grappling with a severe shortage of quality text to train systems on. Future work, she says, should explore how to make AI's memory fade in a more dynamic way, akin to how we can recall a life-changing moment from years ago but forget what we ate for lunch last week. Currently, even with DeepSeek's methods, AI tends to forget and remember in a very linear way—recalling whatever was most recent, but not necessarily what was most important, she says. Despite its attempts to keep a low profile, DeepSeek, based in Hangzhou, China, has built a reputation for pushing the frontier in AI research. They're risking their clients' trust and privacy in the process. Machine translators have made it easier than ever to create error-plagued Wikipedia articles in obscure languages.
