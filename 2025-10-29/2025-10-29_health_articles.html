                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study by the Hebrew University has developed a rapid imaging method that reveals how drugs move through the skin, in just ten minutes. By combining mass spectrometry imaging with an automated analysis tool, the technique maps medication distribution across skin layers without dyes or labels. Tested on antifungal treatments, it offers a faster, more precise way to design safer and more effective topical and transdermal therapies. Scientists at the Hebrew University's School of Pharmacy have unveiled a cutting-edge approach that could transform how we test and design topical medications, from antifungal creams to anti-aging serums. The study, led by Dr. Katy Margulis, introduces a rapid imaging technique that allows researchers to visualize, within minutes, how drugs move through and settle in the skin's layers. Delivering drugs through the skin requires remarkable precision. Until now, measuring exactly how far a compound travels beneath the skin was a tedious process, often taking days and relying on indirect fluorescent methods. Dr. Margulis and her team developed a new mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) method combined with an automated computational tool that can analyze drug distribution within a skin sample in under ten minutes. This approach gives us a clear, label-free snapshot of where a drug actually goes once applied to the skin. Using their new imaging workflow, they compared how effectively each system delivered terbinafine through human and animal skin and discovered striking differences between the systems in depth and extent of drug permeation as well as the drug's skin distribution patterns. Traditional methods for assessing drug permeation could take days, requiring labor-intensive image analysis. The automated clustering tool developed by the researchers reduces that process to minutes, enabling rapid testing of multiple formulations and facilitating time-sensitive studies. The innovation also supports kinetic research, allowing scientists to track how fast and how deep a drug moves through the skin. "We can now monitor drug absorption in near real time," says Dr. Margulis. "This opens the door to time-sensitive treatments and more precise dosing." The study not only enhances pharmaceutical development but also advances the broader goal of precision medicine, which aims at tailoring treatments based on individual biology. By making it possible to map drug distribution so rapidly and accurately, the new method could eventually support personalized skincare or medical creams adjusted for a patient's specific skin type or condition. "This tool allows for smarter, safer, and more efficient formulation testing," says Margulis. "Ultimately, it helps bring better products to patients faster."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daily interactions with friends, even through something as simple as a text message, may reduce momentary loneliness for caregivers tending to a family member with dementia. Providing care for a loved one with dementia can be a difficult burden to bear, and caregivers can be especially vulnerable to loneliness. But social interactions, no matter how small, with friends and other family members can lower feelings of loneliness. Crystal Ng, a research fellow at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, and colleagues studied 223 dementia caregivers, who reported their social interactions and loneliness every three hours over five days-showing that when caregivers interacted with friends, they also reported lower levels of loneliness. We found that caregivers reported having interactions with friends in more than 20% of their waking survey prompts. And these interactions, particularly positive ones, even with not-so-close friends, are related to lower momentary loneliness in daily life." According to Ng, the effect was particularly pronounced among caregivers with particularly difficult care responsibilities, or "high-burden" caregivers. "Interacting with friends appears to be particularly important for high-burden caregivers, and that could be the case because higher-burden caregivers are more at risk of being socially isolated and feeling lonely," she said. "This study captured the dynamic fluctuations of loneliness," she said. "Sending a text to a friend or making the time to get in touch with them can make caregivers feel less lonely and foster a sense of connection amid the burden of dementia. Interventions that encourage caregivers to schedule social interactions with friends in daily life can give them a much-needed emotional lift."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from the University of Birmingham shows that eating flavanol-rich foods-like tea, berries, apples, and cocoa-can protect vascular health in men from the harmful effects of prolonged sitting. Sedentary behavior is prevalent in modern societies; it is estimated that young adults sit for approximately six hours a day, but sitting for long periods induces declines in vascular function. Previous studies have shown that a 1% reduction in vascular function, as measured by brachial Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), which measures the elasticity of the arteries, leads to a 13% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, such as heart disease, strokes, and heart attacks. The researchers wanted to explore if there was a way that diet, particularly foods that are high in flavanols, could help protect against the risk to our vascular system associated with periods of uninterrupted sitting. Flavanols are a type of polyphenol compound that occur naturally in some fruits, tea, and nuts, and cocoa beans. They have been shown to have cardiovascular health benefits, such as protecting the vascular system during periods of mental stress. Dr. Catarina Rendeiro, Assistant Professor in Nutritional Sciences at the University of Birmingham, and leading author, said: "Whether we are sitting at desks, behind the wheel of a car, on a train, or on the sofa reading a book or watching TV, we all spend a lot of time seated. Finding ways to mitigate the impact that sitting for uninterrupted periods has on our vascular system could help us cut the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases." In addition, recent studies have found that cardiovascular diseases cost the UK an estimated £29 billion. The researchers tested whether consuming flavanols just before two hours of sitting could preserve blood vessel function in the arms and legs. Forty young healthy men, 20 who had higher levels of fitness and 20 who had a lower level of fitness, consumed either a high-flavanol (695 mg of total flavanols per beverage) or low-flavanol cocoa drink (5.6 mg of total flavanols per beverage), before completing a two-hour sitting trial. The study was not carried out with women, as changes in oestrogen levels during the menstrual cycle are suspected to affect the impact of flavanols on vascular health during sitting. This should be the focus of another future trial. The team took a range of vascular measures before and after sitting, including: This suggests that higher levels of fitness do not provide protection from sitting. However, the research found that those groups who consumed the high-flavanol cocoa drink, again in both fitness groups, did not experience FMD declines in either of the arteries in their arms or legs. This is the first time flavanols have been shown to be effective at preventing sitting-induced vascular dysfunction, in young healthy men. Dr. Sam Lucas, Professor of Cerebrovascular, Exercise & Environmental Physiology at the University of Birmingham and co-author of the study, said: "Our experiment indicates that higher fitness levels do not prevent the temporary impairment of vascular function induced by sitting when only drinking low-flavanol cocoa. Importantly, after the high-flavanol drink, both fitter and less-fit participants kept their FMD the same as it was before sitting for two hours." There are cocoa products available in supermarkets and health stores which are processed through methods that preserve flavanol levels. Dr. Catarina Rendeiro concluded: "Our research shows that consuming high-flavanol foods and drinks during periods spent sitting down is a good way to reduce some of the impact of inactivity on the vascular system. "Given how common sedentary lifestyles have become and the increased risk this can have to vascular health, using flavanol-rich food and drink, especially in combination with breaking up periods of inactivity by going for a short walk or standing up, could be a good way to enhance long-term health, no matter the individual's fitness level."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With populations aging rapidly worldwide, heart failure has become one of the most pressing medical and social challenges. Older patients face not only a high mortality risk but also losses in muscle strength, mobility, and independence. Clinicians frequently see people who, despite optimal cardiac care, still struggle with frailty and declining physical performance. Recognizing the need for a global standard, leading experts from these groups came together to form the Global Leadership Initiative on Sarcopenia (GLIS). The GLIS model introduced a new diagnostic approach based on muscle strength, muscle mass, and muscle-specific strength, while reclassifying physical performance tests such as the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) not as diagnostic criteria but as outcomes of sarcopenia. However, it had remained unclear whether this new GLIS model could reliably predict prognosis in older patients with heart failure, or whether it truly reflects declines in physical performance. Researchers from Juntendo University, Japan, led by Dr. Taisuke Nakade, together with Dr. Daichi Maeda, Dr. Yuya Matsue, Dr. Tohru Minamino, and colleagues from multiple hospitals and universities across Japan, have offered a solution to this puzzle. "Our inspiration was to test whether this new model truly reflects what clinicians observe at the bedside-namely, functional decline and poor prognosis in older patients with heart failure-and to generate evidence that could influence both practice and international guidelines," Dr. Nakade explains. The GLIS model focuses on three core measures-muscle mass, grip strength, and muscle-specific strength-while treating walking speed and other functional tests as outcomes, thus separating diagnosis from performance. The study analyzed 891 patients aged 65 or older from the FRAGILE-HF registry, classifying them as non-sarcopenic, possible sarcopenic, or sarcopenic. Importantly, the GLIS model accurately identified patients with decreased physical performance. Even after adjusting for other risk factors, GLIS-defined sarcopenia was independently associated with a 3.4-fold higher risk of death. Compared to the conventional AWGS2019 criteria, GLIS provided superior risk reclassification, making it a more powerful tool for clinical decision-making. By diagnosing sarcopenia more accurately, clinicians can better identify those at high risk of physical decline and poor outcomes, even before symptoms become severe. The model also strengthens treatment planning, discharge decisions, and long-term care strategies. At a broader level, validating GLIS supports international standardization of sarcopenia diagnosis, promoting equitable care and paving the way for new diagnostic tools, screening devices, and digital health applications. As Dr. Nakade emphasizes, "This study showed that the newly proposed international GLIS model for sarcopenia effectively reflects both impaired physical performance and poor prognosis in older patients with heart failure." In short, the GLIS model gives doctors a practical, evidence-based approach to detect sarcopenia early, improve patient outcomes, and address one of the most urgent challenges in aging societies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Physician Lauren Hughes was heading to see patients at a clinic about 20 miles from her Denver home in February when another driver T-boned her Subaru, totaling it. "They said: 'You have this fracture and a big gaping wound in your knee. A friend took her home the next day. Surgery is typically recommended when a broken bone is deemed unlikely to heal properly with only a cast. "Sixty-three thousand dollars for a broken ankle and a cut to the knee, with no head injury or internal damage," Hughes said. Four days after her surgery, Anthem notified Hughes that after consulting clinical guidelines for her type of ankle repair, its reviewer determined it was not medically necessary for her to be fully admitted for an inpatient hospital stay. If she had needed additional surgery or had other problems, such as vomiting or a fever, an inpatient stay might have been warranted, according to the letter. Her car was in a junkyard, she had no family nearby, and she was taking opioid painkillers for the first time. When she asked for further details about medical necessity determinations, Hughes was directed deep inside her policy's benefit booklet, which outlines that, for a hospital stay, documentation must show "safe and adequate care could not be obtained as an outpatient." It turns out the surgery charges were denied because of an insurance contract quirk. Under Anthem's agreement with the hospital, all claims for services before and after a patient is admitted are approved or denied together, said Anthem spokesperson Emily Snooks. A hospital stay is not generally required after ankle surgery, and the insurer found Hughes did not need the kind of "comprehensive, complex medical care" that would necessitate hospitalization, Snooks wrote in an email to KFF Health News. "Anthem has consistently agreed that Ms. Hughes' ankle surgery was medically necessary," Snooks wrote. Facing bills from an out-of-network hospital where she was taken by emergency responders, though, Hughes did not understand why she wasn't shielded by the No Surprises Act, which took effect in 2022. The federal law requires insurers to cover out-of-network providers as though they are in-network when patients receive emergency care, among other protections. "If they had determined it was medically necessary, then they would have to apply the No Surprises Act cost," said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at Brookings. There was one more oddity in her case. During one of many calls Hughes made trying to sort out her bill, an Anthem representative told her that things might have been different had the hospital billed for her hospitalization as an overnight "observation" stay. Generally, that's when patients are kept at a facility so staff can determine whether they need to be admitted. A patient with fewer needs is more likely to be billed for an observation stay. Insurers pay hospitals less for an observation stay than admission, Fiedler said. That distinction is a big issue for patients on Medicare. Most often, the government health program will not pay for any care needed in a nursing home if the patient was not first formally admitted to a hospital for at least three days. Yet even she was frustrated during the months spent going back and forth with her insurer and the hospital — and worried when it looked like her account would be sent to a collection agency. In addition to appealing the denied claims, she sought the help of her employer's human resources department, which contacted Anthem. She also reached out to KFF Health News, which contacted Anthem and the Platte Valley Hospital. In late September, Hughes received calls from a hospital official, who told her they had "downgraded the level of care" the hospital billed her insurance for and resubmitted the claim to Anthem. In a written statement to KFF Health News, Platte Valley Hospital spokesperson Sara Quale said that the facility "deeply regrets any anxiety this situation has caused her." The hospital had "prematurely" and erroneously sent Hughes a bill before working out the balance with Anthem, she wrote. "After a careful review of Ms. Hughes' situation," Quale continued, "we have now stopped all billing to her. Furthermore, we have informed Ms. Hughes that if her insurance company ultimately assigns the remaining balance to her, she will not be billed for it." Anthem spokesperson Stephanie DuBois said in an email that Platte Valley resubmitted Hughes' bill to the insurer on Oct. 3, this time for "outpatient care services." An explanation of benefits that was sent to Hughes shows the hospital rebilled for around $61,000 — about $40,000 of which was knocked off the total by an Anthem discount. In the end, Hughes owed only a $250 copayment. There are places where patients receiving emergency care at an out-of-network hospital may fall through the cracks of federal billing protections, in particular during a phase that may be nearly indistinguishable to the patient, known as "post-stabilization." Generally, that occurs when the medical provider determines the patient is stable enough to travel to an in-network facility using nonmedical transport, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor emeritus at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. If the patient prefers to stay put for further treatment, the out-of-network provider must then ask the patient to sign a consent form, agreeing to waive billing protections and continue treatment at out-of-network rates, he said. If possible, patients should contact their insurer, in addition to asking the hospital's billing department: Are you being fully admitted, or kept under observation status, and why? Has your care been determined to be medically necessary? Keep in mind that medical necessity determinations play a key role in whether coverage is approved or denied, even after services are provided. That said, Hughes did not recall being told she was stable enough to leave with nonmedical transportation, nor being asked to sign a consent form. She said expecting patients to navigate complicated billing questions while in the hospital after a serious injury isn't realistic. "I was calling family," Hughes said, "alerting my work colleagues about what happened, processing the extent of my injuries and what needed to be done clinically, arranging care for my pet, getting labs and imaging done — coming to grips with what just happened."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Spanish review uncovers how hydroxytyrosol, the powerhouse molecule in olives, activates key brain-protective pathways, paving the way for next-generation foods that support mental and vascular health. Study: Novel Ingredients: Hydroxytyrosol as a Neuroprotective Agent; What Is New on the Horizon? Lorena Martínez-Zamora at Miguel Hernández University, Spain, recently published a review article in the journal Foods. In it, she discussed the emerging evidence on the efficacy and utility of a phenolic compound derived from olives as a neuroprotective agent. Hydroxytyrosol (HXT) is one of the most important phenolic compounds found in olives. This compound has gained significant attention during the past 20 years because of its health-promoting properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, cardio-protective, neuro-protective, cognition-enhancing, and immune-modulatory properties. Existing evidence suggests that HXT and its metabolites can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. In preclinical and mechanistic studies, the compound has been suggested to alter neuroimmune activities, activate antioxidant pathways, regulate the memory-cognition-mood axis, and interact with dopaminergic metabolism in some brain regions, including the hippocampus and cortex. HXT can protect the neurovascular system in many ways. Robust activation of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway across endothelial and neural tissues is considered a major mediator of HXT's neuroprotective function. Mechanistic evidence suggests that HXT triggers nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (a transcription factor involved in antioxidant system regulation) and upregulates Nrf2 targets in the brain, improving mitochondrial antioxidant system and reducing oxidative protein and DNA damage. Regarding neuroimmune pathways, existing evidence suggests that HXT reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines in microglial cells. Microglial cells are resident immune cells of the brain that act as macrophages to protect the brain from pathogens. HXT has also been found to suppress NF-κB/MAPK signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the brain, a central pathogenic axis produced during Parkinson's disease. These effects have been demonstrated mainly in cell and animal models, but they provide a coherent mechanistic basis for neuroprotection. The chemical structure of HXT is identical to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (DOPET), a dopamine metabolite. Both DOPET and HXT exhibit dual relevance to dopamine homeostasis through antioxidant activity that limits dopamine oxidative stress and feedback modulation of catecholamine synthesis. In stress- and toxin-based models, HXT has been found to improve motivation-related behaviors by altering mesolimbic functions. In chronic stress models, HXT has been found to increase sucrose preference, reduce immobility, augment antioxidant pathways, reduce inflammation, and improve synaptic plasticity within reward circuitry. These findings remain preclinical but suggest dopaminergic and mood-related potential worth exploring in humans. Several randomized controlled trials and pilot studies have reported that increasing exposure to pure HXT, HXT-rich olive oils, or HXT-containing foods is associated with improved cerebral blood circulation, blood-brain barrier stability, and neuroimmune modulation. Recent animal studies have suggested that HXT can significantly mitigate cognitive decline by modulating neurotrophic and inflammatory factors. However, these findings must be translated into humans for clinical implications. Recent human studies have highlighted that chronic intake of approximately 7–15 milligrams of HXT per day effectively improves vascular oxidative balance, low-grade inflammation, and endothelial function. This is consistent with enhanced attention–memory coupling and motor–cognitive integration in old adults. HXT supplementation has been found to significantly improve health-related quality of life in children with mitochondrial disease. The children have also exhibited health benefits consistent with HXT's mitochondria-supporting Nrf2-linked mechanisms relevant to neuroimmune and synaptic homeostasis. While these human data are promising, the evidence remains preliminary, and harmonized pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) studies are required to confirm clinical efficacy and establish optimal dosing strategies. Olive leaves, which contain high levels of oleuropein and HXT, are the most suitable ingredients for developing HXT-enriched ready-to-eat foods. However, both compounds impart a distinct bitter profile that can limit the acceptability of HXT-enriched foods. Some strategies can be implemented to reduce this bitterness, including cyclodextrin complexation, microencapsulation, microemulsions, and the addition of suitable flavoring agents. Some complementary routes have been developed to translate HXT into real foods. These include transfer from extra virgin olive oil by immersion, enzymatic modification of edible oils, valorization of olive by-products in beverages and baked goods, and incorporation into active packaging. Further research is needed to standardize the HXT dose and improve its bioavailability, sensory properties, and industrial stability. According to Martínez-Zamora, future work should also integrate exposure–response analytics, matrix-specific testing, and biomarker tracking to advance HXT toward claim-ready nutrition for brain health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On paper, the salary looked solid, but once Short broke it down hourly, the reality stung: his NP paycheck wasn't that much higher than what he earned as a staff nurse. If you're wanting to become an NP, it is not for money.” The latest data from AMN Healthcare shows that the average salary for NPs was $180,000 in 2024/2025 — a 9.5% increase from the previous year — but there are multiple factors that contribute to the number of zeros in an offer letter, which can lead to surprises when new NPs start negotiating their first job offers. “I did some research [on average NP salaries], but it was limited because my natural inclination was that an NP was going to make more [than a bedside nurse] because that seems like a logical progression,” Short said. A trend toward team-based health care models has led to skyrocketing demand for NPs. “[Our latest data showed] 68% of the nurse practitioner searches were in primary care and 32% were specialty searches,” Alex Herbison, vice president at AMN Healthcare, said. One report found that NPs who are paid hourly earn $6000 more annually than their salaried counterparts because there are more opportunities for hourly workers to take on additional shifts. As an RN, Ayo Adebiyi boosted her wages by working night shifts in the emergency room, and it was difficult to match that when she was negotiating her starting salary as a family NP in Merced, California. In the 28 states and territories where NPs have full practice authority, wages are higher, according to Herbison. NPs working in Washington, Oregon, and California earn mean salaries of $170,000, whereas mean salaries for NPs in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky are $143,000. Adebiyi knows that her salary is lower than that of her counterparts in San Francisco and Los Angeles, but the cost of living in Central California is much lower, too. “Looking back, I should have paid more attention to cost of living,” he said. Just as family doctors earn lower salaries than psychiatrists, cardiologists, or surgeons, NPs working in primary care have lower salaries than those who specialize. Herbison calls neurosurgery, orthopedics, dermatology, gastroenterology, and cardiology “high-revenue specialties,” and having advanced practice providers in a practice to complement the physician's efforts is driving compensation trends up. AMN Healthcare data found that salaries can reach $338,395 for specialist NPs. In outpatient settings, on-call responsibilities are often bundled into base salaries, while hospital-based or urgent care roles often offer higher pay to cover nights, weekends, or extended shifts. Herbison noted that a significant portion of the urgent care searches AMN Healthcare conducts are for NPs. “They're not necessarily on call, but they may get paid a higher rate to take that seven-to-seven role or even overnight shifts,” he said. During negotiations, starting salary figures alone can be misleading. AMN Healthcare data showed that 74% of open positions offer signing bonuses — that number was just 51% in 2023/2024, and the average signing bonus offered to NPs ranged from $2000 to $70,000. Herbison calls benefits and incentives a critical piece of the compensation puzzle, adding, “All incentives are on the table for nurse practitioners now. Relocation, [continuing education], coverage for malpractice, flexible scheduling — these are all levers practices use to stay competitive.” His employer offers perks like a continuing education allowance and covers the fees for memberships to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners and other professional organizations. For Adebiyi, the value of a role comes down to how compensation balances with workload and support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from Mayo Clinic underscores the widespread impact of menopause symptoms on midlife women - and raises concern that most are navigating this stage of life without medical care to help manage those challenges. The study, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, was based on responses from nearly 5,000 women ages 45-60 who were surveyed across four Mayo Clinic primary care locations. More than 3 out of 4 respondents experienced menopause symptoms, with many reporting substantial effects on daily life, work productivity and overall well-being. Despite the availability of safe and effective treatment options, Mayo Clinic researchers found that menopause symptoms remain underrecognized, undertreated and inadequately addressed in the health care system. Severe symptoms affect daily life, yet few women seek care or receive treatment More than one-third (34%) of women who were surveyed reported moderate to very severe symptoms. Sleep disturbances and weight gain were among the most common issues reported by more than half of participants. While many women said they preferred to manage symptoms on their own, others said that they were too busy or unaware that effective treatments exist. "Menopause is universal for women at midlife, the symptoms are common and disruptive, and yet, few women are receiving care that could help them," says lead author Ekta Kapoor, M.B.B.S., an endocrinologist and menopause specialist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Researchers call for proactive care strategies and new tools to close the treatment gap The study noted that women often do not voluntarily mention concerns about menopause symptoms to their healthcare professional. Efforts are underway to develop questionnaires, digital tools and smartphone apps that help women identify symptoms, learn about treatment options and have more productive discussions with their primary care professionals. "Our goal is to educate women and healthcare professionals about menopause," Dr. Kapoor says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze electrocardiograms (ECG) improved detection of severe heart attacks, including those that presented with unconventional symptoms, or atypical ECG patterns, and reduced false positives, according to a study published in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions and simultaneously presented at TCT 2025 in San Francisco. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a severe type of heart attack where a major coronary artery is blocked, preventing blood flow to the heart muscle. Quickly restoring blood flow, or reperfusion, using percutaneous coronary intervention is the standard of care; however, delays in achieving the guideline-recommended time to reperfusion still persist, especially at hospitals and centers not specializing in PCI and in rural areas. Time to reperfusion longer than 90 minutes is associated with threefold higher rates of mortality. "AI-driven ECG interpretation can bring the best of both worlds – identify true heart attacks early while reducing unnecessary activations," said Robert Herman, MD, PhD, lead author of the study and a cardiovascular researcher at AZORG Hospital in Aalst, Belgium. Improving the accuracy of triage at the first medical contact can streamline emergency care, reduce fatigue and strain on clinical teams, and ensure that patients who truly need urgent intervention receive it without delay." In one of the first large, real-world evaluations of an AI–based ECG model for STEMI triage in the emergency setting, researchers retrospectively looked at 1,032 patients with suspected STEMI who triggered emergency reperfusion protocols. Data was from three geographically diverse primary PCI centers between January 2020 and May 2024. Each patient's initial ECG underwent analysis by the STEMI AI ECG Model (Queen of Hearts) trained to detect acute coronary occlusion, including STEMI equivalents and differentiate from benign mimics. The AI ECG model did better than standard triage, detecting 553 of 601 confirmed STEMIs vs. 427 detected by standard triage on the initial ECG. "This technology may be especially valuable in optimizing the transfer of STEMI patients from non-PCI centers to ensure timely and appropriate care." In an accompanying editorial comment, Mohamad Alkhouli, MD, MBA, cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, said the researchers should be "commended for developing an operational AI model aimed at addressing one of the most complex and error-prone aspects of interventional cardiology practice-STEMI activation." However, he emphasized that the AI model employed in the study should be interpreted with caution, as it was originally developed to detect occluded arteries rather than STEMI and necessitates further prospective validation across diverse patient populations. "The true challenge is not proof of accuracy alone, but readiness-to integrate, regulate, and interpret AI as a complement to human judgment, particularly in high-stakes, time-sensitive clinical settings," Alkhouli said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, however, new findings from researchers led by the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA (CNSI) reveal just how Pseudomonas go from exploring a surface to committing to it and building a community - a key finding that can help pave the way to understanding how to tackle these types of infections The new study revealed how Pseudomonas detects and binds to specific sugars left behind by others from its species that arrived earlier. The cell senses these sugar trails using proteins on its body, and then identifies the sugars using hairlike appendages called pili. These pili are normally used to crawl along a surface, but in this case double as mechanical sensors that test the strength of the sugar bonds. All of this information is translated into chemical signals inside the cell that guide the operation of other bacterial machinery, such as the controlled secretion of more sugars to make biofilms. For Pseudomonas, the findings could lead to better approaches for undermining the dangerous bugs' ability to resist drug treatments. "We can envision building on these results to influence the bacteria's behavior," said co-first author William Schmidt, a UCLA doctoral student in bioengineering. "We might be able to turn the cells into more antibiotic-susceptible versions of themselves that are easier to treat." Sugar trails secreted by bacteria guide the organization of biofilms. Until now, the mechanisms behind how cells detect sugars secreted by one another on a surface have been unclear. What's more, the cell-membrane proteins that bind to specific sugars lack the necessary structures to allow any signaling, which has been a long-standing puzzle. People have thought of pili mostly as appendages for moving around. It turns out they also act as sensors that translate force into chemical signals within bacteria, which they use to identify sugars. We're seeing how sensory information is encoded in bacteria by their appendages for the first time." William Schmidt, Doctoral Student, University of California, Los Angeles The sugars released by bacteria serve as both trails for others to follow and building materials for their communities. At later stages of biofilm development, those bacterial sugars help fix the crowd of bugs in place and form the surrounding matrix of the biofilm that protects from challenges that could dislodge it. Pseudomonas visits to sugar trails, L to R: regular cells with their own sugars; regular cells with artificial and natural trails; cells engineered so they can't make sugars with artificial trails. To query this system, the researchers fabricated a surface patterned with premade trails of a synthetic sugar, mimicking the bacteria's naturally produced sugars and especially attractive to Pseudomonas. Research following up on the CNSI-led study has the potential to yield solutions for Pseudomonas infections in cystic fibrosis patients and others. "There's the possibility of turning back the clock on biofilm formation," said co-first author Calvin Lee, a UCLA postdoctoral researcher. "Even if you already have a biofilm, you may be able to make the bacteria take it apart by themselves." The study may also inform solutions to other problems created by bacterial communities. "If you get a surface to mimic empty space enough, as far as the bacteria perceive things, it may be possible to solve this multibillion-dollar problem of biofouling." The scientists also intend to investigate connections between these findings and previous results indicating that cellular signaling persists across generations of bacteria in biofilms. Schmidt, W.

Today, pomegranate fruit is eaten fresh, juiced, or processed into extracts, oils, cosmetics, animal feed, and functional foods worldwide. Recent studies have explored the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, metabolic, cardiovascular, and anticancer effects of pomegranate components for potential nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications.1 Modern reviews further highlight pomegranate's role in promoting healthy aging through modulation of mitochondrial function and immune cell oxidative balance, reflecting its integration into both traditional and evidence-based medicine frameworks.3 Authoritative consumer guidance indicates that typical food use is generally safe, but people considering concentrated supplements should consult clinicians due to possible medication interactions and special situations (e.g., pregnancy, surgery, allergies).7 These compounds are highly concentrated in the peel, which is considered a rich reservoir of phenolic acids and hydrolyzable tannins essential to the fruit's biological activity. Aqueous extracts of pomegranate peel often exhibit the highest overall phytochemical yield among tested solvents. Enzymatic and microwave-assisted extraction techniques can increase polyphenol recovery compared with conventional methods. Pomegranate seeds contain anthocyanins, including pelargonidin and cyanidin glycosides, whereas the peel is particularly enriched in phenolic acids like gallic, ellagic, caffeic, and ferulic acids, as well as hydrolyzable tannins. Juice processing generates peel as a co-product rather than waste, thereby creating an opportunity to upcycle peel into high-value extracts rich in these bioactive ingredients. Pomegranate seed oil, containing up to 76% punicic acid, provides anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, and anticancer properties, making it a valuable resource for food and pharmaceutical formulations.1 Human pharmacokinetic data show that pomegranate juice and standardized extracts can yield similar systemic levels of ellagitannin metabolites when matched for polyphenol content.8 The antioxidant activity of pomegranates is attributed to high levels of hydrolysable tannins, particularly punicalagins, as well as ellagitannins, ellagic acid, and anthocyanins that directly scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, chelate transition metals, and interrupt lipid peroxidation chain reactions. These polyphenols also modulate redox signaling, with in vivo studies reporting reduced basal cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS in white blood cells of aged mice administered a standardized pomegranate extract, along with lower plasma malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker. Under an acute oxidative challenge with tert-butyl hydroperoxide, pomegranate extract prevented ROS surges and reduced mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide levels in neutrophils, thereby protecting innate immune cells while maintaining redox homeostasis during aging. These effects likely reflect both radical scavenging and enhancement of endogenous defenses across leukocyte subsets.3 Comparable effects have been demonstrated in human studies, where supplementation improves total antioxidant capacity and reduces biomarkers such as malondialdehyde and oxidized LDL, indicating systemic redox regulation.4 Randomized clinical trials of pomegranate preparations in adults have reported improvements in physiological endpoints linked to oxidative stress, including reduced blood pressure levels and better exercise performance after exhaustive effort. Enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, have been observed following pomegranate peel supplementation in athletes, supporting recovery and resilience against exercise-induced oxidative stress.4 Pomegranate reduces nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling and shifts cytokine profiles toward a lower-inflammation state. Across in vivo and clinical settings, polyphenols isolated from pomegranate peels reduce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-1β, IL-6, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and C-reactive protein (CRP), all of which are effects consistent with NF-κB pathway inhibition. In rodent models, pomegranate peel extract preserves antioxidant-detoxification gene expression and reduces lipid peroxidation, thereby preventing pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Obese women with knee osteoarthritis receiving pomegranate peel extract showed biochemical evidence of reduced oxidative stress, along with improved enzymatic defenses that modulate upstream inflammatory signaling. However, consistent IL-6 reduction and minor improvements in endothelial function suggest that pomegranate's vascular effects are mediated primarily by anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions rather than direct modulation of adhesion molecules.5 Across clinical studies, changes in total cholesterol and LDL-C are inconsistent; however, anti-atherogenic mechanisms are supported by reduced oxidized lipoproteins and improved macrophage cholesterol handling. Small trials conducted in high-risk groups suggest slower atherosclerotic progression markers, which align with the polyphenol-rich profile of pomegranates, which protect against nitric oxide signaling and lipid peroxidation. Meta-analyses indicate that continued intake may benefit arterial stiffness and oxidative status, even when lipid outcomes are modest.5 However, heterogeneity in study design, small sample sizes, and varied preparations limit these results, necessitating larger, longer trials using standardized products to optimize dosing.5 This microbiota-polyphenol axis is a plausible contributor to downstream metabolic and immune benefits observed in human studies. Emerging data also suggest that gut-derived urolithins mediate mitochondrial biogenesis, potentially linking pomegranate consumption to systemic energy metabolism and cellular longevity.3 Collectively, these effects warrant rigorously designed trials to confirm efficacy, define doses, and clarify which patient groups benefit most.6 Clinical trials also suggest benefits for lipid oxidation, exercise recovery, and selected cognitive outcomes. Comprehensive evidence now supports pomegranate-derived products as multi-target nutraceuticals that aid redox balance, control inflammation, and mitigate age-related functional decline, though standardized formulations remain critical for reproducibility.1–6 In practice, both juices and standardized extracts can achieve comparable levels of ellagitannin metabolite exposure when matched for polyphenol content,8 and consumers should follow established safety guidance and consult a clinician when using concentrated products or when taking medications.7 Further ReadingAll Functional Food ContentLychee Health Benefits: Antioxidant, Neuroprotective, and Anti-Cancer InsightsWhat are Functional Foods?Does Eating Sea Moss Provide Health Benefits?Is Watermelon a Superfood?
