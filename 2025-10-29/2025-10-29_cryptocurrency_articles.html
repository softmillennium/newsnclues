                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) does not plan to issue a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) or e-HKD any time soon. Instead, it intends to prioritize work on its wholesale CBDC, which it is developing as part of Project Ensemble for the settlement of tokenization transactions and for the interbank settlement of tokenized deposits. Separately, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported that seven Hong Kong banks are planning to launch tokenized deposits this year, based on an HKMA interview. Depending on international developments and market demand, it's possible that the retail CBDC decision could change. Hence, during the first six months of 2026 the HKMA aims to finalize preparatory work from a policy, legal and technical perspective. These conclusions were outlined in a report on phase 2 of the e-HKD trials, which investigated the commercial viability of both a retail CBDC and tokenized deposits. The HKMA found that retail users did not particularly distinguish between the e-HKD and tokenized deposits, especially given they would access both via banks. For different reasons, the e-HKD pilots demonstrated that asset managers also did not have a strong preference between a CBDC or tokenized deposits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years, investors have argued that money printing would weaken fiat currencies and push scarce assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC), dramatically higher. That view, once dismissed as niche, has now entered the mainstream in a big way. In a new interview with Cointelegraph, hedge fund manager and macro expert James Lavish broke down the growing acceptance of that thesis. Since then, the money supply has exploded, especially during recent crises, creating what he describes as a structural inflation problem. The US government continues to run enormous deficits, and the only viable solution is to quietly debase its currency over time. And now, he says, even the biggest institutions can see it happening in real time. And guess who else has recognized it? All the credit agencies,” Lavish said, pointing out that now Microsoft has a “better credit score than the US government.” Lavish says this new era of liquidity and inflation could set the stage for Bitcoin to shine. And while short-term volatility remains a risk — especially if the broader market sells off — he expects the cryptocurrency to recover faster and stronger than most traditional assets. Bitcoin's long-term adoption curve, especially among institutional investors, has only just begun. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

Blockchain-enabled cold-chain logistics system (BCCLS) has solved the centralized problem in traditional CCLS system. However, along with that different logistics entities establish their own distributed blockchain ledger, it brings new “data island” and privacy leakage problems for BCCLS. In this paper, a transaction ring signing model with multi-chain fusion (MCF) mechanism has been introduced first which helps achieve secure cross-chain data sharing. The MCF mechanism utilizes the relay chain technology to establish a cross-chain transaction platform among different chains. The transaction ring signing model establishes a ring signature mechanism for one cold-chain logistics product circulating in different institutions. Meanwhile, a ring signature (RS) scheme based on lattice assumption is proposed, which can improve the anti-quantum security of transaction ring signing model. This RS is constructed by lattice assumption which can anti-quantum attack security for cross-chain transaction in BCCLS. Then, the security proof shows that the RS scheme can achieve anonymity under full key exposure and unforgeability under insider attack. The efficiency comparison shows that the RS scheme is efficient than similar schemes, and the performance evaluation shows that the transaction ring signing model with MCF model is efficient and practical. Nowadays, the cold-chain logistics system (CCLS) plays an essential role for cold-chain logistics data collection1. Especially with the emergency of blockchain technology, the distributed blockchain-enabled CCLS (BCCLS) draws much attention for solving the centralized problem in traditional CCLSs2. However, one piece of cold-chain logistics data generally needs many cold-chain logistics workers and devices to cooperate, which brings privacy leakage risk for the system user and cold-chain logistics data in BCCLS. Meanwhile, with the number increasing of chains in different cold-chain logistics institutions, new “data island” problem emerges again as the data structure, consensus algorithms, cryptographic algorithms are different in different chains. Blockchain technology draws many attentions in recent years, which is utilized in many production and life areas as finance3, education4, medical5, logistics6, and so on. It gives a new sight for traditional centralized information systems to solve the centralized management and privacy leakage problems. Blockchain changes the storage form from centralization to distribution for cold-chain logistics data, and improves the traceability capability for frozen food by establishing an immutable distributed ledger2. Because of these revolutions, the consumers can view the food information of production, transportation, processing, etc., which can guarantee the food security7. There are many blockchain-enabled CCLS models or platforms have been introduced in recent years, such as Blockcoldchain, ClodBlocks, and so on8,9,10,11,12. However, these novel frameworks mainly focus on solving traditional centralized problems, which do not consider the cross-chain data-sharing problems. The cross-chain technologies have drawn many attentions in the blockchain-enabled systems and applications. At present, four mainstream cross-chain schemes are notary mechanism, side chain/relay, hash lock and distributed private key control13. Among them, the notary public mechanism introduces a trusted third-party institution as the verifier and coordinator of cross-chain transactions14. The side chain/relay chain is more expensive and less efficient, because in this mode, the transaction needs to wait for the chain to determine that the rollback will not occur before confirming15,16,17,18. Hash locking ensures the atomicity of cross-chain asset exchange, but usually can only be used for cross-chain asset exchange, but cannot realize cross-chain transfer of assets or other forms of interaction19. These two protocols mainly set a format for cross-chain transaction, which can support the cross-chain network to unify the format of message in heterogeneous blockchain-based systems. For one cold-chain product, it will pass many logistics institutions from the production to consumption, such as feeding, transport, testing, processing, selling, and buying. The relay chain can help to establish cross-chain data-sharing platform among different chains in different cold-chain logistics institutions, and this paper plans to construct an MCF model to support the cross-chain logistics data-sharing in BCCLS. As the cold-chain logistics data general contains the sensitive information about the logistics workers and institutions, which are vulnerable to the leakage risk when they are transmitted among the different cold-chain logistics workers and devices. To seek the privacy protection algorithm for cross-chain transaction in BCCLS is the essential work. In general, the cryptographic algorithms are the effective methods to protection system data and user privacy in current information systems. Digital signature gives a proof for the transaction validity, and the signer cannot deny a valid signature sign by himself. It has been developed with many kinds, such as blind signature23, proxy signature24, ring signature25, group signature26, undeniable signature27, designated verifier signature28, etc., which play the different roles in different situations. Common RSA and elliptic curve encryption protocols are based on large integer factorization problem and discrete logarithm problem respectively29,30. Recently, the post-quantum encryption based on lattice, hash, and multivariate-quadratic-equations has drawn many attentions as it can resist the quantum attack31,32,33,34,35. With the rapid developments of quantum computer and quantum computing, the post-quantum encryption becomes more and more popular and practical for information systems. Some ring signature schemes with lattice assumption have been introduced in recent years, which are constructed with different lattice assumptions and applied in different areas36,37. For the cold-chain logistics data sharing in BCCLS, the ring signature is more suitable to establish a secure verification mechanism among many different cold-chain logistics workers and devices. This paper focuses on the “data island” and privacy leakage problems in BCCLS, and introduces a transaction ring signing model with multi-chain fusion mechanism firstly. Then, to improve the anti-quantum security of transaction ring signing model, a lattice-based ring signature (RS) scheme is designed. A multi-chain fusion mechanism has been introduced first, which utilize rely chain to establish secure cross-chain logistics data sharing channel through BCCLS. A transaction ring signing model has been proposed, which provides a ring verification mechanism between different cold chain logistics entities. This model can guarantee the privacy security in the cross-chain logistics data sharing processes in BCCLS. A lattice-based ring signature (RS) scheme is designed, which supports the transaction ring signing model for multi-chain fusion mechanism. This scheme also provides the anti-quantum attack security for cold-chain logistics data. The security proofs of anonymity and unforgeability have been presented, which show the proposed RS is secure. The organizations are as follows: Sect. 3 introduces the multi-chain fusion mechanism and transaction ring signing model, Sect. 4 proposes a new RS scheme, Sect. 5 shows the security proof and analysis, Sect. This section presents some reviews about two main themes of the blockchain methods for CCLS and digital signature scheme for privacy-preserving. Blockchain servers as a distributed ledger which helps the cold-chain logistics to establish cross-institution data-sharing platform. Some BCCLSs have been proposed in recent years, which establish many interesting frameworks and models. Kim et al. established a cold chain system with blockchain technology for blood supplement, which provided a safe and traceable record sheet8. Mendoca et al. proposed a blockchain-based vaccine cold chain network called Blockcoldchain, which established a traceability mechanism to protect the security of transportation process9. Menon et al. introduced a ClodBlocks which utilized blockchain and IoT to guarantee the quality security for clod chain logistics data10. Hu gave a BCCLS for agricultural products, which provided a record of the whole process11. Ni et al. presented a blockchain platform for maritime logistics and optimized the latency, send rate and throughput with a consensus algorithm of proof of concept12. With more and more different chains have been constructed in different cold-chain logistics institutions, these BCCLSs cannot satisfy the cross-chain demands. Xiong et al. proposed a notary group-based cross-chain interaction model which utilized the notary election mechanism and margin pool to achieve cross-chain transaction among different blockchains14. Kong et al. applied the relay chain to construct a heterogeneous adaptive routing protocol, which could achieve load balancing and high energy efficiency15. Li et al.16 constructed a relay chain-based cross-chain platform for IoMT system, and they also proposed a lattice-based designated verifier signature scheme to protect the privacy in cross-chain transaction. Jiang et al.17 introduced a multi-chain fusion model with relay chain, which also applied the cross-chain gateway and IBC to achieve cross-chain interaction and communication for IoMT. Zhang et al.18 formed a DeCross framework with relay chain for industrial Internet of things, which established a cross-chain consensus protocol based on a parallel processing workflow prototype. Sun et al. presented a cross-chain service scheme with the notary mechanism and hash-locking, which aggregate these cross-chain technologies together solve data island problem and evil attack19. Xu et al. designed an access control scheme for distributed Internet of things, and they also applied a symmetric encryption algorithm to protect privacy security20. These researches give a new sight for solving the new “data island” problem in BCCLS, and the cross-chain technologies also can be used to achieve cross-chain data sharing between different clod-chain logistics institutions with different chains. Digital signature serves as essential part of the blockchain transaction, which plays the role in the processes of transaction legality verification and record traceability. There are many different kinds of signature schemes have been applied in different areas for privacy-preserving. Gao et al. proposed a blind signature for Internet of vehicle, which could blind the image information in the data transmission process23. Wang et al. introduced a proxy signature scheme based on lattice assumption, which improved the anti-quantum security for Internet of things24. Zhang et al. presented a ring signature for the microgrid day-ahead market, which utilized double auction algorithm to achieve peer-to-peer payment25. Tang et al. designed an event-oriented linkable group signature scheme with lattice assumption which had more flexibility in relation to the signature control26. Mittal et al. proposed an undeniable signature scheme based on inverse computation and discrete logarithm problems, which could resist the impersonation attack27. Deng et al. designated verifier signature scheme for smart grids, and this signature scheme could protect the privacy security of both transaction parts as that only the designated user could verify the signature28. These former signature schemes cannot resist the quantum attacks. Some post-quantum digital signatures are proposed. Li et al.31 proposed presented an undeniable signature scheme for E-voting system, which was constructed with the Fiat–Shamir signature framework. Xu et al.32 utilized the nested hash coding to construct a post-quantum encryption algorithm for IoT systems, and it also applied the random repetition coding to resist passive eavesdropping attacks. Lyubashevsky et al.34 proposed a CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithm based on parameter set, hash function, and polynomial function to guarantee the security and performance against the quantum attacks. Prest et al.35 introduced a Falcon algorithm, which has anti-quantum security under the hardness of SIS problem on lattice. Xie et al.36 applied the lattice assumption to construct a blind ring signature scheme, which could improve the privacy security in blockchain-based transaction systems. Dong et al.37 designed a certificateless ring signature with lattice theory, which utilized SIS problem to ensure the anti-quantum property. For the privacy-preserving in BCCLS, there needs to provide transaction signature with different operators in different cold-chain logistics institutions for one product, and these former signature schemes are not suitable for this situation. This paper plans to establish a privacy-preserving framework with a lattice-based RS scheme for BCCLS. Facing with new “data island” and privacy leakage problems in BCCLS, a transaction ring signature model with MCF mechanism has been presented in this section. There are four main parts in this MCF mechanism, as: child chain, parent chain, fusion ledger, and cross-chain transaction. The simple processes are shown in Fig. 1, and details of these parts are given blow. As different parties in BCCLS have different functions, they generally establish different kinds of blockchain ledgers with public, consortium, or private blockchain technologies. This is the reason why the new “data island” problem is emerged again. How to destroy the difference limitations of the data structure, consensus algorithm, cryptographic protocol is first problem to solve. Meanwhile, the privacy security, data integrity, and interoperability are some main items which should been taken more considerations. Then, every child chain stores its own transaction records and it also participants the transaction processing in parent chain. It keeps its own operational activities with the general blockchain mechanism, and it does not need to synchronize other unrelated transaction information, which can significantly reduce the ledger bloat. Parent chain: This is a relay chain which can help to establish a cross-chain transaction channel between different child chains. Through this relay chain, different child chains can connect with each other to initialize cross-chain transactions. It solves the data integrity and interoperability for cross-chain transactions in BCCLS, and utilizes the ring signature (show in Sect. 4) to guarantee the privacy security of cross-chain transaction. Here, a message exchanging protocol is utilized to solve the difference limitations, such as the differences of data structure, consensus protocol, and cryptographic algorithm. Meanwhile, a RS scheme is proposed to support the following transaction ring verification model. This RS scheme reduces the signing burdens as that a ring member can represent the ring group to perform sign operation, and guarantees the signer's anonymity as that no one can know the real signer unless opening the signature. Then, this parent chain mainly stores the cross-chain transactions, which does not record the transactions in child chains. It mainly focuses on the cross-chain issues when some cross-chain transaction needs have been occurred. Fusion ledger: Firstly, this ledger serves as the public list for BCCLS, which records the cross-chain transactions created by cold-chain logistics parties in different child chains. It does not change the record form in child chains, and constructs a new ledger with unified form for cross-chain transaction in relay chain. Secondly, this ledger is maintained by the selected representatives from the child chains, and utilizes the consensus algorithms of PoS, DPoS to achieve network-wide consistency. This multi-chain competitive mechanism can promote the cross-chain transaction achievement and improve the transaction verification efficiency. Thirdly, like the transaction verification mechanism in generally blockchain system, the cross-chain transactions also need to be packaged, broadcasted, verified, and linked to the main ledger. As the transactions in this fusion ledger are immutable, which can provide the evidences for cross-chain transactions when there is a dispute. It supports the cross-chain information exchanging between different users in different child chains. To the difference of data structure in heterogeneous BCCLS, the XCM and IBC ca. be used for unifying the message format. In this cross-chain transaction, both users' transaction addresses, signatures, timestamp, and other related information are inserted. For one cold-chain product, it will pass many logistics institutions with many workers, and this cross-chain transaction also be signed by these related workers. This transaction ring verification model (show in Sect. 3.2) utilizes a ring signature scheme to construct multi-party signature verification mechanism, which can guarantee the transaction traceability for cold-chain product disputes. This MCF model helps to establish a secure cold-chain logistics data exchange mechanism among different chains in different logistics institutions. Different from the traditional blockchain structure, this MCF helps to construct a new cross-chain data sharing mechanism. It establishes a bridge among heterogeneous blockchain-based BCCLSs. This model promotes the cross-chain data-sharing and improves the value play of cold-chain logistics data. Meanwhile, to protect the privacy of cold-chain logistics data and system users, a transaction ring signing model is needed as there are many logistics institutions participating in the cold-chain product transportation processes. The simple processes are shown in Fig. 2, and details of these parts are given blow. Logistics data generation: For the frozen foods, such as meat, fruit, seafood, they will go through the processes of feeding, transport, testing, processing, selling, and buying from the production to consumption. Supporting by the technologies of Internet of things and RFID, BIoMT systems collect these data generated by these processes. Meanwhile, the blockchain ledger takes responsibility for the storage and recordation of the logistics data and processing records which are the essential evidences for secure frozen food management. Transaction ring signature: These different doctor's processes relate to many medical workers in different departments. All of these workers take responsibility for the generation these medical data, so they must make a signature on them. Meanwhile, a ring signature scheme has been applied in this part. This signature scheme only needs one member to sign these medical data by representing the group, and the verification process can derive that this signature is generated by this group. It cannot confirm which member signs this signature, which can well guarantee the user privacy of the signer. Here, the related operators all need to sign on this cross-chain data sharing transaction with their own \((pk,sk)\) when the cold chain goods are transmitted through different logistics institutions. This RS plays a role of the transaction verifier to ensure the data integrity, reliability, and privacy security. Transaction construction: After these medical data have been signed by the worker group, they will be packaged into a transaction and uploaded to BCCLS network for verification. Meanwhile, the IBC protocol is inserted into this cross-chain transaction, which can help to unify the data structure from different child chains. Only passing these verifications, this transaction can be packaged into a block and waits for the distributed accounting. Distributed accounting: The verified transactions are packaged into a temporary block, and this block will attach to the longest chain fusion ledger in BCCLS system. Once this process is completed, these transactions become immutable records. This transaction ring verification model utilizes the ring signature protocol to protect the privacy security, and establishes ring verification mechanism for cross-chain transactions among different BCCLSs. Meanwhile, this model can protect the signer's anonymity as there are no trust center and group establishment procedure. It helps different logistics workers to construct a ring signature protection mechanism in relation to one cross-chain logistics product. This ring signature mechanism also provides traceability mechanism when the dispute incidents occur. The security of NTRU-based protocol is due to the distribution of \((a,z)\) is pseudo-random in \(\Re _{q}^{2}\) and the definition of NTRU Lattice is given below. (NTRU Lattice)39: For a message V, the NTRU cryptosystem outputs a polynomial \(z=2(ar+e)+\mu\) in \({\Re _q}\) with \(\{ 0,1\}\) coefficients, by random selecting two short vectors \(r,e \in {\Re _q}({\Re _q}={\mathbb{Z}}[x]/({x^n}+1))\). The short integer problem (\(SIS\)) is a more important lattice assumption for lattice cryptosystem, which was first presented by Ajtai40. The essence of this problem is to find a series of short nontrivial integer form a certain large finite additive group, and the sum of these uniformly random elements is zero. (\(\Re - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\)problem): By randomly choosing \(A \in \Re _{q}^{{n \times m}}\) according to the distribution k, there exists a non-zero \(v \in \Re _{q}^{m}\) which satisfies \(Av=0\) and \({\left\| v \right\|_2} \leqslant \beta\). Gaussian Distribution41: The general Gaussian distribution for \(x \in \Re\) is defined as \({\rho _{c,\sigma }}(x)=\exp (\frac{{ - {{\left\| {x - c} \right\|}^2}}}{{2{\sigma ^2}}})\), where \(\sigma \in \Re\) is the standard deviation and \(c \in \Re\) is the center. Note that, the Gaussian distribution can be simply written as \({\rho _\sigma }(x)\) when the center c is 0. Next, the discrete Gaussian is defined as follows. With the security parameter n, a RS is composed of three probabilistic polynomial time algorithms as follows. KeyGen (\({1^n}\)): Given n, this step derives the public and private key pairs \((p{k_i},s{k_i})\) for every ring user. For a digital signature scheme, the security proof in random oracle model is general method to prove the scheme security. This security model is composed of two participants of a challenger C and an adversary A, which establishes a query-respond game between these two participants and utilizes proof by contradiction to prove the security of RS security. Hash query: A queries on the hash algorithm for enough times without the target messge \({m^*}\), by choosing the ring users' public keys \(p{k_i}\). Secret key query: A queries on the user's private key \(s{k_i}\) in relation to the user's public key \(p{k_i}\) for enough times without the target user's private key \(sk_{i}^{*}\). Signature query: A queries on the sign algorithm in relation to the user \(p{k_i}\) for enough times without the target messge \({m^*}\). Forge: A forges a valid signature \((e,{m^*})\) in relation to the target message \({m^*}\), and sends to C. Then, A attempts to derive a solution for the \({\mathbb{Z}} - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\) instance with these two valid signatures by using Forking lemma. Analyze: Under current classical computational conditions, the lattice assumption \({\mathbb{Z}} - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\) cannot be solved. This security model is defined for RS scheme. From this query-respond game, C can solve the hard problem with the query results and forged signature. But this is improssible with current computation condition. So this security proof has proved that a secure RS can capture the security properities of anonymity, unforgeability, and undeniable. This RS scheme can establish a transaction ring verification mechanism to protect the cross-chain logistics data sharing security and users' privacy security. It is constructed with the lattice assumption \(\Re - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\) with a uniform distribution κ. Here, to simplify the work way, this RS scheme reduces \(\Re ={\mathbb{Z}}\) and executes in rings \(\Re ={\mathbb{Z}}[x]/({x^n}+1)\) with the same hardness assumption \({\mathbb{Z}} - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\)40. This RS generally contains the algorithms of KeyGen., Ring Sign, and Ring Verify, and the simple processes are described as shown in Fig. In addition, it also utilizes the bimodal Gaussian distribution to improve the performance efficiency. Key Gen.: The system parameters \(n,m,q,\kappa ,\sigma\) are preset with the security parameter \(\kappa\) and \(m=O(n\log q)\). Next, the public and private keys are derived as shown in Algorithm 1. Ring Sign: Assume the ring member k with \(({A_k},{S_k})\) represents to sign message \(\mu\). Here, \(\left\| e \right\|>T\) with the conditions of \(T=\eta \sqrt m {\sigma _1}\), and \(\eta\) can be verified with probability \(1 - {2^{ - \kappa }}\) for the security parameter \(\kappa\) (in practice \(\eta \in [1.1,1.4]\)). After this transaction signature passes the verification, it will be uploaded to the blockchain for verification and package. When this transaction passes the blockchain verification, it will become an unalterable record in the blockchain ledger. In this RS scheme, one of the ring group users performs the signing process, and nobody can know which one user is the real signer. This mechanism can guarantee the anonymity of real ring singing user. Meanwhile, it can verify the validity of ring signature and trace the real signer by opening the signature when some disputes occur. This RS scheme can well support the privacy protection in cross-chain data sharing process in BCCLS. The signature \((e,c)\) should satisfy three conditions. First is\(\left\| e \right\|<{T_1}\), as \({T_1}\) is defined in the Ring Verify algorithm. Third is \(c \leftarrow H({A_k}e+qcmod2q,\mu )\), as that it is based on the following Eq. Security proof of the anonymity and unforgeability have been given in the following two subsections. For the RS's anonymity, the case of full key exposure should be taken into consideration, and detailed proof processes are shown in the following. Based on the hardness of lattice assumption \(\Re - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\), this RS can achieve anonymity under full key exposure. Suppose there exists an adaptive adversary A, who performs attack on the RS's anonymity under full key exposure. First and foremost, parameters \(n,m,q,\kappa ,\sigma\) are given. C performs the Key Gen. with \({q_E}\) times to derive ring group members' public keys \({A_i} \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{{2q}}^{{n*m}},\;(i=1,2,...,l)\) and the corresponding secret keys \({S_i} \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{{2q}}^{{m*n}}\). Here, \({R_i}=\{ 1,2,...,{q_E}\}\)is the ring of these \({q_E}\) members. C initializes an empty list \(lis{t_K}\)storing \(\left\langle {i,{A_i},{S_i}} \right\rangle\), and then sends the public key set \(\{ {A_1},{A_2}, \ldots ,{A_l}\}\) to A. Hquery: C initializes an empty list \(lis{t_H}\)storing \(\left\langle {{R_i},{u_j},{c_{ij}}} \right\rangle\). If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{R_i},{u_j},{c_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_H}\) and returns \({c_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, he randomly selects \({y_1},{y_2} \leftarrow D_{\sigma }^{m}\) at random and computes \({c_{ij}} \leftarrow H((\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{A_k}{y_2}mod2q,{\mu _j})\). For member \({i_1}'s\) private key query, C checks list \(lis{t_K}\) and returns \({S_i}\) back to A. For member \({i_1}'s\)sign query on signature \(\left\langle {k,{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\), C first checks the query history. If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{i_1},{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_S}\) and returns \({e_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, C first performs H query to obtain \({c_{ij}}\), and randomly selects \(b \in \{ 0,1\}\) to compute the signature \({e_{ij}}\) by \({e_{ij}} \leftarrow A_{{{i_1}}}^{{ - 1}}(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{y_2}+{( - 1)^b}{S_{{i_1}}}c\). Then, he adds \(({e_{ij}},{c_{ij}})\) to \(lis{t_S}\), returns it back to A. Forge phase: A launches a challenge \(\left\langle {{k_0},{k_1},{R^*},{u^*}} \right\rangle\), where ring \({R^*}\) signs on the target message \({u^*}\). \({k_0}\) and \({k_1}\) are two members of ring \({R^*}\). C chooses \({t^*} \in \{ 0,1\}\), checks the \(\left\langle {{R^*},{u^*},{c^*}} \right\rangle\) in list \(lis{t_H}\), and derives the associated secret “trapdoor” \({S_{{R^*}}}\) with relation to \({A_{{R^*}}}\). It can easily derive that the statistical distance of \({e_{{k_0}}}'s,{e_{{k_1}}}'s\) distribution and \(D_{\sigma }^{m}\) is negligible. Therefore, the statistical distance of \({e_{{k_0}}}\) and \({e_{{k_1}}}\) is also negligible. This derives that A guesses 0 or 1 with the same probability. So, the proposed RS scheme has anonymity under full key exposure. For the RS's unforgeability, the case of insider attack should be taken into consideration. Based on the hardness of lattice assumption \(\Re - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\), this RS can achieve unforgeability under insider attack. Assume there exists an adaptive adversary A, who performs attack on the RS's unforgeability under insider attack. First and foremost, parameters \(n,m,q,\kappa ,\sigma\) are given. C selects \(l \in \left[ {{q_E}} \right]\) as the number of challenge ring member. Note that \({A_{{R_t}}}=[{A_{1*}}{A_{2*}} \cdots {A_{l*}}]\), where \({A_{{i^{st}}}} \in Z_{q}^{{n \times m}}\). Then, C servers the sub-matrix \({A_{i*}}\) as the public key of ring \({R_t}\) member. Therefore, \({A_{ti}}={A_{i*}}\) for the member in ring \({R_t}\). For the \({q_E} - l\) ring member out of \({R_t}\), C performs the Key Gen. with \({q_E}\) times to derive ring group members' public keys \({A_i} \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{{2q}}^{{n*m}},\;(i=1,2,...,l)\) and the corresponding secret keys \({S_i} \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{{2q}}^{{m*n}}\). Here, \(R=\{ 1,2,...,{q_E}\}\)is the ring of these \({q_E}\) members. C initializes an empty list \(lis{t_K}\)storing \(\left\langle {i,{A_i},{S_i}} \right\rangle\), and then sends the public key set \(\{ {A_1},{A_2}, \ldots ,{A_{{q_E}}}\}\) to A. Hquery: C initializes an empty list \(lis{t_H}\)storing \(\left\langle {{R_i},{u_j},{c_{ij}}} \right\rangle\). If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{R_i},{u_j},{c_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_H}\) and returns \({c_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, he randomly selects \({y_1},{y_2} \leftarrow D_{\sigma }^{m}\) at random and computes \({c_{ij}} \leftarrow H((\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{A_k}{y_2}mod2q,{\mu _j})\). For member \({i_1} \notin {R_t}\) private key query, C checks list \(lis{t_K}\) for \(\left\langle {{i_1},{A_{{i_1}}},{S_{{i_1}}}} \right\rangle\) and returns \({S_i}\) back to A. For member \({i_1}'s\)sign query on signature \(\left\langle {{i_1},{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\), there exist three cases which should be taken into consideration. If \({R_i}={R_t}\), C first checks the query history. If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{i_1},{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_S}\) and returns \({e_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, C first performs Hquery to obtain \({c_{ij}}\), and randomly selects \(b \in \{ 0,1\}\) to compute the signature \({e_{ij}}\) by \({e_i} \leftarrow A_{k}^{{ - 1}}(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{y_2}+{( - 1)^b}{S_k}c\). If \({R_i} \ne {R_t}\) and \({i_1} \in {R_i} - {R_t}\), the \(\left\langle {{i_1},{A_{{i_1}}},{S_{{i_1}}}} \right\rangle\) exists in list \(lis{t_K}\). C first checks the query history. If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{i_1},{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_S}\) and returns \({e_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, C first performs Hquery to obtain \({c_{ij}}\). Then, he derives the associated secret “trapdoor” \({S_{{R_i}}}\) with relation to \({A_{{R_i}}}\), and randomly selects \(b \in \{ 0,1\}\) to compute the signature \({e_{ij}}\) by \({e_{ij}} \leftarrow A_{{{R_i}}}^{{ - 1}}(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{y_2}+{( - 1)^b}{S_{{R_i}}}{c_{ij}}\). If \({R_i} \ne {R_t}\) and \({i_1} \in {R_i} \cap {R_t}\), the \(\left\langle {{i_1},{A_{{i_1}}},{S_{{i_1}}}} \right\rangle\) does not exist in list \(lis{t_K}\). C first checks the query history. If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{i_1},{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_S}\) and returns \({e_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, C first finds a \({i_2} \in {R_i} \cap {R_t}\) as the \(\left\langle {{i_2},{A_{{i_2}}},{S_{{i_2}}}} \right\rangle\) exists in list \(lis{t_K}\). Then, he derives the associated secret “trapdoor” \({S_{{R_i}}}\) with relation to \({A_{{R_i}}}\), performs H query to obtain \({c_{ij}}\), and randomly selects \(b \in \{ 0,1\}\) to compute the signature \({e_{ij}}\) by \({e_{ij}} \leftarrow A_{{{R_i}}}^{{ - 1}}(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{y_2}+{( - 1)^b}{S_{{R_i}}}{c_{ij}}\). Then, he adds \(({e_{ij}},{c_{ij}})\) to \(lis{t_S}\), returns it back to A. Here, the probability that C successfully solve the SIS instance is mainly depended on the private key query phase and challenge phase. As there are l ring member in R, the probability of successfully private key query for \(i \notin {R_t}\) is \(1 - 1/{q_E}\), and the probability of successfully challenge for \({R^*}={R_t}\) is \(1/C_{{{q_E}}}^{l}\). Therefore, the probability that challenger C successfully solve the SIS instance is at least \(\varepsilon \left( {1 - 1/{q_E}} \right)/C_{{{q_E}}}^{l}\). So, the proposed RS scheme has unforgeability under insider attack. For this RS scheme, one ring member can represent the ring group to sign the message, and the ring group users cannot deny this signature. As in the signature generation process, all the public keys of ring members are constructed by \(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}}\). In the other hand, this construction provides a signature traceability mechanism as it can quickly find the target user once the medical disputes occur. This security property can protect the user privacy as it cannot know which member of the real signer is, and also provide a secure traceability mechanism for the cold-chain logistics data sharing in the BCCLS. Therefore, the proposed RS scheme can satisfy the security properties of correctness, anonymity, unforgeability, and undeniable. This RS scheme supports the transaction ring signing model and establishes a ring signature mechanism for one cold-chain logistics product circulating in different institutions. To compare the efficiency of this proposed RS scheme, three similar RS schemes have been selected. First, the system parameters \(n,m,q,\sigma\) in these schemes are unified, and the parameter k in41 is set as \(k=0.96n\). Then, three items of the public key size \(pk\), private key size \(sk\), and signature size are considered, and the comparison results are listed in the following Table 1. As for the scheme in Ref.36, the key size of these three items will increase with the increasing of message length l. For the scheme in Ref.37, these three items are all bigger than that in this RS scheme. Therefore, this RS scheme is efficient than similar schemes. Key size comparison with 192-bit security level. Meanwhile, the performance evaluation of this RS comparing with similar schemes are executed. Here, the parameters are set as \(n=1024,q={2^{27}}\) with 192-bit security level, \(m=8323\) for 192-bit which satisfies \(m \geqslant n\left\lceil {\log q} \right\rceil\), the message length is preset to \(l=10\), and \(\sigma ={2^{30}}\). The sizes of public key \(pk\) and private key \(sk\) are more space saving, and the signature size is almost 1/5 of that in Ref36. Then, the time consumption of the proposed RS scheme has been performed and compared with these two related references. The comparison results are shown in Table 2. Here, TTrap, TSam, TMul, and TH represent the times consumption of Trapdoor, Gaussian Sample, Matrix Multiplication, and Hash algorithms, respectively. These performance results show that this RS scheme has certain advantage about the time consumption than similar schemes. Meanwhile, the results are shown in Fig. Here, the time consumption of algorithms TTrap, TSam, TMul, and TH are set as 1.5 ms, 1 ms, 0.1ms, and 0.8 ms respectively, which is set according to the standard experiment environment. Therefore, the cross-chain data sharing transactions will more efficient with more low time consumption algorithms. In addition, along with the logistics link increasing, the key size and time consumption have no changes. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the system indexes do not increase with the ring users increasing. Meanwhile, in the ring singing phase, the ring users' public keys are aggregated together with \(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}}\), and this continuous addition calculation mode cannot change the dimensionality of the public keys. So, it cannot increase the computational complexity and the time consumption of this RS scheme. Therefore, this RS scheme can well support the ring users update and has favorable scalability. Transaction throughput and latency are two main factors for cross-chain transaction in BCCLS. This paper executes the cross-chain transaction in the Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum environment, and selects a single-chain model for comparison with 1000 pieces of transactions. The performance environment is on a Windows 11 desktop with Intel® Core™ i7-9700p 3.0 GHz and 16G RAM. This is a simulation environment close to reality. The comparisons for transaction throughput and latency for these two models are shown in Figs. Here, the “H” and “E” represent the Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum environment respectively. In these two figures, the results show that the indexes of transaction throughput and latency in cross-chain model are small weak than that in single-chain model. But it still shows that the cross-chain transaction model is practical for data sharing in different cold-chain logistics institutions as the differences between these two models are small. Meanwhile, the transaction throughput performed in Hyperledger Fabric is bigger than that in Ethereum, and the transaction latency performed in Hyperledger Fabric is smaller than that in Ethereum. This is because of that Hyperledger Fabric is for enterprise application with consortium blockchain, and the Ethereum is for general users with public blockchain. So the Hyperledger Fabric is more suitable for cross-chain data sharing in BCCLSs. Then, with the institution chains number increasing, the cross-chain data sharing demands are also increasing, and these small differences will be ignored with technology development. With the same performance evaluation environment, the transaction simulations with different transaction number are executed. For the transaction latency, the items of “Query” and “Transaction” increase slowly, but the item of “CreateAccount” increases a lit quickly. This phenomenon is emerged with two reasons: one is that some new accounts have been registered, and the other is that many new cross-chain transaction addresses are generated. In addition, the stable phenomenon also shows the efficiency and practical of the proposed cross-chain model, which brings a more promising application for the proposed model and RS algorithm in BCCLS. Transaction latency comparison with number increasing. Meanwhile, the CUP and RAM usage are monitored when the cross-chain transactions execute in BCCLS. The results are shown in Fig. With the transaction number increasing, the use condition of CUP and RAM keep a slow growth. It indicates that the proposed MCF model and RS scheme is not resource consumption, and it can well support the cross-chain data sharing transaction among different BCCLSs. CPU and RAM use condition with transaction execution. Here, note that the above data analyses are all the average level, which do not consider the basic statistical indicators such as error bars, mean, and variance. 4 and 5 are computed with general setting ruler for the system parameters \(n,m,q,\sigma\) with 192-bit security level. 6 and 7 are computed and taken the average with 1000 pieces of transactions in two different public blockchain platforms of Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum environment. 8 and 9, and 10 are computed and taken the average with 1000 pieces of transactions in two different public blockchain platforms of Hyperledger Fabric. These results are enough to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MCF model and RS scheme. Facing with the new “data island” and privacy leakage problems in current BCCLS, this paper introduces a transaction ring signature model with multi-chain fusion mechanism. The transaction ring signature model helps establish a secure cross-chain data sharing mechanism for cold-chain logistics data-sharing between different logistics entities through BCCLS. Meanwhile, a ring signature scheme with lattice assumption has been designed for the transaction ring signature model. This scheme improves the cross-chain data sharing security, and guarantee the quantum attack security for cross-chain transaction in BCCLS. In addition, this research gives a new sight for cross-chain transaction privacy-preserving, and promotes the construction and application of practical cold-chain logistics data security protection mechanism. The future works will focus on other related privacy enhancement measures in the logistics data sharing processes, such as cross-chain identity authentication, secret sharing, key agreement, and so on. Meanwhile, the consensus mechanism and data compression mechanism are also interesting to give considerations. All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin BTC$113,421.04 and long seen as a leveraged bet on the crypto, has shed nearly $18 billion in market value as enthusiasm dried up and its net asset value (mNAV) premium collapsed in recent months. The stock may be poised for a rebound as a series of key catalysts could reverse the bearish trend as soon as this week, according to a fresh report by 10x Research's Markus Thielen, who previously had been bearish on the name. "At today's price, with the NAV premium largely gone, volatility trending higher, and a potential catalyst in the form of strong Q3 earnings and renewed S&P 500 inclusion speculation, we see Strategy as attractive at current levels," Thielen wrote, noting that the stock here could offer better value than bitcoin itself. That marks a sharp reversal from late 2024, when speculative premiums, said Thielen, which pushed the stock far above its fundamentals. While the 40% decline since July left has sentiment “washed out” and retail interest low, the firm's Thursday earnings report could mark a pivot, said Thielen. He expects the firm to report a roughly $3.6 billion profit from mark-to-market gains on its BTC holdings.

For Bitcoiners, whose movement was built around sound, decentralised money, that shift should have triggered alarm bells. The biggest beneficiary of this new framework is Tether Limited, whose USDT token dominates global stablecoin supply. Custody of those assets rests with Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street firm led by Howard Lutnick. Lutnick has publicly defended the soundness of Tether's reserves, confirming Cantor's role as custodian while emphasizing that it holds no equity stake in the company. The connection is now more delicate: Lutnick was later nominated for a senior White House economic position overseeing elements of trade and financial regulation. What began as a business relationship now blurs into a potential conflict of interest, embedding Tether in Wall Street's plumbing and within the political apparatus that governs it. In effect, Tether has become a private central bank: issuing dollar liabilities, earning seigniorage, and distributing liquidity through the crypto economy, all while piggy backing on U.S. sovereign debt. Its profit per employee rivals the most profitable institutions in finance. Stablecoins promise fast, borderless payments; however, their architecture depends on compliance. Since December 2023, Tether has maintained a proactive wallet-freezing policy for addresses sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. The company says it has frozen billions in tokens linked to illicit activity and now works directly with the U.S. Secret Service and FBI. As Tether expands USDT onto Bitcoin adjacent networks such as Liquid and the RGB protocol, the same compliance logic will travel with it. The more Bitcoin infrastructure hosts these tokens, the more identity, KYC, and whitelisting mechanisms will appear around Bitcoin wallets and payment channels. The network that once prided itself on neutrality risks becoming a conduit for surveillance grade rails. Its sponsors framed it as an anti-CBDC measure, arguing that private stablecoins preserve choice and limit government power. However, the result is nearly identical to what a central bank digital currency would achieve: programmable, trackable dollars, only administered by corporations instead of the Fed. Some analysts have called this the birth of a “CBDC by proxy.” Every USDT minted represents demand for short dated Treasuries, effectively financing the same government that stablecoin advocates claim to bypass. By situating stablecoins within the traditional bond market, the U.S. has created a dollar based feedback loop: bitcoin demand supports Treasury issuance, and Treasury yields support bitcoin profitability. Within the Bitcoin community, opposition to altcoins remains strong, but sponsorships, event partnerships, and integrations show how quickly principle bends toward funding. Bitcoin conferences increasingly feature Tether executives and supporters on stage, often framed as “bridges” to adoption. A familiar refrain has emerged among those bitcoiners who take money from Tether,  ‘if stablecoins are inevitable, it's better they be run by Bitcoiners'. Another popular defence is that Tether provides a lifeline for people in countries locked out of the dollar system or suffering from hyperinflation and collapsing economies. These convenient mantras turn compromise into virtue, allowing Bitcoiners to take sponsorships and funding from the same system they once swore to oppose. That logic may offer comfort to some, but erodes clarity. When Bitcoin developers or advocates align with Tether for sponsorship or exposure, they lend moral legitimacy to a system that thrives on fiat's dominance. With billions in annual profits and deep links to Wall Street custodians, it can sponsor conferences, fund research, and influence narratives across the digital asset world. Its executives appear frequently at policy forums to present stablecoins as allies of innovation and freedom. Each appearance helps normalise the idea that regulated, dollar denominated tokens represent progress for Bitcoin. Every layer of compliance embeds surveillance deeper into the blockchain economy. And every Bitcoiner who accepts that trade off helps build a network where decentralization endures mostly as branding. In the end, too many Bitcoiners remain exactly where Tether wants them, still tethered to the system they are trying to escape. Opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While KDA and PERP crash after Binance's delisting, FLM rallies | Credit: Veronica Cestari Flamingo (FLM) surprised everyone, swinging upward in a show of short-term strength. Binance delists altcoins that consistently exhibit low trading volume, poor liquidity, and insufficient project development, as these assets no longer meet the exchange's quality standards. In some cases, it delists assets due to regulatory or security risks, such as non-compliance and potential fraud, to protect user funds and maintain platform integrity. We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. The decision, while significant, may not come as a surprise to market observers. Last week, the Kadena team confirmed its exit from the project, a revelation that triggered a sell-off and sent KDA's price tumbling. Following Binance's delisting notice, Kadena's market value dropped another 25% today. From a technical perspective, the daily chart shows that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed a bearish crossover. With no demand in sight, KDA's price might reach a new all-time low below $0.045. However, this trend might reverse if many other exchanges drum up support for Kadena. Following the recent development, PERP's price has declined by 14%. On the daily chart, PERP continues to trade within a descending channel, indicating persistent downward pressure. If this trend persists, PERP could fall below the channel's lower boundary, potentially declining toward $0.12. However, if buying momentum returns and the price breaks above near-term resistance, this bearish outlook may be invalidated, opening the door for a rebound toward $0.28. Interestingly, instead of plunging, FLM's price surged by 13.65% following the announcement, climbing to $0.023. However, such rebounds after delisting news often carry significant risk. On the daily chart, CCN's analysis shows that FLM has formed a bearish divergence, a warning signal that the rally may not be sustainable. This divergence emerged as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) turned negative, despite a bullish price movement. If sustained, downside pressure could return once the short-term euphoria fades. However, a surge in demand for the token could invalidate this bias.

The former president of FTX US, Brett Harrison, is back with plans to bring a key force behind crypto market volatility to the more staid world of stocks and commodities trading: perpetual futures contracts.

While crypto venues regularly deal in these non-expiring contracts for digital assets, Harrison's software startup Architect Financial Technologies plans to offer access for foreign currencies, interest rates, single stocks, stock indexes, metals, energy, and other commodities. The venture got approval to operate its new venue out of a regulated entity with the Bermuda Monetary Authority, according to Harrison.</p>

Durov said Cocoon will allow GPU owners to contribute computing power to the network and earn TON tokens in exchange, while developers access low-cost AI compute. The system is designed to ensure users can interact with AI features like summarization and message drafting without exposing private data to centralized providers. Telegram itself will be the first major customer and largest promoter of the network, integrating Cocoon's capabilities into its mini-app and bot ecosystem. The project is scheduled to launch in November 2025, and applications are open to both hardware providers and developers. Durov emphasized that Cocoon's transparent, market-driven design will make AI compute pricing competitive and censorship-resistant. He framed the initiative as part of Telegram's broader mission to protect user privacy and digital freedom amid growing centralization in global tech. Sign in to your account Don't have an account?

The company plans to tokenize gold, creating a gold-backed currency for use as a global payment medium, which has not been seen since 1971. The dual-division model combines physical gold mining with digital innovation, enhancing operational efficiency and market reach. Disclaimer: This is an AI-generated summary of a press release distributed by GlobeNewswire. The model used to summarize this release may make mistakes. The Company is building a seamless value chain, which will include mining gold, vaulting and verifying it in state-of-the-art facilities, and tokenizing it into a blockchain-based digital currency. “Blue Gold is aiming to create the first global gold-backed digital currency. It is a bold and audacious plan, but it is supported by significant macro trends that include the wider use of the blockchain to tokenize real world assets. Gold has always been a store of value, but in the past 50-years fiat currencies have become de linked to hard value, leading to significant devaluation over time. This division will be involved in the development and operation of long-life gold mines; as well as the acquisition of gold sourced from strategic partnerships. The UAE is an emerging global hub for gold, benefiting from political neutrality, state-of-the-art vault infrastructure, and zero tax environment. It will be responsible for managing an independent trust which will own the gold, acquired by the Physical Division and then tokenize it. In addition, the division is building “Blue Gold One”: a universal, secure wallet that lets holders make instant payments, store, or transfer their gold-backed tokens, all on a regulated blockchain. The United States provides a cutting-edge regulatory environment for blockchain and digital asset innovation, with clear legal rights for gold ownership, strong consumer protection, and access to the world's largest pool of capital. Blue Gold Limited (Nasdaq: BGL) is a next-generation gold development company focused on acquiring and aggregating high-potential mining assets across strategic global jurisdictions. The Company's mission is to unlock untapped value in the gold sector by combining disciplined resource acquisition with innovative monetization models, including asset-backed digital instruments. Blue Gold is committed to responsible development, operational transparency, and leveraging modern financial technologies to redefine how gold is produced, accessed, and owned in the 21st century.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To make themselves more appealing, operators are willing to meet the changing preferences of gamblers, including offering them the payment methods that they desire. A new way to perform online transactions is becoming increasingly common: cryptocurrencies. More players are learning how BTC live casinos work, better understanding the benefits of gambling with Bitcoin and other cryptos. With anonymous payments, fast processing times, and low transaction fees, it seems clear why the iGaming industry is making the change to digital currencies. Among those already gambling with crypto, 60% prefer to make Bitcoin payments, while 27% opt for Ethereum. But what is driving this shift, for both operators and players? Accepting crypto transactions holds many benefits for casino operators, which is why an increasing number are embracing this payment method. Crypto is also highly efficient, with almost instant transaction speeds. This means that deposits and withdrawals occur within a few minutes, removing payment friction. This exposes the casino to players outside of its licensing region. Blockchain-based security features and the irreversible nature of crypto transactions reduce fraud and chargebacks, which is a common struggle faced by casino operators offering traditional payment methods. This can help automate various processes, including loyalty rewards and payouts. Crypto transactions are also more private than traditional payments, since there is no need to disclose personal information. It also prevents prosecution in areas where gambling is restricted or banned. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, which ensures trust between operators and players. Gamblers aren't limited to their local banking infrastructure because of crypto's borderless nature.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>$XRP is one of the best performers among heavy-cap cryptos this week. For context, $BTC has surged 5% over the past seven days, while $ETH is up 4.5%. Keeping up with the spot market's energy, the derivatives market has also perked up, as open interest (OI) crosses $4.5B. Multiple factors indicate that $XRP's recent surge might be short-lived. It could be a while before it reclaims its all-time high of $3.65, since the rise in open interest could swing either way. For instance, the OI-weighted funding rate has declined, revealing that confidence in $XRP will be fragile in the absence of a significant broader market shift. Short positions likely anticipate another test of the key support level at $2.18. That partly explains the renewed activity in the derivatives market, which dropped to $3.49B on October 19 – its lowest point since late April. Despite the crypto market simmering in uncertainty since October 10, a new crypto infrastructure coin has been attracting steady investor traction. The Best Wallet Token presale is making its way toward $17M, defying broader market trends. Backed by a non-custodial wallet that boasts hundreds of thousands of downloads on iOS and Android devices, it's clearly not just the token's low presale price that's drawing interest. Companies like Strategy continue to buy the crypto dip, as the market is entering a promising phase supported by friendlier regulations. While institutional giants can afford to buy $BTC and $XRP for a fortune, retail investors are playing a completely different game. For them, the smarter bets are emerging coins with much lower market caps. Smart investors are exercising this strategy while curating their portfolios ahead of the next crypto super cycle, likely to begin in November. $BEST tokens play a key role in fueling this ecosystem, which looks beyond crypto storage and towards driving retail crypto adoption. For holders, it unlocks privileges like early access to vetted presales, lower fees, higher staking rewards, and voting rights. But more importantly, organic demand could underpin the token's value during volatile periods. Take a look at our step-by-step guide to buying the Best Wallet Token before heading to the official presale website. And the next price surge is just a day away.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a report released on Monday, the central bank argued that banks are already subject to strict regulations, including capital, foreign exchange, and Anti-Money Laundering requirements, which could help minimize any risks associated with introducing stablecoins to the country. At the same time, the BOK wants a policy consultative body jointly made up of currency, foreign exchange, and financial authorities to decide on issuer eligibility, volumes and other key considerations. Seo told Cointelegraph that while the central banks' concerns about stablecoin risks are understandable, its argument for banks leading a rollout “seems to lack a logical foundation.” In June, BOK deputy governor Ryoo Sangdai proposed that South Korean banks be the primary issuers of stablecoins in the country to ensure a safety net, before gradually expanding to other sectors. The BOK also wants to ban interest payments on stablecoins, arguing that it could directly compete with bank deposits and disrupt the sector, and has instead pitched the commercialization of deposit tokens, digital tokens that represent deposits in a bank or financial institution. “While I agree that stablecoins themselves should not include any yield-bearing features, I believe it would be excessive to restrict the generation of additional yield through the use of stablecoins,” he said. At least eight major South Korean banks announced plans in June to offer a stablecoin pegged to the South Korean won, with planned launches across late 2025 and early 2026. Meanwhile, Naver Financial, the fintech arm of South Korean tech conglomerate Naver, is reportedly moving forward with a plan to acquire Dunamu, which operates the country's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, and plans to launch a Korean won-backed stablecoin project once the acquisition is complete. The crypto industry in South Korea has benefited from a more favorable environment following the election of President Lee Jae-myung in June, who has since pushed forward with various crypto-related laws, including a bill to legalize stablecoins.
