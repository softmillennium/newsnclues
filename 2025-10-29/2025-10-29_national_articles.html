                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., speaks during the Democratic National Convention Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. WASHINGTON (AP) — When he was elected the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee in June, Rep. Robert Garcia at once gained a powerful perch and a pressing problem. He'd pitched himself as an energetic personality who cared about good governance and accountability. But with Democrats locked out of power, he had few tools available to carry out his mission besides strongly worded letters to federal agencies and speeches during committee hearings. As Republicans faced mounting public pressure from conservative activists and voters after Trump backtracked on that promise, Garcia saw an opening. The Epstein files case shines a light on how Donald Trump is only out for himself.” Garcia in July coordinated Oversight Democrats to force a surprise vote on subpoenaing the Justice Department for documents related to Epstein — and it worked. Republicans narrowly backed the subpoenas at a subcommittee hearing. Democrats similarly pushed Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., in August to subpoena the executors of the Epstein estate for documents. Garcia dismissed the first tranche of more than 33,000 documents from the Justice Department in September as inadequate, mostly public information that lacked a “client list” of Epstein's purported associates. The estate has shared more information since, including Epstein's flight logs, personal schedules and financial ledgers. The burst of attention gave Democrats, still grappling with their party's failure in last year's election and divided on a path forward, a jolt of energy and potential blueprint for navigating Trump's second term. “I think you're going to see us take that kind of aggressive approach in the work that we have ahead,” Garcia said. The Oversight Committee, led by Comer, is one of the most powerful in Congress, with broad leeway to investigate nearly anything. Garcia has sought to use his position as the committee's ranking Democrat to weave his party's disparate stances on Trump, affordability, corruption and democracy into a single message. Garcia has also been a critic of House Speaker Mike Johnson's decision to delay the swearing in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democratic congresswoman-elect from Arizona. Johnson says Grijalva can't be sworn in until the government shutdown ends and legislative work resumes in the House. But Garcia and other Democrats say Johnson's real aim is to delay a vote on legislation that would broaden the subpoena for the Epstein files. As Democrats revamp their media strategy, Garcia has encouraged Oversight Democrats to engage in new digital media to boost the party's message. He's also been meeting with government reform groups to craft legislation around transparency that they hope to put in front of voters next year. “I think on oversight we have a responsibility to gather the information and then to put it out to the court of public opinion, especially in front of Trump's voters,” he said. Oversight hearings have devolved into shouting matches repeatedly during this Congress, reflecting the near-total breakdown of bipartisan relations on the committee. Comer, the Republican chair, said it was “appalling” for Democrats to release the Birthday Book sketch and accused them of engaging in “cherry-picking documents and politicizing information” to imply without evidence that Trump was involved in Epstein's actions. “If we're going to actually save this democracy and restore the American public's trust and move forward post-Trump's presidency, we have to take on the current grift that this man is doing on the country,” Garcia said. After Democrats made another attempt at a surprise committee vote — this time to subpoena the head of the Federal Communications Commission for comments about the suspension of late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel — Comer and Garcia brokered a bipartisan invitation for FCC Chair Brendan Carr to testify on a range of issues. But Comer, a close Trump ally, also called Garcia “a real big drama queen,” after which Garcia accused him of being homophobic. Garcia says his identity as a gay immigrant and naturalized citizen has influenced his leadership style and outlook on the country, especially as the Trump administration pursues its hardline immigration agenda. “I always say that immigrants who are naturalized are some of the most patriotic people we have in this country, because we all have to fight for those rights that many folks are born with,” said Garcia, who became a U.S. citizen in his 20s.</p>

The X-59 supersonic jet, designed for NASA with a goal of bringing supersonic speed without the ‘boom,' completed its first test flight on Tuesday. A new "quiet" supersonic X-59 jet designed to revolutionize air travel successfully completed its first test flight, Lockheed Martin announced this week. The aircraft aims to overcome one of the major hurdles to supersonic travel, which is noise restrictions over land. The plane took off from Palmdale, Calif., at Skunk Works' facility at U.S. Air Force Plant 42, accompanied by a NASA chase plane. It landed safely about an hour later at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center. X-59 took its first test flight, Lockheed announced. NASA has paid Lockheed over $500 million since 2018 to develop the plane. The plane, which measures just under 100 feet nose to tail, flew at subsonic speeds on its first flight, around 230 mph and reached 12,000 feet. The plane is built to eventually reach a cruising speed of 925 mph, or Mach 1.4, and fly at an altitude of 55,000 feet. "This aircraft is a testament to the innovation and expertise of our joint team, and we are proud to be at the forefront of quiet supersonic technology development," OJ Sanchez, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, said in a statement. It's part of our DNA – the desire to go farther, faster, and even quieter than anyone has ever gone before. The experimental quiet supersonic aircraft X-59, a collaboration of Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works and NASA, parked in a hangar in Palmdale, California. The supersonic Concorde aircraft, developed by France and the U.K., began transatlantic flights in 1976, reached max speeds of over 1,300 mph and flew passengers from New York to London in just 3.5 hours. But high operating costs meant ticket costs were about four times higher than a standard first-class ticket, and the supersonic boom meant the plane could only fly at such high speeds over water. Sean Duffy, transportation secretary and acting NASA administrator, speaks alongside Rep. Tom Emmer and House Speaker Mike Johnson during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 23, 2025. NASA plans to fly the X-59 over several U.S. cities in the coming years, gathering public feedback that could help regulators update decades-old bans on supersonic flight over land. If successful, the data could open the door for a new generation of commercial jets capable of cutting cross-country flight times in half — bringing back supersonic travel for the first time in more than two decades, but this time with far less noise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Days after thieves took just minutes to steal eight pieces of the French crown jewels from the Louvre, a former bank robber says he warned a museum official of glaring weaknesses — including jewel cases by streetside windows that were “a piece of cake” to attack. People queue to enter Le Louvre museum Monday, Oct. 27, 2025 in Paris. People queue to enter Le Louvre museum Monday, Oct. 27, 2025 in Paris. PARIS (AP) — Two suspects in the Louvre jewel heist have admitted their involvement and are believed to be the men who forced their way into the world's most visited museum, a Paris prosecutor said Wednesday. Laure Beccuau told a news conference that the two face preliminary charges of theft committed by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy, and are expected to be held in provisional detention. They have “partially” admitted their participation in the robbery, she said. It took thieves less than eight minutes to steal the jewels valued at 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19, shocking the world. The robbers forced open a window, cut into cases with power tools and fled with eight pieces of the French crown jewels. One is a 34-year-old Algerian national who has been living in France since 2010, Beccuau said. He was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport as he was about to fly to Algeria with no return ticket. He was living in Paris' northern suburb of Aubervilliers and was known to police mostly for road traffic offenses. His DNA was found on one of the scooters used by robbers to leave the scene, she said. The other suspect, 39, was arrested at his home in Aubervilliers. Prosecutors had faced a late Wednesday deadline to charge the suspects, release them or seek a judge's extension. Video surveillance cameras showed there were at least four criminals involved, Beccuau said. The four suspected robbers arrived onboard a truck equipped with a freight lift that two of them used to climb up to the museum's window. The four of them left onboard two motor scooters along the Seine river toward eastern Paris, where they had some other vehicles parked, she detailed. The jewels have not been recovered, Beccuau said. Earlier Wednesday, French police acknowledged major gaps in the Louvre's defenses — turning the dazzling daylight theft into a national reckoning over how France protects its treasures. Paris Police Chief Patrice Faure told Senate lawmakers that aging systems and slow-moving fixes left weak seams in the museum. “A technological step has not been taken,” he said, noting that parts of the video network are still analog, producing lower-quality images that are slow to share in real time. A long-promised revamp — a $93 million project requiring roughly 60 kilometers (37 miles) of new cabling — “will not be finished before 2029–2030,” he said. Faure also disclosed that the Louvre's authorization to operate its security cameras quietly expired in July and wasn't renewed — a paperwork lapse that some see as a symbol of broader negligence. Faure and his team said the first alert to police came not from the Louvre's alarms but from a cyclist outside who dialed the emergency line after seeing helmeted men with a basket lift. Faure urged lawmakers to authorize tools currently off-limits: AI-based anomaly detection and object tracking (not facial recognition) to flag suspicious movements and follow scooters or gear across city cameras in real time. Culture Minister Rachida Dati, under pressure, has refused the Louvre director's resignation and insisted that alarms worked, while acknowledging “security gaps did exist.” In June, the Louvre shut in a spontaneous staff strike — including security agents — over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and “untenable” conditions. Unions say mass tourism and construction pinch points create blind spots, a vulnerability underscored by the thieves who rolled a basket lift to the Seine-facing façade. Faure said police will now track surveillance-permit deadlines across institutions to prevent repeats of the July lapse. But he stressed the larger fix is disruptive and slow: ripping out and rebuilding core systems while the palace stays open, and updating the law so police can act on suspicious movement in real time. Experts fear the stolen pieces may already be broken down and stones recut to erase their past.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's White House ballroom saga last week followed a familiar Trump-era arc: A bunch of the president's critics sounded the alarm about his latest provocation – in this case, the sudden and surprising demolition of the East Wing – and a bunch of other people questioned what the big deal was. He's just building a ballroom, after all. And the White House kind of needed a ballroom! The Washington Post editorial board said Trump was characteristically “pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible.” But it praised him for charging ahead and delivering “a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere.” Well, it turns out most Americans see plenty to dislike about Trump's handling of the East Wing and the ballroom. In fact, it appears to be one of the more unpopular things he's done in this second term. And it's not just those  who dislike Trump that are objecting. A new Yahoo News-YouGov poll is the first quality survey to dig into the ballroom saga in depth. It shows Americans disapproved of Trump's demolition of the East Wing (57%-26%), his plans for replacing it with a 90,000-square foot ballroom (61%-25%) and his broader handling of the situation (55%-28%) all by around a 2-to-1 margin. Even Trump's supporters aren't defending him too hard. Around one-quarter of Republicans disapproved on both counts. And those strongly disapproving included a majority of independents: 52%. None of that means this is a game-changer of a political issue which will suddenly send Trump's overall approval numbers plummeting to new depths. But it does reinforce that he just keeps doing things rather haphazardly that give lots of people reason to dislike what they're seeing – even, it seems, some people who generally approve of him. An important question from there is why people disapprove. Is it just because they don't really like change? But the numbers might actually point in another direction. While people disapproved by about a 2-to-1 margin no matter how you asked the question, they were actually slightly more likely to object to the ballroom plans (61%) than they were to the demolition of the East Wing (57%). You could see a situation in which people might think the ballroom is okay and even necessary, but don't like how the East Wing was summarily torn down. The White House's East Wing is now demolished. What that might suggest: People don't really like the idea of building an elaborate new $300 million ballroom – privately funded, Trump says – on the White House grounds during a time of significant economic hardship and inflation. Trump has shown remarkably little concern about these kinds of optics issues. He and his family have taken little care to insulate themselves from allegations that they've ignored conflicts of interest and enriched themselves using the presidency, most notably with their crypto ventures. Even as the country is dealing with the impacts of a government shutdown, Trump is overseas accepting gifts like a golden crown from South Korea. A Pew Research Center poll conducted a month ago showed 61% of Americans and even 31% of Republican-leaning people said they believe Trump has at least “probably” improperly used his office to enrich himself, his friends and his family. A CBS News-YouGov poll around the same time showed 75% of Americans said Trump wasn't focused enough on the issue of “lowering prices of goods and services.” In other words, it doesn't seem to have been a great time to bulldoze part of the White House in the name of building an expensive place to hold parties. And Trump did a great job of making sure people noticed that's exactly what he was doing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The clock is ticking for four major social safety net programs that keep tens of millions of struggling Americans — including millions of children and senior citizens — fed and warm, as well as provide early education services. The government shutdown, which began October 1, has put in jeopardy these federal lifelines as their available funding dries up. The two sides continue to throw barbs at one another, while a growing number of their constituents panic over losing their much-needed federal assistance. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as food stamps are formally known, is expected to provide about $8 billion in assistance in November. The agency has a contingency fund, which contains between $5 billion and $6 billion, but Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins maintains that it cannot be used to cover next month's benefits. Democrats and advocates disagree, arguing that the money should be shifted to fund November's benefits. A coalition of 25 Democratic-run states sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, claiming that the agency cannot suspend benefits indefinitely and refuse to spend available funds to provide assistance. Some states are allocating more money for emergency nutrition assistance to their residents in need, while Virginia is setting up an alternative food benefit program. The potential pause in food stamp benefits has also put a lot of pressure on food banks and pantries, which are already stretched thin from rising prices and increased need. Starting on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families are at risk of losing access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households, according to the National Head Start Association. Some 140 programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will miss their federal funding, which was set to be paid either on October 1 or November 1, if the government shutdown continues. Some of the programs that haven't received their federal funds could have to temporarily close their doors, said Tommy Sheridan, the association's deputy director. But others — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start. The aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December. Those most at risk are people in cold weather states who heat their homes with heating oil or propane, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. That's because a lot of states have rules that prevent electric and natural gas companies from cutting off service to delinquent customers during the winter, but those protections don't apply to firms that deliver fuel. And the process could take even longer this year since HHS laid off its LIHEAP team during its major reorganization in the spring. Similar appropriations were working their way through Congress before the shutdown. WIC continued operating in October thanks to a $300 million infusion from the Trump administration, which tapped leftover tariff revenue that typically supports child nutrition programs. Nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children depend on WIC, formally known as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. But whether it can provide benefits for November is unclear. The USDA told CNN on Monday that it would use tariff revenue to support WIC for the “foreseeable future.” But the National WIC Association told CNN on Wednesday that state agencies have not been informed of additional federal support. Washington's Department of Health said it can maintain food benefits and a reduced administrative team through mid- to late-November, for instance. In New Hampshire, food benefits will continue at least until November 7, but WIC services may end at several locations on Saturday if the shutdown continues.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  This story contains discussion of suicide. Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters. Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world. Chatbot platform Character.AI will no longer allow teens to engage in back-and-forth conversations with its AI-generated characters, its parent company Character Technologies said on Wednesday. The move comes after a string of lawsuits alleged the app played a role in suicide and mental health issues among teens. Instead of open-ended conversations, teens under 18 will be able to create videos, stories and streams with characters. “We do not take this step of removing open-ended Character chat lightly – but we do think that it's the right thing to do given the questions that have been raised about how teens do, and should, interact with this new technology,” the company said in its statement. Character.AI has been at the center of controversy over how teens and children should be permitted to interact with AI, prompting calls from online safety advocates and lawmakers for tech companies to bolster their parental controls. Three more families sued the company in September, alleging that their children died by or attempted suicide and were otherwise harmed after interacting with the company's chatbots. The company said in a previous statement on the September lawsuits that it cares “very deeply about the safety of our users,” adding that it invests “tremendous resources in our safety program.” It also said it has “released and continue to evolve safety features, including self-harm resources and features focused on the safety of our minor users.” Here's how Character.AI's new CEO plans to address fears around kids' use of chatbots Character Technologies said it decided to make the changes after receiving questions from regulators and reading recent news reports. The company is also launching new age verification tools and plans to establish an AI Safety Lab run by an independent non-profit focusing on safety research related to AI entertainment. The changes follow previous Character AI safety measures, such as a notification directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline when suicide or self-harm is mentioned. Character Technologies is the latest AI company to announce or launch new protections for teens amid concern about the technology's impact on mental health. Multiple reports have emerged this year about users experiencing emotional distress or isolation from loved ones after prolonged conversations with ChatGPT. OpenAI in late September rolled out the ability for parents to link their account to a teen's and limited certain types of content for teen accounts, such as “graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent roleplay and extreme beauty ideals.” Meta said this month it will soon allow parents to prevent teens from chatting with AI characters on Instagram.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi is interviewed at United Nations headquarters, Wednesday, Oct., 29, 2025. International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi is interviewed at United Nations headquarters, Wednesday, Oct., 29, 2025. International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi is interviewed at United Nations headquarters, Wednesday, Oct., 29, 2025. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said that despite being unable to fully access Iranian nuclear sites, inspectors have not seen any activity via satellite to indicate that the Islamic Republic has accelerated its production of uranium enriched beyond what it had compiled before the 12-day war with Israel in June. “However, the nuclear material enriched at 60% is still in Iran,” Grossi said in an interview at the United Nations headquarters in New York. “And this is one of the points we are discussing because we need to go back there and to confirm that the material is there and it's not being diverted to any other use.” He added, “This is very, very important.” Grossi said, however, that inspectors have seen movement around the sites where the stockpiles are stored. Without additional access, the U.N. has had to rely on satellite imagery, which can only show so much, he said. That stockpile could allow Iran to build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponize its program, Grossi warned. Iran long has insisted its program is peaceful, but the U.N. nuclear agency and Western nations say Tehran had an organized atomic bomb program until 2003. Iran and the IAEA signed an agreement last month in Cairo to pave the way for resuming cooperation, including on ways of relaunching inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities, that has yet to be implemented. Israel's surprise attack on Tehran came after the watchdog's board of governors voted to censure Iran over its noncooperation with the agency, the first time in 20 years. Iran accused the agency, without providing evidence, of aiding Israel and later the U.S. in their attacks. Top Iranian officials and Iranian media then called for Grossi to be arrested and put on trial if he returned to the country. The “snapback” of U.N. sanctions has complicated the already tenuous relationship between the IAEA and Iran, but Grossi said inspectors are inside the country as of Wednesday and he remains in “constant contact” with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. “It would be incorrect to say they are denying us access. And it would be equally wrong to assume that everything is fine.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom‘s (D-CA) Proposition 50, the ballot measure designed to approve the Democrat-led agenda to redraw California‘s congressional map, is poised to pass next week's special election after supporters raised millions of dollars in donations. Democrats have rallied in full force behind Newsom's redistricting ballot measure, raising significantly more money than Republicans who oppose it. Supporters have raised at least $129 million in contributions, while opponents have raised at least $46 million, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The flow of money has been so significant that Newsom told donors to stop contributing to the pro-Proposition 50 cause this week. You can stop donating,” he said in an email. Some of the largest donations include $15 million from a Democratic super PAC, $12 million from former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, and $10 million from a lobbying group associated with billionaire megadonor George Soros. It appears the donations will pay off come Nov. 4. Most respondents seem to have made up their minds on the measure, given that only 1% said they didn't know how to vote on the issue. The measure reflected a partisan divide, with 84% of Democrats saying they'll support the measure and 89% of Republicans, particularly in House GOP districts, saying they'll oppose it. Given the likelihood of the measure's approval by voters on Election Day, California Republicans are reportedly retreating from their anti-Proposition 50 campaign. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who launched his own effort to challenge gerrymandering on both sides of the political aisle. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has largely sat out Newsom's plan to counteract Republicans' mid-decade redistricting agenda. Although Trump hasn't directly or explicitly endorsed either side of the ballot measure, the Department of Justice deployed election monitors to California with the stated goal of preserving election integrity. Newsom called the move an act of voter suppression.</p>

Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin reports from clashes outside of a Broadview, Ill., immigration facility where anti-I.C.E. The Trump administration will face off with Oregon state leaders in court on Wednesday over whether the president can federalize National Guard troops and deploy them to Portland, a city President Donald Trump has said is "war ravaged" and in need of military reinforcements. The trial comes as the administration has faced a string of setbacks in Oregon, where it has wanted to deploy 200 National Guard soldiers as added protection for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and other federal officers but has been unable to because of repeated court orders. Federal agents clash with anti-ICE protesters at the ICE building on Oct. 12, 2025, in Portland, Oregon. Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two of those orders blocking Trump from deploying both in-state and out-of-state troops, and on appeal, the 9th Circuit briefly ruled in Trump's favor but reversed course this week. All the orders related to Oregon in the lower court and 9th Circuit have been issued on an emergency basis, and Immergut's three-day trial is expected to produce a more permanent decision, though it will likely be appealed by either party right away. Trump has faced obstacles to deploying National Guard soldiers in numerous blue cities, where the administration claims illegal immigration and street crime are rampant. In court papers filed ahead of the trial, DOJ lawyers said the deployment to Portland was "amply justified." President Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaks during a news conference to discuss crime in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 11, 2025. "In the weeks and months preceding the President's decision, agitators assaulted federal officers and damaged federal property in numerous ways, spray-painted violent threats, blockaded the vehicle entrance to the Portland ICE facility, trapped officers in their cars, followed them when they attempted to leave the facility, threatened them at the facility, menaced them at their homes, doxed them online, and threatened to kill them on social media," the DOJ lawyers wrote. They added that law enforcement officers assigned to handle immigration-related tasks had been diverted to managing the local unrest, which they said took them away from officers' regular job duties. "The record is replete with evidence of the [Portland Police Bureau] failing to provide assistance when federal officials have requested it," they wrote. Law enforcement officials and protesters gathered outside an ICE facility in Portland, Oregon, on Sept. 28, 2025. State lawyers, meanwhile, claimed Congress' laws governing National Guard deployment allow the president to federalize the reserved troops against the will of state governors only as a last resort. The high court is weighing whether to take up Trump's National Guard deployment in Chicago, and that case could have far-reaching effects on the president's similar fights in other states, including Oregon and California.

This satellite image taken by Airbus DS shows objects on the ground near what are likely Rapid Support Forces vehicles in the Daraja Oula neighborhood of el-Fasher, Sudan, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025. CAIRO (AP) — Sudan's paramilitary forces killed hundreds of people including patients in a hospital after they seized el-Fasher city in the western Darfur region over the weekend, according to the U.N., displaced residents and aid workers, who described harrowing details of atrocities. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said in a statement the 460 patients and companions were reportedly killed at Saudi Maternity Hospital in el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur. Mini Minawi, the governor of Darfur, shared a video online, which purported to show RSF fighters inside the Saudi Maternity Hospital. Sudanese residents and aid workers also described some of the atrocities carried out by the RSF, fighting since 2023 to take over Africa's third largest nation, after they seized the army's last stronghold in Darfur after over 500 days of siege. “The Janjaweed showed no mercy for anyone,” said Umm Amena, a mother of four children who fled the city on Monday after two days, using a Sudanese term for the RSF. RSF commander Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo on Wednesday acknowledged what he called “abuses” by his forces. In his first comments since the fall of el-Fasher, posted on the Telegram messaging app, he said an investigation was opened. The RSF has been accused by the U.N. and rights groups of atrocities throughout the war, including a 2023 attack on another Darfur city, Geneina, where hundreds of people were killed. Amena was among three dozen people, mostly women and children, who were detained for a day by RSF fighters in an abandoned house close to the Saudi Hospital in el-Fasher. The AP spoke with Amena and four others who managed to flee el-Fasher and arrived exhausted and dehydrated early Tuesday in the nearby town of Tawila, around 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of el-Fasher, which already hosts over 650,000 displaced. The U.N. migration agency said about 35,000 people have fled el-Fasher, mostly to rural areas around it, since Sunday. U.N. refugee agency official Jacqueline Wilma Parlevliet said that the new arrivals told stories of widespread ethnic and politically motivated killings, including reports of people with disabilities shot dead because they were unable to flee, and others shot as they tried to escape. Witnesses told the AP that RSF fighters — on foot, riding on camels, or in vehicles — went from house to house, beating and shooting at people, including women and children. Many died of gunshot wounds in the streets, some while trying to flee to safety, the witnesses said. Giulia Chiopris, a pediatrician at a hospital run by the Doctors Without Borders medical group in Tawila, said they received many patients since Oct. 18, suffering from injuries related to bombing or gunshots. She said that the hospital also received a high number of malnourished children — many of them unaccompanied or orphaned — who were also severely dehydrated during the road journey from el-Fasher. They were brought to the hospital by strangers, she said. In a report late Tuesday, the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) said that RSF fighters continued to carry out mass killings since they took over el-Fasher. The HRL also reported what it said were targeted attacks by the RSF on health facilities, health workers, patients and humanitarian aid workers, which it said amount to war crimes. “An unfathomable horror,” Simon Mane, a national director for the World Vision aid group, said. “Children are not just dying; they are being brutally robbed of their very existence, their hopes and futures cruelly wiped away. Aid groups said hundreds were killed and hundreds detained since the RSF overran the city, but a death toll has been difficult to determine given a near communication blackout. HRL said satellite imagery can't show the true scale of the mass killings, and that “it is highly likely that any estimates of the total number of people who RSF has killed are undercounted.” Before the latest bout of violence, some 1,850 civilians were killed in North Darfur, including 1,350 in el-Fasher, between Jan. 1 and Oct. 20 this year, according to U.N. spokesperson Farhan Aziz Haq. Mohamed Osman, Sudan researcher with Human Rights Watch, said that footage coming out of el-Fasher “reveals a horrifying truth: the Rapid Support Forces feel free to carry out mass atrocities with little fear of consequences.” Sen. Jim Risch, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Tuesday denounced the RSF attacks on the city, and called for it to be designated as a foreign terrorist organization. “The RSF has waged terror and committed unspeakable atrocities, genocide among them, against the Sudanese people,” he wrote on X.

An investigation into the autopen controversy involving former President Joe Biden is gaining momentum in Delaware and Washington, D.C., Fox News has learned. A source familiar with the situation told Fox News on Wednesday morning, "It looks like the investigation has heated up in recent weeks and it appears there's a focus in Delaware as well as Washington, D.C." On Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a post on X that her "team is reviewing the Biden administration's reported use of autopen for pardons." Bondi's post came as the House Oversight Committee released a 100-page report on Tuesday morning detailing findings from its monthslong probe into Biden's White House, specifically whether his inner circle covered up signs of mental decline in the ex-president, and if that alleged cover-up extended to executive actions signed via autopen without Biden's full awareness. Then-President Joe Biden speaks at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, May 17, 2024. The report also detailed a "haphazard documentation process" for pardons made by Biden, which the committee argued left room for doubt over whether the former president made those decisions himself. "In the absence of sufficient contemporaneous documentation indicating that cognitively deteriorating President Biden himself made a given executive decision, such decisions do not carry the force of law and should be considered void," the GOP report said. A Biden spokesperson pushed back on the committee's conclusions in a statement to Fox News Digital made Tuesday morning, however. "This investigation into baseless claims has confirmed what has been clear from the start: President Biden made the decisions of his presidency. Congressional Republicans should stop focusing on political retribution and instead work to end the government shutdown," the spokesperson said. In an interview with The New York Times in July, Biden affirmed he "made every decision" on his own. Fox News Digital's Elizabeth Elkind contributed to this report.

In a press event launching a lawsuit against the Trump administration over SNAP benefits Tuesday, Gov. A coalition of 25 Democratic governors and attorneys general on Tuesday sued the Trump administration over its refusal to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during the ongoing government shutdown — arguing that a suspension of the aid threatens to disproportionately harm millions of vulnerable and low-income Americans. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins speaks with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott during a news conference at the Texas State Capitol in Austin, Texas, on August 15. "Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being," state leaders said in the lawsuit. "Ultimately, states will bear costs associated with many of these harms," they added. "The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems." Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is joined by Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Whip Tom Emmer and Brian Steil for a press conference on the 10th day of a government shutdown on Oct. 10, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) The lawsuit was filed by a coalition of attorneys general and governors from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, D.C., Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Judge Talwani will hear from both parties during an emergency status hearing Wednesday, during which she will weigh the states' request for an emergency order to force USDA to release a portion of its emergency funds to SNAP recipients. The USDA, for its part, has not yet shared details on the policy decision or decision not to funnel the contingency funds to SNAP beneficiaries. A note on its website states simply that, "[T]he well has run dry." "At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01," the agency said.

The Category 5 storm is an extraordinary threat — even in a season that felt unusually quiet. Hurricane Melissa, already one of the strongest hurricanes in history, made landfall in Cuba on Wednesday morning as a Category 3 strength with winds at 120 miles per hour. The National Hurricane Center warned that Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic are facing dangerous flash floods and landslides. The storm is responsible for at least seven deaths as of Wednesday morning. Ahead of landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a blunt warning for Jamaica: “THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION! Hurricane Melissa is an extraordinary storm, even among the many massive, fast-growing, devastating cyclones that have been erupting in the Atlantic Ocean in recent years. Already, it's the strongest storm on record to hit the island and is poised to cause landslides, power outages, and flash floods. Melissa is also poised to extend its swinging arms into Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. It's clear that Melissa will leave a lasting scar on the islands in its path. It's likely to be the strongest tropical cyclone in the world this year, and aid agencies are preparing for a humanitarian disaster. “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,” World Meteorological Organization tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland. As Melissa starts to leave Jamaica behind and ventures further north in the Caribbean, here are a few key things to keep in mind: Melissa is now tied with Hurricane Dorian in 2019 and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest storm to ever make landfall, and certainly the strongest to hit Jamaica. The threshold for rapid intensification is wind speeds increasing by at least 35 mph in 24 hours. A hurricane's devastation doesn't only come from its strong winds. Even a weaker cyclone can leave a trail of death and destruction when it hits a vulnerable area, and much of the lasting havoc comes from water, not wind. Earlier this year, the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, for example, moved inland and collided with another weather system over Texas and triggered flash floods that killed at least 90 people. Jamaica is particularly vulnerable because its mountainous geography can create the ideal conditions for flash floods. And as the country faces a housing shortage and rising prices that are driving many into substandard living conditions, much of the island's housing stock is unlikely to withstand the storm unscathed. Jamaica has enough shelters for 20,000 people, so most residents are likely to brave the storm at home. Officials are worried that not enough people had evacuated ahead of the storm in low-lying areas prone to flooding. “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness in a news conference Monday. Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to November 30. In its early season outlook in May, NOAA anticipated a 60 percent chance of “above-normal” hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean this year, with up to 19 named storms and five of those turning into major hurricanes. Forecasters saw that there was ample warm water in the Atlantic Ocean — a necessary ingredient for hurricanes — and atmospheric conditions that make it easier for cyclones to form. From an American perspective, this season felt unusually quiet. There have been 13 named Atlantic storms this year so far. There were also major storms that churned out at sea and still caused houses to collapse in places like the Outer Banks in North Carolina. While the season as a whole may have seemed unusually calm before Melissa, there's still another month to go, and the fuel for another massive storm remains ready. And historically, some of our most catastrophic storms hit during unusually quiet seasons. “There's this old phrase: All it takes is one,” said Michael Fischer, an assistant professor at the University of Miami studying hurricane modeling. “So far it's been a bit, perhaps a bit quieter than what was expected in terms of the total number of named storms, but the book is not done being written yet.” By late Tuesday, Hurricane Melissa had weakened to a Category 4 as the storm continued to move across the country. Already, officials are reporting extensive damage to homes, schools, and hospitals. “I'm praying for those residents, and we have been preparing and we have been praying for the best,” Holness said, encouraging Jamaicans to “stay inside, batten down (and) keep safe.” Update October 29, 9:15 am ET: This story was originally published earlier on October 29 and has been updated with new reporting as the storm progresses across the Caribbean. Decades of protection helped these sea creatures recover. Two incredibly valuable animals are now “functionally extinct” in Florida. But there's another problem that no one's talking about.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an age where nearly every inch of the world's landmass has been mapped, examples of terra nullius are exceedingly rare. Bir Tawil, for instance — a desolate parcel of desert on the Egyptian-Sudanese border. Each country insists that Bir Tawil belongs to the other. This unusual status has attracted self-styled nationbuilders — so- called “micronationalists” — hoping to create their own “countries.” One notable attempt was by Jeremiah Heaton, an American who in 2014 founded the unrecognized “Kingdom of North Sudan” in Bir Tawil. Along the Croatian-Serbian border, a drawn-out dispute along the River Danube has resulted in claims of terra nullius around at least four small pockets of land. These differing border definitions mean Croatia lays claim to land on the eastern bank of the Danube — territory Serbia considers its own. But the river's former course means there are several pockets on the western bank that would belong to Serbia under those older maps. As with Bir Tawil, these western pockets of land would go to whichever country loses the larger territorial dispute. In practice, that means neither Croatia nor Serbia claims them, although officials say that does not mean they have been forsaken. Land considered terra nullius can be claimed by occupation under international law. In 2015, Czech politician Vit Jedlička claimed a seven-square-kilometer patch in the disputed Danube area, named Gornja Siga, as the “Free Republic of Liberland.” His micronation vision is staunchly libertarian and his ambition, he says, is “a global revolution.” In 2023, British YouTuber Niko Omilano made an attempt to enter what he termed “the banned country” to mark the eighth anniversary of Jedlička's experiment. “It's like the homestead principle” in the American Wild West, says James Riding, a senior lecturer in cultural geography at the UK's Newcastle University, who has co-written an academic paper about Jedlička's political experiment. “If you continue to spread into new territory, there's not a lot to stop you from claiming that territory as your own.” While terra nullius can inspire these kinds of frontier fantasies, it's important to remember these so-called “no man's lands” have long and complex histories and are “more than geographical oddities,” says Riding. Attempts to claim them “can and do often have political motivations or completely disregard the cultural history of the landscapes they claim land in,” he says. After learning about Jedlička's claims along the same stretch of river, 20-year-old Daniel Jackson was inspired to make his own experiment in sovereignty and statehood, although with a very different mission than Jedlička's. Jackson, a dual British and Australian citizen, is the self-declared president of the “Free Republic of Verdis,” or Pocket 3, as it's labeled on international maps. Jackson, who says he's attracted some 400 Verdisian  “citizens” to his cause, believes his fledgling “republic” can become a sovereign nation-state with international recognition. But days after the Verdis team planted their self-designed blue and white striped flag in the sands of Pocket 3 in 2023, Jackson says he endured his first “national” crisis when Croatian police arrived and deported him. Croatia's foreign ministry told CNN it classifies Jackson's occupation of the land — and the Liberland project — as “provocative actions without any basis in law.” It said it was carrying out its obligations to guard its external border and that of Europe's multinational Schengen Area. It also gave short shrift to the concept of terra nullius. While the boundaries along the Danube may be in dispute, it said, both Croatia and Serbia “share an understanding of and respect for a fundamental principle of international law: the fact that a pending delimitation does not render any space a terra nullius (“no man's land”) open to occupation by a third party.” The Serbian government has also been contacted for comment by CNN. They bought a Caribbean island to start their own country Before they tried to occupy Pocket 3, Jackson and his aspiring citizens say they carried out extensive research in local archives, on both sides of the disputed border. He says they delved into the historical maps on which Croatia bases its border, and found several modern charts produced by Croatian government departments that follow the same boundary. They issued passports and drafted  “basic laws” to govern the nation, although none of this is internationally recognized. “There were many reasons why we wanted to start Verdis,” Jackson tells CNN Travel. Creating a country provides opportunities to test new forms of governance and voting systems. We want to serve as a neutral zone, where world leaders can discuss their disputes.” He adds that he wants Verdis to be a “humanitarian hub.” In July and September 2023, Jackson delivered aid to Ukraine under the flag of Verdis, through the “Verdis Red Cross,” a self-styled movement unaffiliated with the International Red Cross. While Jackson himself has no ties to the region, he tells CNN that he sought help and support from locals on both sides of the river in the project — such as boat captains, river guides and legal advisers. “It's important to have ethnic Croats and Serbs” supporting the project, says Domagoj Budetić, Verdis' “minister of foreign affairs,” a Croatian who lives in the nearby city of Osijek. Jackson says around 65% of Verdis' “citizens” are ethnic Serbs and Croats. While his vision of Verdis as a neutral state where nations broker peace treaties might sound fantastical, Jackson says he believes it offers Serbians and Croatians — who were at war a few decades ago — the chance for reconciliation. “Croats and Serbs had a million chances for reconciliation,” says Budetić. A clean slate where things can be done correctly since day one.” One of Verdis' most high-profile supporters is Luke Black, a Serbian singer-songwriter who represented Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023. I especially appreciate youth-led initiatives that think outside the box.” While he admires the idea of unity that both Eurovision and Verdis share, he says “the Verdis dream is unique because it's pure at heart.” Jackson tells CNN that he is determined to achieve international recognition for Verdis. “Lots of people found micronations to make a statement,” he says. The Montevideo Convention, the 1933 international law defining sovereign nation-states, establishes four primary criteria that countries must fulfil: having a permanent population, a defined territory, a functioning government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. While Croatia and Serbia may disagree, Jackson says Verdis met three of the four criteria by forming a government and claiming Pocket 3. Raising their flag on “Verdisian” shores and establishing a permanent population were to prove the biggest challenges. Throughout 2023, Jackson says, representatives of Verdis embarked on multiple “surveying” trips to the territory, where they camped out, mapped the land and planned more robust encampments for future expeditions. In October 2023, Jackson and his government raised the Verdisian flag with great ceremony, finally initiating what they said was the “settlement” phase of their nation-building project. “It was short-lived,” says Jackson, telling CNN Travel that police broke the camp apart and that settlers, including himself, were held for questioning. “We've occasionally snuck flags onto Verdis when the river has been high enough, as a sign we're still committed,” says Jackson. “I think that's a classic example of might is right,” he says. “On a completely pragmatic political level, I would say that this 20-year-old kid is facing significant hurdles which, you know, nations comprising millions of people, like Kurds or Palestinians, have yet to be able to surmount,” says Leshem. “There's been huge protests recently in Serbia, and there's a feeling of stagnation following decades of political inertia.” Supporting a vision such as Verdis, he says, can be “a way to imagine yourself out of the country that you are in.” “I still believe that sooner or later we will be back on the land and Croatia will have to respect international law, including Verdis' territorial integrity,” he told CNN Travel. We hope to have positive relations with Croatia in the future.</p>
