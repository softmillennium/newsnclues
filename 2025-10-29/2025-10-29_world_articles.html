At least 46 children were among those killed by the strikes, which also wounded 253 Palestinians, Gaza's Ministry of Health said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the “forceful strikes” on Tuesday after accusing Hamas of withholding remains of Israeli captives, and attributing the killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah to the group. Gaza officials have repeatedly said that it is difficult to find the remains of captives after two years of near-endless bombardment and genocide. Some recent clashes have broken out involving armed groups unaffiliated with Hamas in Gaza. “These documented crimes add to the long list of ongoing violations against our people,” said the Palestinian Civil Defense in a statement. Indeed, Israel has committed numerous violations of the ceasefire since it went into effect earlier this month. As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Jamaica remains in a state of emergency after being battered by Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic cyclones in history. Mikaela Loach, a Jamaican British climate justice activist, says the hurricane was “caused by the climate crisis,” and says fossil fuel companies are to blame. It's important to “direct that anger towards people who are responsible,” Loach says, suggesting that hurricanes be named after oil executives. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Jamaica remains in a state of emergency after being battered by Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes in history. The Category 5 storm slammed into Jamaica Tuesday with 185-mile-per-hour winds. One Jamaican official told CNN there's extensive damage to homes, schools, hospitals in southwestern Jamaica. Hurricane Melissa is now battering Cuba, where it made landfall today as a Category 3 storm. We go now to Mikaela Loach, Jamaican British climate justice activist, the author of It's Not That Radical: Climate Action to Transform Our World, as well as the children's book, Climate Is Just the Start. Mikaela will be attending next month's COP30 climate summit in Brazil as part of Greenpeace's delegation. MIKAELA LOACH: Thank you so much for having me on again, Amy. Everyone in Jamaica, my family, my friends, over the last few days have been feeling just incredibly tense at this upcoming storm. Thankfully — I kind of lost contact with my family overnight, and then was — had a lot of terrified dreams and interrupted sleep, but this morning, thankfully, I managed to get back in contact with them. And thankfully, my family are OK. My aunt's nephew's house, though, has been completely flattened by the hurricane, and so he's lost his home. But thankfully, all of my family are physically OK. And now it's just: How do we recover from this? A lot of people are exhausted, because in order to try and keep homes safe, that have remained safe, it's required people to be constantly, like, you know, removing water from them. This is actually a complete catastrophe, and it's really quite terrifying. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mikaela, you've suggested that hurricanes should be named after those who you say are responsible for climate change. MIKAELA LOACH: Yeah, so, we currently name hurricanes after just, you know, people's names, in order to distinguish, basically, between storms that are happening at the same time. So that's why this storm is currently called Hurricane Melissa. But I think when we call these things “natural disasters,” or even just calling it this, like, feminine, nice name of Melissa, we're not making it clear to people that there are actually people who are, you know, around today who are profiting from creating the conditions that make these hurricanes possible. You spoke earlier about how hot oceans have supercharged this storm. So, it was able to double in speed in just 24 hours, which is kind of unprecedented, because of these extremely and unnaturally hot seas. So, then, I would argue that instead of calling it Hurricane Melissa, we should call it Hurricane Darren, after Darren Woods, who's the CEO of Exxon, who makes millions in his paycheck in salary every year and an extra many millions more in a bonus. We could also call it Hurricane Wael, after Wael Sawan, the CEO of Shell, who also makes millions from this crisis. So I think it's really important that we make clear that these are not natural disasters; they're fossil fuel disasters. MIKAELA LOACH: I definitely think the Trump administration and their, like, climate denial and their collusion with the fossil fuel industry has a huge impact. I think what I am nervous about is making it out as if this impact has happened now, this collusion with fossil fuel industry has just begun with Trump and Trumpism. I mean, even before Trump, international climate negotiations were being disrupted and delayed by the U.S. under Democrat governments, as well. So, whilst it is significant, the extent to which I think Trump is changing what we see as acceptable or normal around climate action, I think it's also important for us to recognize that before Trump, these were still issues. And so, instead of wanting to kind of revert back to what we see as maybe better, we need to actually push for something that is transformed and is different and actually is what we need in the face of this crisis. So we need things like a fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty to be signed by every country and government in the world. And we need a conflict-of-interest policy to be put into international climate negotiation spaces and all climate spaces and into governments, so that fossil fuel interests are not able to impact governments in the way that they are. AMY GOODMAN: Finally, Mikaela, on Tuesday, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates released a lengthy memo downplaying the impacts of climate change. It read, in part, “Although climate change will have serious consequences — particularly for people in the poorest countries — it will not lead to humanity's demise. People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future.” Gates had previously spent billions of his own money to raise the alarm about the dangers of climate change. He said just focus on issues like hunger and others. MIKAELA LOACH: Well, last time I was on Democracy Now!, it was actually after I had just spoken at Bill Gates's event, when he invited me to speak at his event in New York. And I — instead of saying the things they probably expected me to say, I delivered a speech on why billionaires should not exist and the problem with billionaire philanthrocapitalism, this philanthropy that exerts control on what future is possible. It doesn't surprise me that Bill Gates has changed his tune on climate, because I don't believe that he ever fundamentally cared about creating a better and transformed world for all of us. And that world is actually possible with real climate justice. It's not just with Bill Gates as the only billionaire that's moved in this way, but in a wider way, Big Tech were trying to pretend to us that they cared about the climate and all their green pledges, and they've started moving away from that. Now they've realized that they need fossil fuels to push this, these AI data centers that we don't need, and they need to, you know, have all this access to water resources, and so they're changing the narrative now to benefit them. And I think it's really important that we always ask ourselves, when someone is saying something, “Why are they saying that? And how can we actually tackle that and create the world that we all deserve, which is very, very concerned with climate justice?” AMY GOODMAN: Mikaela Loach, we thank you so much for being with us, Jamaican British climate justice activist, headed to Brazil, to Belém, where the U.N. climate summit will take place.

MOSCOW, October 29. /TASS/. The Poseidon nuclear-powered unmanned underwater vehicle is a completely new step in ensuring Russia's security, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to a TASS question.

"These are completely new technologies, this is a new step from the viewpoint of ensuring our country's security. These are also cutting-edge, absolutely new breakthrough technologies that can be used already in the economy for peaceful goals. This actually constitutes the double effect of these successful trials," Peskov said in response to a question from TASS about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had watched the Poseidon trials.

During his talk with soldiers at a military hospital in Moscow, Putin said that Russia had successfully tested the Poseidon nuclear-powered unmanned underwater vehicle.

The power of the Poseidon weapon far exceeds the power of the advanced Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, the head of state stressed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Japanese auto giant Toyota Motor has denied Donald Trump's suggestion that it is poised to invest more than $10bn in the United States over the coming years. “Go out and buy a Toyota,” added Trump. But a senior executive at Toyota – the world's largest automaker – said that no such explicit promise of investment at that level had been made, although Toyota plans to invest and create new jobs in the US. The firm held talks with Japanese and American officials ahead of Trump's visit. Toyota “didn't specifically say that we'll invest $10bn over the next few years”, Ueda said, adding that the topic of investment did not come up when Akio Toyoda, the firm's chairman, spoke with Trump at a US embassy event on Tuesday. Trump met with Japan's new prime minister and first female premier, Sanae Takaichi, on Tuesday. He welcomed Takaichi's pledge to accelerate a military buildup, while also signing deals on trade and rare earths. Sign up to This Week in Trumpland During the visit, Takaichi pledged to realise a “golden age” in relations with the US and to “fundamentally reinforce” her country's defense posture. The two leaders signed an agreement laying out a framework to secure the mining and processing of rare earths and other minerals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran appears to be stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the reintroduction last month of United Nations sanctions that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity. Those sources say the shipments, which began arriving on September 29, contain 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers in the wake of its 12-day conflict with Israel in June. The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic's depleted missile stocks. The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program. Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country's development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles. While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions' failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey. Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China. Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.” “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.” “Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm. “Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles. That's a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said. China has long been a diplomatic and economic ally for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran's oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years. That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds. The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program. In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China's stance that it “attaches importance to Iran's repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.” What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran's development of a nuclear weapon delivery system. So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation. “Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran's missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China's sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) "eliminated" on Oct. 25 a 45-year-old Russian lieutenant colonel Veniamin Mazzherin, involved in war crimes in Kyiv Oblast, the agency reported on Oct. 29. Mazzherin took part in operations in Kyiv Oblast as a member of a special unit of the Russian National Guard known as Obereg ("Amulet" in English), HUR said. As early as April 2022, Ukrainian authorities had identified soldiers from the Obereg unit and reportedly planned measures to eliminate them. The car carrying Mazzherin exploded in Russia's Kemerovo Oblast on Oct. 25, according to HUR. On Yablunska Street alone, around 40 bodies were discovered. A similar situation was documented in the city of Izium in Kharkiv Oblast after the Ukrainian army liberated the area from Russian occupation in September 2022.

She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) charged Ukrainian billionaire Kostiantyn Zhevago in 2023 with bribing Vsevolod Kniazev, former head of the Supreme Court. The man allegedly offered his services in pro-Kremlin online groups before being recruited by an FSB officer. Ukraine's military reportedly struck an oil refinery as well as a chemical plant in Russia's western regions overnight on Oct. 29, Russian Telegram media channels reported. The decision follows a string of airspace violations involving balloons launched from Belarusian territory that forced multiple airport closures. Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) "eliminated" on Oct. 25 a 45-year-old Russian lieutenant colonel Veniamin Mazzherin, involved in war crimes in Kyiv Oblast. The Russian strike hit the hospital at around 9:20 a.m. local time, when patients, their parents, and medical staff were inside. St. Petersburg police first detained Loginova, who performs under the stage name Naoko,  on Oct. 15 after a video of her and her fellow bandmates performing anti-Kremlin songs by artists designated as "foreign agents" went viral.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The central bank cut its key interest rate again on Wednesday, as widely expected, and suggested it might be the last rate cut for a while.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday but signalled that it might be at the end of its easing cycle even as U.S. tariffs inflict significant and lasting damage on the Canadian economy. Live updates on the Bank of Canada's rate decision U.S. Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rate again despite data gaps But Governor Tiff Macklem suggested that it may be the bank's last rate cut for some time. The bank estimates that Canada's gross domestic product will be about 1.5 percentage points smaller by the end of next year than it would have been without U.S. tariffs and the uncertainty they have sowed. It is also a structural transition,” Mr. Macklem said, according to the prepared text of his remarks. “The U.S. trade conflict has diminished Canada's economic prospects. The structural damage caused by tariffs is reducing our productive capacity and adding costs.” Since returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has hit Canada with a range of double-digit tariffs, both directly and as part of a push to protect certain U.S. industries. This includes a blanket tariff on imports from Canada that don't meet free trade agreement rules, and duties on steel, aluminum, autos and forest products. The latest round of tariff negotiations between Ottawa and Washington broke down last week after Mr. Trump became angry over a TV advertisement made by the Government of Ontario that criticized tariffs. Even in industries not directly touched by tariffs, business investment is frozen and companies are holding off hiring, given the trade uncertainty. Can Canada really double non-U.S. exports in a decade? Looking further out, the bank expects GDP to grow by a tepid 1.1 per cent in 2026 and 1.6 per cent in 2027, with trade uncertainty layered on top of a sharp slowdown in population growth as a result of Ottawa's new immigration targets. The Bank of Canada's rate cut makes sense. Trade disruptions continue to push up costs for businesses, but companies are having a tough time passing these costs along to customers given weak demand. But upward momentum in inflation“has dissipated,” Mr. Macklem said. “Looking at a broader range of indicators, underlying inflation looks to be around 2.5 per cent. With the bank becoming less worried about inflation and more worried about economic weakness, it raises a key question: Why are Mr. Macklem and his team suggesting they may be done with interest rate cuts? “Monetary policy cannot undo the damage caused by tariffs. Increased trade friction with the United States means our economy will work less efficiently, with higher costs and less income. Monetary policy can help the economy adjust as long as inflation is well-controlled, but it cannot restore the economy to its pre-tariff path,” he said. Prime Minister Mark Carney will release his first budget next Tuesday, which is expected to show significant deficit spending, with a focus on infrastructure, defence and housing.

MOSCOW, October 29. /TASS/. The Burevestnik missile, developed by domestic experts, possesses unconditional advantages. Russia can be proud of the achievements of its scientists and specialists, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized during a visit to the Mandryka military hospital.

"Just recently, the newest missile with unlimited range was tested," the Russian leader shared. "It has unconditional advantages."

"We can be proud of the achievements of our scientists, specialists, and engineers who created all this," Putin stressed.

"It is imperative that while we address the most current critical issues, we still do not neglect the enhancement and strengthening of our strategic potential," the Russian leader pointed out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House says it will appoint new Commission of Fine Arts members ‘more aligned with … America First Policies' Donald Trump has fired all six members of an independent federal agency responsible for reviewing his controversial White House ballroom and planned “Arc de Trump” in Washington DC. The Washington Post first reported that all members of the Commission of Fine Arts were dismissed on Tuesday. “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the Commission of Fine Arts is terminated, effective immediately,” read an email sent to one of the commissioners, which was obtained by the Post. A White House official told the Guardian: “We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump's America First Policies.” The Commission of Fine Arts was established in 1910, and is tasked with “giving expert advice to the President, the Congress and the federal and District of Columbia governments on matters of design and aesthetics”, according to its website. Its purview includes reviewing designs proposed for memorials and new or renovated government buildings, and the commission is intended to be staffed by experts in art, architecture and urban design. Earlier this month, Trump unveiled plans for a grand arch close to the Arlington Memorial Bridge in Washington. Trump said the design could be “small, medium, large”, but added: “I happen to like the large one.” Last week, Americans were treated to the sight of a construction crew tearing down part of the East Wing of the White House, as Trump prepares to build a $300m ballroom, funded by wealthy donors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two Polish fighter jets on Oct. 28 intercepted a Russian Il-20 aircraft on a reconnaissance mission in international airspace over the Baltic Sea, the Polish military said. The Russian plane was said to be flying without a filed flight plan and with its transponder turned off. Recent months also saw European allies reporting Russian drones and aircraft intruding within their borders. "Protecting Polish airspace is not only a duty but a daily mission of the Polish Armed Forces soldiers, who safeguard our country's security with full commitment," the Polish army said on X. Poland downed several Russian drones over its territory in early September, while Estonia and Lithuania reported Russian warplanes briefly entering their airspace last month and in October, respectively. The incidents have fueled tensions between NATO and Moscow, with some allied countries urging a more forceful response to the incursions, including the possibility of shooting down Russian aircraft in case of violations. Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent. He has previously worked as a news content editor at the media company Newsmatics and is a contributor to Euromaidan Press. He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a two-run homer off Shohei Ohtani, Shane Bieber pitched four-hit ball into the sixth inning, and the Toronto Blue Jays shook off their epic 18-inning loss to even the World Series with a 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 4 on Tuesday night. Addison Barger had two hits and drove in a run for the AL champion Blue Jays, who coolly rebounded from their heartbreaking, late-night defeat in Game 3 with stellar work at the plate and on the mound. By sending the defending champion Dodgers to just their third loss in 14 games this postseason, the Blue Jays reclaimed homefield advantage and guaranteed the World Series trophy will be won at Rogers Centre. Ohtani redefined the concept of short rest by taking the World Series mound just over 17 hours after he reached base nine times and smashed four extra-base hits in the Dodgers' stirring victory. He was on deck when the game ended. The Dodgers' two-way superstar was outpitched by Bieber, the Blue Jays newcomer who returned from Tommy John surgery in late August. The 2020 AL Cy Young Award winner gave up just one run in a resilient World Series debut. An Orange County native with friends and family roaring for him from the loge level at Dodger Stadium, Bieber issued three walks, but repeatedly got out of trouble. He stranded four runners before Mason Fluharty relieved him in the sixth and stranded two more — and the Blue Jays took control moments later with their seventh-inning rally. Ohtani threw his first pitch to the Blue Jays 17 hours and 21 minutes after celebrating with his teammates when Freddie Freeman's walk-off homer cleared the fence. Although his fastball velocity was down to 97.6 mph from his season average of 98.5, Ohtani largely stayed out of trouble with effective breaking stuff. Ohtani also drew a six-pitch leadoff walk to reach base for the 11th straight time, extending his World Series record — but he didn't get on base again. But the Blue Jays finally got to Ohtani in the third, ending their 13-inning scoring drought with a big swing from their star slugger. Guerrero has set Toronto franchise postseason records with seven homers and 14 RBIs this month. Toronto scored on Andrés Giménez's single and Ty France's groundout off Anthony Banda before Bo Bichette and Barger added RBI singles off struggling Blake Treinen. Toronto played without ALCS hero George Springer, who left Game 3 in the seventh inning after injuring his right side on a swing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American ambassador to Canada delivered an expletive-filled dressing-down to Ontario's representative in Washington during a prestigious event in Ottawa on Monday, according to two sources, who said the tirade focused on an anti-tariff ad commissioned by the province. Ambassador Pete Hoekstra confronted David Paterson, a former General Motors auto executive now working as Ontario's representative, at the annual Canadian American Business Council gala at the National Gallery of Canada. He later threatened to impose another 10-per-cent tariff on Canadian goods. Explainer: What you need to know about Ontario's anti-tariff ad The sources say Mr. Hoekstra was loud and using expletives as he railed against the Ontario commercial in front of more than 200 invited participants, many of whom were prominent U.S. and Canadian business executives. The ambassador was overheard saying Canada was close to a tariff deal on steel, aluminum and energy, but that Ontario Premier Doug Ford had scuttled that goodwill. U.S. embassy spokesperson Ariel Pollock declined to comment, as did Mr. Paterson. Mr. Hoekstra hung up when The Globe called his personal cellphone. Monday's CBAC event is off the record and included a fireside chat with Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade. The Ontario ad, which cost $75-million, featured pro-free-trade remarks by former U.S. president Ronald Reagan. An ad impression is the number of times an advertisement is shown to users, regardless of whether they click on it. Robyn Urback: Doug Ford's anti-tariff ad was a waste, whether or not it torpedoed trade talks Tony Keller: Is Doug Ford's TV ad to blame for Donald Trump's tariff tantrum? Mr. Trump originally said he would have run the ad as well, but later called the Reagan remarks false and announced an immediate end to trade talks with Canada. Later he said the U.S. would impose another 10-per-cent tariff on Canadian goods when the ad was not immediately pulled on Friday. Mr. Ford went on U.S. TV shows Monday to defend the ad and said that Prime Minister Mark Carney had viewed it before it aired. “Our government is committed to doing the serious work necessary to get a deal with the United States,” Mr. LeBlanc replied. But he declined to confirm or deny that the Prime Minister or his staff had approved the Ontario ad. Speaking to reporters at Queen's Park on Tuesday, Mr. Ford was asked whether the federal government had approved the commercial. Ontario Premier Doug Ford speaks to the media during a press conference at Queen's Park in Toronto on Monday.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press “I can tell you one thing, if it wasn't this, he'd pick something else that he wasn't happy with,” Mr. Ford said. Mr. Ford said the Prime Minister “text messaged me a few things” since Monday. We're his closest friend and ally, just like the U.S.” Last week The Globe reported that a trade deal on steel, aluminum and energy could be ready for Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump to sign at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this week. That is unlikely to happen now unless Mr. Trump has a change of heart when he arrives at APEC on Thursday.
