The barrage of airstrikes killed at least 46 children, Gaza health officials reported.

Israel killed at least 104 Palestinians in a barrage of airstrikes on Gaza overnight on Wednesday, in a major violation of the ceasefire agreement that Israel has said is back on after the strikes.

At least 46 children were among those killed by the strikes, which also wounded 253 Palestinians, Gaza's Ministry of Health said. Gaza's Civil Defense teams were forced to use small tools and their hands in attempts to dig through the rubble for survivors and bodies.

Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein said that the strikes were carried out in full coordination with the U.S., per the Associated Press.

Israel and the U.S. said that the ceasefire is back on after the strikes. “As I understand it, they took out an Israeli soldier,” U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “So the Israelis hit back and they should hit back.” He added, however, that “nothing is going to jeopardize” the ceasefire, without acknowledging that such a display of force destabilizes the agreement.

“Hamas is a very small part of the overall Middle East peace. And they have to behave,” Trump said. “If they are good, they are going to be happy, and if they are not good, they are going to be terminated; their lives will be terminated,” he went on, in an open threat to end the ceasefire agreement.

The Israeli military claimed that it took out “terrorists” and outposts in the strikes, without evidence.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the “forceful strikes” on Tuesday after accusing Hamas of withholding remains of Israeli captives, and attributing the killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah to the group. On Tuesday, Israel claimed that one of the bodies returned by Hamas was not the body of one of the captives still remaining in the territory. There are still 13 bodies of captives in Gaza.

Gaza officials have repeatedly said that it is difficult to find the remains of captives after two years of near-endless bombardment and genocide. Additionally, Hamas denied involvement in the attack on Israeli soldiers in Rafah. Some recent clashes have broken out involving armed groups unaffiliated with Hamas in Gaza.

“These documented crimes add to the long list of ongoing violations against our people,” said the Palestinian Civil Defense in a statement.

Indeed, Israel has committed numerous violations of the ceasefire since it went into effect earlier this month. The latest attack brings the total number of people who Israeli forces have killed amid the ceasefire to over 200, and at least 597 injured.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Jamaica remains in a state of emergency after being battered by Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic cyclones in history. The Category 5 storm slammed into Jamaica on Tuesday with 185-mile-per-hour winds, and the extent of the damage is not yet known because communication remains limited. Mikaela Loach, a Jamaican British climate justice activist, says the hurricane was “caused by the climate crisis,” and says fossil fuel companies are to blame. It's important to “direct that anger towards people who are responsible,” Loach says, suggesting that hurricanes be named after oil executives.

Jamaica remains in a state of emergency after being battered by Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes in history. The Category 5 storm slammed into Jamaica Tuesday with 185-mile-per-hour winds. Communication remains limited across much of the island, so the extent of the damage is not fully known. One Jamaican official told CNN there's extensive damage to homes, schools, hospitals in southwestern Jamaica.

Hurricane Melissa is now battering Cuba, where it made landfall today as a Category 3 storm. Severe flooding has been reported in Cuba. The storm is expected to hit the Bahamas later today.

Climate researchers say the storm was supercharged by abnormally warm waters in the Caribbean.

We go now to Mikaela Loach, Jamaican British climate justice activist, the author of It's Not That Radical: Climate Action to Transform Our World, as well as the children's book, Climate Is Just the Start. Mikaela will be attending next month's COP30 climate summit in Brazil as part of Greenpeace's delegation. Democracy Now! will be there, as well.

So, Mikaela, we'll see you there. But let's talk about this latest. One of the strongest hurricanes, most devastating hurricanes in history, has just hit Jamaica. Can you talk about what you understand, with family still there — we're speaking to in Brighton, England, but you're from Jamaica — and how this links to climate change?

MIKAELA LOACH: Thank you so much for having me on again, Amy.

It's been an awful few days. Everyone in Jamaica, my family, my friends, over the last few days have been feeling just incredibly tense at this upcoming storm. Thankfully — I kind of lost contact with my family overnight, and then was — had a lot of terrified dreams and interrupted sleep, but this morning, thankfully, I managed to get back in contact with them. And thankfully, my family are OK. My aunt's nephew's house, though, has been completely flattened by the hurricane, and so he's lost his home. But thankfully, all of my family are physically OK. And now it's just: How do we recover from this? A lot of people are exhausted, because in order to try and keep homes safe, that have remained safe, it's required people to be constantly, like, you know, removing water from them.

This is actually a complete catastrophe, and it's really quite terrifying. And it also just makes me quite angry that it doesn't have to be this way. Like, this has been caused by the climate crisis, by fossil fuel companies. And so, I think it's important that we're not just, like, devastated and sad about this, but also we are angry and direct that anger towards the people who are responsible.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mikaela, you've suggested that hurricanes should be named after those who you say are responsible for climate change. Could you expound on that?

MIKAELA LOACH: Yeah, so, we currently name hurricanes after just, you know, people's names, in order to distinguish, basically, between storms that are happening at the same time. So that's why this storm is currently called Hurricane Melissa. But I think when we call these things “natural disasters,” or even just calling it this, like, feminine, nice name of Melissa, we're not making it clear to people that there are actually people who are, you know, around today who are profiting from creating the conditions that make these hurricanes possible.

You spoke earlier about how hot oceans have supercharged this storm. So, it was able to double in speed in just 24 hours, which is kind of unprecedented, because of these extremely and unnaturally hot seas. And our seas are extremely and unnaturally hot because of fossil fuels being burned at rates that are absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary for decades, and because of fossil fuel companies deliberately lobbying against climate progress, and also companies like Exxon, ExxonMobil, who have buried the climate science. They did some of the first climate science in the '70s and '80s, and they deliberately buried that science and pushed climate denial instead.

So, then, I would argue that instead of calling it Hurricane Melissa, we should call it Hurricane Darren, after Darren Woods, who's the CEO of Exxon, who makes millions in his paycheck in salary every year and an extra many millions more in a bonus. And he's profiting from this climate crisis and continuing it. We could also call it Hurricane Wael, after Wael Sawan, the CEO of Shell, who also makes millions from this crisis. And instead, I think it's important for us to put that accountability on people who have caused it, so also then it's not going to be on the hands of Jamaica to have to recover from this crisis that they didn't create. So I think it's really important that we make clear that these are not natural disasters; they're fossil fuel disasters.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you also talk about the impact of an administration now in the United States that remains, essentially, a climate denier and is ramping up fossil fuel production, and the impact this has on the world's efforts to beat back the climate catastrophe?

MIKAELA LOACH: I definitely think the Trump administration and their, like, climate denial and their collusion with the fossil fuel industry has a huge impact. I think what I am nervous about is making it out as if this impact has happened now, this collusion with fossil fuel industry has just begun with Trump and Trumpism. I mean, even before Trump, international climate negotiations were being disrupted and delayed by the U.S. under Democrat governments, as well. So, whilst it is significant, the extent to which I think Trump is changing what we see as acceptable or normal around climate action, I think it's also important for us to recognize that before Trump, these were still issues. I mean, Biden was still pushing through many fossil — like, fossil fuel projects.

And so, instead of wanting to kind of revert back to what we see as maybe better, we need to actually push for something that is transformed and is different and actually is what we need in the face of this crisis. So we need things like a fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty to be signed by every country and government in the world. And we need a conflict-of-interest policy to be put into international climate negotiation spaces and all climate spaces and into governments, so that fossil fuel interests are not able to impact governments in the way that they are.

AMY GOODMAN: Finally, Mikaela, on Tuesday, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates released a lengthy memo downplaying the impacts of climate change. It read, in part, “Although climate change will have serious consequences — particularly for people in the poorest countries — it will not lead to humanity's demise. People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future.” Gates had previously spent billions of his own money to raise the alarm about the dangers of climate change. He said just focus on issues like hunger and others. Your response?

MIKAELA LOACH: Well, last time I was on Democracy Now!, it was actually after I had just spoken at Bill Gates's event, when he invited me to speak at his event in New York. And I — instead of saying the things they probably expected me to say, I delivered a speech on why billionaires should not exist and the problem with billionaire philanthrocapitalism, this philanthropy that exerts control on what future is possible.

It doesn't surprise me that Bill Gates has changed his tune on climate, because I don't believe that he ever fundamentally cared about creating a better and transformed world for all of us. And that world is actually possible with real climate justice. But real climate justice would require us to tackle the billionaire class and to tackle extreme wealth, and he doesn't, obviously, want that, and now especially, because of the, like, rise of AI, and Microsoft being so reliant on that and pushing that, and this requires a huge amount of fossil fuels and a huge amount of water and resources.

It's not just with Bill Gates as the only billionaire that's moved in this way, but in a wider way, Big Tech were trying to pretend to us that they cared about the climate and all their green pledges, and they've started moving away from that. Now they've realized that they need fossil fuels to push this, these AI data centers that we don't need, and they need to, you know, have all this access to water resources, and so they're changing the narrative now to benefit them.

And I think it's really important that we always ask ourselves, when someone is saying something, “Why are they saying that? What — like, who benefits from that narrative? And how can we actually tackle that and create the world that we all deserve, which is very, very concerned with climate justice?”

AMY GOODMAN: Mikaela Loach, we thank you so much for being with us, Jamaican British climate justice activist, headed to Brazil, to Belém, where the U.N. climate summit will take place. Democracy Now! will be there, as well. We look forward to seeing you.

The former New York City mayor spoke out after an impersonator fooled a UK journalist at The Times of London.

The real Bill De Blasio is down for Zohran Mamdani and his economic vision for New York City.

After an individual impersonating De Blasio successfully duped a journalist with The Times of London into believing the former Democratic mayor was lashing out against the current Democratic nominee's proposals in an article published Tuesday, the real De Blasio, a consistent ally of Mamdani, was forced to speak out and correct the record.

“It was just brought to my attention and I'm appalled,” De Blasio declared in a social media post. “I never spoke to that reporter and never said those things. Those quotes aren't mine, don't reflect my views.”

De Blasio said he was “astounded” the article was published and called it “a complete fabrication.”

“I demand The Times pull down this story immediately. It is an absolute violation of journalistic ethics,” De Blasio added in a separate post. “The truth is I fully support Zohran Mamdani and believe his vision is both necessary and achievable.”

The Times soon acknowledged the egregious error, took down the article, and issued an apology to the former mayor over the lapse in journalistic integrity.

“The Times has apologized to Bill de Blasio and removed the article immediately after discovering that our reporter had been misled by an individual falsely claiming to be the former New York mayor,” read a statement by the newspaper.

So that Times (of London) story sounds off. I doubt Bill de Blasio said those things. If you want to know what he really thinks about Zohran Mamdani, he's written it. https://t.co/L33FoxdxOH— Christopher Shay (@ChrisBurkeShay) October 28, 2025

The correction and apology, however, did not arrive fast enough to prevent the article and false statements from making a blitz across the internet. As the New York Times reports:

The fabricated article had quoted Mr. de Blasio as saying “in my view, the math doesn't hold up under scrutiny, and the political hurdles are substantial.”

A spokesman for Mr. Mamdani's main rival, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, shared a New York Post story about the interview on social media and said that Mr. de Blasio had read the “fine print” on Mr. Mamdani's plans and found they were made only of “glitter and vibes.”

While Cuomo and other right-wing opponents of Mamdani have said the city, home to more than 120 billionaires and vast neighborhoods of the super-rich, cannot afford some of his proposal like free public transport, childcare, and other social programs to be subsidized by higher taxes on the rich, De Blasio said in the wake of the impersonation that he personally believes in the agenda laid out by Mamdani.

“I've said repeatedly that everything I've heard of Zohran's vision is achievable,” DeBlasio said. “It may take time, but it's achievable.”

MOSCOW, October 29. /TASS/. The Poseidon nuclear-powered unmanned underwater vehicle is a completely new step in ensuring Russia's security, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to a TASS question.

"These are completely new technologies, this is a new step from the viewpoint of ensuring our country's security. These are also cutting-edge, absolutely new breakthrough technologies that can be used already in the economy for peaceful goals. This actually constitutes the double effect of these successful trials," Peskov said in response to a question from TASS about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had watched the Poseidon trials.

During his talk with soldiers at a military hospital in Moscow, Putin said that Russia had successfully tested the Poseidon nuclear-powered unmanned underwater vehicle.

The power of the Poseidon weapon far exceeds the power of the advanced Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, the head of state stressed.

The US president claimed he had been told the carmaker was going to be setting up factories ‘all over' the US

The Japanese auto giant Toyota Motor has denied Donald Trump's suggestion that it is poised to invest more than $10bn in the United States over the coming years.

On a visit to Japan earlier this week, the US president claimed he had been told that the carmaker was going to be setting up factories “all over” the US “to the tune of over $10bn”.

“Go out and buy a Toyota,” added Trump.

But a senior executive at Toyota – the world's largest automaker – said that no such explicit promise of investment at that level had been made, although Toyota plans to invest and create new jobs in the US.

The firm held talks with Japanese and American officials ahead of Trump's visit.

“During the first Trump administration, I think the figure was roughly around $10bn, so while we didn't say the same scale, we did explain that we'll keep investing and providing employment as before,” Hiroyuki Ueda told reporters, on the sidelines of the Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo. “So, probably because of that context, the figure of about $10bn came up.”

Toyota “didn't specifically say that we'll invest $10bn over the next few years”, Ueda said, adding that the topic of investment did not come up when Akio Toyoda, the firm's chairman, spoke with Trump at a US embassy event on Tuesday.

Trump met with Japan's new prime minister and first female premier, Sanae Takaichi, on Tuesday. He welcomed Takaichi's pledge to accelerate a military buildup, while also signing deals on trade and rare earths.

During the visit, Takaichi pledged to realise a “golden age” in relations with the US and to “fundamentally reinforce” her country's defense posture. The two leaders signed an agreement laying out a framework to secure the mining and processing of rare earths and other minerals.

            Iran appears to be stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the reintroduction last month of United Nations sanctions that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.
    


            European intelligence sources say several shipments of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran's mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas since the so-called “snapback” mechanism was triggered at the end of September.
    


            Those sources say the shipments, which began arriving on September 29, contain 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers in the wake of its 12-day conflict with Israel in June. The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic's depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.
    


            The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.
    


            Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country's development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.
    


            States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”
    


            While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions' failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban.
    


            CNN has followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by the intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.
    


            Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.
    


            Following a similar route, the Barzin traveled from Gaolan on October 2 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 16, before leaving for China again on October 21.
    


            The Elyana left the Chinese port of Changjiangkou on September 18 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12. Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.
    


            It's not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”
    


            “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”
    


            Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran's medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.
    


            “Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.
    


            The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.
    


            “Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles.  That's a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.
    


            China has long been a diplomatic and economic ally for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran's oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.
    


            That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what's often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.
    


            European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.
    


            In February, CNN reported the shipment of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”
    


            Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC's Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.
    


            The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.
    


            Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China's position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.
    


            “First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.
    


            Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran's nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran's nuclear file.
    


            Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program. The UN Security Council voted down the China-backed resolution in September, one day before the snapback came into force.
    


            Beijing was one of the six countries – along with France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US – that signed the JCPOA with Iran in 2015. In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China's stance that it “attaches importance to Iran's repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”
    


            Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran's development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.
    


            So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.
    


            “Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran's missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China's sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) "eliminated" on Oct. 25 a 45-year-old Russian lieutenant colonel Veniamin Mazzherin, involved in war crimes in Kyiv Oblast, the agency reported on Oct. 29.

Mazzherin took part in operations in Kyiv Oblast as a member of a special unit of the Russian National Guard known as Obereg ("Amulet" in English), HUR said. This unit has been implicated in war crimes and acts of genocide committed in Bucha and other cities across the oblast during February and March 2022.

As early as April 2022, Ukrainian authorities had identified soldiers from the Obereg unit and reportedly planned measures to eliminate them.

The car carrying Mazzherin exploded in Russia's Kemerovo Oblast on Oct. 25, according to HUR.

The city of Bucha in Kyiv Oblast became one of the most recognized symbols of Russian brutality and aggression during the early stages of the full-scale invasion. Russian forces occupied Bucha in early March, and the city was liberated on March 31.

After Ukrainian troops regained control of the previously occupied territories, evidence of numerous war crimes emerged, including mass killings of civilians. On Yablunska Street alone, around 40 bodies were discovered.

A similar situation was documented in the city of Izium in Kharkiv Oblast after the Ukrainian army liberated the area from Russian occupation in September 2022. Four hundred forty-seven unidentified graves of civilians were discovered in the vicinity of the city, some of which showed signs of torture

Ukraine continues to document war crimes committed by the Russian military to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice.

The map allegedly showed the front in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) charged Ukrainian billionaire Kostiantyn Zhevago in 2023 with bribing Vsevolod Kniazev, former head of the Supreme Court.

At the hearing, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi's lawyer, Mykola Hrabyk, called the allegations "unfounded," saying that the case materials contain no evidence of criminal wrongdoing on his part.

"The American decision involves halting the rotation in Europe of a brigade that had units in several NATO countries," the Romanian Defense Ministry said.

On Oct. 21, Russia announced a successful test of Burevestnik, a nuclear-powered cruise missile with a claimed “unlimited range.” Does this "super-weapon' pose a new threat?







The man allegedly offered his services in pro-Kremlin online groups before being recruited by an FSB officer.

Ukraine's military reportedly struck an oil refinery as well as a chemical plant in Russia's western regions overnight on Oct. 29, Russian Telegram media channels reported.

The decision follows a string of airspace violations involving balloons launched from Belarusian territory that forced multiple airport closures. 

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) "eliminated" on Oct. 25 a 45-year-old Russian lieutenant colonel Veniamin Mazzherin, involved in war crimes in Kyiv Oblast.

The Russian strike hit the hospital at around 9:20 a.m. local time, when patients, their parents, and medical staff were inside.

St. Petersburg police first detained Loginova, who performs under the stage name Naoko,  on Oct. 15 after a video of her and her fellow bandmates performing anti-Kremlin songs by artists designated as "foreign agents" went viral.

The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday but signalled that it might be at the end of its easing cycle even as U.S. tariffs inflict significant and lasting damage on the Canadian economy.

The bank's governing council voted to lower the policy rate by a quarter-percentage-point to 2.25 per cent. This was the bank's second consecutive cut, and the fourth cut this year.

U.S. Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rate again despite data gaps

The decision was driven by a weakening economic outlook and a belief that inflation is largely contained. But Governor Tiff Macklem suggested that it may be the bank's last rate cut for some time.

If the economy evolves in line with the bank's new forecast, Mr. Macklem said, “governing council sees the current policy rate at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2 per cent while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment.”

The bank didn't mince words about the outlook for the Canadian economy. 

U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionism and moves to dismantle continental free trade have hammered Canadian businesses and workers, and will leave lasting scars on the country's economic capacity.

The bank estimates that Canada's gross domestic product will be about 1.5 percentage points smaller by the end of next year than it would have been without U.S. tariffs and the uncertainty they have sowed.

“The weakness we're seeing in the Canadian economy is more than a cyclical downturn. It is also a structural transition,” Mr. Macklem said, according to the prepared text of his remarks.

“The U.S. trade conflict has diminished Canada's economic prospects. The structural damage caused by tariffs is reducing our productive capacity and adding costs.”

Since returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has hit Canada with a range of double-digit tariffs, both directly and as part of a push to protect certain U.S. industries. 

This includes a blanket tariff on imports from Canada that don't meet free trade agreement rules, and duties on steel, aluminum, autos and forest products.

Taken together, this has pushed the average U.S. effective tariff rate on Canadian goods to 5.9 per cent from only 0.1 per cent at the start of the year, the bank said. 

The latest round of tariff negotiations between Ottawa and Washington broke down last week after Mr. Trump became angry over a TV advertisement made by the Government of Ontario that criticized tariffs.

The trade war has produced a sharp drop in Canadian exports to the U.S. and layoffs in sectors directly impacted by the levies. Even in industries not directly touched by tariffs, business investment is frozen and companies are holding off hiring, given the trade uncertainty.

Can Canada really double non-U.S. exports in a decade?

The bank's new base-case forecast, published Wednesday in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, sees GDP growing by around 0.75 per cent in the second half of the year, following a 1.6 per cent drop in the second quarter.

Looking further out, the bank expects GDP to grow by a tepid 1.1 per cent in 2026 and 1.6 per cent in 2027, with trade uncertainty layered on top of a sharp slowdown in population growth as a result of Ottawa's new immigration targets. This is the first base-case forecast the bank has published since January.

The Bank of Canada's rate cut makes sense. But now what?

When it comes to inflation, the bank appears to be less concerned than it has been in recent quarters. 

Trade disruptions continue to push up costs for businesses, but companies are having a tough time passing these costs along to customers given weak demand. Ottawa's removal of most counter-tariffs against the U.S. in September also means there will be less of an impact on the price of imported goods.

Annual Consumer Price Index inflation was 2.4 per cent in September, with core inflation measures running around 3 per cent – the top end of the bank's inflation –control band. But upward momentum in inflation“has dissipated,” Mr. Macklem said.

“Looking at a broader range of indicators, underlying inflation looks to be around 2.5 per cent. The bank expects inflationary pressures to ease in the months ahead and CPI inflation to remain near 2 per cent over the projection horizon,” he said.

With the bank becoming less worried about inflation and more worried about economic weakness, it raises a key question: Why are Mr. Macklem and his team suggesting they may be done with interest rate cuts?

After all, at 2.25 per cent, the policy rate is at the lower end of what the bank considers to be a “neutral” range for its policy rate. Monetary policy is not in deeply stimulative territory.

Mr. Macklem said that the structural weakening of the Canadian economy means there is less the bank can do to stimulate growth without causing inflation.

“Monetary policy cannot undo the damage caused by tariffs. Increased trade friction with the United States means our economy will work less efficiently, with higher costs and less income. Monetary policy can help the economy adjust as long as inflation is well-controlled, but it cannot restore the economy to its pre-tariff path,” he said.

With monetary policy constrained, support for the Canadian economy is shifting to fiscal policy. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney will release his first budget next Tuesday, which is expected to show significant deficit spending, with a focus on infrastructure, defence and housing.

MOSCOW, October 29. /TASS/. The Burevestnik missile, developed by domestic experts, possesses unconditional advantages. Russia can be proud of the achievements of its scientists and specialists, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized during a visit to the Mandryka military hospital.

"Just recently, the newest missile with unlimited range was tested," the Russian leader shared. "It has unconditional advantages."

"We can be proud of the achievements of our scientists, specialists, and engineers who created all this," Putin stressed.

"It is imperative that while we address the most current critical issues, we still do not neglect the enhancement and strengthening of our strategic potential," the Russian leader pointed out.

White House says it will appoint new Commission of Fine Arts members ‘more aligned with … America First Policies'

Donald Trump has fired all six members of an independent federal agency responsible for reviewing his controversial White House ballroom and planned “Arc de Trump” in Washington DC.

The Washington Post first reported that all members of the Commission of Fine Arts were dismissed on Tuesday.

“On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the Commission of Fine Arts is terminated, effective immediately,” read an email sent to one of the commissioners, which was obtained by the Post.

A White House official told the Guardian: “We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump's America First Policies.”

The Commission of Fine Arts was established in 1910, and is tasked with “giving expert advice to the President, the Congress and the federal and District of Columbia governments on matters of design and aesthetics”, according to its website.

Its purview includes reviewing designs proposed for memorials and new or renovated government buildings, and the commission is intended to be staffed by experts in art, architecture and urban design. There is no indication about whom Trump plans to appoint to the commission.

Earlier this month, Trump unveiled plans for a grand arch close to the Arlington Memorial Bridge in Washington. The design mimics the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but with a gold Lady Liberty on top. Trump said the design could be “small, medium, large”, but added: “I happen to like the large one.”

Last week, Americans were treated to the sight of a construction crew tearing down part of the East Wing of the White House, as Trump prepares to build a $300m ballroom, funded by wealthy donors.

Nearly two-thirds of Americans disapprove of Trump's ballroom plan, according to a Yahoo/YouGov poll released on Tuesday. About 25% approve.

Two Polish fighter jets on Oct. 28 intercepted a Russian Il-20 aircraft on a reconnaissance mission in international airspace over the Baltic Sea, the Polish military said.

The Russian plane was said to be flying without a filed flight plan and with its transponder turned off.

The Polish MiG-29 fighters escorted the aircraft from the area of responsibility, the Polish Armed Forces' Operational Command said on Oct. 29, reporting that the Russian plane "did not violate Polish airspace."

NATO countries regularly scramble fighter jets in response to suspicious Russian aerial activity in international airspace. Recent months also saw European allies reporting Russian drones and aircraft intruding within their borders.

The Ilyushin Il-20 is a Soviet-era reconnaissance aircraft designed for electronic surveillance, still in use by the Russian Armed Forces.

"Protecting Polish airspace is not only a duty but a daily mission of the Polish Armed Forces soldiers, who safeguard our country's security with full commitment," the Polish army said on X.

Poland downed several Russian drones over its territory in early September, while Estonia and Lithuania reported Russian warplanes briefly entering their airspace last month and in October, respectively.

The incidents have fueled tensions between NATO and Moscow, with some allied countries urging a more forceful response to the incursions, including the possibility of shooting down Russian aircraft in case of violations.

"The American decision involves halting the rotation in Europe of a brigade that had units in several NATO countries," the Romanian Defense Ministry said.

On Oct. 21, Russia announced a successful test of Burevestnik, a nuclear-powered cruise missile with a claimed “unlimited range.” Does this "super-weapon' pose a new threat?









The man allegedly offered his services in pro-Kremlin online groups before being recruited by an FSB officer.

Ukraine's military reportedly struck an oil refinery as well as a chemical plant in Russia's western regions overnight on Oct. 29, Russian Telegram media channels reported.

The decision follows a string of airspace violations involving balloons launched from Belarusian territory that forced multiple airport closures. 

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) "eliminated" on Oct. 25 a 45-year-old Russian lieutenant colonel Veniamin Mazzherin, involved in war crimes in Kyiv Oblast.

The Russian strike hit the hospital at around 9:20 a.m. local time, when patients, their parents, and medical staff were inside.

St. Petersburg police first detained Loginova, who performs under the stage name Naoko,  on Oct. 15 after a video of her and her fellow bandmates performing anti-Kremlin songs by artists designated as "foreign agents" went viral.



Two Polish MiG-29 fighter jets escorted the aircraft from the area of responsibility, the Polish Armed Forces said, reporting that the Russian plane "did not violate Polish airspace."

Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says up to $14bn in GDP will not be recovered once funding is reauthorized

Obamacare insurance prices will jump up 26% next year, report predicts

The US government shutdown has temporarily slowed the economy, and while most of its ill effects will disappear once funding is reauthorized, between $7bn and $14bn in GDP will not be recovered, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts.

Their prediction underscores the shutdown's potential for economic damage, which is now on its 29th day. Congress failed to agree on extending funding beyond the end of September, leading federal agencies to curtail their operations, around 700,000 workers to be furloughed and hundreds of thousands of others to continue working without pay.

The CBO predicts that the shutdown will slash real gross domestic product, which has been adjusted for inflation, by between one and two percentage points in the fourth quarter, though much of that damage will be undone whenever funding is restored.

But there will nonetheless be a lingering economic hit, CBO forecasts. If the shutdown were to end today, it would cost $7bn, while if it ended after six weeks, on 12 November, it would cost $11bn. After eight weeks, on 26 November, the toll would be $14bn.

Schumer ended his press conference by accusing Republicans of using people who rely on Snap “as hostages”.

Replying to a question about whether Democrats should take any responsibility if the food aid benefits ends on Saturday because of the shutdown, as the Trump administration says it will, Schumer replied:

We are saying the Republicans can fund it now, and they're using these people as hostages, plain and simple … that's the answer.

He also linked Democrats's insistence that Snap be funded with Republican's refusal to negotiate over extending tax credits for Affordable Care Act premiums until the government is reopened:

And by the way, we don't want to pit health care and food – they do. We think you can have both.

Schumer said that Senate Democrats would support two different bills, one proposed by a Republican senator, the other by a Democrat, to fund Snap beyond Saturday.

But it is up to Republican Senate majority leader John Thune to hold votes on those, and he said he is not in favor, insisting that Democrats vote for the GOP's bill to reopen the entire government.

Referring to the Snap proposal from New Mexico Democrat Ben Ray Luján, Thune said on the Senate floor today: “This bill is a cynical attempt to provide political cover for Democrats to allow them to carry on their government shutdown even longer, and we're not going to let them pick winners and losers. It's time to fund everybody.”

Republican senator Josh Hawley has proposed similar legislation, which Democrats say they would support, but Thune is not expected to bring it up for a vote.

Democratic senator minority leader Chuck Schumer is laying into Donald Trump, after his administration announced that it could not continue a crucial food aid program beyond Saturday, because of the government shutdown.

Schumer argues that money is available to continue the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), otherwise known as food stamps, but Trump refuses to use it.

“For the first time in history, a president, Donald Trump, is refusing to fund Snap during a shutdown,” Schumer told a press conference.

“Forty-two million Americans – hungry children, middle class families who've just … lost [their] job, veterans, senior citizens who struggle to pay for their food, all of these people will lose their SNAP benefits, not because the money's gone, not because it's not permitted, because Donald Trump ordered it stopped. Donald Trump is a vindictive politician and a heartless man.”

Donald Trump's advisers are considering hosting his proposed political convention ahead of the 2026 midterms in Las Vegas, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Political parties typically hold conventions ahead of presidential elections every four years, but Trump has floated the idea of a convention ahead of next year's midterm elections, where the GOP will be defending their majorities in Congress.

They control the House of Representatives by a mere three seats, when all vacancies are filled, and the Senate by the same amount. The party in power has lost control of the House in recent midterms – as Trump did, during his first term in 2018 – and the Democrats are seen as having a good shot of retaking the lower chamber. That would give them expanded powers to investigate his administration, and block much of his legislative agenda.

Las Vegas is the largest city in Nevada, a swing state that Trump became the first Republican to win in two decades last year, when he triumphed over Kamala Harris.

The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, believes that Republicans will back down from their positions as public outrage grows over sharply higher Affordable Care Act (ACA) premiums.

“We are just three days, three days away from open enrollment and three days away from the biggest health care crisis America has seen in a generation,” Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor.

It's the start of “window shopping” for the ACA, when enrollees can get a look at prices for health plans, and Schumer predicted that they “are seeing that, due to Republican obstruction, they will end up having to pay tens of thousands of dollars more each year for healthcare, seeing their premiums, triple, quadruple, or more”.

The current government shutdown is, in many ways, a continuation of the debate over the Affordable Care Act, which Democrats passed unilaterally in 2010 during Barack Obama's presidency.

The tax credits that lower premiums for the plans came during Joe Biden's presidency, and will expire at the end of the year. Democrats now want the GOP to extend them in conjunction with reopening the government.

Republicans have refused that demand, and insisted the government be reopened before the premium issue is addressed. But many Republicans are also pointing to the debate as proof that the Affordable Care Act has not lived up to its promise, though they have yet to resurrect their apparently dormant quest to repeal the law entirely. Here's Senate majority leader John Thune just now, in a floor speech:

Suffice it to say, as Democrats are now implicitly admitting that Obamacare massively failed, Democrats of course now want to put a bandaid on a gaping wound by extending the Biden Covid bonuses. But, of course, that will do nothing to fix the underlying problem, which is that healthcare costs will continue to spiral under Obamacare.

Throwing $350bn in taxpayer dollars at the problem in the form of enhanced tax credits will do nothing to stop Obamacare premiums from going up by double digits, because that's what they have been doing. And it will do nothing to improve health care for the majority of Americans who are not – not – on Obamacare health plans, like our seniors, our most vulnerable citizens, and those who get their coverage through their employer.

The US government shutdown has dragged into its 29th day, with no sign that lawmakers in Congress are anywhere near approving a measure to get federal agencies working again.

The Senate yesterday held its 13th vote on a bill that would fund the government through 21 November, but Democrats blocked its advancement because it does not include funding for their healthcare priorities. The House of Representatives remains out of session on Republican speaker Mike Johnson's orders, as it has since 19 September. The prolonged recess is seen as a gambit to force Senate Democrats to get on board with the funding proposals, which Republicans passed through the House with almost no Democratic votes before leaving Washington DC.

All signs point to no resolution of this crisis today. While the Senate will take votes, majority leader John Thune has not announced plans to bring the funding bill back up.

On X, Adam Schiff, one of California's Democratic senators, criticized acting US attorney Bill Essayli, after a judge found that he was in the Los Angeles-based position illegally.

Schiff wrote:

“Unlawfully serving” in his role. Acting illegally. But left in place? While this Administration continues to replace career professionals with illegitimate political allies eager to do Trump's bidding, Californians need better relief than this.

Essayli, who is active on X, used the platform to shoot back at the senator:

I do the American People's bidding at the direction of their duly elected President. That's how our Constitution works. Try reading and abiding by it sometime.

It wasn't too dissimilar from the tone taken by Essayli's boss, attorney general Pam Bondi, when she encountered Schiff at a recent congressional hearing.

Back in the United States (since it is well into the night in South Korea), yet another Trump-appointed federal prosecutor has been found to be holding the office illegally. Here's more, from the Associated Press:

A federal judge disqualified acting US attorney Bill Essayli in Southern California from several cases after concluding Tuesday that the Trump appointee has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law.

US district judge J Michael Seabright disqualified Essayli from supervising the criminal prosecutions in three cases, siding with defense lawyers who argued that his authority expired in July.

“Simply stated: Essayli unlawfully assumed the role of Acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California,” Seabright wrote in his decision. “He has been unlawfully serving in that capacity since his resignation from the interim role on July 29, 2025. Essayli may not perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney as Acting United States Attorney. He is disqualified from serving in that role.”

The decision represents another setback to the Trump administration's effort to extend handpicked acting US attorneys beyond the 120-day limit set by federal law. A judge ruled in September that acting US attorney of Nevada, Sigal Chattah, was serving in her position illegally. Another judge disqualified acting US attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, in August.

Donald Trump will meet with Chinese president Xi Xinping on Thursday in South Korea, the White House has confirmed.

The meeting will take place at 11am local in Gyeongju, South Korea – which is 10pm in Washington DC.

It'll be their first encounter since Trump returned to the White House to begin his second term, and there's much to discuss – trade being among the top issues. Here's more on that:

Here are some photos coming through on the wires of Donald Trump at the APEC meeting in South Korea.

Donald Trump has fired all six members of an independent federal agency responsible for reviewing his controversial White House ballroom and planned ‘Arc de Trump' in Washington DC, according to reports.

The Washington Post reported that all members of the Commission of Fine Arts were dismissed on Tuesday.

“On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the Commission of Fine Arts is terminated, effective immediately,” read an email sent to one of the commissioners, which was obtained by the Post.

The US Senate on Tuesday approved a measure that would terminate Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Brazilian imports, including coffee, beef and other products, in a rare bipartisan show of opposition to the president's trade war.

The legislation passed in a 52-48 vote, with five Republicans – senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and the former Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky – joining all Democrats in favor. The vote took place on day 28 of the federal government shutdown with both sides at loggerheads over spending legislation.

The resolution, led by Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia, would overturn the national emergency that Trump has declared to justify the levies, though it is all but certain to stall in the US House, where the Republican-controlled chamber acted to pre-emptively shut down any attempt to block the president's tariffs. In the unlikely event the measure were to reach the president's desk, it would meet Trump's veto.

“Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J Trump,” Kaine said in a floor speech.

While Congressional Republicans have largely declined to rein in the president, Tuesday's vote revealed an underlying discontent with Trump's tariffs.

“Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive. The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule,” Republican Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Tuesday. “And no cross-eyed reading of Reagan will reveal otherwise.”

The Trump administration remains barred from deploying the national guard in Portland, Oregon, following a federal appeals court ruling.

The ninth circuit court of appeals agreed on Tuesday that it would rehear a case over the president's authority with a broader court of 11 judges. The appeals court also vacated a ruling from a three-judge panel last week that sided with the Trump administration.

The order is the latest development in a long legal saga over whether Donald Trump has the authority and justification to deploy national guard forces in Portland. The Oregon city has had about 200 federalized guard members in limbo since late September when Trump attempted to mobilize in response to months of protests there.

The federal government has argued that federal officials working at the ICE facility in south Portland were under attack, while city and state officials argue that local officers have control of the situation.

In defiance of Trump's characterization of Portland as “war ravaged”, locals have been sharing videos of the city's lush hiking trails and thriving food scene, and drawing up plans for Emergency Naked Bike Ride against “the militarization of our city”.

South Korea welcomed US president Donald Trump on Wednesday with a replica gold crown and awarded him with the ‘Grand Order of Mugunghwa', the country's highest decoration, the presidential office said.

US and South Korean warplanes escorted Air Force One on approach, and on the tarmac a South Korean military band greeted Trump with a rendition of ‘YMCA' and guns fired a salute.

Lee is hoping to win concessions from Trump in drawn-out negotiations aimed at lowering US tariffs on South Korea, and has wooed the US president by praising his outreach to North Korea.

Lee's office said that in recognition of Trump's role as a “peacemaker” on the Korean peninsula, he was awarded the ‘Grand Order of Mugunghwa', which is named after South Korea's national flower, a pink hibiscus also known as the Rose of Sharon in English.

“I'd like to wear it right now,” Trump said when presented with the glittering award. A South Korean official said he was the first US president to receive the honour.

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he believed the North Korea situation will improve.

Trump made the comment at a dinner hosted by the South Korean president Lee Jae Myung.

The US president was visiting South Korea to join other heads of state and business leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I am Tom Ambrose and I'll be bringing you the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with the news that progressive civic groups and opposition politicians held anti-US protests in Gyeongju on Wednesday as Donald Trump arrived for events related to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.

The protesters accused Trump of imposing unfair tariffs and pressuring South Korea to increase defense spending. Some staged a performance depicting the US president bound with rope, while others waved red cards and chanted slogans such as ‘No kings, Trump not welcome' and ‘No to APEC'.

Kwon Young-kook, leader of the Justice Party, criticized APEC for “catering to powerful nations instead of promoting genuine economic growth”.

It came as Trump and South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, finalised details of their fraught trade deal at a summit in South Korea on Wednesday, and the US president also sounded an optimistic note about a looming summit with China's Xi Jinping.

“We made our deal, pretty much finalized it,” Trump said at a dinner with Lee and other regional leaders on the sidelines of an Asia Pacific forum.

Trump also said his meeting with Xi on Thursday was likely to be three to four hours long and he expected the talks to go well. The meeting is expected to focus on trying to strike a trade war truce.

In other developments:

The Republican-led US Senate has passed a measure that would terminate Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Brazilian imports, including coffee, beef and other products, in a rare bipartisan show of opposition to the president's trade war. The vote passed 52-48. The resolution was led by Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia, and seeks to overturn the national emergency that Trump has declared to justify the levies.

A federal judge has ordered Gregory Bovino, a senior border patrol official leading the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Chicago, to appear in federal court each weekday to report on the day's incidents in an exceptional bid to impose oversight over the government's militarized raids in the city. The order came after a terse hearing on Tuesday morning.

A federal judge disqualified acting US attorney Bill Essayli in Southern California from several cases after concluding Tuesday that the Trump appointee has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. US district judge J Michael Seabright disqualified Essayli from supervising the criminal prosecutions in three cases, siding with defense lawyers who argued that his authority expired in July.

The US government shutdown stretched into its 28th day with no resolution in sight on Tuesday, as the Senate remained deadlocked over spending legislation even as a crucial food aid program teeters on the brink of exhausting its funding.

The Trump administration is planning to revamp the leadership of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to reports, as the government seeks to intensify its mass deportation efforts. Multiple news outlets have reported that the government intends to reassign multiple directors of ICE field offices in the coming days, potentially replacing them with border patrol officials.

Sweden and Ukraine have taken a major step toward expanding Ukraine's air force, signing an agreement to potentially acquire Gripen fighter jets, and the first of these cutting-edge aircraft could be in Ukrainian skies as soon as 2026, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.

"For me, the JAS-39 is the only fighter jet in the world I'd be willing to sell my soul for," Ukrainian pilot Vadym Voroshylov, call sign Karaya, said on Instagram, describing the possible delivery of Swedish aircraft as an "ideal option" for Ukraine.

Ukraine, which entered the full-scale war relying on Soviet-era fighter jets such as the Su-27, MiG-29, and Su-24 bombers, has expanded its air capabilities with help from Western partners. The country has begun adding NATO-standard aircraft to its fleet, including American F-16s and French Mirage 2000s.

But the number of these modern fighters remains limited, leaving Ukraine struggling to defend its critical and civilian infrastructure from daily Russian attacks. That defense could be strengthened by the addition of Sweden's Gripen, designed by Saab Group — one of the most advanced multirole fighters available.

Under the agreement signed on Oct. 22, Ukraine plans to purchase between 100 and 150 JAS 39 Gripen E fighter jets — the latest variant of Sweden's aircraft. However, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson cautioned that the deal is "a journey for 10 to 15 years" and does not include immediate deliveries.

Yurii Ihnat, head of the Ukrainian Air Force's communications department, also warned that deliveries from Sweden are unlikely to happen "soon."

"Aircraft are not easy to purchase. These deals are made through intergovernmental agreements, not simple transactions, which is why they are so complex," Ihnat said on national television on Oct. 23.

Experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent remained skeptical that Ukraine will receive the newest version of the jet anytime soon. Still, they said any addition of Gripens, including its older version, the C/D, would significantly strengthen the country's air force.

Sweden's Saab JAS 39 Gripen is a versatile, cost-effective multirole fighter jet known for its agility, advanced avionics, and short takeoff capability. This aircraft can perform air-to-air, air-to-ground, and reconnaissance missions. 

Its latest single-seat modification, the Gripen E, packs serious power with its General Electric F414G engine, delivering rapid acceleration and high climb rates. Inside, an advanced data-fusion cockpit with a large panoramic display gives pilots a clear, real-time view of the battlespace.

Capable of reaching Mach 2 at high altitude, around 2,130 km/h (1,320 mph), fast enough to cover the distance between London and Paris in around 10 minutes, the Gripen E features a new AESA radar and advanced electronic warfare systems.

In May 2025, the Gripen E also became the first fighter jet flown by artificial intelligence. The AI pilot, Centaur, completed three sorties, showcasing the aircraft's advanced Beyond Visual Range (BVR) combat capabilities.

The older Gripen C/D lags the latest Gripen E/F in technology and performance. It features legacy avionics and radar, has a lower takeoff weight — 14,000 kg instead of 16,500 kg — and has reduced fuel capacity, limiting its range. 

Powered by the Volvo RM12 engine, it remains a capable multirole fighter but lacks the advanced systems and upgrades that define the Gripen E/F.

Despite these limitations, the aircraft could still prove to be a valuable asset for the Ukrainian Air Force in the war against Russia.

The Gripen can carry a range of long- and medium-range air-to-air missiles, including the MBDA Meteor and AIM-120 AMRAAM for beyond-visual-range strikes, as well as IRIS-T and AIM-9 Sidewinder for medium-range combat.

"One of the advantages of the Gripen over the F-16 is its ability to carry the Meteor air-to-air missile," Andrii Kharuk, military historian and weapons expert, told the Kyiv Independent. 

"The U.S. has not offered Ukraine a comparable class of weapons — and they cannot, because they simply do not have such missiles."

Kharuk also underscored that the Swedish aircraft feature a unique information exchange system that outperforms the American Link-16, which was removed from the F-16s transferred to Ukraine at the U.S. insistence.

Experts the Kyiv Independent spoke with highlighted a key advantage of the Gripen in any of its variants: the ability to take off and land from less-prepared runways and ease of maintenance.

While a Gripen flight hour costs up to $8,000, operating a comparable Soviet-era MiG-29 can cost as much as $15,000 per hour, according to Ukrainian pilot Voroshylov.

"The Swedish Air Force has put a lot of effort into, since World War II, being able to maintain aircraft in the field, simply using conscript airmen, which makes it much easier," Peter Layton, military expert at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent.

The Gripen is designed for field operations, and it can take off and land from roadways and basic airstrips. This fighter jet features short takeoff and landing capabilities, while F-16s typically require much longer, more prepared runways, Layton added.

With Russia constantly targeting Ukrainian aircraft on the ground, the Gripen's quick turnaround time offers a vital advantage. Voroshylov said that under ideal conditions, a Swedish fighter can be ready for a second takeoff in just 10 minutes.

Voroshylov also highlighted a design feature that enhances the Gripen's survivability: its air intakes are located on the sides of the fuselage, reducing the risk of debris — such as rubble from Russian attacks against Ukrainian airfields — being sucked into the engine during flight. This design lowers the chances of engine damage and accidents.

At the same time, the Gripen, particularly the latest E/F variant, depends on numerous U.S.-made components, including its engine, which could give Washington a say over its export and operational use.

"It would most likely require a sign-off from the U.S. administration to send Gripens to Ukraine," Cristoph Bergs, a research analyst for airpower at RUSI, told the Kyiv Independent. "As for the exact limitations and political considerations behind that, we will have to wait and see."

As the battlefield in Ukraine evolves, Russian weapons are increasingly capable of striking deeper behind the front lines.

Aerial glide bombs particularly pose a significant challenge for air defenses. Their small size, low radar signature, and ability to hug the ground make them hard to detect, while mid-flight maneuvering and high-speed terminal dives leave air defenses minimal time to respond.

Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at RUSI, said that Swedish fighters armed with Meteor missiles could play a crucial role in helping Ukraine intercept glide bombs launched from Russian Su-34 bombers, which frequently target frontline settlements.

"Only the Meteor has a suitable effective range to be able to threaten Su-34s launching glide bombs 60-100 kilometers (30-60 miles) behind the front lines," Bronk told the Kyiv Independent.

"The AIM-120C AMRAAMs supplied for F-16 and the Mica missiles for the Mirage 2000-5s do not have nearly enough effective range to do so under practical conditions near the front lines," Bronk added.

Meteor missiles, with an estimated range of at least 200 kilometers (124 miles), could also put Russian territory within striking distance of Ukrainian-controlled areas, including Bryansk, Oryol, Kursk, Belgorod, Rostov oblasts, and Krasnodar Krai.

But military expert Kharuk warned against calling the Gripen a "miracle weapon," describing it instead as "another useful tool that will help Ukraine."

The impact of the Gripen on the war in Ukraine will also hinge on how many jets are delivered and how quickly they arrive, the experts said.

Although Sweden began developing the Gripen in the 1980s, its latest E/F variant only entered service with the Swedish Air Force this October. Sweden currently operates around 100 Gripens, including older C/D models and the new E/F versions, leading experts to believe that the first aircraft sent to Ukraine are likely to be the older models.

Brazil's experience reinforces these expectations. The South American country signed a Gripen contract in 2014, which included technology transfer for local assembly. While the original plan called for all aircraft to be delivered by 2024, delays have pushed the schedule to 2032. As of 2025, Brazil has received just 10 of the jets, according to Aerospace Global News.

During a meeting with journalists, Zelensky announced that Ukraine and Sweden have also agreed to localize production of Gripen fighters on Ukrainian soil, Suspilne reported on Oct. 28. The president did not, however, provide details on the timeline or the steps involved.

According to Kharuk, Ukraine is most likely to receive nearly a dozen Gripen aircraft of older variants within the next 12 months, with spare parts for the jets already sent in a Swedish military aid package last September.

"These aircraft will be both compensation for those lost by the Ukrainian Air Force (since the beginning of the war) and a qualitative improvement," Kharuk said.

MOSCOW, October 29. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky's chief of staff Andrey Yermak hampers the diplomatic effort to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, The American Conservative's columnist Andrew Day wrote.

"For all Yermak's successes at securing Western support, his machinations arguably have made any future diplomatic resolution with Russia less likely," the US journalist believes.

At the same time, in his opinion, without a negotiated settlement, Ukraine "is unlikely to survive as a sovereign and democratic, albeit truncated, state."

Day believes that because of "his enormous influence in the Zelensky government," Yermak has the power to control the flow of information between Kiev's leadership and Western capitals. Besides, he pushes a hardline negotiating stance that many analysts consider counter-productive.

Yermak's profound and peculiar influence over Zelensky raises broader concerns that go beyond the present conflict, Day wrote. In his view, US President Donald Trump should "from time to time direct his frustrations" not only against Zelensky, but against Yermak as well.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a two-run homer off Shohei Ohtani, Shane Bieber pitched four-hit ball into the sixth inning, and the Toronto Blue Jays shook off their epic 18-inning loss to even the World Series with a 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 4 on Tuesday night.

Addison Barger had two hits and drove in a run for the AL champion Blue Jays, who coolly rebounded from their heartbreaking, late-night defeat in Game 3 with stellar work at the plate and on the mound.

By sending the defending champion Dodgers to just their third loss in 14 games this postseason, the Blue Jays reclaimed homefield advantage and guaranteed the World Series trophy will be won at Rogers Centre.

Game 5 is Wednesday at Dodger Stadium, with Game 6 in Toronto on Friday.

Ohtani redefined the concept of short rest by taking the World Series mound just over 17 hours after he reached base nine times and smashed four extra-base hits in the Dodgers' stirring victory.

Ohtani yielded six hits and four runs while pitching into the seventh inning with six strikeouts in Game 4. After Guerrero hit his majestic seventh homer of the postseason in the third, the Blue Jays added two more while chasing Ohtani during their four-run seventh inning.

Ohtani couldn't make up for it at the plate, going 0 for 3 with a walk and two strikeouts. He was on deck when the game ended.

The Dodgers' two-way superstar was outpitched by Bieber, the Blue Jays newcomer who returned from Tommy John surgery in late August. The 2020 AL Cy Young Award winner gave up just one run in a resilient World Series debut.

An Orange County native with friends and family roaring for him from the loge level at Dodger Stadium, Bieber issued three walks, but repeatedly got out of trouble. He stranded four runners before Mason Fluharty relieved him in the sixth and stranded two more — and the Blue Jays took control moments later with their seventh-inning rally.

Ohtani took the mound again 11 days after he hit three homers and struck out 10 Milwaukee Brewers in arguably the greatest single-game performance in baseball playoff history to clinch the NL pennant.

Ohtani threw his first pitch to the Blue Jays 17 hours and 21 minutes after celebrating with his teammates when Freddie Freeman's walk-off homer cleared the fence. Although his fastball velocity was down to 97.6 mph from his season average of 98.5, Ohtani largely stayed out of trouble with effective breaking stuff.

Ohtani also drew a six-pitch leadoff walk to reach base for the 11th straight time, extending his World Series record — but he didn't get on base again.

The Dodgers scored first for the fourth consecutive game when Kiké Hernández's sacrifice fly brought home Max Muncy in the second. But the Blue Jays finally got to Ohtani in the third, ending their 13-inning scoring drought with a big swing from their star slugger.

Nathan Lukes got a one-out single before Guerrero hammered a breaking ball from Ohtani over the left-center wall. Guerrero has set Toronto franchise postseason records with seven homers and 14 RBIs this month.

Ohtani retired 11 of 12 after Guerrero's homer, but the Blue Jays chased him with Daulton Varsho's single and Ernie Clement's double off the wall to start the seventh. Toronto scored on Andrés Giménez's single and Ty France's groundout off Anthony Banda before Bo Bichette and Barger added RBI singles off struggling Blake Treinen.

Toronto played without ALCS hero George Springer, who left Game 3 in the seventh inning after injuring his right side on a swing.

U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra addresses the Global Business Forum in Banff, Alta., in September.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press

The American ambassador to Canada delivered an expletive-filled dressing-down to Ontario's representative in Washington during a prestigious event in Ottawa on Monday, according to two sources, who said the tirade focused on an anti-tariff ad commissioned by the province.

U.S. Ambassador Pete Hoekstra confronted David Paterson, a former General Motors auto executive now working as Ontario's representative, at the annual Canadian American Business Council gala at the National Gallery of Canada.

The sources told The Globe and Mail that Mr. Hoekstra began to swear at Mr. Paterson over the Ontario ad, which has riled up U.S. President Donald Trump. The President cited the ad as the reason he abruptly cancelled trade talks with Canada last week. He later threatened to impose another 10-per-cent tariff on Canadian goods.

The Globe is not identifying the sources, who were not authorized to discuss the matter.

Explainer: What you need to know about Ontario's anti-tariff ad

The sources say Mr. Hoekstra was loud and using expletives as he railed against the Ontario commercial in front of more than 200 invited participants, many of whom were prominent U.S. and Canadian business executives.

The ambassador was overheard saying Canada was close to a tariff deal on steel, aluminum and energy, but that Ontario Premier Doug Ford had scuttled that goodwill.

U.S. embassy spokesperson Ariel Pollock declined to comment, as did Mr. Paterson. Mr. Hoekstra hung up when The Globe called his personal cellphone.

Monday's CBAC event is off the record and included a fireside chat with Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade. Canadian Ambassador to Washington Kirsten Hillman gave a toast at the event, but Mr. Hoekstra declined to, according to a third source with direct knowledge. 

The Globe is not revealing the identity of the source, who was not authorized to discuss the private event.

The Ontario ad, which cost $75-million, featured pro-free-trade remarks by former U.S. president Ronald Reagan. It had 11.4 billion impressions over the past week through earned media such as news coverage and social media. An ad impression is the number of times an advertisement is shown to users, regardless of whether they click on it.

Tony Keller: Is Doug Ford's TV ad to blame for Donald Trump's tariff tantrum? Be serious

Mr. Trump originally said he would have run the ad as well, but later called the Reagan remarks false and announced an immediate end to trade talks with Canada. Later he said the U.S. would impose another 10-per-cent tariff on Canadian goods when the ad was not immediately pulled on Friday.

Mr. Ford did pull the ad on Monday, but allowed it to run during the first two games of the World Series over the weekend, which apparently set off the mercurial U.S. President.

Mr. Ford went on U.S. TV shows Monday to defend the ad and said that Prime Minister Mark Carney had viewed it before it aired.

In Tuesday's Question Period in the House of Commons, the leaders of the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois pressed Mr. LeBlanc to confirm whether the Prime Minister had seen and approved the commercial in advance.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre demanded to know why Mr. Carney would not have pressed Mr. Ford to stop the ad if it was going to endanger a trade deal.

“He has a duty to say whether or not he saw the ads he says blew up the so-called deal he had,” Mr. Poilievre said in the House, but Mr. LeBlanc would not answer directly.

“Our government is committed to doing the serious work necessary to get a deal with the United States,” Mr. LeBlanc replied. But he declined to confirm or deny that the Prime Minister or his staff had approved the Ontario ad.

Asked Monday at the closing of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia whether the President's scuttling of tariff talks was prompted by the Reagan ad, Mr. Carney replied: “I would suggest you take the President at his word for his reasons.”

Speaking to reporters at Queen's Park on Tuesday, Mr. Ford was asked whether the federal government had approved the commercial.

“They know what I was doing. And I said I was going to stop it on Monday. It was very successful,” he said.

Asked about Mr. Carney's comments that Mr. Trump should be taken at his word as to why talks stalled, Mr. Ford said it's up to the Prime Minister to meet with the U.S. President.

“I can tell you one thing, if it wasn't this, he'd pick something else that he wasn't happy with,” Mr. Ford said.

“Negotiations have been going on month after month after month … We need to sit down and start focusing on it, in my opinion. I'd take no deal instead of a bad deal. And President Trump wants to annihilate our steel sector, our manufacturing sector. He wants to take the auto sector out of Ontario, and life sciences sector, and we have to stand up and fight for the jobs here in Ontario.”

Mr. Ford said the Prime Minister “text messaged me a few things” since Monday. Asked whether Mr. Carney is happy with him, Mr. Ford said, “He's happy. Why wouldn't he be happy? We're his closest friend and ally, just like the U.S.” 

Last week The Globe reported that a trade deal on steel, aluminum and energy could be ready for Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump to sign at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this week. That is unlikely to happen now unless Mr. Trump has a change of heart when he arrives at APEC on Thursday.

Fans cheer on the Blue Jays during a marathon Game 3 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium on Monday.Barbara Davidson/The Globe and Mail

Jamie Campbell isn't entirely sure when he realized that he and his fellow Sportsnet broadcasters, along with millions of Canadians, were in for an epic night of baseball on Monday, as the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers tangled for 18 innings in Game 3 of the World Series. But he thinks it might have been around the time the temperature in Dodger Stadium began to plummet.

At 4 p.m. PT when he, Madison Shipman and Joe Siddall began their one-hour pre-game show on a concourse overlooking right field, “the California sun was beating down on us, and I was in a suit and it was noticeably warm. It was sauna-like on the set,” he recalled. As the game progressed and the teams traded blows, the marine layer began to settle in around the stadium. “And it suddenly got cold.”

“I don't remember what moment it was, because there is the added mental strain of having grown up as a fan of the Blue Jays, knowing that the fan in me wants them to win the game. So I was locked in on every pitch.” 

Campbell was speaking on Tuesday, less than 11 hours after Jays fans had their hearts broken by a Freddie Freeman walk-off home run, and he sounded as if he was still trying to process what he'd been a part of, a broadcast he says is an instant “top-three career highlight.”

Toronto Blue Jays fans pushed their bedtimes to watch the Blue Jays-Dodgers game, which tied the record for the most innings in World Series history.

The Canadian Press

It was exhausting, being dialled in for eight hours straight. “But the 14-year-old boy inside of me showed up during Game 3 and reminded the 58-year-old me how incredible this is, and how hard I worked for this opportunity to be a part of such a broadcast,” he said. 

“It was like a childhood dream come true for me, just to be part of it. So, all I needed to do throughout during the inevitable fatigue was to remind myself of that. And be grateful.”

Springer's absence from Jays' Game 4 lineup is a reminder of how taxing the baseball season is

The way it ended, he acknowledged, “was sad and disappointing, but with a very small tinge of relief based on the fact that everybody gets to go to bed now.”

The thing you have to understand about being a part of the TV broadcast of one of the longest games in World Series history is that you don't know before it begins that you'll be a part of the TV broadcast of one of the longest games in World Series history. That possibility only occurs to you as the innings stretch on and neither team is scoring and you creep across the four- or five-hour mark of what ends up being a 6:39-hour marathon that you'd originally figured would be more like the series of high-intensity sprints that is live sports production.

Troy Clara, a longtime producer-director with Sportsnet, had directed long baseball broadcasts before helming Monday's game, which concluded at 2:51 a.m. ET on Tuesday morning.

Monday was different. As millions of Canadians stayed up past their bedtimes to take in an instant classic, Clara chugged coffee and kept up a monologue for almost seven hours, calling the shots from his camera people that he wanted to go out to TV screens across the nation. About five hours into the game, they ordered in a load of food for the crew in the production truck. Not that there was much time to eat. “During the commercial break, you'll fire back a couple of bites of a burger or a sandwich and get back at it,” he said.

With the game crawling into the higher extra innings, Clara's camera operators captured scenes that gave viewers a sense of the anxious exhaustion taking hold in the stadium: fans stifling yawns, tense faces, seat tables along the first baseline piled high with food and beverage containers that had accumulated through the night.

Opinion: These Blue Jays ticket prices are too high. We must do something

That exhaustion began to hit the crew, too, and Clara needed to rally the troops.

“I did give a ‘bear-down' speech, I think that might have been around the 14th inning,” he said. “The camera guys and our videotape operators doing the replays, I noticed a couple of them maybe weren't hunting as much between pitches – hunting for that shot of the fan praying, or hunting for that shot of the guy in the dugout, you know, looking dejected or whatever it might be. I think from that point on, nobody let up.”

Even so, the physical and mental strain began to take its toll. 

Game 3 will go down as the marathon game at the 2025 World Series, with Freddie Freeman's walkoff homer in the 18th inning giving the L.A. Dodgers a 6-5 victory and 2-1 edge on the Toronto Blue Jays.

The Canadian Press

In the top of the 18th inning, the colour commentator Buck Martinez fumbled something he was saying about the Blue Jays catcher Tyler Heineman, who was coming up to bat. He corrected himself, explaining, “My pages are running together.” His co-worker Dan Shulman chuckled and said, “You're forgiven. A-for-effort that you're still trying.”

A few innings before that, Clara had asked a camera operator to get a shot of the next batter. 

“I saw the camera whip over and I knew where the guy was standing, it might have been Ohtani on deck, and he's a pretty large fellow and he's standing right there. And I could see as the camera is panning back and forth and up and down, and he's looking all over, I could see he can't find them. And he told me afterwards, his eyes had just gone bleary and everything was one mushy colour and he couldn't tell one from another.”

Almost out of baseball in 2023, Ernie Clement has become a Jays' mainstay

Still, Clara was grateful to be a part of it. In 1992, during the Jays' first World Series run, he was just a fan who lived in Thunder Bay. When the team won, “we all spilled out of the brewpub on Red River Road in Port Arthur and filled the streets celebrating, just like everybody else right across the country. So now to be here and doing this? It's all an experience. It's all the best.”

And shooting in Dodger Stadium is a treat. “The backgrounds are unbelievable and you have a drone flying over, we had a helicopter flying above, and when you're seeing shots like that, for television people, it gets you excited.” At the end of the game, Clara looked to his technical director and said, “Man, that was a long game – almost five hours.” 

It was actually more than six and a half. 

“I had no idea.”

The Toronto Blue Jays will send rookie right-hander Trey Yesavage to the mound in Game 5 on Wednesday at Dodger Stadium, his second start of the World Series.

The 22-year-old who made a remarkable ascension through the minor leagues to the majors this season will get his fifth start of the postseason, and his second start of the World Series. 

Yet this will be the first road start of the playoffs for Yesavage – the youngest player in this year's World Series – and it comes with pressure, inside iconic Dodger Stadium.

“It's massive. Being a rookie that's 22 years old and having that weight put on your shoulders, it's a big deal,” said Yesavage. “But everyone in this clubhouse has my back.”

Yesavage is 2-1 in his four postseason starts so far, with a 4.26 ERA. In 19 innings pitched so far, he has allowed 14 hits, nine runs, walked 10 and struck out 27. He's enjoyed the comforts of Rogers Centre, including standing ovations from the Canadian fans.

Springer's absence from Jays' Game 4 lineup a reminder of how taxing the baseball season is

“With each passing day here, he gets more comfortable,” said Jays manager John Schneider. “I have no reservations about him pitching on the road.”

He allowed four hits and two runs over four innings while striking out five in Toronto's 11-4 win over the Dodgers in Game 1. He struck out his first batter in that game, two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani.

“Each day I learn something new,” said Yesavage. “I take something away from my game or someone else's game. So just stacking all those days up this entire season has led me to this point.”

The Jays drafted the right-hander from Pottstown, Penn., with the distinctive over-the-top release point 20th overall in the 2024 MLB draft. He began his quick ascent through the minor leagues.

The 6-foot-4, 225-pounder pitched this season in Single-A Dunedin, with the High-A Vancouver Canadians, the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats, and the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons.

He keeps many of his belongings in his Toyota Tundra, since he's been taking just his essentials along as he moves from hotel-to-hotel in this postseason. Even while in Toronto, he's staying in a hotel for now. 

“You should see my truck right now,” said Yesavage earlier in the series. “It looks like a mobile home.”

Yesavage has quickly become a fixture of the Jays, despite just being called up to the big league club in September.

He made just three starts with the Jays before the postseason began, but quickly earned a spot in the rotation. He said several Jays pitchers have taken him under their respective wings, such as Kevin Gausman, Max Scherzer, Chris Bassitt, and Shane Bieber.

Even with a world of data at his fingertips, the pitcher who relies on a four-seam fastball, a slider and a splitter likes to keep it simple.

“I'm pretty meat and potatoes with it. Just keep it basic,” said Yesavage earlier in the series. “I don't want to be out there on the mound thinking too much.”

He says watching his team battle in an epic 18-inning Game 3 was quite an experience. He isn't daunted by the loud atmosphere inside the home of the defending champion Dodgers.

“We play in front of big crowds too, so we're ready,” said Yesavage. “Their fans here are pretty good. They're into it the entire game, so it should be a loud environment.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — When he was elected the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee in June, Rep. Robert Garcia at once gained a powerful perch and a pressing problem.

Colleagues elected Garcia with a mandate to hold President Donald Trump's administration to account. He'd pitched himself as an energetic personality who cared about good governance and accountability. But with Democrats locked out of power, he had few tools available to carry out his mission besides strongly worded letters to federal agencies and speeches during committee hearings.

Then came a renewed burst of public attention to the case of Jeffrey Epstein and Trump's vow to release documents related to the late sex trafficker. As Republicans faced mounting public pressure from conservative activists and voters after Trump backtracked on that promise, Garcia saw an opening.

“If he can betray the American public about this, he can betray and lie to the public about anything,” Garcia said in an interview with The Associated Press. “It all goes together. The Epstein files case shines a light on how Donald Trump is only out for himself.”




Garcia in July coordinated Oversight Democrats to force a surprise vote on subpoenaing the Justice Department for documents related to Epstein — and it worked. Republicans narrowly backed the subpoenas at a subcommittee hearing. Democrats similarly pushed Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., in August to subpoena the executors of the Epstein estate for documents.

Garcia dismissed the first tranche of more than 33,000 documents from the Justice Department in September as inadequate, mostly public information that lacked a “client list” of Epstein's purported associates.

The Epstein estate, meanwhile, provided a book of messages compiled for Epstein's 50th birthday. That book contained a poem and alleged signature from Trump with a sexually suggestive drawing. Democrats immediately published the page online and pointed to it as reason to investigate Trump's involvement in Epstein's activities. The estate has shared more information since, including Epstein's flight logs, personal schedules and financial ledgers.

The burst of attention gave Democrats, still grappling with their party's failure in last year's election and divided on a path forward, a jolt of energy and potential blueprint for navigating Trump's second term.

“I think you're going to see us take that kind of aggressive approach in the work that we have ahead,” Garcia said.

The Oversight Committee, led by Comer, is one of the most powerful in Congress, with broad leeway to investigate nearly anything. Lawmakers have long used the panel's clout to command attention and investigate scandals inside and outside the government.

Garcia has sought to use his position as the committee's ranking Democrat to weave his party's disparate stances on Trump, affordability, corruption and democracy into a single message. Oversight Democrats have also sought information on the treatment of U.S. citizens by the Department of Homeland Security, gifts and payments to administration officials and the administration's response to natural disasters.

“I continue to think this is the most corrupt administration in American history, and we have a huge responsibility to investigate that corruption and to also try to make government work better for working people,” Garcia said.

Garcia has also been a critic of House Speaker Mike Johnson's decision to delay the swearing in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democratic congresswoman-elect from Arizona. Johnson says Grijalva can't be sworn in until the government shutdown ends and legislative work resumes in the House. But Garcia and other Democrats say Johnson's real aim is to delay a vote on legislation that would broaden the subpoena for the Epstein files.

As Democrats revamp their media strategy, Garcia has encouraged Oversight Democrats to engage in new digital media to boost the party's message. He's also been meeting with government reform groups to craft legislation around transparency that they hope to put in front of voters next year.

“I think on oversight we have a responsibility to gather the information and then to put it out to the court of public opinion, especially in front of Trump's voters,” he said.

Oversight hearings have devolved into shouting matches repeatedly during this Congress, reflecting the near-total breakdown of bipartisan relations on the committee. 

Comer, the Republican chair, said it was “appalling” for Democrats to release the Birthday Book sketch and accused them of engaging in “cherry-picking documents and politicizing information” to imply without evidence that Trump was involved in Epstein's actions.

Comer has largely directed the Republican majority to investigate issues that dovetail with the Trump administration's priorities, like the state of crime in cities and states across the country, former President Joe Biden's age and alleged misconduct by nonprofit organizations and government agencies. Garcia has opted to focus on the Trump family and Democrats' priorities rather than respond to GOP investigations.

“If we're going to actually save this democracy and restore the American public's trust and move forward post-Trump's presidency, we have to take on the current grift that this man is doing on the country,” Garcia said.

After Democrats made another attempt at a surprise committee vote — this time to subpoena the head of the Federal Communications Commission for comments about the suspension of late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel — Comer and Garcia brokered a bipartisan invitation for FCC Chair Brendan Carr to testify on a range of issues.

But Comer, a close Trump ally, also called Garcia “a real big drama queen,” after which Garcia accused him of being homophobic.

Garcia says his identity as a gay immigrant and naturalized citizen has influenced his leadership style and outlook on the country, especially as the Trump administration pursues its hardline immigration agenda.

“I always say that immigrants who are naturalized are some of the most patriotic people we have in this country, because we all have to fight for those rights that many folks are born with,” said Garcia, who became a U.S. citizen in his 20s. “It built a drive to try and make this country better and that drives me in my oversight work.”

A new "quiet" supersonic X-59 jet designed to revolutionize air travel successfully completed its first test flight, Lockheed Martin announced this week. 

The sleek, needle-point aircraft built for NASA is designed to break the sound barrier while reducing the sonic boom to a "thump," according to the aerospace contractor. The aircraft aims to overcome one of the major hurdles to supersonic travel, which is noise restrictions over land. 

The plane took off from Palmdale, Calif., at Skunk Works' facility at U.S. Air Force Plant 42, accompanied by a NASA chase plane. It landed safely about an hour later at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center.

The plane's unique shape is designed to greatly lower the volume of the sonic boom typically produced when a plane breaks the sound barrier.

The long, pointed nose prevents adequate forward-facing visibility, so the pilot flies relying on a monitor in the cockpit. 

NASA has paid Lockheed over $500 million since 2018 to develop the plane. 

The plane, which measures just under 100 feet nose to tail, flew at subsonic speeds on its first flight, around 230 mph and reached 12,000 feet. 

The plane is built to eventually reach a cruising speed of 925 mph, or Mach 1.4, and fly at an altitude of 55,000 feet. 

"This aircraft is a testament to the innovation and expertise of our joint team, and we are proud to be at the forefront of quiet supersonic technology development," OJ Sanchez, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, said in a statement.

"X-59 is a symbol of American ingenuity. The American spirit knows no bounds. It's part of our DNA – the desire to go farther, faster, and even quieter than anyone has ever gone before. This work sustains America's place as the leader in aviation and has the potential to change the way the public flies," said Sean Duffy, acting NASA administrator. 

The experimental quiet supersonic aircraft X-59, a collaboration of Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works and NASA, parked in a hangar in Palmdale, California. 

The supersonic Concorde aircraft, developed by France and the U.K., began transatlantic flights in 1976, reached max speeds of over 1,300 mph and flew passengers from New York to London in just 3.5 hours. 

But high operating costs meant ticket costs were about four times higher than a standard first-class ticket, and the supersonic boom meant the plane could only fly at such high speeds over water. 

A crash in 2000 deeply affected public confidence in the plane, and it was retired in 2003.

NASA plans to fly the X-59 over several U.S. cities in the coming years, gathering public feedback that could help regulators update decades-old bans on supersonic flight over land.

If successful, the data could open the door for a new generation of commercial jets capable of cutting cross-country flight times in half — bringing back supersonic travel for the first time in more than two decades, but this time with far less noise.

Days after thieves took just minutes to steal eight pieces of the French crown jewels from the Louvre, a former bank robber says he warned a museum official of glaring weaknesses — including jewel cases by streetside windows that were “a piece of cake” to attack. (AP video shot by Nicolas Garriga)

PARIS (AP) — Two suspects in the Louvre jewel heist have admitted their involvement and are believed to be the men who forced their way into the world's most visited museum, a Paris prosecutor said Wednesday.

Laure Beccuau told a news conference that the two face preliminary charges of theft committed by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy, and are expected to be held in provisional detention. They have “partially” admitted their participation in the robbery, she said.

At least two other accomplices are at large.

Beccuau declined to provide details about the suspects' statements to investigators because she said accomplices may listen. 

It took thieves less than eight minutes to steal the jewels valued at 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19, shocking the world. The robbers forced open a window, cut into cases with power tools and fled with eight pieces of the French crown jewels.

The two men arrested on Saturday night “are suspected of being the ones who broke into the Apollo Gallery to steal the jewels,” Beccuau said. 

One is a 34-year-old Algerian national who has been living in France since 2010, Beccuau said. He was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport as he was about to fly to Algeria with no return ticket. He was living in Paris' northern suburb of Aubervilliers and was known to police mostly for road traffic offenses. His DNA was found on one of the scooters used by robbers to leave the scene, she said. 

The other suspect, 39, was arrested at his home in Aubervilliers. “There is no evidence to suggest that he was about to leave the country,” Beccuau said. The man was known to police for several thefts, and his DNA was found on one of the glass cases where the jewels were displayed and on items the thieves left behind, she added.




Prosecutors had faced a late Wednesday deadline to charge the suspects, release them or seek a judge's extension.

Video surveillance cameras showed there were at least four criminals involved, Beccuau said. 

The four suspected robbers arrived onboard a truck equipped with a freight lift that two of them used to climb up to the museum's window. The four of them left onboard two motor scooters along the Seine river toward eastern Paris, where they had some other vehicles parked, she detailed. 

Beccuau said nothing suggests that the robbers had any accomplices within the museum's staff. 

The jewels have not been recovered, Beccuau said.

“These jewels are now, of course, unsellable … Anyone who buys them would be guilty of concealment of stolen goods,” she warned. “There's still time to give them back.”

Earlier Wednesday, French police acknowledged major gaps in the Louvre's defenses — turning the dazzling daylight theft into a national reckoning over how France protects its treasures.

Paris Police Chief Patrice Faure told Senate lawmakers that aging systems and slow-moving fixes left weak seams in the museum.

“A technological step has not been taken,” he said, noting that parts of the video network are still analog, producing lower-quality images that are slow to share in real time.

A long-promised revamp — a $93 million project requiring roughly 60 kilometers (37 miles) of new cabling — “will not be finished before 2029–2030,” he said. 

Faure also disclosed that the Louvre's authorization to operate its security cameras quietly expired in July and wasn't renewed — a paperwork lapse that some see as a symbol of broader negligence.

The police chief said officers “arrived extremely fast” after the theft, but added the lag in response occurred earlier in the chain — from first detection, to museum security, to the emergency line, to police command.

Faure and his team said the first alert to police came not from the Louvre's alarms but from a cyclist outside who dialed the emergency line after seeing helmeted men with a basket lift. 

The theft also exposed an insurance blind spot: Officials say the jewels were not privately insured.

The French state self-insures its national museums, because premiums for covering priceless heritage are astronomically high — meaning the Louvre will receive no payout for the loss. The financial blow, like the cultural wound, is total.

Faure urged lawmakers to authorize tools currently off-limits: AI-based anomaly detection and object tracking (not facial recognition) to flag suspicious movements and follow scooters or gear across city cameras in real time.

Former bank robber David Desclos has told the AP the theft was textbook and vulnerabilities were glaringly obvious in the layout of the gallery.

Culture Minister Rachida Dati, under pressure, has refused the Louvre director's resignation and insisted that alarms worked, while acknowledging “security gaps did exist.”

The museum was already under strain. In June, the Louvre shut in a spontaneous staff strike — including security agents — over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and “untenable” conditions. Unions say mass tourism and construction pinch points create blind spots, a vulnerability underscored by the thieves who rolled a basket lift to the Seine-facing façade.

Faure said police will now track surveillance-permit deadlines across institutions to prevent repeats of the July lapse. But he stressed the larger fix is disruptive and slow: ripping out and rebuilding core systems while the palace stays open, and updating the law so police can act on suspicious movement in real time.

Experts fear the stolen pieces may already be broken down and stones recut to erase their past.

            President Donald Trump's White House ballroom saga last week followed a familiar Trump-era arc: A bunch of the president's critics sounded the alarm about his latest provocation – in this case, the sudden and surprising demolition of the East Wing – and a bunch of other people questioned what the big deal was.
    


            He's just building a ballroom, after all. And the White House kind of needed a ballroom!
    


            “Of all the reasons to criticize President Trump, this must count as the silliest,” the often-Trump-skeptical National Review wrote.
    


            The Washington Post editorial board said Trump was characteristically “pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible.” But it praised him for charging ahead and delivering “a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere.”
    


            Well, it turns out most Americans see plenty to dislike about Trump's handling of the East Wing and the ballroom.
    


            In fact, it appears to be one of the more unpopular things he's done in this second term. And it's not just those  who dislike Trump that are objecting.
    


In pictures: Trump's East Wing demolition



            A new Yahoo News-YouGov poll is the first quality survey to dig into the ballroom saga in depth.
    


            It shows Americans disapproved of Trump's demolition of the East Wing (57%-26%), his plans for replacing it with a 90,000-square foot ballroom (61%-25%) and his broader handling of the situation (55%-28%) all by around a 2-to-1 margin.
    


            Even Trump's supporters aren't defending him too hard.
    


            For instance, just 55% of Republicans approved of both demolishing the East Wing and building a ballroom. That's compared to 94% of Democrats who disapproved of both. Around one-quarter of Republicans disapproved on both counts.
    


            Indeed, the passion on this issue seems to be very much on the “anti” side.
    


            Just 18% of Americans strongly approved of Trump's handling of the situation, compared to 46% who strongly disapproved. And those strongly disapproving included a majority of independents: 52%.
    


            So this does appear to have animated people of many stripes, to a significant extent.
    


            None of that means this is a game-changer of a political issue which will suddenly send Trump's overall approval numbers plummeting to new depths. But it does reinforce that he just keeps doing things rather haphazardly that give lots of people reason to dislike what they're seeing – even, it seems, some people who generally approve of him.
    


            An important question from there is why people disapprove.
    


            Is it just because they don't really like change? Were the images of the demolished East Wing just that jarring? Or maybe people objected to the lack of transparency and the fact that Trump downplayed the extent of the construction. (Trump said less than three months ago that the ballroom project “won't interfere with the current building,” even though the White House had released images showing the gigantic ballroom completely replacing the East Wing.)
    


            All of those are valid hypotheses. But the numbers might actually point in another direction.
    


            While people disapproved by about a 2-to-1 margin no matter how you asked the question, they were actually slightly more likely to object to the ballroom plans (61%) than they were to the demolition of the East Wing (57%).
    


            That's a little counter intuitive.
    


            The East Wing demolition was the jarring part. You could see a situation in which people might think the ballroom is okay and even necessary, but don't like how the East Wing was summarily torn down. But in fact, Americans disliked the ballroom slightly more than the East Wing teardown.
    


The White House's East Wing is now demolished. Here's what was lost



            What that might suggest: People don't really like the idea of building an elaborate new $300 million ballroom – privately funded, Trump says – on the White House grounds during a time of significant economic hardship and inflation.
    


            Trump has shown remarkably little concern about these kinds of optics issues. He's gilded the interior of the White House. He and his family have taken little care to insulate themselves from allegations that they've ignored conflicts of interest and enriched themselves using the presidency, most notably with their crypto ventures. Even as the country is dealing with the impacts of a government shutdown, Trump is overseas accepting gifts like a golden crown from South Korea.
    


            There are signs that maybe people are starting to pay attention to this. A Pew Research Center poll conducted a month ago showed 61% of Americans and even 31% of Republican-leaning people said they believe Trump has at least “probably” improperly used his office to enrich himself, his friends and his family.
    


            A CBS News-YouGov poll around the same time showed 75% of Americans said Trump wasn't focused enough on the issue of “lowering prices of goods and services.”
    


            In other words, it doesn't seem to have been a great time to bulldoze part of the White House in the name of building an expensive place to hold parties. And Trump did a great job of making sure people noticed that's exactly what he was doing.

            The clock is ticking for four major social safety net programs that keep tens of millions of struggling Americans — including millions of children and senior citizens — fed and warm, as well as provide early education services.
    


            The government shutdown, which began October 1, has put in jeopardy these federal lifelines as their available funding dries up.
    


            Still, the gravity of the situation has yet to push Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill closer to an agreement on a government spending package for fiscal year 2026 that would end the shutdown. The two sides continue to throw barbs at one another, while a growing number of their constituents panic over losing their much-needed federal assistance.
    


            Here's where things stand:
    


            The US Department of Agriculture says it does not have the money to provide food stamps to nearly 42 million Americans next month amid the government shutdown. If the benefits are indeed halted, it would be the first time such a stoppage has taken place.
    


            The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as food stamps are formally known, is expected to provide about $8 billion in assistance in November. The agency has a contingency fund, which contains between $5 billion and $6 billion, but Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins maintains that it cannot be used to cover next month's benefits.
    


Is the federal government shutdown affecting you? Tell us about it



            Democrats and advocates disagree, arguing that the money should be shifted to fund November's benefits. A coalition of 25 Democratic-run states sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, claiming that the agency cannot suspend benefits indefinitely and refuse to spend available funds to provide assistance.
    


            Some states are allocating more money for emergency nutrition assistance to their residents in need, while Virginia is setting up an alternative food benefit program. But in most cases, the efforts only cover a small fraction of the missed payments.
    


            The potential pause in food stamp benefits has also put a lot of pressure on food banks and pantries, which are already stretched thin from rising prices and increased need.
    


            Starting on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families are at risk of losing access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households, according to the National Head Start Association.
    


            Some 140 programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will miss their federal funding, which was set to be paid either on October 1 or November 1, if the government shutdown continues.
    


            Overall, there are about 1,600 Head Start programs in the US, but they obtain federal grants at different times of the year so most are not yet affected by the shutdown. They serve a total of a little more than 750,000 children and receive just over $12 billion in funding annually.
    


            Some of the programs that haven't received their federal funds could have to temporarily close their doors, said Tommy Sheridan, the association's deputy director. But others — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.
    


            The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start. The aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.
    


            Most states are continuing to take applications, though they are warning residents that the grants are paused until the shutdown ends.
    


            Those most at risk are people in cold weather states who heat their homes with heating oil or propane, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. That's because a lot of states have rules that prevent electric and natural gas companies from cutting off service to delinquent customers during the winter, but those protections don't apply to firms that deliver fuel.
    


            Still, Wolfe expects many states to try to use their own funds to help any vulnerable households until the LIHEAP grants are processed, though he is concerned that states could be tapped out since they may also have to provide more emergency food aid during the shutdown.
    


            What's more, even when the government reopens, it's expected to take weeks for the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute the LIHEAP funds to states. And the process could take even longer this year since HHS laid off its LIHEAP team during its major reorganization in the spring.
    


            LIHEAP received about $4 billion in funding in the last fiscal year. Similar appropriations were working their way through Congress before the shutdown.
    


            WIC continued operating in October thanks to a $300 million infusion from the Trump administration, which tapped leftover tariff revenue that typically supports child nutrition programs.
    


            Nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children depend on WIC, formally known as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.
    


            But whether it can provide benefits for November is unclear. The USDA told CNN on Monday that it would use tariff revenue to support WIC for the “foreseeable future.” But the National WIC Association told CNN on Wednesday that state agencies have not been informed of additional federal support.
    


            Some state agencies have announced they have enough money to keep their programs operating into November.
    


            Washington's Department of Health said it can maintain food benefits and a reduced administrative team through mid- to late-November, for instance. In New Hampshire, food benefits will continue at least until November 7, but WIC services may end at several locations on Saturday if the shutdown continues.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  This story contains discussion of suicide. Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters. In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world.



            Chatbot platform Character.AI will no longer allow teens to engage in back-and-forth conversations with its AI-generated characters, its parent company Character Technologies said on Wednesday. The move comes after a string of lawsuits alleged the app played a role in suicide and mental health issues among teens.
    


            The company will make the change by November 25, and teens will have a two-hour chat limit in the meantime. Instead of open-ended conversations, teens under 18 will be able to create videos, stories and streams with characters.
    


            “We do not take this step of removing open-ended Character chat lightly – but we do think that it's the right thing to do given the questions that have been raised about how teens do, and should, interact with this new technology,” the company said in its statement.
    


            Character.AI has been at the center of controversy over how teens and children should be permitted to interact with AI, prompting calls from online safety advocates and lawmakers for tech companies to bolster their parental controls. A Florida mother filed a lawsuit against the company last year alleging the app was responsible for the suicide of her 14-year-old son. Three more families sued the company in September, alleging that their children died by or attempted suicide and were otherwise harmed after interacting with the company's chatbots.
    


            The company said in a previous statement on the September lawsuits that it cares “very deeply about the safety of our users,” adding that it invests “tremendous resources in our safety program.” It also said it has “released and continue to evolve safety features, including self-harm resources and features focused on the safety of our minor users.”
    


Here's how Character.AI's new CEO plans to address fears around kids' use of chatbots



            Character Technologies said it decided to make the changes after receiving questions from regulators and reading recent news reports.
    


            The company is also launching new age verification tools and plans to establish an AI Safety Lab run by an independent non-profit focusing on safety research related to AI entertainment. The changes follow previous Character AI safety measures, such as a notification directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline when suicide or self-harm is mentioned.
    


            Character Technologies is the latest AI company to announce or launch new protections for teens amid concern about the technology's impact on mental health. Multiple reports have emerged this year about users experiencing emotional distress or isolation from loved ones after prolonged conversations with ChatGPT.
    


            OpenAI in late September rolled out the ability for parents to link their account to a teen's and limited certain types of content for teen accounts, such as “graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent roleplay and extreme beauty ideals.” Meta said this month it will soon allow parents to prevent teens from chatting with AI characters on Instagram.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Iran does not appear to be actively enriching uranium but that the agency has recently detected renewed movement at the country's nuclear sites.

Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said that despite being unable to fully access Iranian nuclear sites, inspectors have not seen any activity via satellite to indicate that the Islamic Republic has accelerated its production of uranium enriched beyond what it had compiled before the 12-day war with Israel in June. 

“However, the nuclear material enriched at 60% is still in Iran,” Grossi said in an interview at the United Nations headquarters in New York. “And this is one of the points we are discussing because we need to go back there and to confirm that the material is there and it's not being diverted to any other use.” He added, “This is very, very important.”

Grossi said, however, that inspectors have seen movement around the sites where the stockpiles are stored. Without additional access, the U.N. has had to rely on satellite imagery, which can only show so much, he said. 

That stockpile could allow Iran to build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponize its program, Grossi warned. He added that it doesn't mean that Iran has such a weapon. Iran long has insisted its program is peaceful, but the U.N. nuclear agency and Western nations say Tehran had an organized atomic bomb program until 2003.




The Iranian mission to the U.N. did not immediately return a request for comment.

Iran and the IAEA signed an agreement last month in Cairo to pave the way for resuming cooperation, including on ways of relaunching inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities, that has yet to be implemented. The agreement came after Iranian officials suspended all cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog following the war with Israel in which the U.S. struck several Iranian nuclear sites. 

Israel's surprise attack on Tehran came after the watchdog's board of governors voted to censure Iran over its noncooperation with the agency, the first time in 20 years. Iran accused the agency, without providing evidence, of aiding Israel and later the U.S. in their attacks. 

Top Iranian officials and Iranian media then called for Grossi to be arrested and put on trial if he returned to the country. As a result, the Argentinian diplomat, who has raised the profile of the agency, had to start receiving protection by the Austrian police Cobra unit. 

Since the Cairo agreement, a series of U.N. sanctions have been reimposed on Iran over what European parties to the 2015 nuclear deal have deemed Iran's lack of compliance with the agency and the breakdown of peace negotiations with the U.S. 

The “snapback” of U.N. sanctions has complicated the already tenuous relationship between the IAEA and Iran, but Grossi said inspectors are inside the country as of Wednesday and he remains in “constant contact” with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. 

“Does that mean that they are cooperating at the level they should? No,” he said. “It would be incorrect to say they are denying us access. And it would be equally wrong to assume that everything is fine.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom‘s (D-CA) Proposition 50, the ballot measure designed to approve the Democrat-led agenda to redraw California‘s congressional map, is poised to pass next week's special election after supporters raised millions of dollars in donations.

Democrats have rallied in full force behind Newsom's redistricting ballot measure, raising significantly more money than Republicans who oppose it. Supporters have raised at least $129 million in contributions, while opponents have raised at least $46 million, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

The flow of money has been so significant that Newsom told donors to stop contributing to the pro-Proposition 50 cause this week.

“We have hit our budget goals and raised what we need in order to pass Proposition 50. You can stop donating,” he said in an email.

Since the governor announced the proposal in August, the measure has only increased in popularity among Democrats — receiving support from former President Barack Obama and others.

Some of the largest donations include $15 million from a Democratic super PAC, $12 million from former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, and $10 million from a lobbying group associated with billionaire megadonor George Soros.

It appears the donations will pay off come Nov. 4.

A new poll, published by the Public Policy Institute of California within a week of California's special election, shows 56% of likely voters saying they'll vote in support of the redistricting ballot measure and 43% saying they'll vote against it. Most respondents seem to have made up their minds on the measure, given that only 1% said they didn't know how to vote on the issue.

The measure reflected a partisan divide, with 84% of Democrats saying they'll support the measure and 89% of Republicans, particularly in House GOP districts, saying they'll oppose it. Additionally, 55% of independents say they will vote yes.

Regardless of political affiliation, roughly 70% of voters say the outcome of Proposition 50 is “very important” to them.

Given the likelihood of the measure's approval by voters on Election Day, California Republicans are reportedly retreating from their anti-Proposition 50 campaign. This is demonstrated by the lack of money given to the cause in recent weeks.

Perhaps the most outspoken critic of California's redistricting plan on the Republican side is former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who launched his own effort to challenge gerrymandering on both sides of the political aisle.

TRUMP BLASTS EARLY AND MAIL-IN VOTING, COMPLICATING CALIFORNIA GOP VOTER PUSH

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has largely sat out Newsom's plan to counteract Republicans' mid-decade redistricting agenda. Although Trump hasn't directly or explicitly endorsed either side of the ballot measure, the Department of Justice deployed election monitors to California with the stated goal of preserving election integrity.

Newsom called the move an act of voter suppression. In response to the Trump administration, California Attorney General Rob Bonta authorized the state's own observers to oversee the federal election monitors.

Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin reports from clashes outside of a Broadview, Ill., immigration facility where anti-I.C.E. protesters are being arrested on ‘Special Report.'

The Trump administration will face off with Oregon state leaders in court on Wednesday over whether the president can federalize National Guard troops and deploy them to Portland, a city President Donald Trump has said is "war ravaged" and in need of military reinforcements.

Judge Karin Immergut will preside over the trial, which will begin at 9 a.m. local time and is expected to stretch through the rest of the week.

The trial comes as the administration has faced a string of setbacks in Oregon, where it has wanted to deploy 200 National Guard soldiers as added protection for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and other federal officers but has been unable to because of repeated court orders.

Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two of those orders blocking Trump from deploying both in-state and out-of-state troops, and on appeal, the 9th Circuit briefly ruled in Trump's favor but reversed course this week.

All the orders related to Oregon in the lower court and 9th Circuit have been issued on an emergency basis, and Immergut's three-day trial is expected to produce a more permanent decision, though it will likely be appealed by either party right away.

Trump has faced obstacles to deploying National Guard soldiers in numerous blue cities, where the administration claims illegal immigration and street crime are rampant.

In court papers filed ahead of the trial, DOJ lawyers said the deployment to Portland was "amply justified."

"In the weeks and months preceding the President's decision, agitators assaulted federal officers and damaged federal property in numerous ways, spray-painted violent threats, blockaded the vehicle entrance to the Portland ICE facility, trapped officers in their cars, followed them when they attempted to leave the facility, threatened them at the facility, menaced them at their homes, doxed them online, and threatened to kill them on social media," the DOJ lawyers wrote.

They added that law enforcement officers assigned to handle immigration-related tasks had been diverted to managing the local unrest, which they said took them away from officers' regular job duties.

"The record is replete with evidence of the [Portland Police Bureau] failing to provide assistance when federal officials have requested it," they wrote.

State lawyers, meanwhile, claimed Congress' laws governing National Guard deployment allow the president to federalize the reserved troops against the will of state governors only as a last resort.

"The ordinary challenges of governing cannot justify the extraordinary measure Defendants employed here," Oregon's lawyers wrote.

Also looming in the background is a related case pending before the Supreme Court. The high court is weighing whether to take up Trump's National Guard deployment in Chicago, and that case could have far-reaching effects on the president's similar fights in other states, including Oregon and California.

CAIRO (AP) — Sudan's paramilitary forces killed hundreds of people including patients in a hospital after they seized el-Fasher city in the western Darfur region over the weekend, according to the U.N., displaced residents and aid workers, who described harrowing details of atrocities. 

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said in a statement the 460 patients and companions were reportedly killed at Saudi Maternity Hospital in el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur. He said the WHO was “appalled and deeply shocked” by the reports.

The Sudan Doctors Network, a medical group tracking the war, said fighters from the Rapid Support Forces on Tuesday “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”

Mini Minawi, the governor of Darfur, shared a video online, which purported to show RSF fighters inside the Saudi Maternity Hospital. The minutelong footage shows bodies lying on the floor in pools of blood. A fighter fires a single shot from a Kalashnikov-style rifle into a lone man sitting up, who then slumps to the floor. Other bodies could be seen outside. The Associated Press could not independently verify the date, location or condition under which the video was recorded.

Sudanese residents and aid workers also described some of the atrocities carried out by the RSF, fighting since 2023 to take over Africa's third largest nation, after they seized the army's last stronghold in Darfur after over 500 days of siege. 




“The Janjaweed showed no mercy for anyone,” said Umm Amena, a mother of four children who fled the city on Monday after two days, using a Sudanese term for the RSF.

RSF commander Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo on Wednesday acknowledged what he called “abuses” by his forces. In his first comments since the fall of el-Fasher, posted on the Telegram messaging app, he said an investigation was opened. He did not elaborate.

The RSF has been accused by the U.N. and rights groups of atrocities throughout the war, including a 2023 attack on another Darfur city, Geneina, where hundreds of people were killed.

Amena was among three dozen people, mostly women and children, who were detained for a day by RSF fighters in an abandoned house close to the Saudi Hospital in el-Fasher.

The AP spoke with Amena and four others who managed to flee el-Fasher and arrived exhausted and dehydrated early Tuesday in the nearby town of Tawila, around 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of el-Fasher, which already hosts over 650,000 displaced.

The U.N. migration agency said about 35,000 people have fled el-Fasher, mostly to rural areas around it, since Sunday.

U.N. refugee agency official Jacqueline Wilma Parlevliet said that the new arrivals told stories of widespread ethnic and politically motivated killings, including reports of people with disabilities shot dead because they were unable to flee, and others shot as they tried to escape.

Witnesses told the AP that RSF fighters — on foot, riding on camels, or in vehicles — went from house to house, beating and shooting at people, including women and children. Many died of gunshot wounds in the streets, some while trying to flee to safety, the witnesses said.

“It was a like a killing field,” Tajal-Rahman, a man in his late 50s, said over the phone from the outskirts of Tawila. “Bodies everywhere and people bleeding and no one to help them.”

Both Amena and Tajal-Rahman said that RSF fighters tortured and beat the detainees and shot at least four people on Monday who later died of wounds. They also sexually assaulted women and girls, they said.

Giulia Chiopris, a pediatrician at a hospital run by the Doctors Without Borders medical group in Tawila, said they received many patients since Oct. 18, suffering from injuries related to bombing or gunshots.

She said that the hospital also received a high number of malnourished children — many of them unaccompanied or orphaned — who were also severely dehydrated during the road journey from el-Fasher.

“They arrive here they are really exhausted,” she told the AP. “We are seeing a lot a lot of cases of trauma related to the last bombing and a huge number of orphans.”

She recalled receiving three siblings — the younger 40 days old and the older 4 years — on Monday night, whose family were killed in the city. They were brought to the hospital by strangers, she said.

In a report late Tuesday, the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) said that RSF fighters continued to carry out mass killings since they took over el-Fasher.

The report, which relied on satellite imagery from Airbus, said it corroborated alleged executions and mass killing by the RSF around the Saudi Hospital, and at a detention center at the former Children's Hospital in the eastern part of the city.

It also said that “systematic killings” took place in the vicinity of the eastern wall, which the RSF built outside the city earlier this year.

The HRL also reported what it said were targeted attacks by the RSF on health facilities, health workers, patients and humanitarian aid workers, which it said amount to war crimes.

“An unfathomable horror,” Simon Mane, a national director for the World Vision aid group, said. “Children are not just dying; they are being brutally robbed of their very existence, their hopes and futures cruelly wiped away. Their fate is a devastating moral failure.”

He warned of a catastrophe as mounting reports of atrocities were “now echoing the darkest chapters of this protracted crisis.”

Aid groups said hundreds were killed and hundreds detained since the RSF overran the city, but a death toll has been difficult to determine given a near communication blackout.

HRL said satellite imagery can't show the true scale of the mass killings, and that “it is highly likely that any estimates of the total number of people who RSF has killed are undercounted.”

Before the latest bout of violence, some 1,850 civilians were killed in North Darfur, including 1,350 in el-Fasher, between Jan. 1 and Oct. 20 this year, according to U.N. spokesperson Farhan Aziz Haq.

Footage of the attacks triggered a wave of outrage around the world. France, Germany, the U.K. and the European Union all condemned the atrocities.

Mohamed Osman, Sudan researcher with Human Rights Watch, said that footage coming out of el-Fasher “reveals a horrifying truth: the Rapid Support Forces feel free to carry out mass atrocities with little fear of consequences.”

“The world needs to act to protect civilians from more heinous crimes,” he said.

Sen. Jim Risch, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Tuesday denounced the RSF attacks on the city, and called for it to be designated as a foreign terrorist organization.

“The RSF has waged terror and committed unspeakable atrocities, genocide among them, against the Sudanese people,” he wrote on X.

Fox News senior national correspondent Aishah Hasnie has the latest on the DOJ's investigation into former President Joe Biden's alleged autopen use on ‘The Story.'

An investigation into the autopen controversy involving former President Joe Biden is gaining momentum in Delaware and Washington, D.C., Fox News has learned.

A source familiar with the situation told Fox News on Wednesday morning, "It looks like the investigation has heated up in recent weeks and it appears there's a focus in Delaware as well as Washington, D.C."

On Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a post on X that her "team is reviewing the Biden administration's reported use of autopen for pardons."

Bondi's post came as the House Oversight Committee released a 100-page report on Tuesday morning detailing findings from its monthslong probe into Biden's White House, specifically whether his inner circle covered up signs of mental decline in the ex-president, and if that alleged cover-up extended to executive actions signed via autopen without Biden's full awareness.

The report also detailed a "haphazard documentation process" for pardons made by Biden, which the committee argued left room for doubt over whether the former president made those decisions himself.

"In the absence of sufficient contemporaneous documentation indicating that cognitively deteriorating President Biden himself made a given executive decision, such decisions do not carry the force of law and should be considered void," the GOP report said.

A Biden spokesperson pushed back on the committee's conclusions in a statement to Fox News Digital made Tuesday morning, however.

"This investigation into baseless claims has confirmed what has been clear from the start: President Biden made the decisions of his presidency. There was no conspiracy, no cover-up, and no wrongdoing. Congressional Republicans should stop focusing on political retribution and instead work to end the government shutdown," the spokesperson said.

A coalition of 25 Democratic governors and attorneys general on Tuesday sued the Trump administration over its refusal to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during the ongoing government shutdown — arguing that a suspension of the aid threatens to disproportionately harm millions of vulnerable and low-income Americans.

The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts, asks a federal judge to force the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release a portion of the $9.2 billion in SNAP benefits allocated for the month of November. 

The Trump administration said Friday that it would not use the Agriculture Department's roughly $5 billion contingency fund to cover the food stamp benefits provided by SNAP for the month of November. Instead, they said, the agency is planning to keep it on hand to respond to natural disasters.

States warned in the lawsuit Tuesday that halting the SNAP payments, even in the near-term, threatens disproportionate harm for the roughly 42 million Americans that currently receive SNAP aid beginning on Nov. 1, when the food assistance is slated to expire. 

"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being," state leaders said in the lawsuit. 

"Ultimately, states will bear costs associated with many of these harms," they added. "The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems."

The lawsuit was filed by a coalition of attorneys general and governors from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, D.C., Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. 

In the near-term, the states asked U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, the federal judge in Massachusetts assigned to the case, to order the Trump administration to release the USDA contingency funds to help ensure there is not a lapse in SNAP program benefits beginning Nov. 1.

Judge Talwani will hear from both parties during an emergency status hearing Wednesday, during which she will weigh the states' request for an emergency order to force USDA to release a portion of its emergency funds to SNAP recipients.

The USDA, for its part, has not yet shared details on the policy decision or decision not to funnel the contingency funds to SNAP beneficiaries.

A note on its website states simply that, "[T]he well has run dry."

MOSCOW (AP) — Russia has conducted a successful test of a new atomic-powered and nuclear-capable underwater drone, President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday, declaring that the new weapon can't be intercepted.

Putin's statement, which comes three days after he praised a successful test of a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, appears to be another message to U.S. President Donald Trump that Russia is standing firm in its maximalist demands on Ukraine.

Speaking at a meeting with soldiers wounded in Ukraine, Putin said the Poseidon drone was tested while running on nuclear power for the first time Tuesday, describing it as unmatched in speed and depth.

He said the nuclear reactor that powers Poseidon is “100 times smaller” than those on submarines, and the power of its nuclear warhead is “significantly higher than that of our most advanced Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile.”

Putin first mentioned the underwater nuclear-powered drone in his 2018 state-of-the-nation address along with other prospective weapons. Russian media reported that Poseidon was designed to explode near coastlines and unleash a powerful radioactive tsunami.

Putin said that during Tuesday's test, Poseidon traveled on nuclear power for the first time. He didn't say where the trials were conducted or give any other details.

“For the first time, we managed not only to launch it from its carrier submarine ... but also to activate its nuclear power unit, allowing the vehicle to operate for a certain period of time,” Putin said. “In terms of speed and operating depth, there is nothing like this unmanned vehicle anywhere in the world, and it's unlikely that anything similar will appear in the near future. And there is no way to intercept it.”




Russian media reports said the Poseidon is designed to travel at a speed of up to 200 kph (124 mph) significantly faster than any existing torpedoes or warships.

With nuclear power giving it unlimited range, the drone's speed and depth make it hard for an enemy to locate.

Putin also revealed new details about the Burevestnik cruise missile, saying its nuclear reactor is “1,000 times smaller” than one on a submarine, and starts in minutes, unlike a submarine reactor that takes hours to launch. He described the design of the miniature nuclear engine powering the missile as an engineering breakthrough and a “huge achievement.”

On Sunday, Russia's chief military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, reported to Putin that an Oct. 21 test of Burevestnik was a complete success.

The missile covered 14,000 kilometers (8,680 miles) during a 15-hour flight using nuclear fuel and conducted maneuvers “demonstrating its high capabilities in evading missile and air defense systems,” Gerasimov said.

The Burevestnik, which means “storm petrel” in Russian, is the world's first nuclear-powered missile. That propulsion gives it virtually unlimited range, allowing it to loiter for days, circling enemy air defenses and attacking from an unexpected direction.

Putin has described the Burevestnik and the Poseidon as part of a Russian response to the U.S. missile shield that Washington has developed after its 2001 withdrawal from a Cold War-era U.S.-Soviet pact that limited missile defenses.

Russian military planners have feared a missile shield could tempt Washington to launch a first strike that would knock out most of Moscow's nuclear arsenal in hopes of intercepting a small number of surviving missiles fired in retaliation. Putin and his officials cast the Burevestnik and the Poseidon as a guaranteed retaliation to a first strike.

Putin has brandished Russia's nuclear might repeatedly since sending troops into Ukraine in February 2022, declaring that Moscow was prepared to use “all means” to protect its security interests. He again turned to nuclear messaging since Trump has put a planned Budapest summit with Putin on hold and declared his first major sanctions against Russia since returning to the White House.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The U.S. confirmed on Wednesday that it will reduce its troop presence on NATO's borders with Ukraine but shed no light on any future cuts, as its allies worry about a security gap being created at a time when Russia is increasingly confrontational.

The news first came from Romania, whose defense minister said the decision reflects Washington's shift “toward the Indo-Pacific” region. However, Ionut Mosteanu said allied troop numbers would remain above the number before Russia's full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine in 2022.

The U.S. armed forces later confirmed the move, but denied it was a sign of lessened commitment to NATO. Analysts say that it might tempt Russia to test the military alliance.

Depending on operations and exercises, around 80,000-100,000 U.S. troops are usually present on European soil. NATO allies have expressed concern that the Trump administration might drastically cut their numbers and leave a security vacuum as European countries confront an increasingly aggressive Russia. 

The administration has been reviewing its military “posture” in Europe and elsewhere, but U.S. officials have said that the findings of the review were not expected to be known before early next year.

NATO has recently been bulking up its defensive posture on its eastern flank bordering Belarus, Russia and Ukraine after a series of airspace violations by drones, balloons and Russian aircraft.




The Romanian defense ministry said that the U.S. decision will “stop the rotation in Europe of a brigade that had elements in several NATO countries,” including at a base in Romania.

It said in a statement that about 1,000 U.S. troops will remain stationed in Romania. As of April, more than 1,700 U.S. military personnel were estimated to be deployed there. A brigade usually numbers anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000 troops.

“Our strategic partnership is solid, predictable, and reliable,” Mosteanu said in a news conference.

In a post on X, U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said the U.S. “remains committed to Romania.” 

“Our strong presence in and enduring commitment to Europe remains steadfast, including support for Eastern Sentry,” a NATO operation along the eastern flank, he wrote. He did not mention the troop drawdown.

After the war started in 2022, NATO bolstered its presence on Europe's eastern flank by sending additional multinational battle groups to Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia. Many more European troops are now stationed there.

The Romanian statement said that the U.S. “decision also took into account the fact that NATO has strengthened its presence and activity on the Eastern Flank, which allows the United States to adjust its military posture in the region.”

In a statement later on Wednesday, U.S. Army Europe and Africa said that the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division will return to its base in Kentucky as previously planned but that no other U.S. troops would rotate into Europe to replace it.

“This is not an American withdrawal from Europe or a signal of lessened commitment to NATO and Article 5,” it said, in a reference to the collective security guarantee in the organization's treaty that an attack on one ally should be considered an attack on all 32.

“Rather this is a positive sign of increased European capability and responsibility. Our NATO allies are meeting President Trump's call to take primary responsibility for the conventional defense of Europe,” it said.

It insisted that the move “will not change the security environment in Europe.”

Government officials in Poland and Lithuania, which lie further north along Europe's eastern flank, said they had not been informed of any U.S. troop drawdown in their countries.

Giuseppe Spatafora, research analyst at the EU Institute for Security Studies, said that while the full extent of the American withdrawal is not yet known, “we do know the direction of travel: fewer US troops and assets, and an expectation that Europeans will fill the gap.”

Asked about the move, a NATO official said that “adjustments to U.S. force posture are not unusual.” Under the terms of their employment contract, the official is permitted to speak to reporters but only on condition that they not be named.

The official said that even with this new adjustment, about which NATO was informed in advance, the American “force posture in Europe remains larger than it has been for many years, with many more U.S. forces on the continent than before 2022.”

The official played down any security concerns, saying that “NATO and U.S. authorities are in close contact about our overall posture – to ensure NATO retains our robust capacity to deter and defend.”

Spatafora said that the U.S. drawdown could undermine NATO's deterrent effect.

“Russia could be tempted to test NATO even further, without seeking to open a new front, but checking how the alliance responds” in future to more drone incidents or acts of sabotage, he told The Associated Press.

Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports the latest on President Donald Trump's trip to Asia. Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang also joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss his take on the trip and the broader threat China poses.

The U.S.-China trade war is shifting from a tariff fight to a contest of leverage – and Beijing is quietly setting the tempo. 

As President Donald Trump raises the volume, Beijing is adjusting the dials, fine-tuning export controls, critical minerals and supply chains. 

The move leaves Washington reacting to Beijing's playbook instead of writing the next move, a dynamic that will hang over Trump's next encounter with Chinese President Xi Jinping. 

On Thursday, the two leaders of the world's largest economies are set to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Busan, South Korea. It will be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump's return to office.

For Trump, the visit is more than diplomatic choreography, it's a stage for his economic doctrine. He's anchored his Washington comeback on the idea of U.S. economic firepower, framing his battle cry around restoring American dominance in global trade and emerging technologies. In doing so, his administration has pressed allies and rivals alike to revisit trade terms, wielding tariffs as both weapon and warning.

"There are a lot of arrows in the Chinese quiver," Bryan Burack, a senior policy advisor for China and the Indo-Pacific at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. "The fact of the matter is that they can literally make more moves than we can. They have more coercive tools to use against us, and they can deploy them easier," Burack added, pointing to U.S. industrial dependencies.

"China has been decoupling from us for a long time," Burack said. "So a lot of these moves that look like retaliation are really part of Xi Jinping's long-standing effort to sever dependence on the United States and build self-reliance on critical technologies. Unfortunately, the only way for us to respond is to do the same and that process is painful and excruciating," he added.

Clark Packard, a research fellow at the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, said the perception that China now holds the upper hand is misplaced.

"It is the most important bilateral relationship. It's the most important geopolitical relationship," Packard said. "But policymakers in the United States are overestimating China's economic strength. Beijing believes global power is tilting its way, but that kind of defeatism in Washington is overdone. China's economy isn't nearly as strong as many people think."

He pointed to deep imbalances within China's economy as evidence. "It's focused far too heavily on manufacturing and not enough on domestic consumption," he said. "The country is increasingly dependent on exports and much of the world is growing uneasy with China's outsized share of global trade," Packard added.

Henrietta Levin, a senior fellow on China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, said Trump and Xi will likely try to cool tensions on Thursday, at least for now.

"Both sides are seeking a period of stability in the relationship," said Levin, a former deputy China coordinator at the State Department. "They may reach a limited arrangement, but on whose terms remain to be seen. China is confident it has the upper hand in the trade war and the broader relationship, so Beijing will be reluctant to make meaningful concessions without getting much more in return."

Levin said that confidence stems from Beijing's belief that the U.S. can't absorb economic pain as deeply or as patiently as China can, betting that any trade war will hurt Washington faster and harder.

"What would really strengthen the U.S. hand is deepening partnerships, especially in Asia. Creating a common front against Chinese aggression and unfair trade practices, rather than trying to confront China and its allies at the same time."

Levin added that Washington must also regain control of the diplomatic narrative. "The U.S. would be better off setting the terms of the relationship rather than merely reacting," she said. "It feels like we may have lost the plot in our diplomacy with China and have lost sight of the structural economic issues the trade war was originally meant to address."

The Category 5 storm is an extraordinary threat — even in a season that felt unusually quiet.

Hurricane Melissa, already one of the strongest hurricanes in history, made landfall in Cuba on Wednesday morning as a Category 3 strength with winds at 120 miles per hour. It has now weakened to Category 2. The National Hurricane Center warned that Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic are facing dangerous flash floods and landslides. The storm is responsible for at least seven deaths as of Wednesday morning.

Behind the storm, 2.8 million Jamaicans are reeling from the strongest hurricane to ever lash the island. Melissa landed on Jamaica on Tuesday with winds at 185 miles per hour, putting it firmly in Category 5. Ahead of landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a blunt warning for Jamaica: “THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION! TAKE COVER NOW!”

The capitals and exclamation points are warranted. Hurricane Melissa is an extraordinary storm, even among the many massive, fast-growing, devastating cyclones that have been erupting in the Atlantic Ocean in recent years.

Already, it's the strongest storm on record to hit the island and is poised to cause landslides, power outages, and flash floods. Forecasters expect this one storm will dish out as much rain as three whole months in Jamaica's rainy season, up to 27 inches of precipitation, while coastal areas may see a storm surge as high as 13 feet. Melissa is also poised to extend its swinging arms into Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

It's clear that Melissa will leave a lasting scar on the islands in its path. It's likely to be the strongest tropical cyclone in the world this year, and aid agencies are preparing for a humanitarian disaster. “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,” World Meteorological Organization tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland.

As Melissa starts to leave Jamaica behind and ventures further north in the Caribbean, here are a few key things to keep in mind:

It's hard to overstate just how powerful this storm is, and how quickly it erupted. Melissa is now tied with Hurricane Dorian in 2019 and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest storm to ever make landfall, and certainly the strongest to hit Jamaica. The last time Jamaica took a direct hit from a hurricane was in 1988 from Gilbert.

Melissa also grew quickly. Its wind speed more than doubled in 24 hours, from 70 mph to 140 mph. The threshold for rapid intensification is wind speeds increasing by at least 35 mph in 24 hours.

A hurricane's devastation doesn't only come from its strong winds. Even a weaker cyclone can leave a trail of death and destruction when it hits a vulnerable area, and much of the lasting havoc comes from water, not wind. Earlier this year, the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, for example, moved inland and collided with another weather system over Texas and triggered flash floods that killed at least 90 people.

Jamaica is particularly vulnerable because its mountainous geography can create the ideal conditions for flash floods. And as the country faces a housing shortage and rising prices that are driving many into substandard living conditions, much of the island's housing stock is unlikely to withstand the storm unscathed. Jamaica has enough shelters for 20,000 people, so most residents are likely to brave the storm at home. Officials are worried that not enough people had evacuated ahead of the storm in low-lying areas prone to flooding.

“There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness in a news conference Monday.

Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to November 30. In its early season outlook in May, NOAA anticipated a 60 percent chance of “above-normal” hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean this year, with up to 19 named storms and five of those turning into major hurricanes. The agency's updated forecast in August slightly lowered the chances of above-normal activity to 50 percent. Forecasters saw that there was ample warm water in the Atlantic Ocean — a necessary ingredient for hurricanes — and atmospheric conditions that make it easier for cyclones to form.

From an American perspective, this season felt unusually quiet. There have been 13 named Atlantic storms this year so far. This year became the first time in a decade that no hurricane made landfall in the US by the end of September. But while most tropical storms in the Atlantic didn't hit the US, several did strike the Caribbean. There were also major storms that churned out at sea and still caused houses to collapse in places like the Outer Banks in North Carolina. Melissa is the third Category 5 hurricane this year, after Erin and Humberto, making 2025 one of the most active years on record when it comes to the most severe storms.

”It's been a busy season,” said Monica Medina, a former senior official at NOAA under President Barack Obama. “It's just the storms have not hit the US.”

While the season as a whole may have seemed unusually calm before Melissa, there's still another month to go, and the fuel for another massive storm remains ready.

And historically, some of our most catastrophic storms hit during unusually quiet seasons. “There's this old phrase: All it takes is one,” said Michael Fischer, an assistant professor at the University of Miami studying hurricane modeling. Fischer noted that hurricane activity in 1992 was significantly below average, but that was the year Hurricane Andrew struck Florida and became, at the time, the costliest storm to hit the US, causing $26 billion in damages. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 broke that record with more than $100 billion in damages during a more active season. “We have to be careful before we make assessments of this hurricane season,” Fischer said. “So far it's been a bit, perhaps a bit quieter than what was expected in terms of the total number of named storms, but the book is not done being written yet.”

By late Tuesday, Hurricane Melissa had weakened to a Category 4 as the storm continued to move across the country. Already, officials are reporting extensive damage to homes, schools, and hospitals. “I'm praying for those residents, and we have been preparing and we have been praying for the best,” Holness said, encouraging Jamaicans to “stay inside, batten down (and) keep safe.”

Update October 29, 9:15 am ET: This story was originally published earlier on October 29 and has been updated with new reporting as the storm progresses across the Caribbean.

U.S. lawmakers have tried four times since September last year to close what they called a glaring loophole: China is getting around export bans on the sale of powerful American AI chips by renting them through U.S. cloud services instead.

But the proposals prompted a flurry of activity from more than 100 lobbyists from tech companies and their trade associations trying to weigh in, according to disclosure reports.

The result: All four times, the proposal failed, including just last month.

As leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping prepare for a long-heralded meeting Thursday, the sale of U.S. technology to China is among the thorniest issues the U.S. faces, with billions of dollars and the future of tech dominance at stake. But the tough talk about China obscures a deeper story: Even while warning about national security and human rights abuse, the U.S. government across five Republican and Democratic administrations has repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police, government agencies and surveillance companies, an Associated Press investigation has found.

And time after time, despite bipartisan attempts, Congress has turned a blind eye to loopholes that allow China to work around its own rules, such as cloud services, third-party resellers, and holes in sanctions passed after the Tiananmen massacre. For example, despite U.S. export rules around advanced chips, China bought $20.7 billion worth of chipmaking equipment from U.S. companies in 2024 to bolster its homegrown industry, a report from a congressional committee this month warned. 

This reluctance to act reflects the tremendous wealth and power of the tech industry, which is more visible than ever under the Trump administration. And in recent months, the president himself has struck grand deals with Silicon Valley firms that even more closely tie the U.S. economy to tech exports to China, giving taxpayers a direct stake in the profits for the first time.

In August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services. That same month, Trump announced that the U.S. government had taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion.

Longtime Chinese activist Zhou Fengsuo said the U.S. government is letting American companies set the agenda and ignoring how they help Beijing surveil and censor its own people. In 1989, Zhou was a student leader during the Tiananmen protests, where hundreds and possibly thousands were shot and killed by the Chinese government. Zhou was arrested and imprisoned.

Now a U.S. citizen, Zhou testified before Congress in 2024, calling on Washington to investigate the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance. An AP investigation in September found that American companies to a large degree designed and built China's surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known.

“It's driven by profit, and that's why these strategic discussions have been silenced or delayed,” Zhou said. “I'm extremely disappointed. … this is a strategic failure by the United States.” 

The sale of technology to China is contentious among both Republicans and Democrats, with some arguing for a harder stance. 

They are fighting a powerful opponent. An AP analysis of lobbying filings showed U.S. tech and telecom companies, as well as their trade associations, spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past two decades on lobbyists who listed key bills impacting China-related trade on their quarterly disclosure reports, among other issues.

Tech companies argue that further export restrictions will push China to develop its own domestic supply and strengthen its position in the global race for leadership in artificial intelligence. 

“Continuing to ban U.S. computing from commercial markets only benefits foreign competition and undercuts President Trump's efforts to create jobs, reduce the trade deficit, and grow the economy,” Nvidia said in a statement.

Nvidia has also said that it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed its H20 AI chip for police surveillance. 

Intel, which partnered with a Chinese fingerprinting company as recently as last year, has said the company follows export control policies, and did not address details of its deal with the U.S. government. 

“The U.S. government's investment is a passive ownership, with no board representation, governance or information rights,” Intel said in a statement.

AMD did not respond. The White House and the Commerce and State departments also did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The AP investigation was based on dozens of open record requests, hundreds of pages of congressional testimony, lobbying disclosures and dozens of interviews with current and former Chinese and American executives, politicians, and former federal officials.

Under the cloud services loophole, Chinese companies barred from accessing cutting-edge chips can use Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services overseas instead to train their AI models. Microsoft and AWS also both advertise the capacity to store video surveillance footage on their cloud services for Chinese customers.

For example, SDIC Contech, a state-owned tech company that works with AI, sought access to AWS and Microsoft Azure big data analytics services, procurement bids show. And Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute, a government-backed research institute working on sensitive technologies such as encryption, sought access to $280,000 worth of Azure OpenAI cloud services from Microsoft.

Even sanctioned Chinese companies can use AWS and Microsoft Azure to offer surveillance abilities to customers overseas. For example, despite U.S. sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang in 2019, Dahua and Hikvision, China's two largest surveillance companies, use AWS to offer networked surveillance abroad, according to marketing material on the company websites. Hikvision markets a video surveillance platform called “HikCentral” to private companies overseas, which can be also deployed on Azure, according to a post on Hikvision's website this year. 

Microsoft denied providing services to Hikvision or partnering with them to provide services to others. OpenAI, which provides its advanced AI models through Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, said it was subject to Microsoft's policies and doesn't support China access to its services. AWS did not respond on the record to questions about the cloud services loophole.

Another enduring loophole is in the restrictions passed after the Tiananmen massacre that didn't include newer policing technologies, such as security cameras, surveillance drives, or facial recognition systems. In 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013, lawmakers introduced bills to try and close the loophole. All failed.

The U.S. government under both Republican and Democratic presidents has made other attempts to regulate tech surveillance exports to China. In 2008, the Department of Commerce asked for comment on whether to include “biometric devices” and “integrated security systems” under controlled exports, but ran out of time before the next administration came in. In 2014 and 2015, it tried to tighten controls on surveillance products, but most fell through. In 2024, it sought to restrict exports of face-recognition systems and bar many more military, police, and intelligence end users from receiving U.S. goods, with no success.

Some politicians on both sides of the aisle blame the failures in part on the money and political influence of tech companies.

“I think we've been naive or complicit in the extreme,” said New Jersey GOP Rep. Chris Smith. The U.S., he said, has been “selling and conveying to a malevolent power the ability to destroy us and destroy like-minded Western democracies.” 

“What do all those companies all have in common? A big wallet,” said Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon. “That is as much as anything is what's behind the fact we haven't made as much progress.”

The first round of U.S. prohibitions on Chinese police came after the Tiananmen massacre and applied to “crime control and detection” equipment. They largely stopped U.S. companies from exporting goods to Chinese entities such as restraints, helmets, shields and batons.

But the controls were narrowly confined to largely low-tech goods, leaving out advanced technologies that could be used by police and leading at times to puzzling priorities. U.S. regulators warned sex shops against shipping novelty gold handcuffs to China. At the same time, they broadly permitted Silicon Valley companies to sell routers, servers, software, and more recently, AI-powered surveillance systems to Chinese police. 

For example, despite explicit restrictions on fingerprint recognition systems, U.S. companies still were able to sell gear to process, store and compare fingerprints.

In 2006, with bipartisan support, Smith introduced the Global Online Freedom Act to curtail the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance. Smith drew parallels with IBM's sale of computing gear to Nazi Germany, which has been well documented by historians. IBM told AP in a follow-up statement that the claim that IBM knowingly collaborated with Nazi Germany was “false and has been rejected by credible historians.” 

Associations representing the tech and telecommunications industries and dozens of companies stepped up their lobbying against Smith's proposal, disclosures show. The companies argued the computers, servers and routers they sold in China were no different from what they sold to other countries. Industry groups and individual companies also submitted hundreds of comments to regulators, hoping to influence China-related export regulations.

Smith's bill went nowhere.

“Money talks … When they flood certain members on strategic committees with the money, PAC money and the like, how much easier it is to listen to their narrative that somehow they're part of the reform?” said Smith.

Tech sales to China continued, sometimes with direct government support. Numerous archived webpages show that the U.S. Commercial Service, the export-promoting arm of the Commerce Department, played a crucial role for more than a decade in connecting U.S. vendors to Chinese security agencies and key government officials, including through its marquee Gold Key Matching service.

In 2004, the Commercial Service invited American companies selling security technologies and equipment to show off their products at a Chinese security exposition. Two years later, it advertised opportunities for American firms in the “safety and security” market, followed by another publication later describing market opportunities for foreign security products such as inspection control and guard communication systems. Archived webpages also show that under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the Commercial Service steadily promoted U.S. participation in policing trade shows, even those that showcased “biological identification technologies” or were initiated by the Chinese Communist Party. 

Under Bush, the Commerce Department in 2007 hosted a webinar about how to sell to the Chinese security market and promote surveillance tools to China's public sector. For just $35, the federal agency could offer attendees “market entry-strategies and long-term market penetration plans,” an archived webpage shows. 

Jeanette Chu, who then worked at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and helped give the 2007 webinar, recalled sometimes having concerns.

“I used to ask myself all the time, ‘what is the scary potential of each item?'” said Chu, now a national security and trade expert advising industry.

Despite promises to nail shut Washington's revolving door, President Barack Obama — like presidents before and after him — gave former industry lobbyists and allies top jobs, including Eric Hirschhorn in the Commerce Department, who represented a trade group that lobbied for tech companies exporting abroad. Hirschhorn wrote that Beijing's surveillance abilities were nothing compared to the half-million surveillance cameras blanketing London. He was put in charge of the office that administers U.S. export controls.

In an interview, Hirschhorn said export controls alone were an inefficient way to defend human rights.

“You can use a computer to type an order or type a love note,” he told AP. “Are you not going to sell computers to China because one out of every 10,000 of them will be used to store data about a dissident?”

In 2010, the U.S. State Department's human rights report warned of “police surveillance, harassment and detentions of activists.” Yet U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman led a mission to promote American business interests in the far-west region of Xinjiang, where authorities had arrested thousands of ethnic Uyghurs and cut internet access after deadly unrest the year before. Huntsman did not respond to requests for comment. 

That same year, the Commercial Service spotlighted opportunities for U.S. companies to sell equipment directly to China's central government “ to install a city-wide infrastructure of security, surveillance, and alarm systems " on its website. 

A 2015 State Department draft plan for “smart city” cooperation obtained by AP proposed that China and the U.S. collaborate on joint research, such as on crime and “urban security,” and include private sector players such IBM. Additional documents AP obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request show the U.S. government also sought active counter-terrorism cooperation with China, which gave tech companies a chance for closer contact with Chinese authorities even as Beijing broadly labelled protest or dissent among Uyghurs as terrorism.

Kevin Wolf, then an assistant secretary in charge of export controls at Commerce, said as news about human rights abuses inside China kept surfacing, he worried about U.S. innovations falling into the wrong hands. Wolf said he began drafting a rule to regulate certain surveillance gear sales in early 2016.

“The problem I was struggling with was, mass surveillance can involve everyday ordinary common items: it's cameras, it's software, it's facial recognition stuff and 99 percent of all of those applications are perfectly benign,” said Wolf, now a compliance attorney for industry. “So if you were to say, ban cameras that can read someone's face, you blow up international trade.”

Wolf's colleagues told him the draft rule was too complicated, Wolf said, and it foundered.




In 2018, Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act, giving Commerce authority to make export control rules about advanced technologies. In 2019 and 2020, the Trump administration sanctioned some Chinese officials and surveillance firms over atrocities in Xinjiang. But sales of surveillance equipment continued, albeit at a slower pace — though references to working with the Chinese police would disappear from annual Commerce Department reports for U.S. industry. 

In 2021, Joe Biden put out an executive order describing Chinese surveillance tech companies as “unusual and extraordinary threats” that enabled serious human rights abuses. In his final months in office, Biden's administration drew up sprawling rules for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI systems. Commerce also floated an updated version of Wolf's draft rule to keep facial recognition and other mass surveillance tools from reaching military and intelligence agencies and companies, including in China.

But once again, Washington lobbyists, lawyers and politicians pushed back. “The result would slow business considerably and likely result in the loss of customers that do not present any national security or human rights concerns,” said a Chamber of Commerce filing from late last year.

The proposed rule, in the end, stalled out. 

Gulbahar Haitiwaji, an ethnic Uyghur living in France, says little has changed since she testified to Congress in 2023 urging the U.S. government to “stop American companies from continuing to be complicit in surveilling our people”.

Haitiwaji was arrested and detained in internment camps in Xinjiang for more than two years, after policing systems based on U.S. technology led Chinese officers to identify her as a “terrorist.” She was under constant, excruciating surveillance, with cameras watching her even in the toilet. After she was released in 2019, she still found herself living in what she calls “an open-air prison,” with every move monitored, until she finally left Xinjiang later that year.

She said U.S. tech companies show little accountability.

“It's truly disappointing that the United States, one of the most powerful countries in the world, would sell such technology to China despite knowing the potential for serious consequences,” Haitiwaji said.

            “Terra nullius.” Under international law, this Latin phrase meaning “nobody's land” describes an area of land unclaimed by any sovereign nation-state. In an age where nearly every inch of the world's landmass has been mapped, examples of terra nullius are exceedingly rare.
    


            Bir Tawil, for instance — a desolate parcel of desert on the Egyptian-Sudanese border. Egypt and Sudan have competing maps of the border, but because of the crisscrossing of those boundaries, Bir Tawil would belong to whichever nation relinquished its claim on a larger, more desirable area. Each country insists that Bir Tawil belongs to the other.
    


            This unusual status has attracted self-styled nationbuilders — so- called “micronationalists” — hoping to create their own “countries.” One notable attempt was by Jeremiah Heaton, an American who in 2014 founded the unrecognized “Kingdom of North Sudan” in Bir Tawil. His motivation, he told CNN's Don Lemon at the time, was to make his daughter a real-life “princess.” 



            Other micronationalists have turned to Europe. Along the Croatian-Serbian border, a drawn-out dispute along the River Danube has resulted in claims of terra nullius around at least four small pockets of land.
    


            The boundary dispute began in 1947, after World War II, and flared again in the 1990s when attempts were made to restore the historical separation between Serbia and Croatia, which had spent most of the 20th century as subdivisions of Yugoslavia.
    


            Historically, the two territories were separated by the Danube. Serbia claims its border runs down the center of the contemporary river; Croatia claims a different border, based on 19th-century land ownership maps, when the river ran a different course.
    


            These differing border definitions mean Croatia lays claim to land on the eastern bank of the Danube — territory Serbia considers its own. But the river's former course means there are several pockets on the western bank that would belong to Serbia under those older maps.
    


            As with Bir Tawil, these western pockets of land would go to whichever country loses the larger territorial dispute. In practice, that means neither Croatia nor Serbia claims them, although officials say that does not mean they have been forsaken.
    


            Land considered terra nullius can be claimed by occupation under international law. It's a “murky legal category,” explains Noam Leshem, an associate professor of political and cultural geography at the UK's Durham University and author of “Edges of Care: Living and Dying in No Man's Land.” “The ability to claim territory is fundamentally a question of power, and that power is derived either from law or by the power of might, or by the combination of the two.”
    


            In 2015, Czech politician Vit Jedlička claimed a seven-square-kilometer patch in the disputed Danube area, named Gornja Siga, as the “Free Republic of Liberland.” His micronation vision is staunchly libertarian and his ambition, he says, is “a global revolution.”
    


            The land is now inaccessible to the public, having been fenced off by Croatian authorities. In 2023, British YouTuber Niko Omilano made an attempt to enter what he termed “the banned country” to mark the eighth anniversary of Jedlička's experiment.
    


            “It's like the homestead principle” in the American Wild West, says James Riding, a senior lecturer in cultural geography at the UK's Newcastle University, who has co-written an academic paper about Jedlička's political experiment. “If you continue to spread into new territory, there's not a lot to stop you from claiming that territory as your own.”
    


            While terra nullius can inspire these kinds of frontier fantasies, it's important to remember these so-called “no man's lands” have long and complex histories and are “more than geographical oddities,” says Riding. Attempts to claim them “can and do often have political motivations or completely disregard the cultural history of the landscapes they claim land in,” he says.
    


            After learning about Jedlička's claims along the same stretch of river, 20-year-old Daniel Jackson was inspired to make his own experiment in sovereignty and statehood, although with a very different mission than Jedlička's.
    


            Jackson, a dual British and Australian citizen, is the self-declared president of the “Free Republic of Verdis,” or Pocket 3, as it's labeled on international maps. As such, this would make him the youngest national president in the world. The microstate he lays claim to is located on the sandy shores of an uninhabited, 124-acre patch of land along the Danube. Aside from forest and scrubby beachland, there's not a lot there.
    


            The territory claimed by Jackson is, at roughly half a square kilometer, just a fraction larger than Vatican City, the smallest country in the world. Jackson, who says he's attracted some 400 Verdisian  “citizens” to his cause, believes his fledgling “republic” can become a sovereign nation-state with international recognition.
    


            But days after the Verdis team planted their self-designed blue and white striped flag in the sands of Pocket 3 in 2023, Jackson says he endured his first “national” crisis when Croatian police arrived and deported him.
    


            Croatia's foreign ministry told CNN it classifies Jackson's occupation of the land — and the Liberland project — as “provocative actions without any basis in law.” It said it was carrying out its obligations to guard its external border and that of Europe's multinational Schengen Area. It also gave short shrift to the concept of terra nullius.
    


            While the boundaries along the Danube may be in dispute, it said, both Croatia and Serbia “share an understanding of and respect for a fundamental principle of international law: the fact that a pending delimitation does not render any space a terra nullius (“no man's land”) open to occupation by a third party.” The Serbian government has also been contacted for comment by CNN.
    


They bought a Caribbean island to start their own country



            Jackson remains unbowed by his removal.
    


            “I love what I do,” Jackson tells CNN Travel from his “exile” in the United Kingdom. “I have less experience than other presidents, but I'm at an age where I'm learning quickly. I want to pave the way for my generation to become more involved in world politics.”
    


            Before they tried to occupy Pocket 3, Jackson and his aspiring citizens say they carried out extensive research in local archives, on both sides of the disputed border. He says they delved into the historical maps on which Croatia bases its border, and found several modern charts produced by Croatian government departments that follow the same boundary. As far as they could tell, Pocket 3 had remained uninhabited throughout recorded history.
    


            Satisfied that the territory was theirs for the taking, the self-declared republic began establishing its foundations from afar.  Jackson was elected president by his fellow Verdisians in May 2019 and a government was formed. Officials and ambassadors were appointed, including ministers of foreign affairs, infrastructure and defense. They designed a flag — a single white horizontal stripe sandwiched between two light blue ones — and coat of arms. They issued passports and drafted  “basic laws” to govern the nation, although none of this is internationally recognized.
    


He ran out of countries to visit, so he created his own



            “There were many reasons why we wanted to start Verdis,” Jackson tells CNN Travel. “People came together to do something unique, to be heard. Creating a country provides opportunities to test new forms of governance and voting systems. We want to serve as a neutral zone, where world leaders can discuss their disputes.”
    


            He adds that he wants Verdis to be a “humanitarian hub.” In July and September 2023, Jackson delivered aid to Ukraine under the flag of Verdis, through the “Verdis Red Cross,” a self-styled movement unaffiliated with the International Red Cross.
    


            While Jackson himself has no ties to the region, he tells CNN that he sought help and support from locals on both sides of the river in the project — such as boat captains, river guides and legal advisers.
    


            “It's important to have ethnic Croats and Serbs” supporting the project, says Domagoj Budetić, Verdis' “minister of foreign affairs,” a Croatian who lives in the nearby city of Osijek. “If anything, it's expected due to our geographical position.” Lower application costs and fast-track “citizenships” are offered to those who can prove their connection to the region through descent. Jackson says around 65% of Verdis' “citizens” are ethnic Serbs and Croats.
    


            While his vision of Verdis as a neutral state where nations broker peace treaties might sound fantastical, Jackson says he believes it offers Serbians and Croatians — who were at war a few decades ago — the chance for reconciliation.
    


            “Croats and Serbs had a million chances for reconciliation,” says Budetić. “The war in the ‘90s was far from the only one the two nations had. Croats and Serbs, for much of their history, fought because of their history. Verdis has none. A clean slate where things can be done correctly since day one.”
    


            One of Verdis' most high-profile supporters is Luke Black, a Serbian singer-songwriter who represented Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023. He tells CNN that he thinks “it's in the Serbian spirit to be welcoming to change and innovation. I especially appreciate youth-led initiatives that think outside the box.” While he admires the idea of unity that both Eurovision and Verdis share, he says “the Verdis dream is unique because it's pure at heart.”
    


The Western tourists going to Iraq for vacation



            Jackson tells CNN that he is determined to achieve international recognition for Verdis. “Lots of people found micronations to make a statement,” he says. “We're trying to build a state. We refer to ourselves as a country or a sovereign state for political reasons. We see a big difference between someone claiming their backyard and us claiming terra nullius.”
    


            The Montevideo Convention, the 1933 international law defining sovereign nation-states, establishes four primary criteria that countries must fulfil: having a permanent population, a defined territory, a functioning government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.
    


            While Croatia and Serbia may disagree, Jackson says Verdis met three of the four criteria by forming a government and claiming Pocket 3. Raising their flag on “Verdisian” shores and establishing a permanent population were to prove the biggest challenges.
    


            Throughout 2023, Jackson says, representatives of Verdis embarked on multiple “surveying” trips to the territory, where they camped out, mapped the land and planned more robust encampments for future expeditions.
    


            In October 2023, Jackson and his government raised the Verdisian flag with great ceremony, finally initiating what they said was the “settlement” phase of their nation-building project. A rotating schedule of “citizens” was set to visit over the following months to ensure a permanent Verdisian presence.
    


            Things didn't go to plan. On October 12, the morning after Verdis made its claim on Pocket 3, he says Croatian police — who have de facto control over the western bank of the Danube, even if this doesn't align with the official Croatian interpretation of the border — landed on the beach.
    


            “It was short-lived,” says Jackson, telling CNN Travel that police broke the camp apart and that settlers, including himself, were held for questioning. “We've been in exile ever since.”

            Jackson hasn't given up, though.
    


            “We've occasionally snuck flags onto Verdis when the river has been high enough, as a sign we're still committed,” says Jackson. “We continue to govern from exile. We'll constantly push to be back on the land and be prepared to be back on the land.”
    


            Noam Leshem, the Durham University professor, says Jackson's claim to the territory is ultimately unlikely to succeed, especially in the face of Croatian police deployments. “I think that's a classic example of might is right,” he says.
    


            “On a completely pragmatic political level, I would say that this 20-year-old kid is facing significant hurdles which, you know, nations comprising millions of people, like Kurds or Palestinians, have yet to be able to surmount,” says Leshem. “However, I think that does not mean that we shouldn't take him seriously, him and others like him.”
    


            It's important to consider what drives people to seek this kind of “sovereign fantasy,” adds Leshem, and what inspires others to follow them. “It begins to illuminate the crisis that many around the world are feeling, the sense that their own ability to shape their future within existing political frameworks is increasingly diminished.”
    


            James Riding, the senior lecturer at Newcastle University, notes the project particularly resonates in the Balkans.  “There's been huge protests recently in Serbia, and there's a feeling of stagnation following decades of political inertia.” Supporting a vision such as Verdis, he says, can be “a way to imagine yourself out of the country that you are in.”
    


            The “Free Republic of Verdis” has also staged protests outside the Croatian embassy in London. Jackson says Verdis now has 900 e-residents, as well as its 400 “citizens,” with 700  signing up after recent media coverage.
    


            “I still believe that sooner or later we will be back on the land and Croatia will have to respect international law, including Verdis' territorial integrity,” he told CNN Travel. “We will never give up on our goal. We hope to have positive relations with Croatia in the future. We want to work with them.”

            In the final year of President Donald Trump's first administration, the CIA carried out a clandestine cyberattack against the Venezuelan government, disabling the computer network used by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro's intelligence service.
    


            The attack, described to CNN by four sources familiar with the operation, was perfectly successful.
    


            It was also a throwaway, those sources said — an effort by the CIA to satisfy the president's ambitions to do something about Venezuela and avoid taking riskier, more direct action against Caracas.
    


            The previously unreported episode was one of a series of moves that national security officials took to placate Trump during his first term in office as he sought to oust Maduro, covert maneuvering that came to deeply frustrate the president and his team as the Venezuelan strong man remained stubbornly in power.
    


            It helps underscore the president's public determination to take a maximalist approach toward Venezuela in his second term.
    


            Since the summer, the US has amassed a huge military force in the region, including roughly 10,000 troops, with an aircraft carrier now en route from Europe. The president has said in recent weeks that the US is considering direct strikes on Venezuelan territory, and that he has authorized the CIA to conduct covert activity there. A series of what the military termed “attack demonstration” flights off the Venezuelan coast by US bombers last week were an even more visible indicator of the US' intentions.
    


            Although the administration has characterized the mission for all those military assets as a counternarcotics effort, the size and scope of the buildup has raised the specter of a possible regime-change operation.
    


            Trump during his first term routinely demanded that he be provided military options to pressure Maduro. But White House officials felt that they were given the runaround by Pentagon and intelligence leaders, whom multiple sources described as reluctant to initiate or escalate a conflict with Venezuela. In one meeting at the White House in 2019, a top Pentagon official reportedly banged his fist on the table in frustration after repeated demands from White House officials for more aggressive options.
    


            “In the first Trump administration, he said that all options are on the table,” said Jimmy Story, who was the top US diplomat to Venezuela from 2018 to 2023. “Many of the options are now at the front door.”
    


            The lesson Trump likely took from that earlier era — when a series of officials sought to temper the US policy towards Maduro — was that he would not be stymied this time, said one former senior administration official: “I told these guys I wanted the military option in 2018 and 2019, they didn't give me one — I want a real one now,” this person said, summing up the president's thinking.
    


            The White House and CIA did not provide comment for this story ahead of publication when contacted by CNN. Cyber Command declined to comment.
    


            Trump first requested military options to remove Maduro from power from his second national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, at a meeting at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, in 2017, according to a former White House official. He told the assembled press later that day: “I'm not going to rule out a military option for Venezuela.”
    


            He would return to the request more than once, as he pressed subsequent national security advisers to find a way to get rid of the Maduro regime and grew increasingly frustrated that it hadn't happened.
    


            “Get it done,” Trump told his national security adviser John Bolton in August of 2019, meaning oust Maduro, Bolton wrote in his book. “This is the fifth time I've asked for it,” Trump continued.
    


            White House officials began to sense that senior leaders in both the Pentagon and the CIA were resistant to the idea of using force. They weren't wrong, according to a former senior intelligence official and three former administration officials.
    


            Within the administration, CIA Director Gina Haspel was widely known to be opposed to using agency personnel to carry out covert operations against Maduro, those sources said, and at times resisted suggestions from the White House for proposed action. With pressure building from the White House for covert action, there was a lack of consensus at the CIA and at the Pentagon about what would be effective at pressuring Maduro to leave office. The CIA has a long history of interference in Latin American affairs during the Cold War, including failed regime changes, that has created greater reticence from agency leaders.
    


            In 2019, the administration coalesced around a strategy to offer diplomatic and economic support to the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, officially recognizing him as the legitimate leader of Venezuela after a 2018 election victory for Maduro that was decried internationally as rigged. More than 50 countries would eventually recognize Guaido as the country's head of state.
    


            “The regime was shaky, and we thought that the opposition had a good chance,” one of the former senior administration officials said.
    


            But that effort foundered as it became clear that Guaido had no practical means of actually assuming power in Venezuela.  No massive street protests arose, the military remained loyal to Maduro, and, after a failed coup attempt in the spring of 2019, Guaido remained a president without a government to run.
    


            Trump was “pissed,” according to the former White House official. In his mind, Guaido and the opposition “failed him,” that person and others said — but so had his own government, which had effectively backed a losing horse.
    


            The president lost his appetite for focusing on Venezuela during the second half of his second term, following the opposition's failed coup, according to multiple former administration officials. But Trump had also adopted an even more hawkish view of Venezuela.
    


            The desire increased among White House officials for using covert operations and cyberattacks to cause disruptions in Venezuela, and for collecting intelligence on the regime, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.
    


            Cyber Command, the US military's offensive and defensive cyber unit, conducted a cyberattack in the latter half of Trump's first term to interrupt the satellite communications of the Wagner Group, Russian mercenaries who then reportedly had a presence in Venezuela, the sources said.
    


            The US military also considered setting up a special team, staffed with Coast Guard personnel, to focus on hacking drug traffickers and collecting intelligence to support US counter-narcotic efforts, according to the sources. The team would have had a heavy Venezuela focus, but concern about legal authorities and bureaucratic hurdles prevented the idea from turning to action.
    


            Other ideas never got off the ground. An administration official proposed knocking a hydroelectric dam in Venezuela offline with a cyberattack, one of the sources said, but the idea seemed half- baked and never made it to the desk of the Pentagon's cyber operations planners.
    


            The hope was that aggressive covert action could cause enough discomfort and create sufficient disturbances that the military, which has played a critical role in keeping Maduro in power, would be convinced to switch sides and support the opposition, said the former White House official.
    


            But other officials criticized that strategy as lacking solid planning for the day after, the former White House official said — who added that history appears to be repeating itself
    


            “Opposition doesn't have a plan. We don't have a plan,” that person said. “Hope is not a plan.”
    


            There were signs that Trump might soften his approach to Venezuela in his second term, according to Story, the former diplomat. Special envoy Richard Grenell has met several times with Maduro to try to secure the release of US citizens wrongfully detained in the country, for example. But in recent months Trump ordered Grenell to stand down, and officials say the Venezuela portfolio is now largely being driven by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Venezuela hawk.
    


            “Then the hawks took over,” Story said, “so now it's ‘maximum pressure' to another level.”
    


            He declined to comment on any covert action.
    


            In the midst of the military buildup, the Trump administration has carried out a series of lethal military strikes against small, go-fast boats including some that have left Venezuelan ports. The Defense Department insists they are trafficking drugs, although it has provided no evidence and Venezuela is not a major producer or transit point for drugs into the US.
    


            What the administration's end game is remains unclear. Some, like Story, say that they would be “very surprised” if the US ships in the Caribbean were not “deployed in some way” against the Venezuelan government.
    


            “It's not a force capable of invading the country, but it could potentially be a force capable of doing highly sophisticated rendition of senior leadership in the country,” Story told CNN.
    


            But Trump, who rose to power in part through his criticism of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is also keenly aware of the political risks of backtracking on his noninterventionist bona fides. In the end, the former White House official said, the famously mercurial president could find any number of ways to declare “victory” in Venezuela.
    


            “This is wag the dog,” this person said, “This is anything you want it to be.”

The shutdown of the U.S. federal government could cost the economy up to $14 billion, depending on how long it lasts, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday.

The shutdown, now in its fourth week, will result in the loss of at least $7 billion of gross domestic product by the end of 2026 as a result of furloughed federal employees working fewer weeks, the CBO said.

And the cost will grow the longer the shutdown drags on, CBO Director Phillip Swagel told U.S. House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, in a letter.

A six-week shutdown will cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown will cost $14 billion, Swagel said.

Senators remain pessimistic about the chances of reaching a bipartisan deal to reopen the government despite the effects of the shutdown becoming more painful for the American people. 

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told NBC News on Wednesday that he saw no evidence of a breakthrough.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, meanwhile, accused the White House of slamming the door on talks to end the impasse.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said it will stop paying for food assistance, known as SNAP, on Nov. 1 if the shutdown is not resolved. More than two dozen states have sued the Trump administration to maintain SNAP benefits. 

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach a short-term funding agreement to keep the government open.

Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding that would reopen the government.

The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday, and wealthy U.S. households may benefit most. 

The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. A quarter-point reduction would bring the benchmark rate to a range between 3.75%-4.00%. It could fall to 3.1% by the end of 2027, according to a September forecast from the Federal Open Market Committee. 

"That really sets the floor for all other interest rates," said Michael Wagner, co-founder of Omnia Family Wealth in Aventura, Florida. "We ultimately start earning less money on cash, which makes it less attractive versus other investments."

Reductions in the fed funds rate typically set off a chain reaction throughout the economy.

For example, cash held in high-yield savings accounts typically earns less money soon after a reduction in the federal funds rate. The change in short-term interest rates can also potentially lead to cheaper terms on longer-term loans, such as mortgages.

Lower interest rates can speed up economic growth and lead to an increase in hiring, experts say.  But they are also associated with rising levels of wealth inequality. 

"The Fed's easing cycle could unintentionally widen the generational wealth gap, lifting the net worth of retirees, baby boomers," said Kathryn Rooney Vera, a chief market strategist at StoneX Group.

That's because asset price booms tend to follow Fed rate cuts, and older, wealthier consumers — who own more stocks — disproportionately benefit from those market gains. Meanwhile, younger and less advantaged households with more of their assets in cash may see their returns diminish.

The top 0.1% wealthiest households own over $23 trillion in financial assets as of the second quarter of 2025, according to Federal Reserve data. That's a 91.2% increase from the $12.32 trillion recorded in the first quarter of 2020.

By contrast, the bottom half of the U.S. population holds about $10 trillion in assets. That's a 46.6% increase from the start of 2020, when this segment held just $6.93 trillion in assets.

President Donald Trump is "losing a self-inflicted trade war" with China, leaving the United States with a "weak hand" going into his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Senate Democrats said Wednesday in a new report on the effects of Trump's wide-ranging tariffs.

"Trump's trade wars have imposed significant costs" on U.S. consumers and businesses, "sold out American farmers," and the president "has strengthened China's hand while weakening America's leverage," the report says.

CNBC received the report by Democrats on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs a day before Trump is set to meet Xi in South Korea.

Trump is "putting America's long-term prosperity and security at risk," Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in a statement to CNBC.

"Trump needs to change course on his trade war with China now and stop hurting American families, farmers, and businesses," Warren said.

Warren's comments came before Trump, speaking at the Asia Pacific Economic Forum in Gyoeongju, South Korea, said he was optimistic of reaching a trade deal with Xi, which could include reducing tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese goods.

"It's going to work out very, very well for everybody, and ... I look forward to seeing him," Trump said.

The report points to inflation data and other economic metrics in the wake of Trump's implementation of global tariffs in April.

"Between January and April, year-over-year Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was falling, but it has rebounded since May — after Trump announced his universal tariffs," the report said.

"Last week, CPI data showed that inflation increased by 3 percent year-over-year in September, the highest rate since May 2024," the report said.

Core goods inflation, which includes physical products such as clothing, furniture, electronics, appliances, and cars, but excludes food and energy, also increased 1.5 percent over the year in September. Grocery goods also trended higher.

"Studies suggest that President Trump's tariffs are costing American families around $1,500 more per year and disproportionately harming lower- and middle-income households that spend a greater share of their incomes on essential goods," the report said.

In addition to inflation data, the report also pointed to jobs data as evidence that Trump's trade policy is not reaping rewards.

"Rather than reviving manufacturing as promised, Trump's strategy has also caused the sector to shed 42,000 jobs and manufacturing employment has contracted for four straight months — the longest monthly streak of losses since early 2020," the report said.

Warren and the other committee Democrats said that despite Trump's talk about an impending deal with Xi, it is clear China has the upper hand and continues to impose pain on American businesses and farmers.

The report cited rare earths export controls imposed by China, and that nation's refusal, since May, to buy U.S.-grown soybeans.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this week that there was a framework of a deal that would see China defer restrictions on rare earths exports, and that also would alleviate U.S. farmers' concerns.

China purchased $12.6 billion worth of American soybeans in 2024, but just $2.5 billion worth in the first half of 2025 before the effective boycott began.

"Simultaneously, Trump's tariffs have raised costs on farm inputs like fertilizer and equipment, squeezing farmers from both sides," the report noted.

The report also says that China has expanded exports in the wake of Trump's tariffs.

"In September alone, China's exports to Africa increased 56.4%, to Southeast Asia by 15.6%, and to the EU [European Union] by 14%," the report said.

"China's exports continue growing despite U.S. tariffs, reaching record trade surpluses by routing goods through third countries. 

In a statement to CNBC responding to the report, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, "It's hard to tell if Democrats are delusional or wishcasting more doom for the American people, on top of their idiotic government shutdown."

"The reality is that the President's trade and tariff agenda has already secured historic trade deals with countries that in total have an over $30 trillion economy and one billion people," Desai said. "This same agenda is also driving trillions in investments to make and hire in America, especially in sectors that are critical to our national and economic security."

General Motors laid off roughly 1,700 workers at manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio on Wednesday, citing a slowdown in the electric vehicle market.

The company confirmed there were around 1,200 layoffs at Detroit's electric vehicle plant and 550 cuts at Ohio's Ultium Cells battery cell plant, in addition to 850 temporary layoffs at that site in Ohio. The company also said it would temporarily lay off 700 at Ultium Cells' Tennessee plant.

"In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity," the company said in a statement. "Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our U.S. manufacturing footprint, and we believe our investments and dedication to flexible operations will make GM more resilient and capable of leading through change."

GM also said battery cell production at its Ohio and Tennessee facilities will be temporarily paused beginning in January. It anticipates resuming operations at both battery cell sites by the middle of 2026 and will use the pause to upgrade its facilities.

Wednesday's layoffs follow the company saying last week that it would cut more than 200 salaried employees, mostly engineers at its global tech campus in metro Detroit, as part of a restructuring effort.

After September, federal incentives of up to $7,500 to purchase electric vehicles was discontinued, leaving consumers racing to use the benefit before the expiration. Though sales for plug-in vehicles soared to records for many automakers in the third quarter, that demand is expected to decline following the discontinuation.

GM previously reported a more than doubling of sales for electric vehicles during the third quarter from the year prior, a trend other automakers like Ford Motor and Hyundai saw as well.

"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles," CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during "Squawk Box" last week.

Still, GM's third-quarter results last week included a $1.6 billion impact from its all-electric vehicle plans not playing out as anticipated, signaling it was undergoing a reassessment of its EV capacity and manufacturing processes. 

The Detroit News first reported on the layoffs.

Nvidia became the first company ever to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization at the open on Wednesday morning.

The tech giant's stock was up around 4.4% to almost $210 in the opening minutes of trading, giving it a valuation of roughly $5.1 trillion.

The historic valuation milestone was reached after CEO Jensen Huang said Tuesday that the company expects $500 billion in AI chip orders over the next four years and plans to build seven AI supercomputers for the US Department of Energy.

Nvidia's upward move was also bolstered by President Donald Trump saying in a Wednesday press conference in South Korea that he could discuss Nvidia's Blackwell chips with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a meeting on Thursday.

Nvidia also gained after a Tuesday announcement that it would invest $1 billion in Nokia to develop 6G technology. That news pushed the Finnish telecommunications' stock up to its highest level in almost a decade.

The chip firm's stock has risen more than 50% so far in 2025 and has climbed a staggering 1,500% in the past five years.

Nvidia's arrival at a $5 trillion valuation comes just a day after Apple hit a $4 trillion market capitalization, joining Microsoft and Nvidia in the exclusive club.

Apple hit $4 trillion for the first time as the company's rally, driven by strong iPhone 17 sales, continued. Apple's share price was virtually unchanged at $269.68 at the open on Wednesday.

"The Q3 earnings season will reach its apex this week with key reports due from Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta on Wednesday as well as Apple and Amazon on Thursday," Jim Reid, head of macro and thematic research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note on Monday. 

"The five biggest companies in the world after Nvidia now make up $15tn in total market capitalization or 25% of the S&P 500."

Tech Reviews:

Amazon's new Echo Studio is priced at $220.

Review: The $100 Echo Dot Max outshines the pricier Echo Studio.

“Alexa, what new things can you do?” That's the first question I posed to Amazon.com Inc.'s latest pair of Echo smart speakers. Like so many other people, I have a long history of asking these devices to play music, give me the weather forecast or control a smart light or two. But that's as far as my interactions with them have typically gone.

With the new $100 Echo Dot Max and $220 Echo Studio, Amazon hopes that'll change. And the reason is more advanced artificial intelligence.

Fiserv's stock plummeted 44% Wednesday and headed for its worst day ever after the fintech company cut its earnings outlook and shook up some of its leadership team.

"Our current performance is not where we want it to be nor where our stakeholders expect it to be," wrote CEO Mike Lyons in a release.

For the full year, Fiserv now expects adjusted earnings of $8.50 to $8.60 a share for the year, down from a previous forecast of $10.15 and $10.30. Revenues are expected to grow 3.5% to 4%, versus a prior estimate of 10%.

During an earnings call Wednesday, Lyons said Argentina's deteriorating economic environment contributed to slowing growth and margin disappointment. Last year, the South American country contributed 10 percentage points to its 16% organic growth rate, he said.

Fiserv's original growth estimate "assumed that to compensate for the slowdown, our non-Argentinian businesses would grow significantly faster than their historical mid-single-digit range," he said.

Adjusted earnings came in at $2.04 per share, falling short of the LSEG estimate of $2.64. Revenues rose about 1% from a year ago to $4.92 billion, missing the $5.36 billion forecast. Net income grew to $792 million from $564 million in the year-ago period.

Along with the results, Fiserv announced a slew of executive and board changes.

Beginning in December, operating chief Takis Georgakopoulos will serve as co-president with Dhivya Suryadevara, recent CEO of Optum Financial Services and Optum Insight at UnitedHealth Group. Fiserv also promoted Paul Todd to finance chief.

"We also have opportunities in front of us to improve our results and execution, and I am confident that these are the right leaders to help guide Fiserv to long-term success," Lyons wrote in a separate release.

Fiserv also announced that Gordon Nixon, Céline Dufétel and Gary Shedlin would join its board at the beginning of 2026, with Nixon serving as independent chairman of the board. Shedlin is slated to lead the audit committee.

The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company also announced an action plan that Lyons said would better situate the company to "drive sustainable, high-quality growth" and reach its "full potential."

Fiserv said it will move its stock from the NYSE to the Nasdaq next month, where it will trade under the ticker symbol "FISV."

Fiserv did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

When Saudi Arabia first announced plans to reinvent its oil-based economy, huge infrastructure projects like the futuristic region NEOM and smart city The Line were championed as central to the transformation.

Almost a decade on from the launch of its "Vision 2030" transformation strategy, however, and Riyadh's priorities have shifted with the times.

Now, technology and artificial intelligence are key priorities for the kingdom.

"We're reprioritizing a little bit towards sectors that need it the most, and today it's technology, artificial intelligence," Faisal Alibrahim, Saudi's economy minister, told CNBC Wednesday.

"We want to move into an economic structure that is productivity-led and at the heart of productivity is technology, innovation and generative AI," he told CNBC's Dan Murphy on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh.

Riyadh's Vision 2030 strategy to diversify its economy away from oil has seen it invest heavily in tourism, cultural and sports events, technology and infrastructure.

"Our primary objective is non-oil growth and non-oil growth has been steadily increasing, this is our main driver of economic growth," Alibrahim said, noting that non-oil activities now represent 56% of total real GDP in Saudi Arabia.

"All of our transformation efforts are to achieve non-oil growth so we can diversify our economy from having to rely on a single commodity price and how big the government budget is, but also to rely on private sector dynamism and to be ready for the future."

Alibrahim said sectors like tourism had been performing far better than expected, with targets set for 2030 achieved years in advance, prompting the kingdom to up its target to 150 million visitors by the end of the decade, he said.

A key pillar of the Vision 2030 program is the creation of NEOM, an urban development project with a futuristic, car-free and zero-carbon city called The Line at its center.

It's estimated that the entire NEOM project will cost $1.5 trillion, with The Line seen costing around $500 billion, but Saudi Arabia has looked to cut costs in recent years as its budget deficit has grown amid lower oil prices.

Alibrahim said "agility" and the ability to shift priorities and amend plans had become key parts of Vision 2030, noting that "the minute these plans aren't solving for your optimal outcomes is the minute you need to re-plan and adjust."

This shift in priorities has seen the technology, innovation and artificial intelligence sectors become more important areas of focus.

Abdulelah Albarrak, partner for government and public institutions at Oliver Wyman, agreed that Saudi's economic plans had to respond technological change.

"Plans have to remain agile and responsive to changes in evolving technologies, in emerging technologies that really dictate change. It goes without saying these giga and mega projects have a significant economic and socio-economic impact in growing the nation, in driving and cultivating new sectors, but also the emergence of AI and other emerging trends require a lot of focus," he said.

Alibrahim told CNBC that Saudi was now seen as a land of opportunity for investors, as well as investment.

"People here stopped coming to Saudi to take money, they're coming here to make money," he said.

"Saudi stopped being only a source of capital to [being] also a capital of real economic opportunities," he added. "We're just unlocking the potential."

In September, the Saudi finance ministry estimated in a pre-budget statement that the budget deficit for 2026 will be 3.3% of GDP and that it was comfortable with that level.

"The government will continue to adopt expansionary spending policies that are contrary to the economic cycle, and [which are] directed towards national priorities with social and economic impact, and in a way that contributes to achieving the goals of the Saudi's Vision 2030, and diversifying the economic base," the ministry said in a statement.

It also forecast that the economy would expand 4.4% in 2025, which it said was supported by the growth of non-oil activities, and by 4.6% in 2026. On Wednesday, Alibrahim upgraded the 2025 forecast, stating that the kingdom's 2025 real GDP growth will be 5.1%.

Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister Mohammed Aljadaan has played down concerns over Saudi Arabia's growing debt pile (albeit a relatively low one of 32% of GDP) and deficit.

"The ratio of public debt to GDP is still at relatively low levels compared to many other economies, and that it is within safe limits compared to the size of the economy, and is supported by financial reserves," the minister said.

— CNBC's Dan Murphy contributed reporting to this story.

The battle over Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package is heating up.

Tesla's chair, Robyn Denholm, sent a letter to shareholders on Monday warning them that Musk may choose to leave the company if they do not pass the massive compensation plan at its annual meeting next week.

The package, which could be worth as much as $1 trillion if Musk hits a series of ambitious revenue and product goals over the next decade, has faced pushback.

Proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have both recommended that shareholders vote against it, leading Musk to brand them as "corporate terrorists" in a fiery conclusion to Tesla's earnings call last week. However, other notable shareholders have publicly supported it.

With the vote to potentially make Musk the world's first trillionaire looming, here's where Tesla's most high-profile investors stand.

The State Board of Administration of Florida, a fund that manages assets worth over $280 billion and counts former presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis as its chairman, said on Monday it would back the proposed pay package.

The board, which holds over $1 billion in Tesla shares, described the 2025 CEO performance award as a "bold, performance-driven incentive structure."

ARK Invest CEO and longtime Tesla bull Cathie Wood said earlier this month she was confident Musk's pay package would pass, and that it could lead Tesla to "super-exponential growth," adding that she disagreed with Glass Lewis and ISS.

Tesla is the biggest holding in ARK's portfolio, with the firm holding around $1 billion worth of shares.

Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and one of Tesla's biggest Wall Street cheerleaders, also expressed support for Musk's $1 trillion payday.

In a note released shortly after Tesla unveiled the package, Ives said it would help keep Musk focused on the company and accelerate Tesla's "autonomous and robotics future."

New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli wrote a letter to Tesla shareholders on Monday, urging them to vote against the compensation plan and criticizing the board for an "alarming lack of independence."

The state's retirement fund holds over three and a half million Tesla shares, valued at about $1.7 billion, according to a recent SEC filing.

The nation's second-largest teachers' labor union joined a group of unions, state treasurers, and investment firms earlier this month in urging Tesla shareholders to vote against the mammoth pay deal, arguing it did not secure enough commitments from Musk to keep him focused on Tesla.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Nvidia took center stage yesterday — literally and figuratively. In addition to inking deals with multiple well-known companies, CEO Jensen Huang made a major domestic production announcement during the chip titan's technology conference.

Here's the full rundown:

The Federal Reserve will announce its penultimate interest rate decision for 2025 at 2 p.m. ET today, and traders see a cut as a foregone conclusion: Fed funds futures are pricing in a 99.9% chance of a 25 basis point cut, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.

Still, investors will keep an eye on whether any Fed officials break with the majority, and whether Fed chair Jerome Powell's post-announcement press conference provides any clues into the future path on monetary policy. Respondents to CNBC's October Fed Survey also expressed concern about how the central bank is analyzing the economy with some data on hold thanks to the government shutdown.

OpenAI officially wrapped up its restructuring into a nonprofit yesterday. The startup's nonprofit, now named the OpenAI Foundation, has a controlling stake worth around $130 billion in OpenAI's for-profit business, which is called OpenAI Group PBC. (PBC stands for public benefit corporation.)

The buzzy AI startup also confirmed that longtime backer Microsoft holds an investment in the for-profit arm that amounts to $135 billion. As CNBC's Ashley Capoot notes, that's equivalent to about 27% of the company on an as-converted diluted basis.

Microsoft is set to report earnings after the bell today, along with Big Tech peers Alphabet and Meta.

The federal government shutdown is officially one month old — and Washington is feeling the heat.

A group of more than two dozen states sued President Donald Trump's administration yesterday to maintain benefits tied to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, which provides food stamps. The Agriculture Department, which oversees SNAP, has said the benefits will end this weekend.

A federal judge yesterday also extended a temporary ban on firing federal workers during the shutdown. Air traffic controller union officials meanwhile said some of their members have picked up second jobs to bring in money while they work without pay.

Shares of Boeing are slightly down in premarket trading this morning after the planemaker reported earnings for its third quarter. The company returned to cash-positive territory for the first time since 2023 but logged a $4.9 billion charge tied to delays of its 777X plane.

Boeing — which has been plagued by manufacturing and supply chain issues, as well as the fallout of two crashes — is on track for its most deliveries since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took Boeing's helm in 2024, said in a staff note that "there's still more work to do to advance our development programs" but "we're seeing positive signs across our business."

The following chart shows how U.S. regional banks have fared since 2020. CNBC's Hugh Son talked to the activist investors targeting underperforming financial institutions.

— CNBC's Kif Leswing, Annika Kim Constantino, Mike Wayland, Sean Conlon, Ashley Capoot, Jeff Cox, Kevin Breuninger, Dan Mangan and Leslie Josephs contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

Etsy CEO Josh Silverman will step down from his position and move to the role of executive chairman at the end of the year, the online marketplace said Wednesday.

Kruti Patel Goyal, Etsy's president and chief of growth who previously oversaw its Depop resale app, will take the helm at Etsy effective Jan. 1, 2026, the company said.

Etsy shares fell more than 6% in morning trading following the news, which was announced alongside its third-quarter earnings report. The company posted a beat on the top and bottom lines, but gross merchandise sales were down year over year.

For the third quarter, Etsy reported adjusted earnings per share of 63 cents on revenue of $678 million, which exceeded consensus estimates of 53 cents per share and $655.3 million, according to LSEG. Sales increased 2.4% from a year ago.

Gross merchandise sales, or the total volume of goods sold on the platform, came in at $2.72 billion. That's a 6.5% decline from the same period a year ago, when GMS was $2.91 billion, but higher than expectations for $2.68 billion, according to StreetAccount.

The company reported net income of $75.5 million, or 63 cents per share, compared with a profit of $57.4 million, or 45 cents per share, a year ago.

Active buyers on Etsy slid 5% year over year to 86.6 million, while sellers on the platform totaled 5.5 million during the quarter, a decrease of 10.9% from the same period a year ago.

Depop, which Etsy acquired for $1.62 billion in 2021, was a brighter spot in the results. Depop GMS soared 39.4% year over year to $292.1 million. Active sellers jumped nearly 41% to 3 million, while active buyers were up nearly 40% to 6.6 million.

Silverman, a former eBay executive, held the top job for the last eight years and guided the company through a demand surge brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, when shoppers flocked to the site to buy up face masks.

Etsy has struggled to grow its business since the pandemic e-commerce boom, while it continues to contend with stiff competition from Amazon and Shopify, as well as China-linked upstarts Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop.

President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policies have also strained some Etsy sellers' businesses, particularly the removal of the "de minimis" exception in August, a provision where shipments under $800 were allowed to enter the country virtually duty-free.

Etsy has sought to integrate artificial intelligence tools across its site to keep buyers and sellers returning to the platform, while working to establish itself as a "gifting destination."

Last month, Etsy partnered with OpenAI to allow its merchants to sell their products directly in ChatGPT.

Silverman said in a statement that he felt it was the "right time to hand over the leadership baton" to Goyal, who he said is the "right leader to guide the business forward."

"I remain confident in Etsy's continued growth — not only because of our unique marketplace, but because of the talented people behind it," Silverman said.

Silverman will remain executive chair through the end of 2026.

The company also announced that venture capitalist Fred Wilson, Etsy's chairman since 2017, will step down from the role. He'll continue to serve on Etsy's board.

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Kruti Patel Goyal is currently the company's president and chief growth officer and was previously CEO of Depop.

Trinidad and Tobago's prime minister has backed US strikes against alleged traffickers from Venezuela, which retaliated by cutting off gas deals.

On a clear day from Trinidad's northern coast, neighboring Venezuela is visible in the distance, along with the hazy outlines of a gas platform tethered near an offshore field. Soon, the US's largest aircraft carrier may be part of that tableau.

Self-Driving Cars:

Uber is preparing to offer driverless rides in Lucid vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Uber Technologies Inc. is preparing to offer driverless rides on vehicles developed by Lucid Group Inc. and Nuro Inc. in the San Francisco Bay Area for the first time next year, thrusting the company into direct competition with Waymo's robotaxi service.

Road testing of the vehicles — Lucid Gravity SUVs outfitted with Nuro's self-driving technology — is currently underway with drivers manually operating them, a Nuro spokesperson said. The first cars in the test fleet were delivered in September, and the number will grow to more than a hundred in the coming months, according to an Uber statement.

OpenAI on Wednesday announced two reasoning models that developers can use to classify a range of online safety harms on their platforms. 

The artificial intelligence models are called gpt-oss-safeguard-120b and gpt-oss-safeguard-20b, and their names reflect their sizes. They are fine-tuned, or adapted, versions of OpenAI's gpt-oss models, which the company announced in August. 

OpenAI is introducing them as so-called open-weight models, which means their parameters, or the elements that improve the outputs and predictions during training, are publicly available. Open-weight models can offer transparency and control, but they are different from open-source models, whose full source code becomes available for users to customize and modify.

Organizations can configure the new models to their specific policy needs, OpenAI said. And since they are reasoning models that show their work, developers will have more direct insight into how they arrive at a particular output. 

For instance, a product reviews site could develop a policy and use gpt-oss-safeguard models to screen reviews that might be fake, OpenAI said. Similarly, a video game discussion forum could classify posts that discuss cheating.

OpenAI developed the models in partnership with Robust Open Online Safety Tools, or ROOST, an organization dedicated to building safety infrastructure for AI. Discord and SafetyKit also helped test the models. They are initially available in a research preview, and OpenAI said it will seek feedback from researchers and members of the safety community.

As part of the launch, ROOST is establishing a model community for researchers and practitioners that are using AI models in an effort to protect online spaces.

The announcement could help OpenAI placate some critics who have accused the startup of commercializing and scaling too quickly at the expense of AI ethics and safety. The startup is valued at $500 billion, and its consumer chatbot, ChatGPT, has surpassed 800 million weekly active users. 

On Tuesday, OpenAI said it's completed its recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit lab, but has emerged as the most valuable U.S. tech startup in the years since releasing ChatGPT in late 2022.

"As AI becomes more powerful, safety tools and fundamental safety research must evolve just as fast — and they must be accessible to everyone," ROOST President Camille François, said in a statement.

Eligible users can download the model weights on Hugging Face, OpenAI said.

For more than two decades, Scott Payne lived in the shadows. As an undercover FBI agent, he infiltrated violent biker gangs and white-supremacist networks. These were criminals who trusted him, laughed with him, and would have killed him if they knew his true identity.

Payne joined the FBI in 1998, having worked as a police officer in South Carolina for five years. Over the next 23 years, he built false identities so convincing that criminals treated him as one of their own. He earned invitations to secret gang meetings, shared beers with white supremacists, and watched as men planned murders in front of him.

He said the work demanded patience, confidence, and nerves of steel. It also required luck. Twice, Payne's cover was nearly blown. Both times, he thought he was about to die.

In 2005, Payne was deep inside the Outlaws Motorcycle Club in Brockton, Massachusetts. For months, he'd been posing as a tattooed Southerner named "Tex," slowly winning over members in bars and strip clubs.

Then one night, a gang member led him into a basement during a private meeting with multiple bikers, where he was essentially accused of being a cop.

"They brandished their weapons," Payne told Business Insider's Kevin Reilly. One of the men said to him: "It's my job to protect my brothers. I need you to take all your clothes off. I need you to write down your full name, your address, your kids' names, your wife's name." They used it to cross-check his information online.

As he stripped, Payne handed over his clothes that had a hidden wire. If they found it, he'd be dead.

"Being stripped in a basement at gunpoint is not a big deal if you're not wired, you're just naked. It's uncomfortable. It's cold. When you're wired, it's a big deal," Payne said.

In the end, the biker who searched his clothes didn't find the hidden wire, and Payne walked out alive. "A lot of people ask me, 'What would you have said if he would have found it?' And to this day, I remember it like it was yesterday. I got two responses," Payne said.

One was "I don't know." The second was a bluff: "The gig is up. I'm an undercover FBI agent. I can walk out of here, and we can see each other in court."

Fourteen years later, Payne faced another near miss with death — this time with "The Base," a violent white-supremacist group operating out of Georgia and founded in 2018.

When Payne arrived for a meeting one day, a young recruit pulled out a handheld scanner that could detect hidden transmitters.

As he waved it over the back of Payne's truck, the device started shrieking right where the FBI had planted a tracking beacon.

"I thought we were getting ready to throw down," Payne said. "I'm like, here we go."

Then, by sheer luck, another member noticed nearby power lines and suggested that's what may have caused the device to go haywire. The young recruit tested the theory, and the scanner went wild again.

The group blamed the power lines for the interference and moved on. Payne walked away unscathed, again.

Payne had spent months infiltrating "The Base." In late 2019, he said he watched its members start planning real killings.

"We uncovered several murder plots that Luke wanted to bring me in on," Payne said, referring to Luke Lane, a group leader. "They had found a couple that they believed were an Antifa couple in a couple of counties away, and they wanted to murder 'em."

Payne said he pretended to agree to keep his cover, telling them the Antifa couple plot would be "good practice."

Then, he helped coordinate the sting that stopped it.

He picked Lane up for what was supposed to be lunch. "I feigned that my truck had had issues and pulled over on the side of the road, got out to work on my truck, and then that's when another truck came over."

Meanwhile, the SWAT team was coming over the hill. As they approached, Payne said he jumped in the other truck, which then drove off. "They take down Luke without incident." The arrests ended the plot before anyone was killed.

Payne retired from the FBI in 2021, but he hasn't stopped trying to help.

He now trains law enforcement teams on domestic terrorism cases and has written a book, "Codename Pale Horse: How I Infiltrated America's Nazis."

What saved him during his time undercover, Payne said, is what agents and investigators need now: calm under pressure, patience, and an ability to read people.

For all the dangers he faced, Payne said the work is still worth doing because the threats he once saw face-to-face haven't gone away.

"Do I believe that white supremacy in the domestic-terrorism realm is probably the most violent and most dangerous? Yes," he said, adding that the challenge for investigators is identifying threats before they move.

Fruitist, the healthy snacking company known for its jumbo blueberries, has raised $150 million in an equity funding round led by new investor J.P. Morgan Asset Management, with billionaire Ray Dalio's family office doubling down on its existing investment in the farming startup. The company, valued at over $1 billion, is growing distribution rapidly in a snacking market estimated to be as large as $800 billion and in which consumers are spending more dollars on premium-priced, healthier options.

Fruitist has now raised a total of $443 million in equity capital from investors, and says the new capital will help it push deeper into retail locations around the world. In the U.S., its berries are already sold at Costco, Giant, Publix, ShopRite, Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Wakefern, Walmart, and Whole Foods, among other stores. It is also planning to expand distribution of its recently introduced single-serve, grab-and-go packs of fresh blueberries, Fruitist Snack Cups, citing explosive growth in the European market, and its new, even larger Legend Super Jumbo blueberries.

The company told CNBC earlier this year that annual sales surpassed $400 million, and that sales of its blueberries had tripled over the previous 12 months. It did not provide a new sales figure or new valuation with the latest investor round. Aliment Capital and Steve Kaplan, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, also participated in the new funding.

"We are investing in growth in volume, more production capacity," said Fruitist CEO and co-founder Steve Magami, citing its agricultural operations in eight countries. "The dollars are going into growing volumes because demand is far greater than we can supply," he said.

The majority of the new investor money will fund new planting and investments in cold storage and infrastructure, including automation, to increase control over quality and distribution.

"We believe that Fruitist, with control of its value chain, significant organic growth opportunity ahead, and positioning as a driving force of premiumization of berries and the better-for-you category, will realize durable expansion," said Brad Demong, managing director, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a statement announcing the deal.

The recently introduced supermarket coolers stocking Fruitist Snack Cups have grown distribution from an initial 30 stores in Spain in April to 750 stores, and Magami said that is headed to 1,000 stores. That is happening in the U.S. as well, where he said most retail partners will be adding the product in at least a small number of their locations.

Fruitist ranked No. 18 on the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

"We see a snacking industry at $600 billion to $800 billion, and we see the healthy snacking industry as an eighth of that total, and we know our products rank to the far right of the upper right quadrant," Magami said. He added that company doesn't see traditional berry industry players as the competition, describing them as "more of a commodity," and Fruitist as being in a new snacking category.

"Over time, people will realize regular blueberries are more for the blender and cakes, and these are snacking berries to replace a meal," he said.

Sally Lyons Wyatt, chief advisor consumer goods & foodservice insights at consulting firm Circana, said the healthy snacking sector — often called the "better for you" segment and which includes fruits, vegetables, cheese, yogurt, and nuts — is posting notable growth in a relatively flat snacking market. "What is keeping the core snacking category going is the 'better for you' products," she said. 

"Berries are full of antioxidants and one of the healthiest fruits in this snacking story," Lyons Wyatt said.

She said the trend had taken off before Covid, but then got a boost from an increased focus on health and wellness during the pandemic and the rise of social media influencers as consumer brand advocates, and has since seen a further tailwind from the GLP-1 weight loss drug boom.

Magami said Fruitist's research shows that GLP-1 users "are eating virtually less of everything except for fruits and vegetables" six month after starting the drugs.

"We think we are at the intersection of wellness culture and snacking on the go, and know that there is a willingness to pay for more reliable fruit," he said, adding that the goal is "to build the largest healthy snacking business in the world." 

Fruitist is expanding into cherries, raspberries and blackberries, but Magami described the additional berries as "just getting started, just at the ground floor."

He said the cherry production, already in China, is expected to be introduced to other markets including North America over the next year. "We want to scale fast," he said, but added that the new produce lines are a very small, single-digit percentage of the total business now, and "will never on their own be as large for us as blueberries."

While he declined to comment on any initial public offering timeline, Magami said the firm is closely monitoring the planned IPO of Jennifer Garner's Once Upon a Farm, which recently filed to go public.

Matthew Kennedy, senior strategist at IPO research and IPO ETF firm Renaissance Capital, says for investors eyeing companies like Fruitist and Once Upon a Farm, growth is as much, if not more of a driving factor, than the healthy snacking theme.

"Companies often go public when growth trends look most optimistic, so the biggest risk for investors is when that growth is unsustainable, either because it was a fad, or because there's a really devoted initial customer base that doesn't translate to the broader market," he said.

In a food space that has seen public offerings that run the gamut from traditional packaged goods and beverages to alternative proteins like Beyond Meat and dairy alternatives like Oatly — and closer comps to Fruitist like egg and butter producer Vital Farms — Kennedy said it can be hard to find a perfect match. But he added that investors generally like to see a portfolio of products, "which is why we're seeing Fruitist make a push beyond its core blueberry offering, or Once Upon a Farm expand beyond its pouches." 

Kennedy also said that since the food space has had "a lot of losers" this year, "it's especially impressive if a company is able to sell a premium product and take market share while the rest of the industry is under pressure."

Circana has monitored the consumer gravitating to berries for years, "and every year, it's one of those products that just continues to outpace most traditional packaged snacks," Lyons Wyatt said.

The growth rate for snack produce has slowed, but she said that is a function of the fact that just a few years ago it was a very small market. Circana's current estimate of 4% growth for snack produce is far below the 19% growth it posted in the 2019-2020 period, but she said it is the continued growth that matters more, and a business model that is "about as pure and transparent as you get with snack produce."

"It will continue to gain strength and we see it being a big hit around the world because it delivers on all the aspects of what consumers are looking for," she said. The biggest limitation to broader consumer adoption, she added, is price.

"These are priced around $6 a clamshell," said Magami. "We are not selling champagne strawberries for $19. We are focused on building a durable business and growing the brand and have substantial runway ahead," he said. "We will realize well above average growth, which is rare in this sector."

NEW CARLISLE, Indiana — A year ago, it was farmland. Now, the 1,200-acre site near Lake Michigan is home to one of the largest operational AI data centers in the world. It's called Project Rainier, and it's the spot where Amazon is training frontier artificial intelligence models entirely on its own chips.

Amazon and its competitors have pledged more than $1 trillion towards AI data center projects that are so ambitious, skeptics wonder if there's enough money, energy and community support to get them off the ground.

OpenAI has Stargate — its name for a slate of mammoth AI data centers that it plans to develop. Rainier is Amazon's $11 billion answer. And it's not a concept, but a cluster that's already online. 

The complex was built exclusively to train and run models from Anthropic, the AI startup behind Claude, and one of Amazon's largest cloud customers and AI partners.

"This is not some future project that we've talked about that maybe comes alive," Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, told CNBC in an interview at Amazon's Seattle headquarters. "This is running and training their models today."

Tech's megacaps are all racing to build supercomputing sites to meet an expected explosion in demand. Meta is planning a 2-gigawatt Hyperion site in Louisiana, while Google parent Alphabet just broke ground in West Memphis, Arkansas, across the Mississippi River from Elon Musk's Colossus data center for his startup xAI.

In the span of a month, OpenAI committed to 33 gigawatts of new compute, a buildout CEO Sam Altman says represents $1.4 trillion in upcoming obligations, with partners including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom and Oracle.

Amazon is already delivering, thanks to decades of experience in large-scale logistics. From massive fulfillment centers and logistics hubs to AWS data centers and its HQ2 project, Amazon has deep and close relationships with state and local officials and a playbook that's now being used to get AI infrastructure set up in record time.

"These deals all sound great on paper," said Mike Krieger, chief product officer at Anthropic, which has raised billions of dollars from Amazon. "But they only materialize when they're actually racked and loaded and usable by the customer. And Amazon is incredible at that."

The public unveiling of Rainier comes a day ahead of Amazon's third-quarter earnings report. Investors will be listening closely for commentary on capital expenditures, but they also want to know how quickly capex projects will convert into revenue, and eventually, profit.  

On Tuesday, Amazon announced 14,000 layoffs as part of a broader push to flatten management and reallocate resources to priority areas like AI and the company's Trainium chips.

The genesis of the Rainier complex dates back to the spring of 2023.

Roughly six months after ChatGPT launched, Amazon started scouting land in rural Indiana, working with American Electric Power through its Indiana Michigan Power subsidiary. A year later, it signed an $11 billion agreement with Indiana, the largest capital investment in the state's history.

Construction began in September of last year and, as of this month, seven buildings are already online, with two more campuses underway. The full site will eventually span 30 buildings and draw more than 2.2 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power more than 1.6 million homes.

Josh Sallabedra, who's spent 14 years building data centers for Amazon, is now the Indiana site lead. He relocated from the West Coast last year to oversee the project. Sallabedra brought on four general contractors to accelerate the timeline and says he's never seen the company move this fast. 

"That's the customer demand right now," Sallabedra told CNBC. "As we saw AI and machine learning coming, we changed to a different building type."

While some tech giants are throwing up temporary structures to move faster — Meta is building under giant tents in Ohio — Amazon took a more deliberate path. Midway through construction, it updated its facility design to speed up deployment.

"It's not just fast," said Garman. "It is secure and reliable AWS infrastructure … an industrial, enterprise-scale data center."

Or, as Garman described it, "Cornfields to data centers, almost overnight."

The site still feels raw. Workers in safety vests move between trailers as steel beams rise in the distance. Convoys of pickup trucks kick up dust past unfinished warehouse shells. From the security gate, a line of streetlamps stretches toward the data center core, where lifts haul crates packed with chips.

This quiet stretch of rural Indiana, dotted with grain silos, transmission lines, and the occasional barn, has become a magnet for ambitious infrastructure projects. General Motors and Samsung are jointly building a $3.5 billion electric vehicle battery plant next door. At peak, more than 4,000 construction workers have been showing up each day in a town with a population of just 1,900.

Locals don't necessarily love the trend.

"It's just difficult to keep losing farmland," said Marcy Kauffman, president of New Carlisle's town council. "And this took a lot of farmland." 

Dan Caruso, a longtime resident of the area, worries that this is just the beginning.

"My friends tried to tell me, 'You can't let them come in, because once they get their toe in there, they'll want more,'" Caruso said. "And that's exactly what happened."

Indiana Michigan Power says peak power demand will more than double by the end of the decade, raising questions about household utility bills. One report found that monthly electricity bills in neighborhoods near these new types of sites are 267% higher than five years ago.

And expansion isn't slowing anytime soon. 

"We're rapidly adding new capacity all over the place," Garman said. "I don't know that we'll be done ever. We're going to continue to build as our customers need more capacity."

Rainier's seven data center buildings are packed wall-to-wall with Trainium 2, Amazon's custom-built chips. Nvidia's market-leading graphics processing units are nowhere to be found. Amazon claims this is the largest known deployment of non-Nvidia compute anywhere in the world.

"They're already running about 500,000 chips in Indiana today," Garman said. "And in fact, it's going so well that they've actually doubled down on that order." Amazon expects the number to reach a million by the end of the year.

Trainium 3, developed in collaboration with Anthropic, is set to launch in the next few months.

It's the latest example of the tightening bond between the two companies. Anthropic's primary infrastructure runs on AWS, and it's one of the first major AI labs to train models on Amazon's custom silicon. Amazon has invested $8 billion in the startup as part of its broader AI strategy.

While Trainium can't match Nvidia's GPUs in raw performance, AWS says its technology offers greater density and efficiency, packing more chips into each data center to deliver higher aggregate compute while reducing power and cooling costs.

Amazon and Anthopic have co-designed silicon based on real-world training demands. Garman and Krieger both told CNBC that Anthropic provided direct input to speed up training, cut latency and improve energy efficiency.

With Trainium 3, one major goal is to better support frontier models.

"It gives better performance, it gives better latency characteristics, it gets better power consumption per flop," Garman said. "That will be deployed inside of Indiana. It'll be deployed in many of our other data centers all around the world."

Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of infrastructure services at AWS, said it's critical to be "able to control the stack all the way from the lower layers of the infrastructure" in order to "build the right set of capabilities that these model providers want."

Anthropic is moving at a breakneck pace, and burning mounds of cash in the process, as it races to keep up with OpenAI and others.

The company's annual revenue run rate is nearing $7 billion. Its Claude chatbot powers more than 300,000 businesses, a 300-fold increase over the last two years. The number of large enterprise customers, each producing more than $100,000 in annual revenue, has jumped nearly sevenfold in just a year.

Claude Code, Anthropic's new agentic coding assistant, generated $500 million in annualized revenue within its first two months.

But Anthropic isn't counting exclusively on Amazon as it carves its future path. Last week, the company announced a partnership with Alphabet that gives Anthropic access to up to 1 million of Google's custom-designed Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs. The deal is worth tens of billions of dollars,

Anthropic had already received funding from Google, and Krieger said the company needs all the processing power it can get.

"There is such demand for our models," said Krieger, "that I think the only way we would have been able to serve as much as we've been able to serve so far this year is this multi-chip strategy."

Garman is well aware of the multi-cloud and multi-chip efforts, and said Amazon has no plans to do anything drastic, like bidding to buy Anthropic.

"We love the partnership as it is," he said.

Elon Musk's Grokipedia promises to be a "massive improvement over Wikipedia." How do the two compare?

On Monday afternoon, Grokipedia.com went live. Musk did not immediately claim ownership of the site, but its X account was linked to xAI, Musk's AI venture. The site's landing page listed 885,279 articles, calling it v0.1.

"The goal here is to create an open source, comprehensive collection of all knowledge," said Musk, who later confirmed the domain.

Business Insider examined Grokipedia's pages about some of the most contentious issues and events, from January 6 and Gamergate to Donald Trump.

Here's how it compares to Wikipedia.

Both Grokipedia and Wikipedia call January 6 a "riot." Beyond that, the two entries are widely different.

The second sentence of Grokipedia's entry references "widespread claims of voting irregularities." The Wikipedia references these claims, but repeatedly calls them "false." The Wikipedia entry calls Rudy Giuliani's claims of rigged voting machines "conspiracy theories."

Grokipedia:

Wikipedia:

Wikipedia's opening references "many people" being injured, before focusing on 174 police officer injuries and the later suicides of four officers. Grokipedia, on the other hand, first references harm with the death of rioter Ashli Babbitt.

Between the "legal proceedings" and the "aftermath," Grokipedia has an entire section on the "controversies." The section includes coverage of allegations that the riot was orchestrated by the FBI, questioning of the event's characterization as an "armed insurrection," and criticism of the media.

Grokipedia: 7,627 words.

Wikipedia: 19,837 words.

It's no secret that Elon Musk has a contentious relationship with OpenAI. He cofounded the company and invested in it before leaving and founding his own venture, xAI. He's also sued OpenAI multiple times.

Musk's lawsuits are prominently placed in the Grokipedia entry, featured in the last sentence of the introduction. On Wikipedia, the suits are mentioned five paragraphs into a section on "corporate structure."

Grokipedia:

Wikipedia:

Grokipedia's entry leaned more toward politics. It referenced a Manhattan Institute study that indicated OpenAI moderated more hate speech directed toward liberals than conservatives, and a Substacker who wrote that content involving white and conservative identities was more harshly moderated.

It wasn't all conservative-favoring, though. Later, the page referenced how some Sora prompts with "sexist, racist, or ableist" descriptions "often succeed without intervention, amplifying societal prejudices embedded in training data rather than being filtered effectively."

The two entries were ultimately quite similar. Grokipedia covered more of OpenAI's recent controversies, but it was also almost 3,000 words longer.

Grokipedia: 9,077 words.

Wikipedia: 6,206 words.

Musk has also had an up-and-down history with Trump. He led the Department of Government Efficiency, but began publicly feuding with the president over Trump's spending bill.

Grokipedia's entry about Donald Trump is significantly more positive. One example: Trump's prosecution and indictments.

Wikipedia:

On Wikipedia, Trump's legal cases related to sexual abuse and fraud allegations are given an entire paragraph in the introduction. On Grokipedia, they are only referenced further down in a section about Trump's post-presidency. In that section, Grokipedia referenced "fundraising hauls" and "procedural vulnerabilities."

Grokipedia:

Across the post, Grokipedia more frequently splits its entries into critics and defenders. (Grokipedia uses the word "critics" 18 times, compared to Wikipedia's 3.) In a section on Trump's financials, Grokipedia countered criticisms that Trump was "reckless" with a defense that it "aligned with real estate and casino industry norms during boom periods."

References to Musk were also widely different. Wikipedia didn't characterize his appointment, merely calling him a special government employee before describing the Department of Government Efficiency's work.

Grokipedia described criticisms of Musk's appointment for "bypassing Senate confirmation norms," but also a defense for "injecting fresh perspectives free from bureaucratic entrenchment."

The basic descriptions of the Gamergate controversy in 2014 differ greatly in the two online encyclopedias.

Wikipedia calls it a "misogynistic online harassment campaign." Grokipedia calls it a "grassroots online movement" focused on "exposing conflicts of interest and lack of transparency in video game journalism."

The ordering of subjects is also skewed between posts. Wikipedia focuses on the subjects of harassment before a later section on "purpose and goals." In contrast, Grokipedia's first section after its origins is "Ethics in Gaming Journalism."

Grokipedia also framed Gamergate as an act of "decentralized activism," building a future for later movements that "bypassed traditional gatekeepers."

Elon Musk's anti-Wikipedia stance dates back to 2019, when he looked at his own page. "Just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years. It's insane!" he wrote.

Wikipedia and Grokipedia both discuss criticisms of Musk in their introductions to the business leader, but Grokipedia is more defensive. It said that Musk's criticisms came from "legacy media outlets that exhibit systemic left-leaning tilts in coverage."

Wikipedia:

Grokipedia did not mention Musk's controversial gesture during the presidential inauguration, which Wikipedia devoted an entire subsection to. It also does not mention his promotion of "conspiracy theories," "transphobia," or "support of white pride," all of which appear in his Wikipedia entry.

Unlike Wikipedia, Grokipedia includes a section about his long hours and favorite exercises.

Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund — the largest of its kind in the world — on Wednesday reported a 5.8% return during the third quarter, powered by strong stock market gains and AI optimism.

Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) manages the fund on behalf of the Norwegian population. Set up in the 1990s to invest excess revenues from Norway's oil and gas industry, the enormous Government Pension Fund Global is currently invested in assets across 70 countries, including almost 9,000 companies.

Its portfolio comprises a mix of equities, fixed income, renewable energy infrastructure and real estate.

The return on its equity investments for the quarter was 7.7%, while its fixed income investments made 1.4%. Renewable energy infrastructure added 0.3%, while real estate returned 1.1%.

Trond Grande, deputy CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, said strong stock market gains in basic materials, financials and telecommunications helped drive performance during the quarter.

Asia-Pacific was also a key region for the portfolio over the period, Grande told CNBC in an interview Wednesday. He highlighted AI optimism among tech companies, as well as improvements in corporate governance, particularly in Japan and South Korea.

Asked by CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum if there is an AI bubble in markets, Grande said: "I wouldn't use that word. I think we see elevated pricing, but we also see strong earnings. There's obviously a lot to say for this technology. However, I think the jury is still out on exactly who is going to monetize this new technology in the best way."

He added that the fund looked to spread its investments broadly in order to diversify its portfolio.

At the end of September, the fund had a value of 20.4 trillion Norwegian kroner ($2 trillion), an increase of 854 billion Norwegian kroner during the the three-month period. The accounting value was 1.03 trillion kroner, translating into a profit of $102.56 billion.

The fund's return was 0.06% lower than the benchmark index, NBIM said Wednesday.

U.S. stocks account for almost 40% of NBIM's equity investments.

Among NBIM's U.S. equity holdings are stakes in tech giants Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia and Microsoft. The fund is also a major shareholder in companies including JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, Eli Lilly and Coca Cola.

During the reporting period, stock markets were volatile, with the major U.S. averages seeing both selloffs and record highs as Wall Street grappled with U.S. tariffs and looked for clues on the trajectory for the American economy.

However, Big Tech stocks largely saw gains over the course of the quarter, as investors continued to bet big on the AI boom. More recently – and since the NBIM reporting period ended – volatility has taken hold of tech megacaps, amid growing concerns that an AI bubble is forming in equity markets.

Overall, 71.2% of its investments are allocated to equities, 26.6% to fixed income, 1.8% to unlisted real estate and 0.4% to renewable energy infrastructure.

Capital inflows into the fund reached 81 billion kroner after management costs during the period.

In early September, the fund announced a decision to invest $543 billion in a Manhattan office tower.

In the three months to Sept. 30, the Norwegian krone appreciated 0.7% against the U.S. dollar. Over the course of the year, the Norwegian currency has gained 12% versus the greenback.

Last month, NBIM drew the ire of the Trump administration following a decision from Norwegian officials to restrict the sovereign wealth fund's investment activity in Israel.

The U.S. State Department told CNBC at the time that it was "very troubled" by the fund divesting its stake in New York-listed Caterpillar, a move that came amid concerns in Norway about certain companies' ties to the conflict in the Gaza Strip.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has added nine direct reports in the past year or so, according to internal organization charts viewed by Business Insider. Five of those previously worked for Google or DeepMind.

Last year, Microsoft appointed Suleyman — cofounder of AI pioneer DeepMind and former head of startup Inflection AI — as CEO of a new Microsoft AI division. The organization is responsible for consumer AI products such as Microsoft's Copilot chatbot and the Bing search engine.

Business Insider wrote about Suleyman's organizational chart a few months after the new unit came together. Now, an updated org chart shows how his team of 17 direct reports is shaping up, with nine new names and four who no longer appear.

The changes show the fierce competition for AI talent and how tech companies poaching from each other. Microsoft has a special recruiting team for Microsoft AI to help with competitive offers.

Amar Subramanya, CVP, AI MAI

Subramanya joined Microsoft in July from Google, where he was VP of engineering for generative AI product Gemini. In a LinkedIn post shortly after he joined, Subramanya wrote the culture at Microsoft was "refreshingly low ego yet bursting with ambition."

"It reminds me of the best parts of a startup: fast-moving, collaborative, and deeply focused on building truly innovative, state-of-the-art foundation models to drive delightful AI-powered products such as Microsoft Copilot," Subramanya wrote.

Dominic King, VP, Microsoft AI Health

King was previously the health lead at DeepMind back when Suleyman was running it. He joined Microsoft in December from UnitedHealth Group where he was a senior vice president of clinical solutions.

"Health is a critical use case for AI. Patients and the public continue to face multiple pain points on their path to better health," he wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing his new role. "We're now at an inflection point where AI capabilities are already assisting with faster and more accurate diagnoses and helping people better navigate the complexity of modern healthcare."

Jacob Andreou, CVP, Copilot Product

Andreou joined Microsoft this year. He was the senior vice president of product and growth at Snap from 2015 to 2023 and a partner at Greylock since 2023. Andreou appears to be behind Mico, Copilot's new AI character inspired by Clippy, Microsoft Office's often-hated animated paper clip.

Mark D'Arcy, CVP, Creative

D'Arcy joined Microsoft AI in June. He previously spent 10 years at Meta as chief creative officer and nearly seven years at Time Warner before that in roles including president and chief creative officer.

Meghan Perez, VP, General Manager

Perez has spent more than 25 years at Microsoft. Her LinkedIn profile suggests she's in a vice president of the "Microsoft Edge Web and App Platform." Microsoft Edge is the company's web browser that Suleyman's team is working to infuse with AI.

Sean Lyndersay, VP, Edge Product

Lyndersay has spent more than 26 years at Microsoft. He's been in his current role since September 2024, which his LinkedIn profile describes as being responsible for product strategy and direction for Edge, the browser.

Tim Frank, CVP, Monetization Product

Frank joined Microsoft in January from Google, where he spent nearly 14 years most recently as senior director of product management for advertiser and customer engagement platforms. Frank describes his role in a LinkedIn post as "building the next generation of monetization for AI-first products."

Trevor Callaghan, VP, Responsible AI

Callaghan is a former general counsel at DeepMind and a former legal director at Google.

Umesh Shankar, CVP, Data, Privacy, & Security

Suleyman hired Shankar in March to "lead a new privacy and security engineering effort focused on Copilot," he wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing the hiring.

Shankar previously spent nearly 19 years at Google, most recently as chief technology and distinguished engineer for Google Cloud Security. Suleyman wrote that Shankar was "involved in many foundational security and privacy projects" while at Google.

Chris Daly, VP, Strategy & Business Operations

Daly joined Microsoft AI in May 2024 after spending about nine years in investment banking at Robey Warshaw. Daly's LinkedIn indicates he lives in London. He appeared on Suleyman's org chart last year with the same title.

Jordi Ribas, CVP, Bing

Ribas has been at Microsoft for more than 25 years. His LinkedIn profile lists his title as "CVP at Microsoft — Search & AI," leading teams responsible for engineering, product, and growth in Copilot, Bing, and Microsoft Search in Bing for Enterprise. Ribas was listed on Suleyman's org chart last year with the title of corporate vice president of "search and distribution," but a Microsoft spokesman said he effectively has the same title.

Karén Simonyan, CVP & Chief Scientist, Microsoft AI

Simonyan is one of three Inflection cofounders. He was the chief scientist at that startup, and he's taking on this role again at Microsoft AI.

Before Inflection, Simonyan was a principal research scientist at Google's DeepMind AI lab.

Simonyan "is a renowned AI researcher and thought leader, who has led the development of some of the biggest AI breakthroughs over the past decade including AlphaZero," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an email to employees last year. Simonyan had the same title on last year's org chart.

Kya Sainsbury-Carter, CVP, Microsoft Advertising

Sainsbury-Carter is a nearly 20-year veteran of Microsoft. She's been in her current role since March 2023 leading the advertising team, which her LinkedIn says has more than $10 billion in annual revenue. Sainsbury-Carter had the same title on Suleyman's org chart last year.

Mike Davidson, CVP, Design & UX Research

Davidson has worked for Microsoft since 2022. His previous roles include vice president of design at Twitter and founder of a news-media company called Newsvine that was acquired by NBCNews.com. He was also the director of media product development and design at the Walt Disney Internet Group. His role doesn't appear to have changed since last year's org chart.

Qi Zhang, CVP, Microsoft AI Asia

Zhang is based in Beijing and has been at Microsoft for 22 years. Zhang's title appears to have changed since last year to CVP of Microsoft AI Asia from CVP of Microsoft AI ARPD (Microsoft's Asia-Pacific Research and Development group), perhaps suggesting a broader scope. A Microsoft spokesperson said Zhang has always had a big scope.

Rob Cromwell, CVP, Copilot Engineering

Cromwell joined Microsoft along with Suleyman and Simonyan from Inflection AI, where he was the vice president of engineering. Cromwell had until then been at Inflection for about six months, having joined the company from the security-camera startup Verkada. His title has changed from VP of engineering to CVP of "Copilot engineering." A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the promotion.

Rukmini Iyer, CVP, Monetization Engineering, MSN

Iyer has worked for Microsoft for more than 15 years. She has been a corporate vice president since 2020, when she was promoted from a distinguished engineer who led algorithms and infrastructure teams for Bing Ads. Her title on last year's org chart was corporate vice president of "Microsoft ads engineering." A Microsoft spokesperson said Iyer has always been a CVP, but the term "monetization" is newly being used on the team.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Prakhar Agarwal, an applied researcher at Meta Superintelligence Labs. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.

I started my career at Apple in 2020. I spent five years there, then moved to OpenAI in the OpenAI API team. I moved to Meta Superintelligence Labs this summer when a lot of folks were making the shift.

I was in graduate school at the University of Washington, specializing in machine learning, when I applied to Apple. Later, OpenAI, Meta, and a bunch of other companies began reaching out, so I didn't have to explicitly apply for any of those. 

I don't deny that experience plays a huge role. In most of these companies, the number of positions is pretty small, so naturally, they're converging more toward experienced folks.

These roles are very high autonomy. You don't have a traditional setup and hierarchy. Your role involves identifying a gap, then going to solve that problem. It's up to you to prioritize what is the right thing to address in the limited time and resources that you have access to.

Once you're in, you're pretty much thrown in the deep end. You define your own problems and try to come up with solutions. At OpenAI and Meta, they spend a lot of time hiring smart people. You need to tell them what needs to be done, rather than the other way round.

The interviews test for a couple of things. First, do you understand the required nomenclature, and do you understand what LLMs are? 

You still have to write code, but it's much more involved and related to the actual work you're doing at the job. You are fitted for scenarios.

The second thing they're trying to understand is whether you can operate in an ambiguous domain. Given an abstract problem, how are you concretizing and making it a workable metric-driven solution?

Having a Ph.D. helps. It conveys that you're able to work in an abstract domain. But if you can convey that in a different form, be it at a startup or in your role in building an integral piece of software, that is a good enough scenario to get a résumé accepted.

I recommend that people get their hands dirty and actually work on problems and solutions. Practical experience gives you the required skillset and a base to build on. It'll also teach you what not to do and what won't work. Building that intuition will differentiate you from the crowd at interviews.

At a minimum, make sure your theoretical understanding is good and work to understand the nomenclature required to do your job.

You also have to use these models a lot. Once you're using them, you'll understand what they are good at and what they are not good at, which is something people may overlook.

The ability to find gaps in AI models is actually one of the most important things that all of these companies are looking for. What is a gap that needs addressing in the next version of Llama? And once you've identified it, can you quantify that in a metric?

You'll also want to demonstrate that you know where things are trending. These are the capabilities that I think the model could be good at three or six months down the line.

These top-tier AI companies are focusing on high-bandwidth communication.

The handling of the problem statements is happening at a much higher pace compared to Big Tech, where you spend a week trying to create a presentation. Here, you'll just go to a meeting room and discuss the problem over a whiteboard session before going to your own spaces and working on these problems.

These work conversations are usually one-to-ones, one-to-twos, or three-person conversations, so you should be able to articulate the gaps and problems well to people above you and people in the same peer group.

What I've noticed about the AI communities is that they're very open about ideas or feedback.

If you get stuck with something, reach out to people on Twitter or LinkedIn. They are very likely to respond and help.

It might feel like a lot of information is beyond the classroom because the structured class coursework is pretty outdated. When you want to learn about these domains, don't just rely on your coursework or your professor or the books that were written probably five, 10 years ago to bring you to that level.

Consume knowledge from wherever it's coming from: a blog post, a YouTube video, or a conversation on Twitter.

Start following people who are sharing a lot on these domains. You might not be able to understand everything on day one, but you'll start picking it up.

Microsoft's early investments in OpenAI may seem like a no-brainer today, but Satya Nadella says the company and its founder, Bill Gates, saw the decision as a risk back then.

Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019, less than four years after its founding. The company has since invested over $13 billion in the ChatGPT maker.

But getting that first investment deal across the finish line wasn't that straightforward, Nadella said in an interview with "TPBN," a tech-focused YouTube show, on Tuesday.

"Even at Microsoft, you kind of got to have to get a board approval to just go throw a billion dollars out there," Nadella said."But I must say it was not that hard to convince anyone that this is an important area and it's going to be risky."

"In retrospect, who would have thought? I didn't put in a billion dollars saying, 'Oh yeah, this is going to be a hundred bagger,'" he continued.

Nadella told TBPN that Gates was also wary when he wanted to invest in OpenAI back in 2019.

"Remember this was a nonprofit, and I think Bill even said, 'Yeah, you're going to burn this billion dollars,'" Nadella said.

"We kind of had a little bit of high risk tolerance, and we said we want to go and give this a shot," he added.

Representatives for Nadella and Gates at Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

OpenAI has come a long way since Microsoft took its first bet on it.

The AI startup became a household name in November 2022 after it released an early demo of ChatGPT. The chatbot went viral on social media and added a million users within five days.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said at the company's annual DevDay conference on October 6 that "more than 800 million people use ChatGPT every week."

On Tuesday, OpenAI announced that it had completed its restructuring. Its nonprofit arm, OpenAI Foundation, will now oversee a new public benefit corporation, OpenAI Group PBC. With the changes, Microsoft holds a 27% stake, valued at about $135 billion, in OpenAI's for-profit business.

Microsoft's shares are up nearly 29% year to date.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ines Pacheco. It has been edited for length and clarity.

It's very scary. The storm is intense, but we're safe.

The house we are in is made of concrete with a slab roof, and we did a lot of preparatory work. Currently, there are eight of us here: my husband, me, our two girls, ages 4 and 6, our nanny and her two children, ages 10 and 13, and a gardener from our community whose roof is made of zinc, which offers less protection — plus a dog and a cat.

We are in the Blue Mountains outside Kingston, where even normal rain can trigger landslides. Because hurricanes come with notice, we've been talking to the kids for days about what to expect — lots of scary sounds, bad weather, and the importance of staying calm and listening. Now, we're just waiting it out and doing a lot of mopping.

We were here for Hurricane Beryl last year, so they are familiar with some of the signs, but this is much worse. We don't sugarcoat it as a little rainstorm, but we keep it age-appropriate.

One thing about Jamaica is that, in my experience, neighbors take care of each other, and I keep telling them that. We're in a community chat with neighbors sharing photos and road updates; some are already blocked.

We stocked up on food and supplies. We already have a deep freezer and an extra freezer full. I also make school lunches for our local schools, so I had a lot of stock on hand. I've been repurposing it to feed everyone.

My kids heard "life-threatening floods" on the news and latched onto that phrase. I told them that's why we stay home and follow directions — so we'll be OK.

Time is strange now. Up here in the hills, it started raining on Friday and hasn't really stopped. The wind gusts picked up on Saturday. Kingston felt it more at landfall today, but in the mountains, the wind has been something to behold, especially at night.

We might be here for a week or more.

With the kids, routine helps. On weekends at home, we like to sit down for meals together three times a day, so we're doing that now.

We have regular mealtimes and talk like it's a normal day, even though it isn't. The girls are generally having fun — a full table, older kids to idolize.

When the wind howls, they get scared, and we comfort them, reminding them that we're safe.

We've been losing power here and there, so we ration device time to keep everything charged. I'll say, "OK, iPads down — Uno or Bananagrams." But it's also like being on an airplane: some rules go out the window. If they want chocolate cookies at 8 a.m., fine. We're all just trying to survive.

I won't pretend I'm calm. I've had moments where I feel like I'm going to throw up from fear. I'm not a natural optimist, but I keep reminding myself: We are OK. The house might take on water, and some things might break, but we are OK. I try to bring that energy to the kids because they emulate what they see. If they see me scared, they'll be scared. So I tell them, "We're OK. People are protecting each other."

I'm proud of how they're handling it — tiny troopers. For now, we'll continue to mop, cook, charge devices when possible, play games, and eat together. We'll listen for updates, check on neighbors, and wait for the storm to pass.

Microsoft and OpenAI have resolved a major dispute, addressing a lingering question ahead of the company's earnings on Wednesday.

On Tuesday's "TPBN" podcast, the show hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays spoke with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella after the announcement, noting that he is now a "peacetime CEO," as the dispute with OpenAI has been resolved.

"I think AI and everything that it entails is going to be a core driver, and some of it'll come from just this intelligence and this sort of continual march of capability," Nadella said in response to the hosts' question on what he expects from the OpenAI agreement. "I'm always focused on long-term return."

The two companies reached a deal that lifts restrictions that have limited OpenAI's ability to raise money since 2019, when it gave Microsoft sweeping rights to its work in exchange for billions in cloud computing power.

The landmark deal was announced just a day before Microsoft's third-quarter earnings release and call.

The deal would allow the ChatGPT maker to complete its restructure from a nonprofit to a for-profit company, which will give CEO Sam Altman greater authority to strike deals and steer the company as it embarks on its mission to build $500 billion worth of data centers over the next decade.

OpenAI initially started as a nonprofit but restructured following Altman's brief ouster in late 2023, forming a new for-profit arm called OpenAI Group PBC to allow the firm to function more like a traditional company. The nonprofit still governs the for-profit entity.

However, the original deal with Microsoft constrained OpenAI's ability to raise funds from outside investors and secure computing contracts even after its restructuring. That limit became a point of conflict between the two companies as ChatGPT's user base skyrocketed alongside the need for more computing power. OpenAI now boasts roughly 800 million weekly ChatGPT users and is working to build a series of large data centers across the country.

As part of the new deal, Altman won't receive equity in the new structure or any change to his $76,000 annual salary, and the company has not announced any plans to go public. Microsoft will retain its 27% stake in the AI giant and continue to hold certain rights to OpenAI products and AI models until 2032. Most of Altman's wealth comes from his role at the Y Combinator and his early investments in companies like Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit.

Microsoft shares rose around 2% on Tuesday at market closing time after announcing the deal with OpenAI.

"OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure," Bret Taylor, Chair of the OpenAI Board of Directors, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. "The nonprofit remains in control of the for-profit, and now has a direct path to major resources before AGI arrives."

OpenAI and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) does not plan to issue a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) or e-HKD any time soon. Instead, it intends to prioritize work on its wholesale CBDC, which it is developing as part of Project Ensemble for the settlement of tokenization transactions and for the interbank settlement of tokenized deposits. Separately, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported that seven Hong Kong banks are planning to launch tokenized deposits this year, based on an HKMA interview. HSBC has already launched a tokenized deposit service.

Depending on international developments and market demand, it's possible that the retail CBDC decision could change. Hence, during the first six months of 2026 the HKMA aims to finalize preparatory work from a policy, legal and technical perspective.

These conclusions were outlined in a report on phase 2 of the e-HKD trials, which investigated the commercial viability of both a retail CBDC and tokenized deposits. The phase 2 pilots involved 21 firms, including a dozen banks as well as BlackRock, Fidelity International, BCG, Mastercard and Visa.

The HKMA found that retail users did not particularly distinguish between the e-HKD and tokenized deposits, especially given they would access both via banks. Just over a third of users had privacy concerns about a CBDC. For different reasons, the e-HKD pilots demonstrated that asset managers also did not have a strong preference between a CBDC or tokenized deposits.

For years, investors have argued that money printing would weaken fiat currencies and push scarce assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC), dramatically higher. That view, once dismissed as niche, has now entered the mainstream in a big way. 

In a new interview with Cointelegraph, hedge fund manager and macro expert James Lavish broke down the growing acceptance of that thesis. His message is simple: If you don't own hard assets, you're falling behind.

“Prices of goods are inflating. And so if you don't own them, then you're going to be left behind.”

Lavish traces the issue back to the fiat era that began after the US left the gold standard in 1971. Since then, the money supply has exploded, especially during recent crises, creating what he describes as a structural inflation problem. The US government continues to run enormous deficits, and the only viable solution is to quietly debase its currency over time.

And now, he says, even the biggest institutions can see it happening in real time. “Banks are recognizing this. And guess who else has recognized it? All the credit agencies,” Lavish said, pointing out that now Microsoft has a “better credit score than the US government.”

Lavish says this new era of liquidity and inflation could set the stage for Bitcoin to shine. And while short-term volatility remains a risk — especially if the broader market sells off — he expects the cryptocurrency to recover faster and stronger than most traditional assets.

Is it too late to benefit? Lavish doesn't think so. Bitcoin's long-term adoption curve, especially among institutional investors, has only just begun.

Blockchain-enabled cold-chain logistics system (BCCLS) has solved the centralized problem in traditional CCLS system. However, along with that different logistics entities establish their own distributed blockchain ledger, it brings new “data island” and privacy leakage problems for BCCLS. In this paper, a transaction ring signing model with multi-chain fusion (MCF) mechanism has been introduced first which helps achieve secure cross-chain data sharing. The MCF mechanism utilizes the relay chain technology to establish a cross-chain transaction platform among different chains. The transaction ring signing model establishes a ring signature mechanism for one cold-chain logistics product circulating in different institutions. Meanwhile, a ring signature (RS) scheme based on lattice assumption is proposed, which can improve the anti-quantum security of transaction ring signing model. This RS is constructed by lattice assumption which can anti-quantum attack security for cross-chain transaction in BCCLS. Then, the security proof shows that the RS scheme can achieve anonymity under full key exposure and unforgeability under insider attack. The efficiency comparison shows that the RS scheme is efficient than similar schemes, and the performance evaluation shows that the transaction ring signing model with MCF model is efficient and practical.

Nowadays, the cold-chain logistics system (CCLS) plays an essential role for cold-chain logistics data collection1. Especially with the emergency of blockchain technology, the distributed blockchain-enabled CCLS (BCCLS) draws much attention for solving the centralized problem in traditional CCLSs2. However, one piece of cold-chain logistics data generally needs many cold-chain logistics workers and devices to cooperate, which brings privacy leakage risk for the system user and cold-chain logistics data in BCCLS. Meanwhile, with the number increasing of chains in different cold-chain logistics institutions, new “data island” problem emerges again as the data structure, consensus algorithms, cryptographic algorithms are different in different chains.

Blockchain technology draws many attentions in recent years, which is utilized in many production and life areas as finance3, education4, medical5, logistics6, and so on. It gives a new sight for traditional centralized information systems to solve the centralized management and privacy leakage problems. Blockchain changes the storage form from centralization to distribution for cold-chain logistics data, and improves the traceability capability for frozen food by establishing an immutable distributed ledger2. Because of these revolutions, the consumers can view the food information of production, transportation, processing, etc., which can guarantee the food security7. There are many blockchain-enabled CCLS models or platforms have been introduced in recent years, such as Blockcoldchain, ClodBlocks, and so on8,9,10,11,12. However, these novel frameworks mainly focus on solving traditional centralized problems, which do not consider the cross-chain data-sharing problems.

The cross-chain technologies have drawn many attentions in the blockchain-enabled systems and applications. At present, four mainstream cross-chain schemes are notary mechanism, side chain/relay, hash lock and distributed private key control13. Among them, the notary public mechanism introduces a trusted third-party institution as the verifier and coordinator of cross-chain transactions14. After the transaction initiator initiates a transaction on the source chain, the notary verifies whether the transaction is valid by listening to the events on the source chain. After the verification is passed, the notary public notifies the target chain to perform corresponding operations. The side chain/relay chain is more expensive and less efficient, because in this mode, the transaction needs to wait for the chain to determine that the rollback will not occur before confirming15,16,17,18. Hash locking ensures the atomicity of cross-chain asset exchange, but usually can only be used for cross-chain asset exchange, but cannot realize cross-chain transfer of assets or other forms of interaction19. Distributed private key control also needs to wait for source chain transactions to be connected, and it is difficult to develop20. In addition, there are also some other cross-chain protocols, such as cross-consensus message (XCM) in Polkadot21, and inter-blockchain communication (IBC) in Cosmos22. These two protocols mainly set a format for cross-chain transaction, which can support the cross-chain network to unify the format of message in heterogeneous blockchain-based systems. For one cold-chain product, it will pass many logistics institutions from the production to consumption, such as feeding, transport, testing, processing, selling, and buying. The relay chain can help to establish cross-chain data-sharing platform among different chains in different cold-chain logistics institutions, and this paper plans to construct an MCF model to support the cross-chain logistics data-sharing in BCCLS.

As the cold-chain logistics data general contains the sensitive information about the logistics workers and institutions, which are vulnerable to the leakage risk when they are transmitted among the different cold-chain logistics workers and devices. To seek the privacy protection algorithm for cross-chain transaction in BCCLS is the essential work. In general, the cryptographic algorithms are the effective methods to protection system data and user privacy in current information systems. Digital signature gives a proof for the transaction validity, and the signer cannot deny a valid signature sign by himself. It has been developed with many kinds, such as blind signature23, proxy signature24, ring signature25, group signature26, undeniable signature27, designated verifier signature28, etc., which play the different roles in different situations. Meanwhile, the difficult mathematical problems are the bases for these signature schemes. Common RSA and elliptic curve encryption protocols are based on large integer factorization problem and discrete logarithm problem respectively29,30. Recently, the post-quantum encryption based on lattice, hash, and multivariate-quadratic-equations has drawn many attentions as it can resist the quantum attack31,32,33,34,35. With the rapid developments of quantum computer and quantum computing, the post-quantum encryption becomes more and more popular and practical for information systems. Some ring signature schemes with lattice assumption have been introduced in recent years, which are constructed with different lattice assumptions and applied in different areas36,37. For the cold-chain logistics data sharing in BCCLS, the ring signature is more suitable to establish a secure verification mechanism among many different cold-chain logistics workers and devices.

This paper focuses on the “data island” and privacy leakage problems in BCCLS, and introduces a transaction ring signing model with multi-chain fusion mechanism firstly. Then, to improve the anti-quantum security of transaction ring signing model, a lattice-based ring signature (RS) scheme is designed. The main contributions are shown in the following:

A multi-chain fusion mechanism has been introduced first, which utilize rely chain to establish secure cross-chain logistics data sharing channel through BCCLS.

A transaction ring signing model has been proposed, which provides a ring verification mechanism between different cold chain logistics entities. This model can guarantee the privacy security in the cross-chain logistics data sharing processes in BCCLS.

A lattice-based ring signature (RS) scheme is designed, which supports the transaction ring signing model for multi-chain fusion mechanism. This scheme also provides the anti-quantum attack security for cold-chain logistics data.

The security proofs of anonymity and unforgeability have been presented, which show the proposed RS is secure. The performance evaluations have been given to state the efficiency and practical of the proposed model and RS scheme.

The organizations are as follows: Sect. 2 gives some related work, Sect. 3 introduces the multi-chain fusion mechanism and transaction ring signing model, Sect. 4 proposes a new RS scheme, Sect. 5 shows the security proof and analysis, Sect. 6 presents the efficiency comparison and performance, and Sect. 7 concludes.

This section presents some reviews about two main themes of the blockchain methods for CCLS and digital signature scheme for privacy-preserving.

Blockchain servers as a distributed ledger which helps the cold-chain logistics to establish cross-institution data-sharing platform. Some BCCLSs have been proposed in recent years, which establish many interesting frameworks and models. Kim et al. established a cold chain system with blockchain technology for blood supplement, which provided a safe and traceable record sheet8. Mendoca et al. proposed a blockchain-based vaccine cold chain network called Blockcoldchain, which established a traceability mechanism to protect the security of transportation process9. Menon et al. introduced a ClodBlocks which utilized blockchain and IoT to guarantee the quality security for clod chain logistics data10. Hu gave a BCCLS for agricultural products, which provided a record of the whole process11. Ni et al. presented a blockchain platform for maritime logistics and optimized the latency, send rate and throughput with a consensus algorithm of proof of concept12. With more and more different chains have been constructed in different cold-chain logistics institutions, these BCCLSs cannot satisfy the cross-chain demands. Xiong et al. proposed a notary group-based cross-chain interaction model which utilized the notary election mechanism and margin pool to achieve cross-chain transaction among different blockchains14. Kong et al. applied the relay chain to construct a heterogeneous adaptive routing protocol, which could achieve load balancing and high energy efficiency15. Li et al.16 constructed a relay chain-based cross-chain platform for IoMT system, and they also proposed a lattice-based designated verifier signature scheme to protect the privacy in cross-chain transaction. Jiang et al.17 introduced a multi-chain fusion model with relay chain, which also applied the cross-chain gateway and IBC to achieve cross-chain interaction and communication for IoMT. Zhang et al.18 formed a DeCross framework with relay chain for industrial Internet of things, which established a cross-chain consensus protocol based on a parallel processing workflow prototype. Sun et al. presented a cross-chain service scheme with the notary mechanism and hash-locking, which aggregate these cross-chain technologies together solve data island problem and evil attack19. Xu et al. designed an access control scheme for distributed Internet of things, and they also applied a symmetric encryption algorithm to protect privacy security20. These researches give a new sight for solving the new “data island” problem in BCCLS, and the cross-chain technologies also can be used to achieve cross-chain data sharing between different clod-chain logistics institutions with different chains.

Digital signature serves as essential part of the blockchain transaction, which plays the role in the processes of transaction legality verification and record traceability. There are many different kinds of signature schemes have been applied in different areas for privacy-preserving. Gao et al. proposed a blind signature for Internet of vehicle, which could blind the image information in the data transmission process23. Wang et al. introduced a proxy signature scheme based on lattice assumption, which improved the anti-quantum security for Internet of things24. Zhang et al. presented a ring signature for the microgrid day-ahead market, which utilized double auction algorithm to achieve peer-to-peer payment25. Tang et al. designed an event-oriented linkable group signature scheme with lattice assumption which had more flexibility in relation to the signature control26. Mittal et al. proposed an undeniable signature scheme based on inverse computation and discrete logarithm problems, which could resist the impersonation attack27. Deng et al. designated verifier signature scheme for smart grids, and this signature scheme could protect the privacy security of both transaction parts as that only the designated user could verify the signature28. These former signature schemes cannot resist the quantum attacks.

Some post-quantum digital signatures are proposed. Li et al.31 proposed presented an undeniable signature scheme for E-voting system, which was constructed with the Fiat–Shamir signature framework. Xu et al.32 utilized the nested hash coding to construct a post-quantum encryption algorithm for IoT systems, and it also applied the random repetition coding to resist passive eavesdropping attacks. Lyubashevsky et al.34 proposed a CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithm based on parameter set, hash function, and polynomial function to guarantee the security and performance against the quantum attacks. Prest et al.35 introduced a Falcon algorithm, which has anti-quantum security under the hardness of SIS problem on lattice. Xie et al.36 applied the lattice assumption to construct a blind ring signature scheme, which could improve the privacy security in blockchain-based transaction systems. Dong et al.37 designed a certificateless ring signature with lattice theory, which utilized SIS problem to ensure the anti-quantum property. For the privacy-preserving in BCCLS, there needs to provide transaction signature with different operators in different cold-chain logistics institutions for one product, and these former signature schemes are not suitable for this situation. This paper plans to establish a privacy-preserving framework with a lattice-based RS scheme for BCCLS.

Facing with new “data island” and privacy leakage problems in BCCLS, a transaction ring signature model with MCF mechanism has been presented in this section. The following sections first describe the relay chain-based MCF mechanism, and then present the detailed descriptions of the transaction ring signature model.

There are four main parts in this MCF mechanism, as: child chain, parent chain, fusion ledger, and cross-chain transaction. The simple processes are shown in Fig. 1, and details of these parts are given blow.

Multi-chain fusion mechanism.

Child chain: This kind of chain contains the chains of feeding (BCCLS 0), transport (BCCLS 1), testing (BCCLS 2), processing (BCCLS 3), selling (BCCLS 4), and buying phases (BCCLS n). As different parties in BCCLS have different functions, they generally establish different kinds of blockchain ledgers with public, consortium, or private blockchain technologies. This is the reason why the new “data island” problem is emerged again. How to destroy the difference limitations of the data structure, consensus algorithm, cryptographic protocol is first problem to solve. Meanwhile, the privacy security, data integrity, and interoperability are some main items which should been taken more considerations. Then, every child chain stores its own transaction records and it also participants the transaction processing in parent chain. It keeps its own operational activities with the general blockchain mechanism, and it does not need to synchronize other unrelated transaction information, which can significantly reduce the ledger bloat.

Parent chain: This is a relay chain which can help to establish a cross-chain transaction channel between different child chains. Through this relay chain, different child chains can connect with each other to initialize cross-chain transactions. It solves the data integrity and interoperability for cross-chain transactions in BCCLS, and utilizes the ring signature (show in Sect. 4) to guarantee the privacy security of cross-chain transaction. Here, a message exchanging protocol is utilized to solve the difference limitations, such as the differences of data structure, consensus protocol, and cryptographic algorithm. Meanwhile, a RS scheme is proposed to support the following transaction ring verification model. This RS scheme reduces the signing burdens as that a ring member can represent the ring group to perform sign operation, and guarantees the signer's anonymity as that no one can know the real signer unless opening the signature. Then, this parent chain mainly stores the cross-chain transactions, which does not record the transactions in child chains. It mainly focuses on the cross-chain issues when some cross-chain transaction needs have been occurred.

Fusion ledger: Firstly, this ledger serves as the public list for BCCLS, which records the cross-chain transactions created by cold-chain logistics parties in different child chains. It does not change the record form in child chains, and constructs a new ledger with unified form for cross-chain transaction in relay chain. Secondly, this ledger is maintained by the selected representatives from the child chains, and utilizes the consensus algorithms of PoS, DPoS to achieve network-wide consistency. Here, the consensus mechanism can support the MCF model as the child chains complete to serve as the system maintainer, which can avoid the problem of inconsistent ledger caused by a malicious child chain. This multi-chain competitive mechanism can promote the cross-chain transaction achievement and improve the transaction verification efficiency. Thirdly, like the transaction verification mechanism in generally blockchain system, the cross-chain transactions also need to be packaged, broadcasted, verified, and linked to the main ledger. As the transactions in this fusion ledger are immutable, which can provide the evidences for cross-chain transactions when there is a dispute.

Cross-chain transaction: The cross-chain transaction is the main parts for the MCF mechanism in BCCLS. It supports the cross-chain information exchanging between different users in different child chains. To the difference of data structure in heterogeneous BCCLS, the XCM and IBC ca. be used for unifying the message format. In this cross-chain transaction, both users' transaction addresses, signatures, timestamp, and other related information are inserted. For one cold-chain product, it will pass many logistics institutions with many workers, and this cross-chain transaction also be signed by these related workers. This transaction ring verification model (show in Sect. 3.2) utilizes a ring signature scheme to construct multi-party signature verification mechanism, which can guarantee the transaction traceability for cold-chain product disputes.

This MCF model helps to establish a secure cold-chain logistics data exchange mechanism among different chains in different logistics institutions. Different from the traditional blockchain structure, this MCF helps to construct a new cross-chain data sharing mechanism. It establishes a bridge among heterogeneous blockchain-based BCCLSs. Here, the relay chain acts the data and value exchange bridge, breaks the difficult limitation of data interoperability, and guarantees the immutability of cross-chain transactions. This model promotes the cross-chain data-sharing and improves the value play of cold-chain logistics data. Meanwhile, to protect the privacy of cold-chain logistics data and system users, a transaction ring signing model is needed as there are many logistics institutions participating in the cold-chain product transportation processes. The next section shows the detailed descriptions of this model.

The transaction ring verification model mainly contains four parts: Logistics data generation, Transaction ring signature, Transaction construction, and Distributed accounting. The simple processes are shown in Fig. 2, and details of these parts are given blow.

The transaction ring verification model.

Logistics data generation: For the frozen foods, such as meat, fruit, seafood, they will go through the processes of feeding, transport, testing, processing, selling, and buying from the production to consumption. Supporting by the technologies of Internet of things and RFID, BIoMT systems collect these data generated by these processes. Meanwhile, the blockchain ledger takes responsibility for the storage and recordation of the logistics data and processing records which are the essential evidences for secure frozen food management.

Transaction ring signature: These different doctor's processes relate to many medical workers in different departments. All of these workers take responsibility for the generation these medical data, so they must make a signature on them. Meanwhile, a ring signature scheme has been applied in this part. This signature scheme only needs one member to sign these medical data by representing the group, and the verification process can derive that this signature is generated by this group. It cannot confirm which member signs this signature, which can well guarantee the user privacy of the signer. Here, the related operators all need to sign on this cross-chain data sharing transaction with their own \((pk,sk)\) when the cold chain goods are transmitted through different logistics institutions. This RS plays a role of the transaction verifier to ensure the data integrity, reliability, and privacy security.

Transaction construction: After these medical data have been signed by the worker group, they will be packaged into a transaction and uploaded to BCCLS network for verification. Then, the mining nodes verify this transaction according the system consensus mechanism. Meanwhile, the IBC protocol is inserted into this cross-chain transaction, which can help to unify the data structure from different child chains. Only passing these verifications, this transaction can be packaged into a block and waits for the distributed accounting.

Distributed accounting: The verified transactions are packaged into a temporary block, and this block will attach to the longest chain fusion ledger in BCCLS system. Next, the newly transactions are also broadcasted to the whole network. Once this process is completed, these transactions become immutable records.

This transaction ring verification model utilizes the ring signature protocol to protect the privacy security, and establishes ring verification mechanism for cross-chain transactions among different BCCLSs. Meanwhile, this model can protect the signer's anonymity as there are no trust center and group establishment procedure. It helps different logistics workers to construct a ring signature protection mechanism in relation to one cross-chain logistics product. This ring signature mechanism also provides traceability mechanism when the dispute incidents occur.

(Lattice)38: Let \(V=[{v_1}| \cdots |{v_m}] \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{q}^{{r*m}}\) be linearly independent vectors in \({\mathbb{Z}}_{q}^{r}\)and q be a prime, \(\Lambda (V)=\{ z \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{q}^{r}|z=Vx\bmod q,x \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{q}^{m}\}\) is the r-dimensional lattice to vector V.

The security of NTRU-based protocol is due to the distribution of \((a,z)\) is pseudo-random in \(\Re _{q}^{2}\) and the definition of NTRU Lattice is given below.

(NTRU Lattice)39: For a message V, the NTRU cryptosystem outputs a polynomial \(z=2(ar+e)+\mu\) in \({\Re _q}\) with \(\{ 0,1\}\) coefficients, by random selecting two short vectors \(r,e \in {\Re _q}({\Re _q}={\mathbb{Z}}[x]/({x^n}+1))\).

The short integer problem (\(SIS\)) is a more important lattice assumption for lattice cryptosystem, which was first presented by Ajtai40. The essence of this problem is to find a series of short nontrivial integer form a certain large finite additive group, and the sum of these uniformly random elements is zero. The proposed RS is mainly based on \(SIS\) problem, and the definition of \(SIS\) in the ring are \(\Re\) presented as following.

(\(\Re - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\)problem): By randomly choosing \(A \in \Re _{q}^{{n \times m}}\) according to the distribution k, there exists a non-zero \(v \in \Re _{q}^{m}\) which satisfies \(Av=0\) and \({\left\| v \right\|_2} \leqslant \beta\). Here, is \({\Re _q}\) the quotient ring \(\Re /(q\Re )\).

Gaussian Distribution41: The general Gaussian distribution for \(x \in \Re\) is defined as \({\rho _{c,\sigma }}(x)=\exp (\frac{{ - {{\left\| {x - c} \right\|}^2}}}{{2{\sigma ^2}}})\), where \(\sigma \in \Re\) is the standard deviation and \(c \in \Re\) is the center.

Note that, the Gaussian distribution can be simply written as \({\rho _\sigma }(x)\) when the center c is 0. Meanwhile, the discrete Gaussian distribution over \({\mathbb{Z}}\) is defined as \({D_\sigma }(x)={\rho _\sigma }(x)/{\rho _\sigma }(z)\) with center 0, and written as \(D_{\sigma }^{m}(x)={\rho _\sigma }(x)/{\rho _\sigma }{(z)^m}\) over \({{\mathbb{Z}}^m}\). Next, the discrete Gaussian is defined as follows.

(Discrete Gaussian)41: The function \({\rho _{c,\sigma }}(x):{\Re ^n} \to (0,1]\) of n-dimensional Gaussian with the center c can be described as: \({\rho _{c,\sigma }}(x)\mathop =\limits^{\Delta } \exp (\frac{{ - {{\left\| {x - c} \right\|}^2}}}{{2{\sigma ^2}}})\).

With the security parameter n, a RS is composed of three probabilistic polynomial time algorithms as follows.

KeyGen (\({1^n}\)): Given n, this step derives the public and private key pairs \((p{k_i},s{k_i})\) for every ring user.

Sign \((p{k_1},p{k_2},...,p{k_l},s{k_a},m)\): For a message m, a signer generates a signature e with all ring users' public key \((p{k_1},p{k_2},...,p{k_l})\) and the signer's private key \(s{k_a}\).

Verify\((e,p{k_a},m)\): The verifier verifies \(e'{\text{s}}\) legality with the signer's public key \(p{k_a}\), and outputs the results.

For a digital signature scheme, the security proof in random oracle model is general method to prove the scheme security. This security model is composed of two participants of a challenger C and an adversary A, which establishes a query-respond game between these two participants and utilizes proof by contradiction to prove the security of RS security. First and formost, a hypothesis that A has ability to forge a valid signature with some key information is preset. Detailed descriptions are as follows.

Initialize: Given the system parameters, C initializes the query-respond game with A.

Hash query: A queries on the hash algorithm for enough times without the target messge \({m^*}\), by choosing the ring users' public keys \(p{k_i}\).

Secret key query: A queries on the user's private key \(s{k_i}\) in relation to the user's public key \(p{k_i}\) for enough times without the target user's private key \(sk_{i}^{*}\).

Signature query: A queries on the sign algorithm in relation to the user \(p{k_i}\) for enough times without the target messge \({m^*}\).

Forge: A forges a valid signature \((e,{m^*})\) in relation to the target message \({m^*}\), and sends to C.

Challenge: A utilizes the query-respond results of the former three algorithms and the forged signature \((e,{m^*})\) to derives the signature \((e^{\prime},{m^*})\) for the target message \({m^*}\). Then, A attempts to derive a solution for the \({\mathbb{Z}} - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\) instance with these two valid signatures by using Forking lemma.

Analyze: Under current classical computational conditions, the lattice assumption \({\mathbb{Z}} - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\) cannot be solved. By the proof by contradiction, the former hypothesis is invalid, and the RS is secure.

This security model is defined for RS scheme. From this query-respond game, C can solve the hard problem with the query results and forged signature. But this is improssible with current computation condition. So this security proof has proved that a secure RS can capture the security properities of anonymity, unforgeability, and undeniable.

This RS scheme can establish a transaction ring verification mechanism to protect the cross-chain logistics data sharing security and users' privacy security. It is constructed with the lattice assumption \(\Re - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\) with a uniform distribution κ. Here, to simplify the work way, this RS scheme reduces \(\Re ={\mathbb{Z}}\) and executes in rings \(\Re ={\mathbb{Z}}[x]/({x^n}+1)\) with the same hardness assumption \({\mathbb{Z}} - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\)40. This RS generally contains the algorithms of KeyGen., Ring Sign, and Ring Verify, and the simple processes are described as shown in Fig. 3. In addition, it also utilizes the bimodal Gaussian distribution to improve the performance efficiency. Next are the detailed descriptions.

Ring signing process.

Key Gen.: The system parameters \(n,m,q,\kappa ,\sigma\) are preset with the security parameter \(\kappa\) and \(m=O(n\log q)\). Next, the public and private keys are derived as shown in Algorithm 1.

Key Gen.

Ring Sign: Assume the ring member k with \(({A_k},{S_k})\) represents to sign message \(\mu\).

Ring Sign.

Ring Verify: The ring signature \((e,c)\) can be verified by ring member \(k's\) public key \({A_k}\). Here, \(\left\| e \right\|>T\) with the conditions of \(T=\eta \sqrt m {\sigma _1}\), and \(\eta\) can be verified with probability \(1 - {2^{ - \kappa }}\) for the security parameter \(\kappa\) (in practice \(\eta \in [1.1,1.4]\)).

Ring Verify.

After this transaction signature passes the verification, it will be uploaded to the blockchain for verification and package. When this transaction passes the blockchain verification, it will become an unalterable record in the blockchain ledger. In this RS scheme, one of the ring group users performs the signing process, and nobody can know which one user is the real signer. This mechanism can guarantee the anonymity of real ring singing user. Meanwhile, it can verify the validity of ring signature and trace the real signer by opening the signature when some disputes occur. This RS scheme can well support the privacy protection in cross-chain data sharing process in BCCLS.

The signature \((e,c)\) should satisfy three conditions. First is\(\left\| e \right\|<{T_1}\), as \({T_1}\) is defined in the Ring Verify algorithm. Second is \({\left\| e \right\|_\infty }<q/4\), as this condition is restricted system security reason. Third is \(c \leftarrow H({A_k}e+qcmod2q,\mu )\), as that it is based on the following Eq. (1) holds.

Security proof of the anonymity and unforgeability have been given in the following two subsections.

For the RS's anonymity, the case of full key exposure should be taken into consideration, and detailed proof processes are shown in the following.

Based on the hardness of lattice assumption \(\Re - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\), this RS can achieve anonymity under full key exposure.

Suppose there exists an adaptive adversary A, who performs attack on the RS's anonymity under full key exposure. Then, there exists a challenger who can execute a query-respond game with A to solve SIS problem a polynomial time algorithm C.

First and foremost, parameters \(n,m,q,\kappa ,\sigma\) are given. C performs the Key Gen. with \({q_E}\) times to derive ring group members' public keys \({A_i} \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{{2q}}^{{n*m}},\;(i=1,2,...,l)\) and the corresponding secret keys \({S_i} \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{{2q}}^{{m*n}}\). Here, \({R_i}=\{ 1,2,...,{q_E}\}\)is the ring of these \({q_E}\) members. C initializes an empty list \(lis{t_K}\)storing \(\left\langle {i,{A_i},{S_i}} \right\rangle\), and then sends the public key set \(\{ {A_1},{A_2}, \ldots ,{A_l}\}\) to A.

Hquery: C initializes an empty list \(lis{t_H}\)storing \(\left\langle {{R_i},{u_j},{c_{ij}}} \right\rangle\). Upon receiving a  Hquery from A, C first checks the query history. If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{R_i},{u_j},{c_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_H}\) and returns \({c_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, he randomly selects \({y_1},{y_2} \leftarrow D_{\sigma }^{m}\) at random and computes \({c_{ij}} \leftarrow H((\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{A_k}{y_2}mod2q,{\mu _j})\). Then, he adds \({c_{ij}}\) to \(lis{t_H}\), and returns it to A.

For member \({i_1}'s\) private key query, C checks list \(lis{t_K}\) and returns \({S_i}\) back to A.

For member \({i_1}'s\)sign query on signature \(\left\langle {k,{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\), C first checks the query history. If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{i_1},{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_S}\) and returns \({e_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, C first performs H query to obtain \({c_{ij}}\), and randomly selects \(b \in \{ 0,1\}\) to compute the signature \({e_{ij}}\) by \({e_{ij}} \leftarrow A_{{{i_1}}}^{{ - 1}}(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{y_2}+{( - 1)^b}{S_{{i_1}}}c\). Then, he adds \(({e_{ij}},{c_{ij}})\) to \(lis{t_S}\), returns it back to A.

Forge phase: A launches a challenge \(\left\langle {{k_0},{k_1},{R^*},{u^*}} \right\rangle\), where ring \({R^*}\) signs on the target message \({u^*}\). \({k_0}\) and \({k_1}\) are two members of ring \({R^*}\). C chooses \({t^*} \in \{ 0,1\}\), checks the \(\left\langle {{R^*},{u^*},{c^*}} \right\rangle\) in list \(lis{t_H}\), and derives the associated secret “trapdoor” \({S_{{R^*}}}\) with relation to \({A_{{R^*}}}\). Then, he computes a challenge signature \({e_{ij}}\), and returns it to A. Next, A gives his guess \(t^{\prime} \in \{ 0,1\}\).

It can easily derive that the statistical distance of \({e_{{k_0}}}'s,{e_{{k_1}}}'s\) distribution and \(D_{\sigma }^{m}\) is negligible. Therefore, the statistical distance of \({e_{{k_0}}}\) and \({e_{{k_1}}}\) is also negligible. This derives that A guesses 0 or 1 with the same probability. So, the proposed RS scheme has anonymity under full key exposure.

For the RS's unforgeability, the case of insider attack should be taken into consideration.

Based on the hardness of lattice assumption \(\Re - SIS_{{q,n,m,\beta }}^{\kappa }\), this RS can achieve unforgeability under insider attack.

Assume there exists an adaptive adversary A, who performs attack on the RS's unforgeability under insider attack. Then, there exists a challenger who can execute a query-respond game with A to solve SIS problem by a polynomial time algorithm C.

First and foremost, parameters \(n,m,q,\kappa ,\sigma\) are given. C selects \(l \in \left[ {{q_E}} \right]\) as the number of challenge ring member. He obtains a SIS instance \({A_{{R_t}}} \in Z_{q}^{{n \times lm}}\) and divides this \(n \times lm\) matrix into l matrixes with \(n \times m\). Note that \({A_{{R_t}}}=[{A_{1*}}{A_{2*}} \cdots {A_{l*}}]\), where \({A_{{i^{st}}}} \in Z_{q}^{{n \times m}}\). C selects \({t_i} \in \left[ {{q_E}} \right],i \in \{ 1,2, \cdots ,l\}\), and sets \({R_t}=\{ {t_1},{t_2}, \cdots ,{t_l}\}\). Then, C servers the sub-matrix \({A_{i*}}\) as the public key of ring \({R_t}\) member. Therefore, \({A_{ti}}={A_{i*}}\) for the member in ring \({R_t}\). For the \({q_E} - l\) ring member out of \({R_t}\), C performs the Key Gen. with \({q_E}\) times to derive ring group members' public keys \({A_i} \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{{2q}}^{{n*m}},\;(i=1,2,...,l)\) and the corresponding secret keys \({S_i} \in {\mathbb{Z}}_{{2q}}^{{m*n}}\). Here, \(R=\{ 1,2,...,{q_E}\}\)is the ring of these \({q_E}\) members. C initializes an empty list \(lis{t_K}\)storing \(\left\langle {i,{A_i},{S_i}} \right\rangle\), and then sends the public key set \(\{ {A_1},{A_2}, \ldots ,{A_{{q_E}}}\}\) to A.

Hquery: C initializes an empty list \(lis{t_H}\)storing \(\left\langle {{R_i},{u_j},{c_{ij}}} \right\rangle\). Upon receiving a Hquery from A, C first checks the query history. If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{R_i},{u_j},{c_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_H}\) and returns \({c_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, he randomly selects \({y_1},{y_2} \leftarrow D_{\sigma }^{m}\) at random and computes \({c_{ij}} \leftarrow H((\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{A_k}{y_2}mod2q,{\mu _j})\). Then, he adds \({c_{ij}}\) to \(lis{t_H}\), and returns it to A.

For member \({i_1} \notin {R_t}\) private key query, C checks list \(lis{t_K}\) for \(\left\langle {{i_1},{A_{{i_1}}},{S_{{i_1}}}} \right\rangle\) and returns \({S_i}\) back to A. Otherwise, abort.

For member \({i_1}'s\)sign query on signature \(\left\langle {{i_1},{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\), there exist three cases which should be taken into consideration.

If \({R_i}={R_t}\), C first checks the query history. If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{i_1},{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_S}\) and returns \({e_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, C first performs Hquery to obtain \({c_{ij}}\), and randomly selects \(b \in \{ 0,1\}\) to compute the signature \({e_{ij}}\) by \({e_i} \leftarrow A_{k}^{{ - 1}}(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{y_2}+{( - 1)^b}{S_k}c\). Then, he adds \(({e_i},{c_{ij}})\) to \(lis{t_S}\), returns it back to A.

If \({R_i} \ne {R_t}\) and \({i_1} \in {R_i} - {R_t}\), the \(\left\langle {{i_1},{A_{{i_1}}},{S_{{i_1}}}} \right\rangle\) exists in list \(lis{t_K}\). C first checks the query history. If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{i_1},{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_S}\) and returns \({e_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, C first performs Hquery to obtain \({c_{ij}}\). Then, he derives the associated secret “trapdoor” \({S_{{R_i}}}\) with relation to \({A_{{R_i}}}\), and randomly selects \(b \in \{ 0,1\}\) to compute the signature \({e_{ij}}\) by \({e_{ij}} \leftarrow A_{{{R_i}}}^{{ - 1}}(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{y_2}+{( - 1)^b}{S_{{R_i}}}{c_{ij}}\). Then, he adds \(({e_i},{c_{ij}})\) to \(lis{t_S}\), returns it back to A.

If \({R_i} \ne {R_t}\) and \({i_1} \in {R_i} \cap {R_t}\), the \(\left\langle {{i_1},{A_{{i_1}}},{S_{{i_1}}}} \right\rangle\) does not exist in list \(lis{t_K}\). C first checks the query history. If this query already exists, C finds the storing \(\left\langle {{i_1},{R_i},{u_j},{e_{ij}}} \right\rangle\) on \(lis{t_S}\) and returns \({e_{ij}}\) back. Otherwise, C first finds a \({i_2} \in {R_i} \cap {R_t}\) as the \(\left\langle {{i_2},{A_{{i_2}}},{S_{{i_2}}}} \right\rangle\) exists in list \(lis{t_K}\). Then, he derives the associated secret “trapdoor” \({S_{{R_i}}}\) with relation to \({A_{{R_i}}}\), performs H query to obtain \({c_{ij}}\), and randomly selects \(b \in \{ 0,1\}\) to compute the signature \({e_{ij}}\) by \({e_{ij}} \leftarrow A_{{{R_i}}}^{{ - 1}}(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}} ){y_1}+{y_2}+{( - 1)^b}{S_{{R_i}}}{c_{ij}}\). Then, he adds \(({e_{ij}},{c_{ij}})\) to \(lis{t_S}\), returns it back to A.

Suppose ε represents the probability that A outputs a legitimate signature. Here, the probability that C successfully solve the SIS instance is mainly depended on the private key query phase and challenge phase. As there are l ring member in R, the probability of successfully private key query for \(i \notin {R_t}\) is \(1 - 1/{q_E}\), and the probability of successfully challenge for \({R^*}={R_t}\) is \(1/C_{{{q_E}}}^{l}\). Therefore, the probability that challenger C successfully solve the SIS instance is at least \(\varepsilon \left( {1 - 1/{q_E}} \right)/C_{{{q_E}}}^{l}\). Here, with the query times \({q_E}\) increasing, the success probability becomes more negligible. So, the proposed RS scheme has unforgeability under insider attack.

For this RS scheme, one ring member can represent the ring group to sign the message, and the ring group users cannot deny this signature. As in the signature generation process, all the public keys of ring members are constructed by \(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}}\). In the one hand, this mechanism guarantees that the signer is authorized by the ring group, and the ring signature is approved by all the ring group members. In the other hand, this construction provides a signature traceability mechanism as it can quickly find the target user once the medical disputes occur. This security property can protect the user privacy as it cannot know which member of the real signer is, and also provide a secure traceability mechanism for the cold-chain logistics data sharing in the BCCLS.

Therefore, the proposed RS scheme can satisfy the security properties of correctness, anonymity, unforgeability, and undeniable. This RS scheme supports the transaction ring signing model and establishes a ring signature mechanism for one cold-chain logistics product circulating in different institutions. In addition, this RS scheme improves the cross-chain transactions security with the multi-chain fusion mechanism in the BCCLS. The fusion ledger protects the immutability of the cold-chain logistics data and provides a mechanism for traceability of the cross-chain data processing.

To compare the efficiency of this proposed RS scheme, three similar RS schemes have been selected. First, the system parameters \(n,m,q,\sigma\) in these schemes are unified, and the parameter k in41 is set as \(k=0.96n\). Then, three items of the public key size \(pk\), private key size \(sk\), and signature size are considered, and the comparison results are listed in the following Table 1. As for the scheme in Ref.36, the key size of these three items will increase with the increasing of message length l. For the scheme in Ref.37, these three items are all bigger than that in this RS scheme. Therefore, this RS scheme is efficient than similar schemes.

Key size comparison with 192-bit security level.

Meanwhile, the performance evaluation of this RS comparing with similar schemes are executed. Here, the parameters are set as \(n=1024,q={2^{27}}\) with 192-bit security level, \(m=8323\) for 192-bit which satisfies \(m \geqslant n\left\lceil {\log q} \right\rceil\), the message length is preset to \(l=10\), and \(\sigma ={2^{30}}\). The more intuitive comparison results are show in the following Fig. 4. The sizes of public key \(pk\) and private key \(sk\) are more space saving, and the signature size is almost 1/5 of that in Ref36.

Then, the time consumption of the proposed RS scheme has been performed and compared with these two related references. The comparison results are shown in Table 2. Here, TTrap, TSam, TMul, and TH represent the times consumption of Trapdoor, Gaussian Sample, Matrix Multiplication, and Hash algorithms, respectively. These performance results show that this RS scheme has certain advantage about the time consumption than similar schemes. Meanwhile, the results are shown in Fig. 5 with more intuitive form. Here, the time consumption of algorithms TTrap, TSam, TMul, and TH are set as 1.5 ms, 1 ms, 0.1ms, and 0.8 ms respectively, which is set according to the standard experiment environment. Therefore, the cross-chain data sharing transactions will more efficient with more low time consumption algorithms.

Time consumption performance.

In addition, along with the logistics link increasing, the key size and time consumption have no changes. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the system indexes do not increase with the ring users increasing. Meanwhile, in the ring singing phase, the ring users' public keys are aggregated together with \(\sum\limits_{{i=1}}^{l} {{A_i}}\), and this continuous addition calculation mode cannot change the dimensionality of the public keys. So, it cannot increase the computational complexity and the time consumption of this RS scheme. Therefore, this RS scheme can well support the ring users update and has favorable scalability.

Transaction throughput and latency are two main factors for cross-chain transaction in BCCLS. This paper executes the cross-chain transaction in the Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum environment, and selects a single-chain model for comparison with 1000 pieces of transactions. The performance environment is on a Windows 11 desktop with Intel® Core™ i7-9700p 3.0 GHz and 16G RAM. This is a simulation environment close to reality. The comparisons for transaction throughput and latency for these two models are shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. Here, the “H” and “E” represent the Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum environment respectively. In these two figures, the results show that the indexes of transaction throughput and latency in cross-chain model are small weak than that in single-chain model. But it still shows that the cross-chain transaction model is practical for data sharing in different cold-chain logistics institutions as the differences between these two models are small. Meanwhile, the transaction throughput performed in Hyperledger Fabric is bigger than that in Ethereum, and the transaction latency performed in Hyperledger Fabric is smaller than that in Ethereum. This is because of that Hyperledger Fabric is for enterprise application with consortium blockchain, and the Ethereum is for general users with public blockchain. So the Hyperledger Fabric is more suitable for cross-chain data sharing in BCCLSs. Then, with the institution chains number increasing, the cross-chain data sharing demands are also increasing, and these small differences will be ignored with technology development.

Transaction throughput comparison.

Transaction latency comparison.

With the same performance evaluation environment, the transaction simulations with different transaction number are executed. The comparison results are shown in the following Figs. 8 and 9. With the transaction number increasing, the transaction throughput increases slowly with relation to the items of “CreateAccount” and “Query”, and the throughput of “Transaction” keeps stable no matter the transaction number increasing. For the transaction latency, the items of “Query” and “Transaction” increase slowly, but the item of “CreateAccount” increases a lit quickly. This phenomenon is emerged with two reasons: one is that some new accounts have been registered, and the other is that many new cross-chain transaction addresses are generated. In addition, the stable phenomenon also shows the efficiency and practical of the proposed cross-chain model, which brings a more promising application for the proposed model and RS algorithm in BCCLS.

Transaction throughput with number increasing.

Transaction latency comparison with number increasing.

Meanwhile, the CUP and RAM usage are monitored when the cross-chain transactions execute in BCCLS. The results are shown in Fig. 10. With the transaction number increasing, the use condition of CUP and RAM keep a slow growth. It indicates that the proposed MCF model and RS scheme is not resource consumption, and it can well support the cross-chain data sharing transaction among different BCCLSs.

CPU and RAM use condition with transaction execution.

Here, note that the above data analyses are all the average level, which do not consider the basic statistical indicators such as error bars, mean, and variance. The results in Figs. 4 and 5 are computed with general setting ruler for the system parameters \(n,m,q,\sigma\) with 192-bit security level. The results in Figs. 6 and 7 are computed and taken the average with 1000 pieces of transactions in two different public blockchain platforms of Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum environment. The results in Figs. 8 and 9, and 10 are computed and taken the average with 1000 pieces of transactions in two different public blockchain platforms of Hyperledger Fabric. These results are enough to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MCF model and RS scheme.

Facing with the new “data island” and privacy leakage problems in current BCCLS, this paper introduces a transaction ring signature model with multi-chain fusion mechanism. The transaction ring signature model helps establish a secure cross-chain data sharing mechanism for cold-chain logistics data-sharing between different logistics entities through BCCLS. Meanwhile, a ring signature scheme with lattice assumption has been designed for the transaction ring signature model. This scheme improves the cross-chain data sharing security, and guarantee the quantum attack security for cross-chain transaction in BCCLS. In addition, this research gives a new sight for cross-chain transaction privacy-preserving, and promotes the construction and application of practical cold-chain logistics data security protection mechanism.

The future works will focus on other related privacy enhancement measures in the logistics data sharing processes, such as cross-chain identity authentication, secret sharing, key agreement, and so on. Meanwhile, the consensus mechanism and data compression mechanism are also interesting to give considerations. Moreover, the actual deployment of the proposed MCF model and RS scheme will be executed in the BCCLS, and the throughput, latency, a dynamic node changes will be considered to evaluate the practice.

MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin BTC$113,421.04 and long seen as a leveraged bet on the crypto, has shed nearly $18 billion in market value as enthusiasm dried up and its net asset value (mNAV) premium collapsed in recent months.

The stock may be poised for a rebound as a series of key catalysts could reverse the bearish trend as soon as this week, according to a fresh report by 10x Research's Markus Thielen, who previously had been bearish on the name.

"At today's price, with the NAV premium largely gone, volatility trending higher, and a potential catalyst in the form of strong Q3 earnings and renewed S&P 500 inclusion speculation, we see Strategy as attractive at current levels," Thielen wrote, noting that the stock here could offer better value than bitcoin itself.

The stock's slump to below $280 (down another 1.8% on Wednesday) has left the market cap sitting at barely above the value of the bitcoin on the company balance sheet. That marks a sharp reversal from late 2024, when speculative premiums, said Thielen, which pushed the stock far above its fundamentals.

While the 40% decline since July left has sentiment “washed out” and retail interest low, the firm's Thursday earnings report could mark a pivot, said Thielen.

He expects the firm to report a roughly $3.6 billion profit from mark-to-market gains on its BTC holdings. The profit could reset speculation for a potential S&P 500 index inclusion decision in December — a move in which Thielen has now assigned a 60–70% probability.

Including the stock in one of the most important equity indexes in the world could drive up to $28 billion in passive and active fund flows, setting up MSTR for a similar rally seen in Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) following their inclusions into the S&P 500.

"Capitulation always feels like the end — until it quietly marks the beginning," Thielen said.

The (EF) has launched “Ethereum for Institutions,” a new online portal designed to guide enterprises, financial institutions, and developers looking to build on Ethereum's infrastructure. 

1/ Now live: the Ethereum for Institutions siteEthereum is the neutral, secure base layer where the world's financial value is coming onchainToday, we're launching a new site for the builders, leaders, and institutions advancing this global movement — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) 

In a series of posts on X, the foundation said the initiative marks Ethereum's continued evolution into the backbone of the global on-chain economy — uniting privacy-preserving technology, real-world assets, and institutional staking within a single framework.A New Institutional Gateway to Ethereum

The launched by EF's Enterprise Acceleration team, provides a roadmap for organizations adopting Ethereum. The platform offers resources and technical pathways to support institutional adoption.

“Ethereum is the neutral, secure base layer where the world's financial value is coming onchain,” stated. “Clear pathways are essential as institutions build.”

The site highlights Ethereum's decade-long reliability — with over 1.1 million validators and continuous uptime — while spotlighting leading companies such as BlackRock, Visa, eToro, and Coinbase, which already manage billions in assets and trillions in transaction volume using Ethereum-based solutions.ZK Privacy and Compliance: The Next Institutional Frontier

Recognizing privacy as a key institutional requirement, the Ethereum Foundation emphasizes the use of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to enable compliant, audit-ready applications on public rails.

Projects like Chainlink, RAILGUN, Aztec Network, and Zama are featured for pioneering privacy-preserving smart contracts that allow secure counterparties and business logic without sacrificing transparency or composability.

These advancements represent a leap for institutions balancing compliance mandates with the need for secure, programmable finance. “Privacy solutions are no longer theoretical — they're live and scaling in production,” Ethereum Foundation notes.Tokenization, Stablecoins, and Real-World Assets

Ethereum said it dominates the real-world asset (RWA) and stablecoin sectors, hosting over 75% of all tokenized RWAs and 60% of global stablecoin supply.

Institutions can now explore market infrastructure at institutions.ethereum.org/rwas-stablecoins, where tokenized treasuries and onchain credit platforms are reshaping capital markets.

From BlackRock and Securitize to Ondo Finance, Centrifuge, and Maple, major financial firms are deploying tokenized instruments that offer 24/7 settlement, transparency, and composability.

Stablecoins issued by Tether, Circle, PayPal, and Ethena Labs are also highlighted for their role in accelerating global onchain payments.Restaking, Layer-2s, and the Composable Financial Stack

The foundation said Ethereum's Layer-2 networks — including Linea, Starknet, Base, Scroll, and Unichain — now secure over $50 billion in value, offering the throughput and cost efficiency required for global-scale applications.

At the same time, staking and restaking protocols like Ether.fi, EigenLayer, Lido, RocketPool, and Symbiotic are enabling institutions to participate in Ethereum's security model while earning yield on staked ETH.

With 67% of DeFi's total value locked (TVL) and the deepest liquidity across any blockchain, Ethereum continues to lead as the settlement layer for institutional-grade decentralized finance.

The new Ethereum for Institutions portal is a living resource, continuously updated to feature ecosystem builders, regulatory innovations, and enterprise-grade integrations. 

Institutions can engage directly with the Ethereum Foundation's Enterprise Acceleration team via — joining a growing global movement to bring finance fully onchain.

Is Tether actually undermining the promise of Bitcoin through the practices its use is normalizing in the Bitcoin economy?

When the GENIUS Act became law on 18 July 2025, the crypto industry celebrated it as the end of regulatory uncertainty. The Act requires licensed stablecoin issuers to hold liquid reserves such as cash and U.S. Treasuries, publish monthly disclosures, and submit to federal or state supervision. At the same time, Congress shelved a federal central bank digital currency.

Supporters saw this as a victory for innovation, but critics called it a quiet federalization of private money. The United States no longer needs to issue its own digital dollar. It has simply delegated that function to private issuers operating under oversight. For Bitcoiners, whose movement was built around sound, decentralised money, that shift should have triggered alarm bells.

The biggest beneficiary of this new framework is Tether Limited, whose USDT token dominates global stablecoin supply. In its Q2 2025 attestation, Tether Limited reported a net profit of approximately $4.9 billion and total exposure to U.S. Treasuries exceeding $127 billion. Treasury bills and reverse repo holdings. Its balance sheet showed nearly $120 billion in Treasuries, making Tether one of the world's largest private holders of U.S. government debt.

Custody of those assets rests with Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street firm led by Howard Lutnick. Lutnick has publicly defended the soundness of Tether's reserves, confirming Cantor's role as custodian while emphasizing that it holds no equity stake in the company. 

The connection is now more delicate: Lutnick was later nominated for a senior White House economic position overseeing elements of trade and financial regulation. That appointment places a federal policymaker in proximity to one of the largest private holders of U.S. government debt and the key custodian for a company whose dollar backed token depends on the U.S. Treasuries for profit. The optics are uncomfortable. What began as a business relationship now blurs into a potential conflict of interest, embedding Tether in Wall Street's plumbing and within the political apparatus that governs it.

In effect, Tether has become a private central bank: issuing dollar liabilities, earning seigniorage, and distributing liquidity through the crypto economy, all while piggy backing on U.S. sovereign debt. Its profit per employee rivals the most profitable institutions in finance.

Stablecoins promise fast, borderless payments; however, their architecture depends on compliance. Since December 2023, Tether has maintained a proactive wallet-freezing policy for addresses sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. The company says it has frozen billions in tokens linked to illicit activity and now works directly with the U.S. Secret Service and FBI. 

This is not inherently sinister, it's what regulators demand, but it means enforcement now operates within the money itself. The control lever no longer sits solely with banks, it resides in the smart contract of the token issuer.

As Tether expands USDT onto Bitcoin adjacent networks such as Liquid and the RGB protocol, the same compliance logic will travel with it. The more Bitcoin infrastructure hosts these tokens, the more identity, KYC, and whitelisting mechanisms will appear around Bitcoin wallets and payment channels. The network that once prided itself on neutrality risks becoming a conduit for surveillance grade rails.

The GENIUS Act's passage also realigned the politics of digital currency. Its sponsors framed it as an anti-CBDC measure, arguing that private stablecoins preserve choice and limit government power. However, the result is nearly identical to what a central bank digital currency would achieve: programmable, trackable dollars, only administered by corporations instead of the Fed. Some analysts have called this the birth of a “CBDC by proxy.”

The policy also meshes neatly with fiscal priorities. Every USDT minted represents demand for short dated Treasuries, effectively financing the same government that stablecoin advocates claim to bypass. Tether's profits flow from the interest rate paid on those securities, an invisible subsidy from public debt to private issuers.

By situating stablecoins within the traditional bond market, the U.S. has created a dollar based feedback loop: bitcoin demand supports Treasury issuance, and Treasury yields support bitcoin profitability. In that loop, decentralization is incidental.

Within the Bitcoin community, opposition to altcoins remains strong, but sponsorships, event partnerships, and integrations show how quickly principle bends toward funding. Bitcoin conferences increasingly feature Tether executives and supporters on stage, often framed as “bridges” to adoption. 

A familiar refrain has emerged among those bitcoiners who take money from Tether,  ‘if stablecoins are inevitable, it's better they be run by Bitcoiners'. Another popular defence is that Tether provides a lifeline for people in countries locked out of the dollar system or suffering from hyperinflation and collapsing economies. This is an emotionally persuasive narrative.  These convenient mantras turn compromise into virtue, allowing Bitcoiners to take sponsorships and funding from the same system they once swore to oppose.

That logic may offer comfort to some, but erodes clarity. USDT on Bitcoin does not make Bitcoin more sovereign; it makes the dollar more omnipresent. When Bitcoin developers or advocates align with Tether for sponsorship or exposure, they lend moral legitimacy to a system that thrives on fiat's dominance. The irony is that Bitcoin's fiercest defenders are now helping entrench the very structure it was built to escape.

Tether's scale gives it power in markets and in messaging. With billions in annual profits and deep links to Wall Street custodians, it can sponsor conferences, fund research, and influence narratives across the digital asset world. Its executives appear frequently at policy forums to present stablecoins as allies of innovation and freedom. Each appearance helps normalise the idea that regulated, dollar denominated tokens represent progress for Bitcoin.

But the money tells a different story. Each stablecoin transaction that settles in USDT extends the dollar system's reach and perpetuates the weaponization of money. Every layer of compliance embeds surveillance deeper into the blockchain economy. And every Bitcoiner who accepts that trade off helps build a network where decentralization endures mostly as branding.

Bitcoin doesn't need a conspiracy against it; it only needs its followers to forget what made it different. The GENIUS Act, the rise of Tether, and the regulatory preference for private rails all point to a future where digital cash exists, but never without permission. The Trojan horse is not Tether, it's the belief that working with it preserves freedom.

In the end, too many Bitcoiners remain exactly where Tether wants them, still tethered to the system they are trying to escape.

Key Takeaways

Three altcoins just got the Binance axe, and the market's reaction couldn't be more dramatic.

Kadena (KDA) and Perpetual Protocol (PERP) experienced a significant decline, losing a substantial portion of their value within hours.

Flamingo (FLM) surprised everyone, swinging upward in a show of short-term strength.

What's behind this sudden split? Is FLM's rebound a fluke, or not? Let's evaluate each token.

Binance delists altcoins that consistently exhibit low trading volume, poor liquidity, and insufficient project development, as these assets no longer meet the exchange's quality standards.

In some cases, it delists assets due to regulatory or security risks, such as non-compliance and potential fraud, to protect user funds and maintain platform integrity.

Earlier today, Binance announced plans  to delist Kadena (KDA), with the move set to take effect on November 12.

The decision, while significant, may not come as a surprise to market observers.

Last week, the Kadena team confirmed its exit from the project, a revelation that triggered a sell-off and sent KDA's price tumbling.

Following Binance's delisting notice, Kadena's market value dropped another 25% today.

Interestingly, on the same day, Gate, another exchange, noted that it will continue to support  the project.

From a technical perspective, the daily chart shows that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed a bearish crossover.

With no demand in sight, KDA's price might reach a new all-time low below $0.045.

However, this trend might reverse if many other exchanges drum up support for Kadena. In that scenario, the altcoin might rise toward $0.20.

PERP, native to the decentralized perpetual futures DEX, Perpetual Protocol, was also one of the altcoins Binance delisted.

Following the recent development, PERP's price has declined by 14%. Although the altcoin remains at 76% of its record low, which reached 19 days ago, the technical structure still leans bearish.

On the daily chart, PERP continues to trade within a descending channel, indicating persistent downward pressure.

Meanwhile, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) has slipped into the negative region, confirming rising bearish momentum.

If this trend persists, PERP could fall below the channel's lower boundary, potentially declining toward $0.12.

However, if buying momentum returns and the price breaks above near-term resistance, this bearish outlook may be invalidated, opening the door for a rebound toward $0.28.

The last on Binance's delisting list is FLM, the native token of the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Flamingo.

Interestingly, instead of plunging, FLM's price surged by 13.65% following the announcement, climbing to $0.023.

However, such rebounds after delisting news often carry significant risk.

On the daily chart, CCN's analysis shows that FLM has formed a bearish divergence, a warning signal that the rally may not be sustainable.

This divergence emerged as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) turned negative, despite a bullish price movement.

Additionally, the red line of the Supertrend indicator remains above Flamingo's price, reinforcing the bearish bias.

If sustained, downside pressure could return once the short-term euphoria fades. As such, FLM's price could slide to $0.013.

However, a surge in demand for the token could invalidate this bias. In that case, FLM's price might surge to $0.027.

The former president of FTX US, Brett Harrison, is back with plans to bring a key force behind crypto market volatility to the more staid world of stocks and commodities trading: perpetual futures contracts.

While crypto venues regularly deal in these non-expiring contracts for digital assets, Harrison's software startup Architect Financial Technologies plans to offer access for foreign currencies, interest rates, single stocks, stock indexes, metals, energy, and other commodities. The venture got approval to operate its new venue out of a regulated entity with the Bermuda Monetary Authority, according to Harrison.

This may rank among the biggest missed opportunities to generate wealth in the history of Bitcoin. And it left in its wake a trail of corruption, revenge and extortion.



The strange story began a decade ago in the foothills of the Caucasus mountains in the country of Georgia. The man who missed out on what could now be a $21 billion fortune is Georgia's reclusive leader. He has since resorted to blunt force and the vast resources of a nation state to obtain what he failed to get when he declined a credible offer to mine Bitcoin in the early years of the cryptocurrency's existence.



I first heard elements of this story this summer, from an acquaintance in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. He is preternaturally connected and has a talent for recounting real-life novellas featuring improbable characters in various parts of the world.



I have learned over the years that his stories tend to be true more often than not, so when I heard this one, I wanted to know more, thinking I'd spend a week on it and maybe write something. Instead, I spent months burrowing deeper into a geopolitical crypto rabbithole that keeps furnishing stranger-than-fiction plot twists.



I wrote the first story for the New York Times earlier this month, detailing how the Georgian leader in question, Bidzina Ivanishvili, went after his former financial advisor with pliant courts, intelligence agents, an international abduction and a jailhouse beating in an ongoing and so far unsuccessful effort to gain control of the imprisoned advisor's Bitcoin holdings.



What follows below is the previously untold story of the true extent of Ivanishvili's Bitcoin miss and his attempts to claw back at least some of the cryptocurrency in ways that resemble a shakedown. It can be read independently of the New York Times story.



But first, let's go back to a Georgia of a decade ago. The post-Soviet republic had been known outside of its borders largely for its spectacular food and an ancient winemaking tradition, of which it is endlessly proud. Then-President Mikheil Saakashvili who led Georgia for a decade until 2012 was charismatic, young and a little crazy, and he rid Georgia of entrenched corruption, opened it up to international investment and allied it with the West, drifting away from Moscow's orbit. That record was marred by Saakashvili's own eventual slide toward abuse of power.



Enter Ivanishvili, who succeeded Saakashvili and later had his predecessor locked up on politically-motivated charges. Ivanishvili held office only briefly, preferring instead to steer Georgia from outside of the political hierarchy. Much of the coverage of his ongoing shadow rule has focused on his efforts to put Georgia back under Russian influence and roll back core democratic freedoms.



What has remained hidden from public view, until he launched an extra-judicial campaign to punish his former financial advisor and claw back nearly $1 billion in what he sees as his “stolen” bitcoin, are his misadventures in the crypto world.



In 2014, a crypto mining startup called Bitfury set up a data center in Georgia. Co-founded by a Latvian-born computer scientist, Bitfury employed a senior Georgian executive who suggested that the company should take advantage of his country's business-friendly laws and unusually low electricity rates, the single biggest operating cost in crypto mining.



Back then, Bitfury was facing a conundrum peculiar to crypto pioneers: it was bitcoin-rich but fiat-poor. The young company was mining so much bitcoin that it was already profitable on paper but it was reluctant to sell bitcoin to raise cash necessary for expanding the business. Its executives believed the price of bitcoin would keep rising and the cryptocurrency would mature into a global store of value. But it was a belief ahead of its time and many traditional investors were deeply skeptical of bitcoin's potential and wary of betting on companies whose primary business model relied on accumulating an untested asset. So Bitfury had to get creative about fund-raising: among other tactics, the company began renting out mining capacity to select investors willing to take the long view. It was a digital version of leasing a small plot of farmland for a year, growing tomatoes on it, and keeping the harvest at the end of the lease.



Georgia is a small country — and Ivanishvili looms large over it. Bitfury representatives pitched to him an intriguing idea: buy $50 million worth of Bitfury's mining computers' processing time and keep the Bitcoin these computers generate. Three people familiar with the episode described it to me in some detail. According to one of them, the pitch took place in Ivanishvili's residence on a hill overlooking Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. Visible from many points in the city stretching below, the house is a funky, sprawling jumble of glass and steel designed by a Japanese architect.



Although his estimated net worth has declined significantly compared to prior years, Ivanishvili is still a wealthy man. According to Forbes, he's currently worth $2.7 billion. He made his money in Russia, beginning in the chaotic 1990s with imports of electronics and continuing with investments in banking, conventional mining and real estate. He sold most of his Russian assets before entering Georgian politics.



He used to go by Boris back in his Russian days, and though no evidence emerged to back it up, his detractors have mused that he's a Manchurian candidate of sorts, cultivated by Russian intelligence to bring the rebellious Caucasus nation back under Moscow's control. Ivanishvili has always denied this, and it is just as likely that his background and worldview simply align naturally with Russia. But it is not a worldview shared by most of his compatriots. Georgians generally support integration with the European Union and despise Vladimir Putin for having invaded Georgia in 2008 and hived off parts of its territory, which Russian troops continue to occupy.



Ivanishvili is known for his extravagant hobbies and tastes. He had his people uproot rare trees all over Georgia and re-plant them in a special park devoted to his fascination with giant trees, a project that likely cost him millions of dollars. “Since 2016, Georgians have been observing the surreal spectacle of some of the nation's most impressive trees departing their longtime homes in forests and gardens and traveling by barge to a park on the Black Sea coast,” Eurasianet wrote in 2020.



If Ivanishvili's rejected $50 million Bitcoin play sounds too big to be realistic, please consider that he reportedly dropped $96 million at Sotheby's on a single Picasso painting, winning a bidding frenzy that started at $50 million. In 2006, it was the second-highest price ever paid at auction for a single painting. For years, a replica of the painting was said to hang on the wall of his James Bond-style Tbilisi mansion, the same place where Ivanishvili one day considered the merits of another expensive purchase: a trove of Bitcoin.



In 2015, when he was studying the Bitcoin proposal, his fiat fortune suddenly seemed to be at risk. A rogue banker at Credit Suisse, where some of his wealth had been parked, was submitting doctored investment reports and concealing losses, a long-running fraud that cost Ivanishvili nearly $1 billion. With help from the same advisor whom he later jailed in the Bitcoin dispute, Ivanishvili eventually succeeded in winning legal judgments against the bank. But he has had trouble collecting on the damages awards in part because he's now under U.S. financial sanctions for undermining democracy. The wealth manager who committed the fraud served time in prison and killed himself in 2020.



So in 2015, when the full extent of the fraud was just starting to emerge, perhaps it wasn't a good time for Ivanishvili to entertain the idea of literally sinking $50 million into a stack of computers submerged in a cooling liquid with a vague promise of producing digital tokens holding little discernible intrinsic value. One could also conjecture that having just been swindled by one money manager, Ivanishvili was suspicious of others offering to safeguard and multiply his money.



At the time, Bitcoin was still a niche and novel financial product with a median price of around $272 in 2015, compared to $115,000 today. It attracted true believers but also had many critics who remained skeptical of the long-term value potential of Bitcoin, given the currency's volatility.



In Georgia back then, one of the biggest Bitcoin boosters was George Bachiashvili, the same financial advisor who would later fall out spectacularly with Ivanishvili. Just 30 years old at the time and armed with an MBA degree, he embraced the promise of the blockchain and grasped the often arcane concepts and use cases underpinning it, according to people who knew him at the time.



"Bitcoin is more of a medium of exchange, something that has a utility that can be applied. That's why we don't look at it as a commodity,” Bachiashvili, whose private-equity firm was an early investor in Bitfury, told CoinDesk in 2014. “We look at it as a medium of exchange and that it will be used for money and signing transactions and proof of ownership and property."



Bachiashvili tried to get others as interested in the emerging crypto ecosystem as he was.



As part of that effort, he helped Bitfury pitch a Bitcoin investment to Ivanishvili himself. Ensconced in his glass house with replicas of fine art decorating the walls (the originals were kept in a vault in London), Ivanishvili quickly rejected the $50 million mining proposal, without delving into any of the technical details, according to the three people familiar with the situation. “I don't remember that anyone discussed any details on this as (Ivanishvili) did not express any interest to invest and any discussions stopped after this,” one of the people said.



Timur Tskivadze, a lawyer for Ivanishvili, says he has no information about this episode and sees no need to comment on it because it has “nothing to do” with the subsequent legal dispute that eventually landed Bachiashvili in jail.



As a co-founder of two banks — one in Russia and one in Georgia — Ivanishvili was much more comfortable in the world of fiat currencies and traditional lending.



So when Bachiashvili and Bitfury failed to interest the Georgian leader in bitcoin, Bachiashvili approached Ivanishvili's Georgian bank for a loan to help him make a personal investment in bitcoin mining — similar to the one Ivanishvili had rejected for himself. The Georgian leader agreed and authorized a high-interest credit. Using the loan and personal funds, Bachiashvili rented $6.3 million worth of mining capacity from Bitfury and generated 24,000 Bitcoin a year later.



He paid back the loan with $600,000 interest, and the matter appeared closed. However, nearly a decade later, Ivanishvili accused the former advisor of stealing the bitcoin from him. Ivanishvili's argument: the loan entitled him to a share of the mined Bitcoin. In May, Bachiashvili, who had escaped from Georgia, was snatched in a parking lot of an Abu Dhabi hotel, blindfolded and sent by private jet back to Tbilisi to serve an 11-year prison sentence, on dubious charges of theft and money laundering. He was beaten in jail.



It is possible to imagine that the Georgian leader, in his quest to punish the former advisor and gain access to his crypto wallets, was driven at least in part by the enormity of his own Bitcoin miss. Through his lawyer, Ivanishvili denied ordering the kidnapping, the jailing or the beating of Bachiashvili.



Had Ivanishvili taken the $50 million deal back in 2015 — and assuming his mining contract had followed the same ratio of invested capital to mined Bitcoin as Bachiashvili's $6.3 million rental — the Georgian leader could have become one of the biggest individual Bitcoin holders in the world, a “whale” controlling some 190,000 Bitcoin. At current prices, his hypothetical crypto wealth would have climbed above $21 billion, dwarfing his known existing fortune. The course of Georgia might have been different too, though it is hard to assess whether a much wealthier Ivanishvili would have just enjoyed life and embraced even more extravagant pursuits–or deployed his new crypto fortune to amp up his efforts to remake the country in negative ways.



Satoshi Nakomoto, whose real identity remains a mystery, created Bitcoin after the 2008 financial crisis, thinking a decentralized digital currency would provide a safer alternative to the badly shaken traditional banking system. To battle inflation and forestall monetary manipulation, Nakamoto limited the total supply of bitcoin to 21 million tokens, of which about 19.9 million has already been mined.



When Bitfury set up its mining operation in Georgia over a decade ago, the pace of new bitcoin generation was much faster than it is today reflecting the cryptocurrency's deliberately staggered deflationary structure under which the size of the reward for validating blockchain transactions is cut in half roughly every four years.



For those brave or crazy enough to believe in Bitcoin in those early years, mining presented a straight path to wealth generation. Back then, purchasing Bitcoin on the secondary market wasn't as easy as it is today because exchanges were rudimentary, unregulated, prone to hacks and suffering from liquidity problems.



Given Bitcoin's current price, Ivanishvili appears interested in obtaining the cryptocurrency by any means necessary. The Georgian leader's sudden interest in his former advisor's Bitcoin stash coincides in time with the severe drop of his own estimated net worth.



Global billionaire trackers at Bloomberg and Forbes have drastically revised down Ivanishvili's wealth estimates this year — by $2 to $3 billion — and Bloomberg even removed him from its marquee ledger of the world's 500 richest people. There's no single reason for this estimated decline, but U.S. financial sanctions and continuing Credit Suisse difficulties are likely to have played a role.



Before his former advisor Bachiashvili went on trial in Tbilisi, Ivanishvili's lawyer sent a proposal to his counterpart on Bachiashvili's defense team. It is a bizarre document that puts a legalistic veneer on an intimidation attempt.



Delivered casually via Whatsapp, the document said Ivanishvili was prepared to accept 60% of what he claimed was his stolen Bitcoin with the implicit understanding that criminal charges would be dropped should Bachiashvili accept the deal.



Ivanishvili added a threat: for each month of inaction by Bachiashvili the amount of his crypto debt to the Georgian leader would be increased by 5%. And by the time the court ruled against Bashiashvili — the Whatsapp document left little doubt that an acquittal was unlikely — “the accused will lose the chance to receive any discounts” and would be liable for the 100% of the Bitcoin and would go to jail on top of that. Bachiashvili still retains significant Bitcoin holdings, though it is unclear how much is left from the original mining investment.



Ivanishvili's lawyer confirms he sent this proposal on his client's behalf and calls it “widespread practice” in criminal cases. Bachiashvili deemed it extortion and refused. As threatened, he was promptly convicted.



David Jandieri — one of Bachiashvili's lawyers who handles international aspects of the case — soon became the target of a smear campaign on a pro-Ivanishvili TV channel that called him a Western spy and a wannabe politician. He was also hauled in for questioning and threatened with criminal prosecution in connection with his defense of Bachiashvili.



Concerned for his physical safety, Jandieri has since fled Georgia by a complicated multi-country route, in a hurried manner not unlike his client's own escape from Tbilisi back in March. The runaway lawyer hit a nerve-wracking snag at Georgia's land border with Armenia where security personnel informed him that his passport was no longer valid. They took photos of him and called someone. And then they let him through. Jandieri no longer has access to his client, which may have been the whole point.



The ripples from the Bitcoin blowup continue spreading in the strangest of ways. The head of the Georgian security service who personally flew to Abu Dhabi to escort Bachiasvili on his forced return home abruptly resigned after just five months on the job, with no clear explanation.



While in jail, Bachiashvili says he was threatened by the prison warden who encouraged him to turn over his Bitcoin to Ivanishvili. After Bachiashvili refused, he was brutally beaten by another inmate. Georgian authorities later claimed Bachiasvili organized his own beating to make himself look better in international courts.



And the prison warden? He suddenly quit his job and was later found dead of a single gunshot wound in his garage. Georgian authorities said he likely killed himself.

Real-world asset (RWA) specialist Ondo Finance (Ondo) has expanded its tokenized securities platform to the BNB Chain BNB$1,108.62, bringing over a hundred U.S. stocks and ETFs to one of the most active blockchain networks.

The move opens access for BNB Chain's 3.4 million daily users to buy and sell tokenized shares of companies like Apple or Tesla, as well as popular ETFs, around the clock thorugh Ondo Global Markets.

These assets are aimed primarily at non-U.S. investors who want exposure to U.S. markets but may be blocked by geographic or regulatory barriers.

Tokenized stocks took off earlier this year as digital brokerages and crypto exchanges, including Robinhood, Kraken, Bybit, Gemini started offering rading equities onchain.

Ondo's expansion into BNB Chain brings it into closer competition with projects like Backed and Kraken's xStocks, which also offer tokenized financial assets on BNB. This step into BNB Chain deepens the tokenized stock market's reach into Asia and Latin America, where BNB has a strong user base.

The broader tokenized stock market has more than doubled since August to nearly $700 million currently, according to data from RWA.xyz. Since its launch in September, Ondo Global Markets has become one of the largest players in the space, with around $320 million in total value locked, per RWA.xyz.

CoinTracker Launches Crypto Broker Tax Compliance Suite, Empowering Brokers and Exchanges to Tackle New Reporting Requirements While Elevating User Trust

CoinTracker unveils new suite of enterprise-grade tax compliance tools and announces partnership with Coinbase

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CoinTracker, the leading provider of crypto tax compliance and accounting technology for enterprises and investors, today announces the launch of its Broker Tax Compliance Suite, a technology offering equipping crypto institutions to navigate regulatory complexity with precision and scale. At time of launch, CoinTracker's Broker Tax Compliance Suite has been selected by leading crypto exchange, Coinbase, to provide crypto tax compliance infrastructure.


CoinTracker's Broker Tax Compliance Suite is a complete, crypto-native tax reporting solution purpose built to meet the needs of crypto brokers and exchanges under new reporting regulations. Designed for the complexities of crypto markets, the tax reporting technology suite enables crypto brokers and exchanges to comply with new IRS 6045 regulations with accuracy and ease, while delivering a seamless user experience to customers.




The suite of tools equips digital asset brokers and exchanges to meet new regulations that came into force January 1, 2025, which require brokers to report certain crypto transactions to the IRS in 2026 using the 1099-DA forms. The technology suite enables brokers to meet all information reporting obligations by providing automated 1099-DA reporting covering all IRS and state requirements.




The suite of tools also includes a consumer tax center, enabling brokers and exchanges to offer embedded tax reporting functionality to their end users, helping to increase user loyalty and trust. By implementing CoinTracker's embedded tax technology, brokers can empower their crypto trader user base to meet their own personal tax reporting requirements and file personal returns accurately. The tool enables brokers to automatically fill critical gaps that end users will face when filing their crypto taxes, including accurate cost-basis reporting, which presents a complex data challenge.




Jon Lerner, CEO and Co-Founder of CoinTracker, commented: “The top concern for crypto brokers and exchanges today is how to stay compliant and deliver peace of mind to users in a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. Compliance isn't just about ticking boxes. It's about building trust through transparency, accuracy, and user experience. That's exactly what CoinTracker's Broker Tax Compliance solution was built to deliver. With our technology, brokers can turn compliance into a competitive advantage by simplifying complex reporting and elevating user trust. They can also solve the problem of working out the cost basis on transfers – an issue that we know is currently top of mind for institutions and crypto traders alike.”




At time of launch, leading crypto exchange, Coinbase, has selected CoinTracker to provide Broker Tax Compliance Tools, including automated 1099-DA reporting under new regulations affecting brokers, and embedded consumer tax reporting for its user base.




This launch marks the expansion of CoinTracker's Enterprise offering, which also includes a crypto subledger solution for businesses with crypto accounting needs. CoinTracker's Enterprise technology tools are built on the same trusted infrastructure that has powered CoinTracker's consumer tax reporting products since 2017, and processed billions of transactions across millions of users.

At Blockchain Life 2025, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov unveiled Cocoon, short for Confidential Compute Open Network, a decentralized infrastructure initiative combining blockchain, AI, and social media.

Durov said Cocoon will allow GPU owners to contribute computing power to the network and earn TON tokens in exchange, while developers access low-cost AI compute. The system is designed to ensure users can interact with AI features like summarization and message drafting without exposing private data to centralized providers.

Telegram itself will be the first major customer and largest promoter of the network, integrating Cocoon's capabilities into its mini-app and bot ecosystem. The project is scheduled to launch in November 2025, and applications are open to both hardware providers and developers.

Durov emphasized that Cocoon's transparent, market-driven design will make AI compute pricing competitive and censorship-resistant. He framed the initiative as part of Telegram's broader mission to protect user privacy and digital freedom amid growing centralization in global tech.

Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has sparked a fresh debate around central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and how they could reshape financial freedom.

It started when Schwartz shared his article “The War on Cash” on X. The post quickly drew attention, especially after a user asked what poses a bigger threat to freedom – the war on cash or CBDCs.

Here's what he had to say.

“It Depends on How They're Used”

Schwartz replied with an interesting perspective.

“If a CBDC creates more options for people who want to use it, that's good. If it becomes an excuse to hamper other options more consistent with individual freedom, that's bad.”

He added that CBDCs could actually support freedom in some cases, such as giving people access to a government-run banking option when private institutions block them. 

But he also admitted the market has largely moved on, noting it's harder for governments to discriminate secretly than for financial institutions to do so quietly.

In short, Schwartz believes the technology isn't the problem, but how it's used.

Ripple's Growing Role in the CBDC Push

Ripple has already worked with Palau, Bhutan, Montenegro, Georgia, and the U.K. on early digital currency pilots. These efforts helped improve the XRP Ledger (XRPL) so it could handle not just CBDCs, but also stablecoins and tokenized deposits.

That evolution led to RLUSD, Ripple's dollar-backed token launched on both XRPL and Ethereum. RLUSD's market cap is now close to $790 million, supported by partnerships with DBS Bank and Franklin Templeton.

The War on Cash: Why Is Schwartz Concerned?

In his essay, Schwartz argued that the “war on cash” has quietly eroded people's financial independence. Current regulations, he said, push individuals to rely on banks that can terminate accounts without clear reasons.

He compared it to being forced to eat only at approved restaurants – constantly monitored, with no choice to cook at home. 

“That is, effectively, what banks are forced to do today,” he wrote.

Public Pushback on CBDCs

While global regulators champion CBDCs, not everyone is convinced. 

On Reddit, there are repeated heated discussions that reflect growing public distrust. One user wrote that CBDCs could become “a financial disaster,” citing failed experiments in Finland, Kenya, and Nigeria.

Users voiced fears about privacy loss, government surveillance, and banks losing relevance as the central bank takes control. Others warned about the risk of hacking, economic instability, and job losses in traditional banking.

Will CBDCs bring efficiency and inclusion, or usher in an era of state-controlled finance where every transaction can be tracked and restricted? This is a trend to monitor.

FAQs

A CBDC, or Central Bank Digital Currency, is a digital form of a country's official currency, issued and regulated by its central bank, not a private financial institution.

CBDCs are not inherently a threat. The risk depends on their design; they can increase freedom by providing more options or decrease it if used to restrict access to cash and private payment methods.

Primary public concerns include the potential for loss of financial privacy, increased government surveillance of spending, and the risk of transaction control or censorship by authorities.

Yes, ideally they would coexist. A well-designed CBDC would serve as an additional payment option without hampering an individual's ability to use cash or other private financial services.

Blue Gold Limited plans to create a gold-backed digital currency, integrating mining and blockchain technology.

Blue Gold Limited, a next-generation gold development company, has announced its strategy to become a leading vertically integrated gold company by merging physical gold with digital innovation. The company plans to tokenize gold, creating a gold-backed currency for use as a global payment medium, which has not been seen since 1971. Blue Gold's operations will consist of two divisions: a Physical Division focused on mining gold and a Digital Division tasked with tokenizing it and developing a digital payment platform. The Physical Division will manage gold mining operations primarily from the UK and UAE, while the Digital Division will operate from the US, ensuring regulatory compliance and offering a secure platform for transactions. Through this innovative approach, Blue Gold aims to redefine gold ownership and trading in the 21st century.

Blue Gold's mission is to unlock gold's potential as a borderless payment medium through a gold-backed digital currency.

Blue Gold's physical mining division will operate primarily from the UK and the UAE, focusing on long-life gold mines.

Blue Gold plans to tokenize gold and develop a digital payment platform for global transactions using blockchain technology.

The dual-division model combines physical gold mining with digital innovation, enhancing operational efficiency and market reach.

The U.S. offers a favorable regulatory environment for blockchain and digital assets, beneficial for Blue Gold's operations.

  NEW YORK, NY, Oct.  29, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blue Gold Limited (Nasdaq: BGL) ("Blue Gold" or the “Company”), a next-generation gold development and technology company, sets out its vision, mission and strategy to become a market leading vertically integrated gold company. Blue Gold will seamlessly blend physical gold with digital innovation by tokenizing gold and aims to also give token holders the means to spend those tokens in real world situations globally.
 



   Mission-Driven Innovation: Mine, Tokenize & Transact
  



  Blue Gold's mission is to unlock gold's true potential as a borderless payment medium, introducing a gold backed currency for the first time since 1971.
 


  The Company is building a seamless value chain, which will include mining gold, vaulting and verifying it in state-of-the-art facilities, and tokenizing it into a blockchain-based digital currency. In parallel the Company is developing a digital payment platform to enable token holders to spend their gold to buy goods and services globally.
 


  “Blue Gold is aiming to create the first global gold-backed digital currency. It is a bold and audacious plan, but it is supported by significant macro trends that include the wider use of the blockchain to tokenize real world assets. Gold has always been a store of value, but in the past 50-years fiat currencies have become de linked to hard value, leading to significant devaluation over time. We want to return it to real-money, using the block chain,” said Andrew Cavaghan, Chief Executive Officer.
 



   Dual-Division Model: Physical + Digital
  




   Physical Division:
  
  The Company plans to run this division from the UK and the UAE. This division will be involved in the development and operation of long-life gold mines; as well as the acquisition of gold sourced from strategic partnerships.
  
  The Company continues to plan for the restart of the Bogoso and Prestea gold mine, and is actively considering other gold mining acquisition opportunities in Latin America, West Africa and beyond.  In the meantime, the new gold trading division will be established in the UAE to immediately start acquiring gold for tokenization.
 


  The UK has a long tradition of mining and gold trading and vaulting, and is host to the largest gold trading exchange in the world. The UAE is an emerging global hub for gold, benefiting from political neutrality, state-of-the-art vault infrastructure, and zero tax environment.
 



   Digital Division:
  
  The Company shall establish the headquarters for the Digital Division in the US.  It will be responsible for managing an independent trust which will own the gold, acquired by the Physical Division and then tokenize it.  The Digital Division will also be responsible for managing the outsourced storage and auditing of the gold, so that token holders can redeem their token for gold at any time. In addition, the division is building “Blue Gold One”: a universal, secure wallet that lets holders make instant payments, store, or transfer their gold-backed tokens, all on a regulated blockchain.
 


  The United States provides a cutting-edge regulatory environment for blockchain and digital asset innovation, with clear legal rights for gold ownership, strong consumer protection, and access to the world's largest pool of capital. By issuing the tokens in the US Blue Gold will be able to directly market these tokens to US citizens, giving them access to this opportunity.
 



   About Blue Gold Limited

Oops, something went wrong

BitMine Immersion Technologies has reportedly added 27,316 ETH, worth roughly $113 million, to its corporate treasury this week, according to blockchain data shared by Lookonchain via Arkham Intelligence.

Key Takeaways:

BitMine added 27,316 ETH worth $113 million, boosting its total Ethereum holdings to over 3.3 million ETH ($13.2B).

The firm is now the largest corporate holder of Ethereum and the second-largest crypto treasury after Michael Saylor's Strategy.

CEO Tom Lee sees Ethereum as a “neutral chain” poised for institutional adoption, while cautioning that Bitcoin remains vulnerable to major market swings.

The transfer allegedly came from custody platform BitGo, though the company has yet to confirm the transaction.

Earlier this week, BitMine announced its total Ethereum holdings surpassed 3.3 million ETH, valued at around $13.2 billion.

This solidifies BitMine's position as the largest Ethereum-holding corporation and the second-largest crypto treasury overall, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy.

Led by Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, BitMine has outlined an ambitious goal of accumulating 5% of Ethereum's total supply, positioning itself as a long-term backer of the blockchain's expanding financial ecosystem.

The firm counts heavyweight institutional supporters such as Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Bill Miller III, Digital Currency Group, Founders Fund, Galaxy Digital, Kraken, and Pantera Capital.

Lee has been vocal about Ethereum's potential, describing it as a “truly neutral chain” likely to win favor among Wall Street institutions and US policymakers.

At press time, Ethereum (ETH) has fallen 2.36% over the past 24 hours, trading around $4,000, according to The Block's market data.

Last week, Lee also warned that Bitcoin's volatility isn't gone, and it could still fall by as much as half its value.

His comments come amid rising optimism that Bitcoin's price swings have softened thanks to spot Bitcoin ETFs and increased institutional participation.

However, Lee cautioned that Bitcoin continues to move in tandem with traditional markets, and tends to amplify those moves.

“The stock market has more frequent 25% drawdowns,” he said. “So if the S&P is down 20%, Bitcoin could be down 40%.”

Lee added that while the broader economy has matured in recent years, Bitcoin's correlation with equities means sharp corrections are still likely.

As reported, Lee has reaffirmed his bullish stance on Ethereum (ETH), revealing a $1.5 billion purchase following last weekend's market crash.

Despite warning that digital asset treasuries (DATs) are trading below their net asset value (NAV), suggesting a potential bubble burst, Lee told Fortune he views the pullback as a long-term buying opportunity.

Lee's move was mirrored by BitMine Immersion Technologies, which accumulated 379,271 ETH worth roughly $1.5 billion across three major purchases this week, according to data from Arkham Intelligence.

The mining firm now holds over 3 million ETH, or 2.5% of the total supply, making it one of the largest corporate holders of Ether.

BitMine reportedly aims to control 5% of all ETH in circulation, positioning itself as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The online gambling world is highly competitive, with thousands of digital casinos vying for the patronage of a handful of players. To make themselves more appealing, operators are willing to meet the changing preferences of gamblers, including offering them the payment methods that they desire.

A new way to perform online transactions is becoming increasingly common: cryptocurrencies. A growing number of casino platforms are starting to adopt crypto transactions to attract tech-savvy players and speed up secure transactions.

More players are learning how BTC live casinos work, better understanding the benefits of gambling with Bitcoin and other cryptos. With anonymous payments, fast processing times, and low transaction fees, it seems clear why the iGaming industry is making the change to digital currencies.

Among those already gambling with crypto, 60% prefer to make Bitcoin payments, while 27% opt for Ethereum. Stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currencies and less volatile than traditional cryptocurrencies, are also becoming increasingly popular.

But what is driving this shift, for both operators and players?

Accepting crypto transactions holds many benefits for casino operators, which is why an increasing number are embracing this payment method.

Crypto transaction costs are lower than those from payment processors involved in traditional withdrawal and deposit methods, which reduces operating costs for the casinos. Crypto is also highly efficient, with almost instant transaction speeds. This means that deposits and withdrawals occur within a few minutes, removing payment friction. This is vital for high-frequency online casino operations.

Crypto payments can seamlessly cross borders. There is no need for currency conversions or lengthy processing delays, which makes the platform more appealing for players from across the world. This exposes the casino to players outside of its licensing region.

Blockchain-based security features and the irreversible nature of crypto transactions reduce fraud and chargebacks, which is a common struggle faced by casino operators offering traditional payment methods.

In the future, operators can use smart contracts where the terms of agreement are written in code and integrated directly into the casino website. This can help automate various processes, including loyalty rewards and payouts.

The shift to crypto is also fueled by the benefits it offers players.

Crypto allows instant deposits and withdrawals, allowing players to access funds and start playing immediately without waiting for processing to be completed. Crypto transactions are also more private than traditional payments, since there is no need to disclose personal information. It also prevents prosecution in areas where gambling is restricted or banned.

Blockchain technology offers unprecedented transparency and fairness. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, which ensures trust between operators and players.

The final benefit for players is global accessibility. Gamblers aren't limited to their local banking infrastructure because of crypto's borderless nature.

Quick Facts:

$XRP is one of the best performers among heavy-cap cryptos this week.

For context, $BTC has surged 5% over the past seven days, while $ETH is up 4.5%. Considering the previous weeks' bloodbath, the trend paints an optimistic picture for the market, but their gains pale in comparison to $XRP's 9.45%.

The cross-border remittance token has managed a steady climb for most of the week, briefly touching $2.69 before retracing slightly. Keeping up with the spot market's energy, the derivatives market has also perked up, as open interest (OI) crosses $4.5B.

Multiple factors indicate that $XRP's recent surge might be short-lived. It could be a while before it reclaims its all-time high of $3.65, since the rise in open interest could swing either way.

For instance, the OI-weighted funding rate has declined, revealing that confidence in $XRP will be fragile in the absence of a significant broader market shift. Short positions likely anticipate another test of the key support level at $2.18.

The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is now at 51, while the current price is just slightly below the 50-day exponential moving average of 2.6852, further indicating that the recent rally is slowing down.

That partly explains the renewed activity in the derivatives market, which dropped to $3.49B on October 19 – its lowest point since late April.

With the US and China set to discuss trade frictions and the Fed rate cut looking increasingly likely, $XRP could soon capitalize on the return of risk appetite and head for $3.

Despite the crypto market simmering in uncertainty since October 10, a new crypto infrastructure coin has been attracting steady investor traction. The Best Wallet Token presale is making its way toward $17M, defying broader market trends.

Backed by a non-custodial wallet that boasts hundreds of thousands of downloads on iOS and Android devices, it's clearly not just the token's low presale price that's drawing interest.

Companies like Strategy continue to buy the crypto dip, as the market is entering a promising phase supported by friendlier regulations.

While institutional giants can afford to buy $BTC and $XRP for a fortune, retail investors are playing a completely different game. For them, the smarter bets are emerging coins with much lower market caps.

Smart investors are exercising this strategy while curating their portfolios ahead of the next crypto super cycle, likely to begin in November. This reallocation is behind the growing interest in the Best Wallet Token presale, which powers the Best Wallet ecosystem.

The project is on a mission to capture 40% of the global crypto wallet market share by 2026. It's an ambitious target but not one that is far-fetched, considering the Best Wallet app is:

$BEST tokens play a key role in fueling this ecosystem, which looks beyond crypto storage and towards driving retail crypto adoption. For holders, it unlocks privileges like early access to vetted presales, lower fees, higher staking rewards, and voting rights.



Being anchored to a thriving ecosystem with a growing user base, the token is expected to take off following its upcoming launch, making the current presale deal too good to ignore.

But more importantly, organic demand could underpin the token's value during volatile periods.

For early investors who buy the token at $0.025865 in the current presale phase and grab the 79% staking APY, that leaves room for jaw-dropping returns.

➡️ Thinking of investing in $BEST? Take a look at our step-by-step guide to buying the Best Wallet Token before heading to the official presale website.

Being a presale, however, the price rises in stages, while the staking APY lowers as more holders join the staking pool. And the next price surge is just a day away.

So be sure to join the Best Wallet Token presale today to lock in the best deal.

As always, do your own research before investing in crypto. This is not financial advice.

 The Bank of Korea should make clear rules for stablecoin issuers, allowing banks and non-banks to issue the tokens, says Kaia DLT Foundation chair Dr. Sangmin Seo. 

The Bank of Korea's push for the banking sector to lead the rollout of won-denominated stablecoins lacks logic, says Dr. Sangmin Seo, the chair of the Kaia DLT Foundation.

In a report released on Monday, the central bank argued that banks are already subject to strict regulations, including capital, foreign exchange, and Anti-Money Laundering requirements, which could help minimize any risks associated with introducing stablecoins to the country.

At the same time, the BOK wants a policy consultative body jointly made up of currency, foreign exchange, and financial authorities to decide on issuer eligibility, volumes and other key considerations.

Seo told Cointelegraph that while the central banks' concerns about stablecoin risks are understandable, its argument for banks leading a rollout “seems to lack a logical foundation.”

Seo argued that a better solution would be to establish clear rules for stablecoin issuers that can “minimize monetary risks and foster innovation.”

He said it would also allow both banking and non-banking institutions that meet these criteria to “compete and demonstrate their strengths.”

In June, BOK deputy governor Ryoo Sangdai proposed that South Korean banks be the primary issuers of stablecoins in the country to ensure a safety net, before gradually expanding to other sectors.

The BOK also wants to ban interest payments on stablecoins, arguing that it could directly compete with bank deposits and disrupt the sector, and has instead pitched the commercialization of deposit tokens, digital tokens that represent deposits in a bank or financial institution. 

Seo said a total ban on stablecoin yield would be an excessive measure and could harm and limit adoption.

“While I agree that stablecoins themselves should not include any yield-bearing features, I believe it would be excessive to restrict the generation of additional yield through the use of stablecoins,” he said.

At least eight major South Korean banks announced plans in June to offer a stablecoin pegged to the South Korean won, with planned launches across late 2025 and early 2026.

Meanwhile, Naver Financial, the fintech arm of South Korean tech conglomerate Naver, is reportedly moving forward with a plan to acquire Dunamu, which operates the country's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, and plans to launch a Korean won-backed stablecoin project once the acquisition is complete.

The crypto industry in South Korea has benefited from a more favorable environment following the election of President Lee Jae-myung in June, who has since pushed forward with various crypto-related laws, including a bill to legalize stablecoins.

We previously identified an embryonic shift in the corticospinal motor neuronal transcriptome after spinal cord injury associated with successful axonal regeneration1. Exploiting this transcriptional regenerative ‘signature', here we used in silico screens to identify small molecules that generate similar shifts in the transcriptome, and identified thiorphan—a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor—as a lead candidate. In a new adult motor cortex neuronal in vitro screen2, thiorphan increased neurite outgrowth 1.8-fold (P < 0.001). We then infused thiorphan into the central nervous system beginning 2 weeks after severe C5 spinal cord contusions and, when combined with a neural stem cell graft, thiorphan elicited significant improvements in forelimb function (P < 0.005) and corticospinal regeneration (P < 0.05). Extending clinical relevance, thiorphan significantly increased neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neuronal cultures from a 56-year-old human. These findings represent a new path for drug discovery, starting from in silico screens to proof-of-concept in adult human brain cultures.

There are no effective therapies for promoting neural repair after spinal cord injury (SCI), which represents a disorder of great unmet medical need. We reported recently that the corticospinal projection—the most important motor system for voluntary movement in humans—undergoes regression to an embryonic transcriptional state after adult SCI in mice1; in this state, the corticospinal axon regenerates into a neural stem cell graft placed in the site of the injury.

Taking advantage of established bioinformatics approaches, in silico screens and medium-throughput model systems of adult motor cortex neuronal cultures2, we sought to identify drugs and small molecules that replicated the regenerative transcriptional state of the corticospinal neuron. First, we compared the injured and regenerating corticospinal transcriptome with a publicly available database of several thousand drugs and small molecules already tested in humans—the Connectivity Map3 (CMap). This in silico screen identified several compounds that mimicked, to varying degrees, the corticospinal regenerating transcriptome. We then tested these lead compounds in a newly developed in vitro screen in cultures of adult cortical motor neurons. A lead small molecule candidate, thiorphan (253 Da), known primarily as a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, exhibited the greatest efficacy in supporting total neurite outgrowth and longest neurite length in this medium-throughput screen. We then tested the ability of thiorphan to support axonal regeneration and functional recovery after severe, bilateral mid-cervical SCI in adult rats when delivered 2 weeks after SCI—a clinically relevant time point for intervention. Notably, thiorphan treatment combined with a neural progenitor cell (NPC) graft significantly improved functional recovery after SCI. Moreover, thiorphan administration significantly augmented corticospinal axon regeneration into stem cell grafts. Finally, pursuing the true translational potential of thiorphan, we tested its effects on primary cultures of adult cynomolgous monkey motor cortex and 56-year-old human cortex neurons: once again, thiorphan significantly increased neurite growth. Thus, a bioinformatics-driven approach combined with an in vitro screen, in vivo testing and primate in vitro confirmation represent a new pathway for drug discovery. Thiorphan previously underwent human testing for a different disease indication, enhancing its readiness for development as a therapy for SCI.

We adopted a five-step pipeline to identify candidates for enhancing neural repair with a streamlined path that could lead to human testing (Fig. 1a). Step 1 involves characterizing the transcriptomic state or ‘signature' of a cell type that exhibits a beneficial biological effect. In this case, we used the transcriptome of corticospinal motor neurons that are capable of regeneration after SCI. We reported previously that, within 2 weeks of SCI, the corticospinal neuron undergoes transient transcriptional reversion to an embryonic state—a state in which it is capable of regenerating1. These data are publicly available. In Step 2, we perform an in silico screen to compare the regenerating corticospinal transcriptome with shifts in the transcriptome generated by more than 1,300 small molecules or compounds in the Broad CMap (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/ConnectivityMap.html). Drugs and small molecules in CMap have been exposed to various cell lines in vitro, and effects of these compounds on the transcriptome of the cultured cells have been characterized3. Thus, we searched CMap for compounds that generated transcriptomic shifts that parallel the state of regenerating corticospinal neurons. In Step 3, we took the lead candidates from the in silico screen and applied them to a medium-throughput in vitro assay consisting of cultures of adult motor cortex neurons; this screen became available only recently2 and provides what could be the most useful in vitro system for predicting potential in vivo effects in the mature nervous system, because the screen consists of adult rather than embryonic or postnatal neurons. To date, in vitro cellular screens of the nervous system consisted of either embryonic or early postnatal neuronal cultures, which may not accurately reflect responses of adult central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Immortalized neural cell lines4 suffer from similar limitations. Although adult dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons can be cultured routinely, these cells exhibit fundamentally different transcriptomes before and after injury1,5,6 and, again, might not be accurate tools for predicting therapeutic benefits of candidate therapies for injured brain and spinal cord motor neurons. Induced pluripotent stem cells or neurons induced from other cell types also often exhibit early cellular markers7. Cultures of adult neurons therefore may represent the most optimal in vitro screen developed for clinical translation2. Step 4 consists of in vivo validation of the top drug arising from the in vitro screen in a model of SCI. Finally, Step 5 consists of validating candidate compounds in cultures of adult primate cortical neurons, including human adult cortex. This step follows rather than precedes in vivo testing because of the scarcity of the primate and human neuronal resource: normal human neurons in particular are available only occasionally from surgical specimens and in our case were obtained from an individual undergoing tumour resection through a cortical window, where pathology confirmed the cortical biopsy was normal tissue.

Tested in cultures of adult mouse primary cortical neurons for 5 days in vitro, three independent biological replicates were performed on separate days, each using neurons from four adult mice. For each condition, data from all neurons measured across replicates were combined to yield n = 200 neurons per condition. Each neuron was spatially separated and analysed as an independent observation. Total neurite outgrowth per cell (Tuj1 labelling) is shown for each condition. Median values: DMSO (82.9); thiorphan (90.7, 99.8, 132.4, 166.1); triflusal (74.3, 61.7, 94.5, 124.5); milrinone (78.9, 77.4, 68.5, 75.5); adiphenine (74.4, 44.5, 31.7, 3) (d). Maximum neurite length per cell is shown for each condition. Median values: DMSO (93.3); thiorphan (111.1, 105.4, 122.1, 128); triflusal (84.4, 85, 104.9, 114.3); milrinone (100.6, 81.7, 79, 78.6); adiphenine (87.4, 60, 30.6, 6.23) (e). Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t-test (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). Error bars ± s.e.m. (d,e). Scale bar, 25 μm (c).

Step 1 was accomplished in this study by using our previous data describing the transcriptome of the regenerating corticospinal neuron1, as referenced above.

In silico analysis directly followed the original methodology of Lamb et al.3, identifying several compounds that most closely matched the expression profile of the regenerating corticospinal system (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1a). A ‘connectivity score' with a value between +1 and −1 described the similarity between the corticospinal transcriptomic profile and an individual compound's transcriptomic profile, where +1 was most similar and −1 was least similar to the corticospinal dataset (Fig. 1b). We further calculated a ‘reliability score' for each compound that takes into account the connectivity score, P value, false detection rate (FDR), ‘instance count' (number of experiments that include the compound), non-null score (the ratio of experiments that have a consistent score based on most experiments) and ‘specificity score' derived from the distribution of enrichment scores for gene lists from MSigDB; see Methods for a more detailed description of the reliability score. The top compounds that met the criteria of highest enrichment, reliability and specificity scores were considered ‘hits' in this assay and included: quinostatin (highest enrichment score +0.91 ± 0.07), thiorphan (+0.86 ± 0.11), triflusal (+0.79 ± 0.13) and milrinone (+0.78 ± 0.18), whereas adiphenine was the most negatively correlated (−0.78 ± 0.18; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Biological annotation (Methods) indicated that quinostatin inhibits PI3 kinase; thiorphan is a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor; triflusal inhibits nuclear factor κB, phosphodiesterase and COX1, and milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Quinostatin was not available for purchase and attempts at synthesis did not yield adequate quality compound. Thiorphan has been characterized primarily as a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor targeting neprilysin8. It has also been linked to neuroprotective properties in models of perinatal excitotoxic brain lesions9 and diabetic retinopathy10, and has β-amyloid degrading properties11. Thiorphan, milrinone and triflusal were taken forward as positive candidates, and adiphenine was used as a negative control.

We assessed the lead candidate compounds in dissociated cultures of the adult (postnatal day 60) mouse motor cortex2. An average of 10,000 neurons per single motor cortex were obtained, and we quantified total neurite outgrowth and maximal neurite length per cell 5 days after exposure to the candidate compounds. Several drug doses were applied (Fig. 1d,e), including the predicted negative modifier of corticospinal growth, adiphenine. Significant overall differences in neurite outgrowth were present using various compounds (drug type × dose interaction generalized estimating equation for total neurite outgrowth, Wald chi-square = 60.67, P < 0.0001; drug type × dose interaction generalized estimating equation for total maximum neurite length, Wald chi-square = 227.78, P < 0.0001). Thiorphan stood out as most effective both in measures of total neurite outgrowth and neurite length: at a dose of 250 μM it increased total neurite outgrowth by 80% compared with controls (post hoc generalized estimating equation, Wald chi-square = 29.69, P < 0.001; Fig. 1d,e) and longest neurite length by 30% (post hoc generalized estimating equation, Wald chi-square = 12.62, P < 0.001; Fig. 1d,e). The effect of thiorphan was dose dependent, with peak effects occurring at doses between 100 μM and 250 μM. The effect of the next candidate drug for enhancing corticospinal regeneration, triflusal, was more modest, with an increase in neurite outgrowth of 30% at its peak dose of 250 μM with no significant change in longest neurite length; none of these changes reached statistical significance (Fig. 1e). The third candidate in rank order, milrinone, did not significantly influence either total neurite outgrowth or longest neurite length at any dose (Fig. 1d,e). Validating the in silico screening process, the predicted negative regulator of corticospinal growth, adiphenine, strongly and significantly reduced total neurite outgrowth and longest neurite length in a dose-dependent manner (post hoc generalized estimating equation, P < 0.001; Fig. 1c–e).

Given the success of thiorphan in demonstrating efficacy in the in vitro screen, it advanced to Step 4: in vivo testing in a clinically relevant model of SCI. Adult Fischer 344 rats underwent severe contusive bilateral cervical SCI at the C5 spinal cord segment; mid-cervical lesions are the most common levels of human injury12 (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). We then waited 2 weeks—a clinically relevant time to delay intervention to allow subject recovery from the acute effects of injury (Fig. 2a). Animals were then divided into one of four treatment groups: (1) lesion alone (n = 9), (2) thiorphan alone (n = 10), (3) diluent + NPC graft (n = 9) and (4) thiorphan + NPC graft (n = 9). We tested diluent + NPC grafts as a positive control in this lesion model because these cells support axonal regeneration into the lesion site, the formation of new neural relays across the injury site and partial functional recovery13,14. We also compared thiorphan alone with NPCs. The combination of thiorphan + NPCs aimed to determine whether effects of both treatments were additive, thereby representing a method of further augmenting recovery after severe cervical SCI. Thiorphan was infused continuously into the left motor cortex because it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. Infusions continued for 4 weeks starting 2 weeks after injury at a dose of 100 mM (0.25 μl h−1), based on extrapolation of in vitro dosing to in vivo dosing15. An in vivo neprilysin cleavage assay confirmed the bioactivity of intraparenchymal motor cortex infusions of thiorphan over 1, 2 and 4 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Spinal cord NPC grafts were obtained from Fischer 344 embryonic-day-14 (E14) spinal cords as reported previously16 and injected through the dura into the lesion cavity 2 weeks post SCI (Fig. 2b; Methods). Two weeks before euthanasia, the corticospinal projection was traced anterogradely using an AAV9-CAG–Ruby2sm_Flag.

Animals that received thiorphan and a substrate for axonal regeneration into the lesion site—an NPC graft—exhibit significant functional recovery over time compared with lesioned controls (P = 0.005, group × time interaction, Poisson generalized linear model). Treatment with thiorphan alone also trended towards significance (P = 0.14). The lesion model applied in this experiment is the most severe that we have tested, and NPC grafts also exhibited a trend towards better outcomes than lesioned controls but this did not reach statistical significance.

Twelve weeks after SCI, animals treated with thiorphan + NPC grafts exhibited a significant, twofold improvement in forelimb grasping success (number of pellets grasped and eaten) after severe mid-cervical SCI compared with lesioned controls (Poisson generalized linear model, Wald chi-square = 7.92, P = 0.005; Fig. 2c). Recipients of thiorphan alone or NPC grafts alone exhibited lesser degrees of forelimb recovery compared with lesioned controls that did not reach statistical significance (Poisson generalized linear model, Wald chi-square = 2.16, P = 0.14 comparing thiorphan with lesion alone, and Wald chi-square = 2.07, P = 0.15 comparing grafts-only with lesion alone; Fig. 2c). The accuracy of pellet retrieval (percentage of pellets grasped that are eaten) also improved significantly in animals that received thiorphan + NPC grafts (Gamma generalized linear model, Wald chi-square = 10.13, P = 0.001) compared with lesioned controls (60% accuracy versus 30% accuracy; Fig. 2d). Thus, as suggested by in silico and subsequent in vitro screens, thiorphan significantly improves functional outcomes when combined with neural stem cell grafts to sites of SCI by enhancing the potency of NPC grafting.

To examine anatomical mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of thiorphan infusion on functional outcomes, we assessed corticospinal axon regeneration into stem cell grafts occupying the lesion site. Previously, we have shown that corticospinal axons regenerate into NPC grafts placed into sites of SCI and form synapses. Further, grafted NPC neurons extend axons from the lesion site to host neurons below the lesion and form synapses; consequently, new neural relays are formed across the lesion that support functional improvement13,16,17,18,19. In the present experiment, thiorphan significantly increased corticospinal regeneration into grafts by 60% (P < 0.05; Fig. 3a,c,e) compared with individuals that received NPC grafts alone (Fig. 3b,d,e and Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). Thiorphan administration in the absence of NPC grafts could not promote corticospinal regeneration into the lesion cavity because there was no cellular substrate onto which injured corticospinal axons could extend. Thin plane confocal microscopy showed colocalization of corticospinal axon terminals with synaptophysin apposed onto grafted neurons, indicating putative synapse formation from regenerating host axons to grafted neurons (Fig. 3f). Nearly all grafted animals in this experiment exhibited complete graft filling of the lesion cavity (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). Cortical infusion of thiorphan over 4 weeks caused no damage or neuronal loss in the motor cortex (Supplementary Fig. 4c,d).

We also examined whether thiorphan treatment influenced corticospinal axonal sprouting above the lesion site: there were no significant differences in corticospinal axon density among the four animal groups (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Although thiorphan was administered into the motor cortex, we also examined whether there was a difference in the growth of serotonergic or sensory (calcitonin gene-related-peptide-labelled) axons into the graft; as expected, there was no difference between thiorphan + NPC graft and the diluent + NPC grafted groups (Supplementary Fig. 6a–f). We further examined whether thiorphan administration into the cortex influenced the host–graft glial border (glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity); it did not (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Finally, we examined whether thiorphan administration into the cortex affected graft differentiation: it did not (Supplementary Fig. 7d–k); as expected, neither did it affect graft-derived axon extension into the host (Supplementary Fig. 7l,m). Thus, beneficial effects of thiorphan administration were detectable on the corticospinal system to which it was targeted.

The final step in this process, Step 5, extended the clinical relevance of this work by determining whether thiorphan can also promote growth from adult primate motor cortex and human cortical neurons (Fig. 4a–c). This step is performed last because these samples—particularly normal human cortex samples—are highly valuable. Human participant approval was obtained for these procedures. Neurons were isolated from the monkey M1 motor cortex, dissociated and cultured, adapted from ref. 2, and treated with 100 μM thiorphan for 5 days in vitro (two replicates). These cultures are free of NPCs when assessed by markers such as Nestin and Sox2. Thiorphan treatment significantly increased total neurite outgrowth by 36% (P < 0.001) and maximum neurite length by 61% (P < 0.0001) compared with control conditions (Fig. 4a–c). We then proceeded to culture the human cortex: normal cortex from the middle temporal gyrus of a 56-year-old man was obtained from biopsy, the tissue was dissociated and neuronal cultures established (adapted from ref. 2; Supplementary Fig. 8). Treatment with 100 μM thiorphan for 5 days in vitro (Fig. 4d–f) resulted in a significant increase in total neurite outgrowth by 30.3% ± 7.3% (P < 0.0001) compared with control conditions. Thiorphan also exhibited a significant increase in longest neurite length by 23.0% ± 9.4% (P = 0.016) compared with controls. Thus, thiorphan retains biological activity when tested in monkey and human cortical cultures, exhibiting roughly 40% of the potency exhibited in rats in effects on total neurite outgrowth and 70% of the potency exhibited in rats in terms of longest neurite length.

Each point represents the total neurite length of one neuron. e, Thiorphan treatment of human cortical neurons also significantly increased the maximum neurite length per cell (**P < 0.01, two-tailed t-test). f, Representative images of 56-year-old human cortical neurons in culture labelled for Tuj1. g, RNA sequencing was performed on cultures of adult primary motor cortex from rhesus monkeys treated for 5 days with thiorphan or vehicle (DMSO). A total of 177 genes changed ±1.5-fold on a log2 scale. h, Gene ontology of these 177 genes demonstrates clear enrichment for developmental processes (Gene Ontology database24, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10536401). i, To identify in vivo mechanisms recruited by thiorphan treatment, rat brains were removed after 2 weeks of thiorphan infusion and compared with diluent-infused controls. Thiorphan treatment increased immunolabelling for both BDNF and phospho-AKT in the infused motor cortex, reflecting a shift to a state that is developmental and pro-regenerative. Scale bars, 20 μm (c,f). Scale bars, 25 μm, inset scale bars, 10 μm.

Thiorphan was identified as a potential candidate for improving axonal growth after CNS injury by virtue of its ability to shift the cellular transcriptome to an embryonic, pro-growth state. To assess whether this mechanism was actually recruited in neuronal target cells, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of macaque M1 motor cortex cells exposed to thiorphan for 5 days in vitro compared with control cultures lacking thiorphan exposure (Fig. 4g). Because we had one sample of thiorphan-treated and one sample of vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO))-treated cells, we compared mRNA species changing ± 1.5 log2 units between the two samples: 177 genes reached this cut-off threshold (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Gene ontology of these 177 genes identified 29 biological processes and remarkably, 16 of these 29 were related to development, including neuron development, nervous system development, and synapse assembly (Fig. 4h). To further examine mechanisms associated with thiorphan delivery, we infused it intracortically for two weeks in rats and performed immunolabelling of the infused region compared with animals that received vehicle infusions: thiorphan administration resulted in increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Fig. 4i) and phospho-AKT (Fig. 4i) in the infused region, paralleling higher levels of these molecules observed both in neural development and successful regeneration. These findings support a mechanistic framework in which thiorphan modifies the developmental, metabolic and signalling state of cells to impact neuronal regeneration, consistent with its initial identification on the basis of its ability to replicate the effects of SCI in driving neurons developmentally backward towards a state of embryonic development.

We report the identification of a new and effective drug treatment for SCI arising from an analytical pipeline that targets the regenerative transcriptome of the adult corticospinal motor system. Notably, thiorphan was selected from a database of compounds that have already been tested in human clinical trials, facilitating potential clinical translation. Direct thiorphan infusion into the motor cortex was safe and effective in this experiment, and effects on neurite outgrowth were confirmed in adult rhesus monkey and human cortical cultures. Future studies will determine whether thiorphan exhibits efficacy after intrathecal administration, or after systemic administration because there is transient breakdown of the blood–brain barrier after SCI20. In addition, newly synthesized derivatives of thiorphan with improved blood–brain barrier permeability can be developed to simplify administration for clinical trials.

A previous study used in silico screens to identify compounds improving neural repair after peripheral nerve injury, based on dissection of whole DRG including neurons and support cells. The compound ambroxol was identified, which exhibited relatively modest effects in improving peripheral and optic nerve regeneration and cortical sprouting in a model of stroke, without evidence of functional efficacy6,21. By contrast, the present study started with a transcriptional dataset obtained from a specific neuronal population that is critical for human voluntary movement after SCI—layer V corticospinal neurons—rather than a general neuronal and glial RNA-seq dataset. We then used a CMap enrichment method3 to more deeply probe the CMap dataset that led to the identification of thiorphan, triflusal and milrinone as the most likely potential mimics of the specific corticospinal regeneration transcriptome. We then used a new medium-throughput assay to test candidate drugs in the most faithful potential assay of adult brain neural injury examined to date: cultures of adult motor cortex neurons. Only thiorphan resulted in consistently significant and dose-dependent improvements in motor cortex neurite outgrowth. Other lead candidates (for example, triflusal, milrinone) did not increase neurite outgrowth, suggesting that a rigorous in vitro assay is essential to validate in silico targets, as in silico models may not fully capture the complexity of cellular responses. Subsequent in vivo testing of thiorphan yielded evidence of functional CNS recovery from this type of analytical pipeline. Moreover, thiorphan exhibited significant effects on neurite outgrowth of adult human neurons, supporting clinical translation. This platform can be applied broadly to other CNS disorders, potentially yielding several new candidate drugs to treat CNS injury and neurodegenerative disorders using compounds that have already been tested in humans for other indications and have yielded evidence of safety. A lack of safety results in the failure of up to one-half of human clinical trials22, and the current pipeline can de-risk new drug development considerably.

Thiorphan induced recovery of motor function when combined with a neural stem cell graft to a site of severe cervical SCI. This improvement occurred within 2 weeks—a timeframe in which host corticospinal axons have already regenerated into stem cell grafts1 and stem cell grafts have extended axons into the host cord below the lesion; indeed, stem cell implants extend axons rapidly into the host beginning 3 days after implantation16. Without a stem cell graft in the lesion site, there would be no cellular substrate onto which axons could regenerate into the lesion site with or without thiorphan administration. But in the presence of the stem cell substrate, thiorphan increased corticospinal axon regeneration into the lesion site by 60%. This presumably supported the formation of greater numbers of neural relays across the lesion site13,16,17,18,19 that, in turn, facilitated functional recovery. The lack of statistically significant recovery in our graft-alone group (P = 0.15) highlights the challenge of achieving forelimb functional restoration in this severe model. In previous studies, we used less severe lesion models and found that stem cells alone induced significant functional recovery. Yet in the present more severe lesion, the addition of thiorphan yielded significant and meaningful functional recovery.

Administration of thiorphan in vivo to rats with SCI resulted in elevated levels of BDNF and phospho-AKT in neurons, paralleling higher levels of these molecules observed during neural development. Confirmation that thiorphan actually induces complete reversion of corticospinal neurons to an embryonic transcriptional state1 would require RNA-seq studies after in vivo infusions, and these were not performed. RNA sequencing of adult motor cortex cultures from macaque monkeys following thiorphan exposure did indicate a development shift in transcriptional state. Nonetheless, the link between thiorphan treatment and transcriptional change is indirect.

A pipeline of advanced in silico analysis coupled with improved in vitro screens identify the drug thiorphan as a candidate for the treatment of SCI. This platform can be adopted across nervous system disease states to accelerate the development of new therapies for human neurological disorders.

Ion-channel activity reflects a combination of open probability and unitary conductance1. Many channels display subconductance states that modulate signalling strength2,3, yet the structural mechanisms governing conductance levels remain incompletely understood. Here we report that conductance levels are controlled by the bending patterns of pore-forming transmembrane helices in the heterotetrameric neuronal channel GluN1a-2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Our single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analyses demonstrate that an endogenous neurosteroid and synthetic positive allosteric modulator (PAM), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), binds to a juxtamembrane pocket in the GluN2B subunit and stabilizes the fully open-gate conformation, where GluN1a M3 and GluN2B M3′ pore-forming helices are bent to dilate the channel pore. By contrast, EU1622-240 binds to the same GluN2B juxtamembrane pocket and a distinct juxtamembrane pocket in GluN1a to stabilize a sub-open state whereby only the GluN2B M3′ helix is bent. Consistent with the varying extents of gate opening, the single-channel recordings predominantly show full-conductance and subconductance states in the presence of 24S-HC and EU1622-240, respectively. Another class of neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate, engages a similar GluN2B pocket, but two molecules bind simultaneously, revealing a diverse neurosteroid recognition pattern. Our study identifies that the juxtamembrane pockets are critical structural hubs for modulating conductance levels in NMDAR.

The white bar in the micrograph indicates 20 nm. b-c, Map quality assessment of non-active state (b) and pre-active state (c).

a, Single-particle cryo-EM analysis of the glycine, glutamate, and 24S-HC-bound GluN1a-2B NMDAR. In this dataset, the closed and open states were identified. Data processing was performed on sets of movies listed in Supplementary Table 2. The white bar in the micrograph indicates 20 nm. b-c, Map quality assessment of closed state (b) and open state (c).

a, Superposition of the PS (light orange) and 24S-HC (yellow) binding sites demonstrating distinct binding modes. At Site-1, the hydroxyl group at the tip of 24S-HC and the sulfate group of PS reside in a similar area surrounded by GluN2B pre-M1' and M1'. 24S-HC binds parallel to GluN2B M1' helix, while PS wedges into the GluN2B M2' and M3' helices. At Site-2, the ketone group of PS overlaps with the phospholipid acyl group (grey). b, Concentration-responses of 24S-HC in the presence of various concentrations of PS. For each PS concentration, EC50 values with 95% CI were 531 nM (([411 nM, 941 nM], 2 µM PS), 568 nM (([383 nM, 2.2 µM], 10 µM PS), 714 nM (([444 nM, 2.25 µM], 50 µM PS). The Hillslope was 1.19 for 2 µM, 1.14 for 10 µM, and 0.768 for 50 µM. Experiments were done with six or seven individual oocytes per PS concentration. Data for 0 μM PS condition were previously shown in Fig. 2d. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM.

Source Data

a, Superposition of the 24S-HC stabilized open (deep teal) and closed (grey) structures. Binding of 24S-HC at the GluN2B juxtamembrane pocket favours movement of GluN2B pre-M1' (dotted arrow). This pre-M1' movement is essential to accommodate the bending of the pore-forming GluN2B M3' helices. b, Conformational coupling of LBDs and TMDs in GluN1 (upper panel) and GluN2B (lower panel). Shown here are the superpositions of the closed (grey) and open (magenta and deep teal) states. The Cα atoms of the gating ring residues, right above the channel gate, for GluN1a (Ile664) and GluN2B (Gln662), are shown as spheres. Note the substantial positional shift of GluN2B Gln662 residues between open and closed states, contrasted with the minimal displacement of GluN1a Ile664 residues (dotted lines).

a, In the closed state, the channel is highly constricted at both VIVI-gate and the Asn-ring. b, In the sub-open state, the channel is dilated at the VIVI-gate, with partial dilation at the Asn-ring. Arrows on the model represent the kinked region of the GluN2B M3' helices. c, All-atom potential of mean force (PMF) calculation of the free energy for Na+ ions around the TMD region of the 24S-HC-bound fully open state. The wider pore radius at the Thr-ring in the fully open state (2.2 Å in the sub-open state, 3.0 Å in the fully open state) corresponds to a modest energy barrier (~ 1.7 kcal mol−1) that permits Na+ permeation without stable binding, whereas the Asn-ring displays favourable free energy consistent with its role as a secondary gate. PMF calculation of EU1622-240-bound GluN1a-2B was adapted from ref. 21.

a, Cross-section of the channel pore of the closed (left), sub-open (middle), and fully open (right) states of GluN1a-2B NMDAR. Water molecules are coloured in slate spheres overlaid with cryo-EM density in grey mesh. Key residues involved in the water network are shown. b, Local resolution of water density in the channel pore.

The structure of the PS-bound structures in the non-active and pre-active states viewed from the side (upper panels) and top (lower panels) of the TMDs. The pre-active state shows a greater distance between the GluN2B Gln662 residues compared to the non-active state due to the GluN1a-2B LBD dimer rotations (curved arrows). In both cases, the channel gate remains closed. The hydrophobic gate residues are shown as magenta (GluN1) and deep teal (GluN2B) spheres.

a, Single-particle cryo-EM analysis of glycine, glutamate, and EU1622-240-bound GluN1a-2B NMDAR. The most predominant conformation of this dataset was the sub-open state. Data processing was performed on sets of movies listed in Supplementary Table 2. The white bar in the micrograph indicates 20 nm. b, Map quality assessment of the sub-open state.

a, The representative current-voltage curves for GluN1-2B responses in the presence 100 μM glutamate and 30 μM glycine with either vehicle (left) or 24S-HC/EU1622-240 (right) in different calcium concentrations. b, The average reversal potentials for vehicle and 24S-HC/EU1622-240 were determined from current-voltage relationships in solutions with different concentrations of Ca2+. c, Mean ΔReversal potential (high Ca2+ minus low Ca2+). Statistical significance was assessed using a two-tailed t-test; the asterisk (*) indicates p = 0.0405, n.s., not significant. d, The average permeability ratio of Ca2+ to monovalent cations derived from a modified version of Lewis equation. Values are shown as mean ± S.E.M. Data are from independent measurements: vehicles (n = 6), 24S-HC (n = 13), EU1622-240 (n = 10). Statistical significance was assessed using a two-tailed t-test; the asterisk (*) indicates p = 0.0112, n.s., not significant.

Umbrella histogram and block analysis of (a) Cl- and (b) Na+. Umbrella sampling histograms show good window overlap along the reaction coordinate for both ions. Block analysis used 2-ns incremental increases in the data used for each per PMF calculation. Both systems converged to within thermal energy by the final block.

Supplementary Tables 1-4.

Conformational transitions between the closed state, sub-open state, and fully-open state of GluN1a-2B NMDAR. Global conformational changes are presented first, followed by zoomed-in views highlighting local rearrangements around the GluN1a M3 and GluN2B M3′ helices. GluN1a is coloured in magenta, and GluN2B in deep teal.

It won't catch any fish, but the discovery of as many as 20,000 silver coins and pieces of jewelry dates back to the early Middle Ages.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A Swedish fisherman searching for gooey, juicy worms to use as bait near his summer home near Stockholm instead struck something far more solid (and much less interesting to fish): a copper cauldron brimming with coins and jewelry. In total, the find comprised 13 pounds of early Middle Ages silver. 

“This is probably one of the largest silver treasures from the early Middle Ages that has been found in Sweden,” Sofia Andersson, antiquarian at the Stockholm County Administrative Board, said in a translated statement. “We do not yet know exactly how many coins there are, but I believe it could be upward of 20,000.”

The thousands of silver coins come mainly from the 12th century C.E., and some were embossed with the text “KANUTUS,” which is the name “Knut” in Latin. These coins were minted during Knut Eriksson's reign as Sweden's king near the end of the 12th century, from around 1173 to 1195. This period of the region's history was marked by conflict, and as a result—as Lin Annerbäck, director of Stockholm's Medieval Museum, told the Swedish-languageDagens Nyheter—the buried treasure may have been an attempt by a wealthy family to hide their valuables during a time of uncertainty. 

While the copper cauldron holding the treasure was “unfortunately not as well preserved” as the objects inside, Andersson said, those objects were in impressive condition. In addition to the coins, the discovery included silver rings, silver pendants, and pearls. 

Sifting through the many coins, the experts found some unusual pieces, including so-called bishop coins that would have been minted in Europe during the Middle Ages for specific bishops. Andersson said that the new treasure features several such coins, where a bishop is depicted holding a shepherd's crook in his right hand. 

Many of the coins feature uneven cut edges and raised designs on their faces—one particularly eye-catching example features a building, which is likely a church—and some are adorned with decorative dotted borders.

The Stockholm County Administrative Board continues to work with archaeologists to both analyze the treasure and investigate the location of the discovery to see if more buried treasures await them. They are currently keeping the exact site of the find a secret from the public to protect any potential remaining artifacts. 

Under Swedish law, anyone that discovers ancient silver (or gold, bronze, or another copper alloy, for that matter) must report it to the state. The state can then offer a payment to redeem the treasure. The board said that once investigations wrap, it will pass along information about the discovery to the National Heritage Board, and the board can then decide if it plans to pay compensation to the fisherman who found the hoard in order to redeem the silver. 

Our best guess? He walks away with far more than worms.

Identifying quantum phases of matters has quantum computers stumped and could represent a boundary to physical observation itself.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Quantum computing is often portrayed as the “superman” of the information age. Powered by entangled qubits in superposition, these high-tech machines can perform many calculations at once, drastically improving computing time when compared to classic supercomputers. Just last week, for instance, Google announced that the company's quantum computer could run algorithms some 13,000 times faster than its classical counterpart. 

But even Superman has his kryptonite—and the same can be said for quantum computers. 

Usually, these weaknesses play out on the engineering side of things. For one, quantum computers are extremely susceptible to decoherence and require robust error-correction to even be usable. This is the chief reason why today's quantum computers can barely inch past the 1,000-qubit mark, and current estimates suggest that a 20 million-qubit quantum computer would be needed to break classical cryptography. 

But a new study, recently uploaded to the preprint server arXiv, explores the computational limits of these machines—possibly probing the very limit of physical observation itself. In other words, there are some problems that even quantum computers can't solve, and it could be that these questions are fundamentally unsolvable. 

Although not all examples of determining a quantum phase are considered impossible, New Scientist reports that some questions would require quantum computers to operate for impossibly long times—potentially billions of trillions of years. 

“They're like a nightmare scenario that would be very bad if it appears,” Schuster tells New Scientist. “It probably doesn't appear, but we should understand it better.”

This work is a follow-up to Schuster's recent study, published earlier this year in the journal Science, which focused on improving randomness in quantum computers. Simulating randomness helps scientists understand real-world phenomena and design algorithms. 

The team was able to generate randomness with fewer operations than were previously necessary, which could indicate that it's possible to create quantum computers focused on cryptography much more easily that was expected. However, within this research, Schuster and his team probed a deeper question behind the work: What are the possible computational limits of these machines?

“Our results show that several fundamental physical properties—evolution time, phases of matter, and causal structure— are probably hard to learn through conventional quantum experiments,” the authors noted in a press statement at the time. “This raises profound questions about the nature of physical observation itself.”

Around the world, budgets for fundamental research — studies that seek primarily to advance knowledge for its own sake, without an expectation of a return on investment — are coming under pressure to an extent not seen for at least a generation.

In the United States, the principal funder of fundamental research, the National Science Foundation, has this year terminated some 1,600 grants worth a total of US$1 billion, a huge chunk of its $10 billion budget. And US President Donald Trump has proposed slashing its budget by 55%. Meanwhile, in the European Union, competition for funding will only worsen if the bloc implements a misguided plan to include defence and security research in its Horizon Europe programme, which has previously funded only civil research projects.

7 basic science discoveries that changed the world

China has bucked the trend. Last week, the nation's leadership announced that funding for fundamental research will increase in the country's next five-year plan, for 2026 to 2030. But elsewhere, as global conflict and pressure on public spending grows, we are hearing funders from Australia to the United Kingdom argue that research with a direct real-world impact — ideally economic — is preferable to fundamental research. In other words, basic research is nice to have, but dispensable in straitened circumstances.

A News Feature in Nature this week offers a reminder of why this approach is wrong-headed. It describes world-changing ‘blue skies' research that was mostly or entirely about acquiring knowledge, and only later found to have wider applications. In some cases, such discoveries have improved or saved millions of lives.

The polymerase chain reaction — the fundamental science behind the PCR tests used to identify bacteria and viruses that became a part of daily life during the COVID-19 pandemic — originated from work on bacteria found in hot springs by the microbiologists Hudson Freeze and Thomas Brock at Indiana University in Bloomington. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) emerged from the study of the fundamental physical properties of the atomic nucleus, and studies of venomous lizards played a key part in the development of drugs such as Ozempic that mimic the GLP-1 hormone. Flat-screen televisions have their roots in studies of chemicals that were isolated from carrots. The News Feature covers seven prominent examples, but there are numerous others.

Is academic research becoming too competitive?

Is academic research becoming too competitive?

It is true to say that, overall, today's research-funding environment bears little resemblance to that of decades gone by. In the twentieth century, many scientists performed research work alongside their teaching and administrative duties without needing to apply for the large grants that are now a staple of research systems, particularly in high-income countries. With greater public funding has come more scrutiny from policymakers and funders, and more desire to show some form of return on investment.

That is right and proper: no one wants to see taxpayers' monies being misspent. But world-changing discoveries often occur unexpectedly and are built on years — or decades — of fundamental research that expanded our knowledge of the world and how it works. And because private companies are constrained by the need to provide returns in the short term, they rarely provide the sort of consistent, long-term funding needed for the fundamental research that finds things we didn't know we were looking for.

All governments need to make choices about how best to spend public money. In the case of research, that necessitates working with the research community to adjust the balance of funding to different fields, cutting finance to some and increasing the pot for others. But before those decisions are made, two myths should be dispelled: that fundamental science is less important than other types of research, and that it has no long-term impact. The discoveries described in our News Feature are a timely and necessary reminder that funding decisions should not neglect the painstaking, long-term studies that have proved, time and time again, to be foundational to knowledge, progress and, ultimately, the betterment of society.

Climate change and human-made shelters have created survivable habitat for the cold-adapted mosquito species Culiseta annulata.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Out of all creatures on Earth, mosquitoes are arguably the least lovable. Every year, roughly 700,000 people die from mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue, yellow fewer, and malaria (which claims the lion's share of fatalities). 

However, mosquitoes have one big weakness—the cold. When temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius), mosquitoes become sluggish, which can impact feeding and reproduction. But as the world gradually warms due to climate change, these pesky parasites have finally been able to infiltrate one of the last places that remained mosquito-free.

Earlier this month, experts confirmed that Iceland has finally fallen prey to the blood-sucking menace of mosquitoes. In mid-October, insect enthusiast Björn Hjaltason reported the discovery of three specimens—two female and one male—of the mosquito species Culiseta annulata on the ‘Insects in Iceland' Facebook group. With mosquitoes finally found in Iceland, Antarctica is now the only mosquito-free landmass on Earth.

“At dusk on the evening of October 16th, I caught sight of a strange fly on a red wine ribbon,” said Hjaltason. Wine roping is a popular method of attracting insects (particularly moths). “I immediately suspected what was going on and quickly collected the fly. It was a female.”

Days later, the Natural Science Institute of Iceland confirmed the arrival of mosquitoes, which likely made their way to the land mass likely via freight shipping. Though previous mosquitos have hitched rides on airplanes to the Nordic island, this is the first established sighting of the creatures in the wild. 

Iceland's arctic conditions are one reason why mosquitoes have failed to secure a foothold on the island, but it isn't the only reason. The mosquito Aedes nigripes, for example, hibernates beneath ice as a pupa to survive winters in Greenland. But Icelandic winters are more variable, which can cause sudden rises in temperature that kickstart the mosquito life cycle without providing sufficient time to complete it. Culiseta annulata, however, opts to camp out in human-made structures (like outbuildings and basements) until warmer temperatures return. 

And for Iceland, those warming temperatures are only increasing. Iceland experienced recorded-breaking heat this year, with Egilsstaðir Airport reporting a temperature of about 79.9 degrees Fahrenheit (26.6 degrees Celsius) on May 15, while other parts of the country saw the mercury rise about 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) higher than the typical average. 

Climate change is basically rolling out the red carpet for mosquitoes to proliferate around the globe, and their newfound presence in Iceland that's not the only news mosquitos are making. The Guardian reported that eggs of the Egyptian mosquito were found in the U.K., along with adult specimens of the Asian tiger mosquito—both of which are known to spread tropical diseases (luckily, Culiseta annulata isn't known to be much more than a biting nuisance). 

In other words, more mosquitoes are coming—whether we like them or not.

Sleep deprivation rapidly disrupts cognitive function and in the long term contributes to neurological disease. Why sleep deprivation has such profound effects on cognition is not well understood. Here we use simultaneous fast fMRI–EEG to test how sleep deprivation modulates cognitive, neural and fluid dynamics in the human brain. We demonstrate that attentional failures during wakefulness after sleep deprivation are tightly orchestrated in a series of brain–body changes, including neuronal shifts, pupil constriction and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow pulsations, pointing to a coupled system of fluid dynamics and neuromodulatory state. CSF flow and hemodynamics are coupled to attentional function within the awake state, with CSF pulsations following attentional impairment. The timing of these dynamics is consistent with a vascular mechanism regulated by neuromodulatory state. The attentional costs of sleep deprivation may thus reflect an irrepressible need for rest periods driven by a central neuromodulatory system that regulates both neuronal and fluid physiology.

Sleep plays a fundamental role in maintaining brain health and preserving cognitive performance. Despite the intense biological need for sleep, sleep deprivation is a major facet of modern life. A single night of lost sleep can cause noticeable cognitive impairment, including attentional failures, in which individuals fail to properly react to an easily detected external stimulus1,2,3. The behavioral deficits caused by sleep deprivation carry a major cost for organismal survival; for example, a momentary lapse in attention while driving a car can have life-threatening outcomes4. Sleep deprivation reliably induces attentional failures despite this cost, suggesting that these deficits reflect an unavoidable need of the brain for sleep. However, the neural basis of sleep deprivation-induced attentional failures is not yet well understood.

Acute sleep deprivation has widespread effects on both local and global aspects of neurophysiology. Large fluctuations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals appear across various networks following sleep deprivation5,6, and large-scale fMRI signals are linked to altered electrophysiology, eyelid closures7,8,9 and arousal state, suggesting global changes in brain activity and vigilance. Attentional lapses after sleep deprivation are linked to reduced activity within the thalamus and cognitive control areas, suggesting a failure to engage large-scale network activity10,11. At the scale of local cortical areas, attentional failures are linked to sleep-like low-frequency waves in isolated cortical patches in rats12. Intriguingly, transient occurrences of sleep-like slow wave activity also predict attentional lapses in humans13,14. Together, these findings have shown that attentional deficits following sleep deprivation are linked to brain-wide hemodynamic changes and low-frequency neural oscillations. The neural basis of these attentional failures is not well understood. One possibility is that attentional lapses correspond to a brief state in which the brain transiently carries out a sleep-dependent function that is incompatible with waking behavior.

Sleep serves many functional purposes, and sleep neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that sleep is linked to not only neuronal but also vascular and fluid changes in the brain. Global low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) hemodynamic waves appear in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and these vascular fluctuations in turn drive pulsatile waves of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow15,16. Sleep deprivation increases the amplitude of the global BOLD signal6, and sleep deprivation modulates CSF pulsatility17, suggesting that the effects of sleep deprivation could be accompanied by altered CSF dynamics. However, precisely how attentional deficits are linked to hemodynamics and CSF flow is not yet clear.

We conducted a within-subject total sleep deprivation study in healthy human participants to investigate whether sleep deprivation and its associated attentional deficits are linked to altered brain fluid dynamics. We used multimodal fast fMRI, electroencephalography (EEG), behavioral assessments and pupillometry to track multiple aspects of neurophysiological dynamics simultaneously. We discovered that CSF flow is coupled to behavioral deficits during wakefulness after sleep deprivation. Notably, we found that attentional failures during wakefulness are marked by a brain- and body-wide state change that underlies both behavioral deficits and pulsatile fluid flow. Specifically, the moments where attention fails occur just before the initiation of a global hemodynamic event and a large-scale outward pulse of CSF flow, followed by subsequent reversal of these dynamics.

To investigate how sleep deprivation modulates neural activity and vascular and CSF dynamics, we performed a simultaneous EEG and fast fMRI experiment in 26 human participants. To enable within-subject comparisons, each participant was scanned twice: once after a night of regular sleep (well-rested) and once after one night of total sleep deprivation, which was continuously supervised in the laboratory (Fig. 1a). We performed simultaneous EEG–fMRI scans with pupillometry in the morning. During the scans, participants performed up to four runs of a sustained attention task, the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT; Fig. 1b), followed by an eyes-closed resting-state run. CSF flow is bidirectional and includes pulsations of both inflow (inward/dorsal) and outflow (outward/ventral). This fast fMRI protocol enabled us to simultaneously measure cortical hemodynamic BOLD signals and CSF inflow in the fourth ventricle (Fig. 1c).

a, For the sleep-deprived visit, participants arrived at the laboratory at 7:00 p.m. before the sleep-deprived night and were monitored continuously during the night. For the well-rested visit, participants arrived between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. the day of the scan. For both visits, scans were performed around 10:00 a.m. in the morning. Scans included up to four PVT runs followed by a 25-min resting-state run. b, For the PVT attention task, each run used either the auditory PVT (aPVT; detecting a beep) or the visual PVT (vPVT; detecting a luminance-matched visual stimulus) with 5 to 10 s interstimulus interval (ISI). c, Left, example fMRI acquisition volume position (green box) for simultaneous measurement of BOLD and CSF flow. The volume intersects the fourth ventricle to enable inward CSF flow detection. Yellow marks the cortical segmentation, and purple indicates the flow measurement region of interest (ROI). The image was masked to delete identifiers. Right, example placement of a CSF ROI (magenta) in the fourth ventricle in one representative participant. d, CSF time series from the same participant during wakefulness showing that sleep deprivation causes large CSF waves during wakefulness, whereas the well-rested condition shows smaller CSF flow. e, Sleep deprivation increased low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) CSF power during wakefulness (wake segments: n = 486 in well-rested, n = 205 in sleep-deprived; N1 segments: n = 179 in well-rested, n = 59 in sleep-deprived; N2 segments: n = 57 in well-rested, n = 40 in sleep-deprived; the black bar indicates P = 0.0004; two-tailed segment-level permutation test with a Bonferroni correction) to a magnitude similar to N1 and N2 sleep. Sleep segments are from the same participants in the final resting-state scan. Power spectral density (PSD) was calculated on CSF signal in resting-state runs. Data are presented as mean values ± s.e.

We first investigated whether sleep deprivation altered the dynamics of CSF flow in resting-state scans that included awake and sleeping periods (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Consistent with previous studies, the CSF inflow signal during well-rested wakefulness exhibited a small-amplitude rhythm synchronized to respiration18,19, in contrast to NREM sleep where CSF exhibits large ~0.05 Hz waves16. However, visual inspection clearly showed that the CSF signal during wakefulness after sleep deprivation also exhibited large-amplitude low-frequency waves, resembling NREM sleep (Fig. 1d). We analyzed this CSF signal across sleep stages in participants who had at least 60 s of continuous wakefulness during the resting-state run (N = 22, excluding segments with high motion; framewise displacement > 0.55 mm) and found a 4.7 dB increase in the CSF signal peaking at 0.04 Hz in sleep-deprived wakefulness (Fig. 1e,h). Remarkably, the CSF power in sleep-deprived wakefulness reached levels similar to the CSF power during typical N2 sleep (0.01–0.1 Hz power in sleep-deprived wake: 24.50 dB, 95% confidence interval = [24.46, 24.55]; rested N2: 24.80 dB, 95% confidence interval = [23.95, 25.59]). These session-dependent increases in CSF flow were not driven by motion artifacts (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Prior work has shown that total overnight sleep deprivation increases BOLD fluctuations6 and low-frequency EEG signals20,21, both of which could modulate CSF flow, so we next examined these two factors in this cohort. To assess the effect of sleep deprivation on neural signals, we compared the levels of EEG slow wave activity (0.5–4 Hz), a well-recognized indicator of sleep pressure22,23,24, and found that sleep deprivation induced an increase in EEG slow wave activity (P = 0.029, paired t-test; Fig. 1f), as expected. Hemodynamics are the primary driver of CSF flow, as changes in blood vessels can mechanically drive CSF flow16,25,26,27, and we found that sleep deprivation also induced a significant increase in low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) cortical gray matter BOLD power (P = 0.0048, paired t-test; Fig. 1g), and these effects were not driven by motion artifacts (Extended Data Fig. 1b). These results demonstrate that sleep deprivation causes low-frequency CSF flow pulsations, increased EEG slow wave activity and hemodynamic waves that appear during wakefulness, with changes in the same direction as the dynamics typically seen during N1 or N2 sleep.

Because large-scale CSF waves typically occur during NREM sleep, a state in which attention is suppressed, we investigated whether the CSF waves during well-rested and sleep-deprived wakefulness were associated with any attentional deficits. As expected2,10,28,29,30, sleep deprivation caused an increase in the mean reaction time (Fig. 2a) and the omission (missed response) rate (Fig. 2b) in the PVT task. Despite participants being awake with eyes open, we observed that attentional lapses (reaction time > 500 ms) and omissions tended to coincide with high-amplitude CSF flow (Fig. 2c). To quantify this behavior–CSF relationship, we tested whether lapses (reaction time > 500 ms) and omissions were linked to CSF power, analyzing data in 60-s segments during confirmed wakefulness (EEG and no eyelid closures >1 s). We found that worse attentional performance was linked to increased low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) CSF power: segments with attentional lapses and segments with omissions exhibited significantly higher CSF flow power than segments without lapses (Fig. 2d). This effect remained significant when controlling for motion (repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA): F2,50 = 2.46, P > 0.05 for motion). These results demonstrated that larger low-frequency CSF flow pulsations are associated with attentional failures during wakefulness. We hypothesized that this CSF dynamic would be associated with BOLD signal amplitude and indeed found that worse attentional performance was also linked to increased low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) gray matter BOLD power (Fig. 2e).

a, Reaction times after sleep deprivation showed a higher mean and a longer tail, indicating more behavioral lapses (N = 26 participants; shading represents standard error across participants; z = –25.08, P < 0.0001; data were analyzed by two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test). b, Omission rate increased after sleep deprivation (N = 26 participants, t25 = –7.00, P = 2.43 × 10−6; data were analyzed by paired two-tailed t-test). c, CSF flow and reaction time fluctuations during one example run, showing higher flow when reaction time slows down. d, Low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) CSF power within nonoverlapping 60 s segments, categorized into three different states: high attention (all reaction times below 500 ms), low attention (at least one reaction time > 500 ms) and omissions (at least one omission). Higher CSF power appears in lower attentional states (two-tailed repeated measures ANOVA and a Tukey post hoc test; F2,50 = 62.04, P = 5.49 × 10−5 for main effect, N = 26 participants). e, Low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) gray matter BOLD power within nonoverlapping 60-s segments, following the same analysis as in d.

Box plots show the mean (center), the boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers indicate minimum to maximum.

What process could result in joint changes in CSF flow, hemodynamics and attentional function? Ascending neuromodulation, such as noradrenergic input from the locus coeruleus, modulates attentional function31,32 and also acts directly on the vasculature33, making this a candidate mechanism for modulating both attention and CSF flow. Neuromodulatory tone and locus coeruleus firing is correlated with pupil diameter34, and sleep deprivation is well known to modulate pupil diameter, with smaller diameter indicating a low arousal state and decreased attentional function31,35,36. We investigated whether pupil diameter was linked to hemodynamics and CSF flow on faster timescales. We found that pupil diameter was significantly correlated with CSF flow: pupil constriction was linked to outward CSF signals, and pupil dilation was linked to subsequent inward CSF signals, with CSF flow following the pupil by 4.75 s (Fig. 3a,b,f). This correlation was also significant when we tested drowsy segments from rested wakefulness, demonstrating that this pupil–CSF coupling is present across states (Extended Data Fig. 2). However, the pupil–CSF correlation was significantly higher after sleep deprivation (Extended Data Fig. 2), suggesting that sleep deprivation drives a pupil-locked fluctuation in CSF flow. Consistent with this, we also observed that CSF flow peaks were locked to drops in attentional performance: both reaction time and the rate of omissions increased before CSF peaks (Fig. 3c,d). These patterns were also evident at the individual participant level (Extended Data Fig. 3a–h).

a, Spontaneous pupil constriction and dilation is time locked to peaks of CSF flow. Black bars indicate significant changes in z-scored pupil diameter compared to baseline (P < 0.05; two-tailed t-test, baseline = [–30, –28] s, Bonferroni corrected). Data are presented as mean values ± s.e.; AU, arbitrary units. b, Cross-correlation between pupil diameter and CSF showing a strong correlation (maximal r = 0.25 at lag –4.75 s; n = 400 segments, 23 participants). c, During periods with pupil constriction, reaction times also showed significant increases compared to baseline (stars mark segments with P < 0.05; data were analyzed by two-tailed t-test, Bonferroni corrected). d, Omission rate during task showing a significant increase during pupil constriction and significant decrease during pupil dilation (stars mark segments with P < 0.05; two-tailed t-test relative to baseline, Bonferroni corrected). e, Significant biphasic changes in cortical BOLD activity are locked to CSF peaks (P < 0.05; two-tailed t-test relative to baseline, Bonferroni corrected). f, Mean CSF signal. g, To estimate the impulse response function (IRF) linking pupil size changes to BOLD and CSF activity, we convolved pupil diameter traces from each segment with a series of IRFs. Estimated IRF of the cortical BOLD signal to the pupil diameter shows a time to peak at 8 s. Cross-correlation between pupil diameter and BOLD showed a strong correlation (maximal r = 0.34 at lag –1.25 s; n = 400 segments, 23 participants). h, Predicting CSF flow with no additional parameter fitting, assuming that the derivative of the pupil-locked BOLD fluctuations drives CSF flow, shows significant prediction of the true CSF signals (zero lag r = 0.26; n = 400 segments).

In each case, although CSF flow was locked to behavior and the pupil, it lagged these measures in time, which could reflect a vascular mechanism that introduces a time delay. Furthermore, although pupil diameter is consistently correlated with noradrenergic tone, it is also correlated with several other modulators37,38. To test whether pupil–CSF coupling reflected a pupil-locked modulation of cerebrovascular fluctuations, which could be expected from noradrenergic-driven vasoconstriction and would drive a delayed CSF response39, we examined the global cortical BOLD signal and found an anticorrelation with the pupil (Fig. 3e). We calculated the best-fit impulse response linking the pupil to the global BOLD signal and found a negative impulse response with a peak delay of 8 s (Fig. 3g), consistent with pupil-linked vasoconstriction. To test whether this mechanism in turn predicted CSF flow, we convolved the pupil signal with its impulse response and calculated the expected CSF flow driven by this vascular effect, with no additional parameter fitting16. We found that the convolved pupil signal yielded a significant prediction of CSF activity (Fig. 3h; zero lag R = 0.26, maximal R = 0.3 at lag –1.25 s), indicating that the timing of the pupil–CSF coupling could be explained by a vascular intermediary.

Having found that hemodynamic waves and CSF flow pulsations were highest in epochs with omissions, we next examined the precise dynamics occurring at the moment of omissions. Because CSF flow pulsations increase during NREM sleep, we carefully excluded omissions due to NREM sleep to confirm whether these flow changes appeared during wakefulness (EEG verified and excluding segments with eye closures >1 s). We found a strong coupling between behavior and CSF flow during sleep-deprived wakefulness: omissions were locked to an outward wave and then an inward wave of CSF flow in the fourth ventricle (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Figs. 4a and 5a,g). Although few omissions occurred in the well-rested state, when they did appear, they showed similar CSF flow coupling, demonstrating that a complete attentional failure even when rested can engage a similar mechanism (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). The cortical gray matter BOLD signal exhibited a matched biphasic pattern, consistent with vascular drive of outward and then inward CSF flow (Extended Data Figs. 4b and 5c,i). However, our imaging protocol was only able to directly measure CSF inflow (inward to the brain) due to the placement of the acquisition volume (Fig. 1c), whereas drops in CSF signal could in theory represent either outflow or simply no flow. We therefore conducted a second study in an additional ten sleep-restricted participants with a new imaging protocol that measured bidirectional flow (Extended Data Fig. 6a) to test whether this pattern specifically signaled CSF outflow before inflow. This acquisition method allowed simultaneous measurement of inflow and outflow but did not allow measurement of gray matter BOLD signals. We confirmed that omissions were locked to a pulse of CSF flowing outward out of the brain, beginning at the time of the missed stimulus, followed by a pulse flowing inward into the brain (Extended Data Fig. 6b). These results replicated the finding of coupled attentional function and CSF flow pulsations in an independent cohort, with a biphasic profile of outward flow at omissions, followed by inward flow.

a, Awake omission trials are locked to a biphasic change in CSF flow, with an outward trough followed by an inward peak. Time zero marks stimulus onset; omission occurs within the following seconds. Data are presented as mean values ± s.e. b, Omission trials are locked to a broadband drop in EEG power, including decreased alpha–beta (10–25 Hz) EEG power, and then an increase in slow wave activity (SWA; 0.5–4 Hz) and alpha–beta power. The biphasic alpha–beta power change is widespread with centro-occipital predominance, whereas the slow wave activity increase has occipital and frontal predominance. The spectrogram is normalized within frequency; black bars indicate a significant change in broadband power (0.5–30 Hz) compared to baseline. c, The aperiodic component of the EEG was subtracted to display oscillation-specific changes. The alpha–beta and slow wave activity effects were still present (statistics are provided in Extended Data Fig. 8). d, Pupil diameter showed a biphasic change at omissions, with a significant constriction during the omission trial followed by dilation after trial onset (9–12 s). e, Heart rate dropped during omissions and subsequently increased. f, Respiratory rate drop at omissions and subsequent increase. Black bars with stars indicate significant changes from baseline (n = 364 trials, 26 participants). Data are presented as mean values ± s.e. (standard error across segments). Stars indicate P < 0.05; two-tailed t-test with a Bonferroni correction over time, baseline = [–20, –10] s. Exact P values are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

During NREM sleep, CSF flow is coupled to neural slow wave activity16,40, and local slow waves can also increase after sleep deprivation12. We therefore analyzed the EEG spectrogram to investigate which neural dynamics might be linked to these omission-locked CSF waves (example spectrogram in Extended Data Fig. 7a). We found that omissions (n = 364 trials, 26 participants) were accompanied by EEG alterations across multiple frequency bands and across different electrodes, with a drop in broadband EEG power, particularly pronounced in the alpha–beta (10–25 Hz) range, followed shortly by a subsequent increase in power (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Figs. 5b,h and 8). In addition to this broadband change, the oscillation-only component of the spectrogram (calculated by subtracting the aperiodic component41,42,43,44) also demonstrated significant clusters at slow and alpha–beta frequencies, with a broad spatial distribution (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 8b). The global distribution of the EEG power change suggested an altered global arousal state. Overall, this broadband power reduction and steepening spectral slope pointed to a spatially distributed change in electrophysiological dynamics.

What type of neuronal event might these EEG spectral shifts reflect? The relatively broadband and spatially global (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Figs. 5b and 8) nature of these EEG changes suggested that they might reflect a transient change in cortical excitability45, perhaps mediated by central neuromodulatory state, as suggested by the pupil coupling (Fig. 3g,h). In addition, autonomic state changes and systemic oscillations can drive CSF flow46,47,48, consistent with the idea that large-scale neuromodulatory changes could contribute to both the attentional failures and CSF dynamics. We therefore tested whether a sequence of events could be locked to the CSF flow: a drop in attentional state followed by recovery of attention. Consistent with this, pupil dilation was biphasically coupled to CSF flow: the pupil was constricted during the omission, corresponding to a low arousal state and outward CSF flow, and then subsequently dilated (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), with CSF subsequently flowing inward (Fig. 4a). Because neuromodulatory state also has systemic effects49, we further examined systemic physiological recordings, including changes in respiratory rate and volume, heart rate and peripheral vascular volume, reflecting activity of the autonomic nervous system. We found that all systemic measures were significantly locked to the omission (Fig. 4d–f and Extended Data Figs. 3d–f, 4c,d and 5e,f,k,l). These results demonstrate that attentional failures during wakefulness were coupled to a brain- and body-wide integrated state shift, manifesting as a transient behavioral deficit, electrophysiological markers of distinct neuronal state, pupil constriction and hemodynamic and CSF flow waves.

These results clearly identified widespread behavioral, neuronal and arousal dynamics that were locked to CSF pulsatile flow during sleep-deprived wakefulness. However, attentional failures are typically brief during wakefulness, with a spike in arousal rapidly following an omission. Furthermore, the neurovascular, pupil and CSF dynamics showed biphasic patterns, with both signal drops and increases around attentional failures. Due to this biphasic pattern, each physiological change could potentially be explained by two different possibilities: either it was specifically linked to drops in arousal (at the onset of attentional failures) or it was locked to increases in arousal (at the recovery of behavior). We therefore designed an analysis of behavioral responses to separate the neurophysiological dynamics linked to the drop, versus recovery, of attention. We categorized behavioral omissions into three types: ‘Type A', where the omission trial was preceded and followed by a valid response, ‘Type B', the first of at least three consecutive omissions, and ‘Type C', the last omission of a consecutive series (Fig. 5a). As described above, wakefulness during all omissions was verified both through EEG scoring and eye tracking.

a, Omissions during wakefulness were categorized as isolated (Type A), onset of sustained low attention (Type B) and end of sustained low attention (Type C). Schematic made with BioRender.com. b, Type A, isolated omission trials (n = 127 trials, 26 participants), were locked to a decrease in broadband EEG power and then increased power at attention recovery in the next trial. CSF showed a significant decrease followed by a significant increase. Respiratory rate and heart rate both showed significant changes from baseline after trial onset. c, Type B, first omission of the series, signifies the onset of a sustained low attentional state (n = 61 trials, 20 participants). CSF signal, respiratory rate and heart rate all decrease significantly (P < 0.05, paired t-test across segments and time bins, Bonferroni corrected). The black arrow marks the onset time of CSF signal drop, at 0.5 s. d, Type C, last omission of the series, followed by increased attentional state (n = 57 trials, 20 participants). The EEG shows heightened slow wave activity during the omission and subsequent increase in alpha–beta power at the recovery of attention. CSF signal, respiratory rate and heart rate all increase significantly (P < 0.05; paired t-test relative to baseline, Bonferroni corrected). The black arrow marks the onset time of the CSF signal increase, at 9.5 s (that is, on average 1 s after behavior recovery). For data in b–d, black bars indicate significant (P < 0.05, paired two-tailed t-test, Bonferroni corrected) changes from baseline ([–10, –5] s). Gray regions indicate the average timing of trials where no behavioral responses were recorded for each omission type. Blue circles indicate average timing of valid responses before or after each omission type. Red crosses indicate average timing of the omission trial onset. Data are presented as mean values ± s.e. (standard error across segments). Participant-level averages are provided in Extended Data Fig. 9. The exact P values are in Supplementary Table 1.

To determine whether CSF pulsations were linked to attention drops or attention recovery, we compared Type B (attention drop) and Type C (attention recovery) trials. This analysis identified two separable patterns: neural, CSF and systemic signals showed opposing changes locked to Type B and C omissions (Fig. 5b–d and Extended Data Fig. 9a). The loss of attentional focus in Type B omissions was linked to a decrease in EEG alpha–beta power and expulsion of CSF, whereas regaining of attentional focus in Type C omissions co-occurred with an increase in EEG broadband power and inward flow of CSF, and the systemic arousal indicators followed the same pattern (Fig. 5c,d). The behavioral changes occurred before the initiation of the CSF flow changes (that is, the temporal derivative; Extended Data Fig. 9b), indicating that the behavioral events were associated with a subsequent reversal of flow direction. These results demonstrated that CSF flow occurs in a specific sequence of events: during an attentional failure, EEG power drops in concert with body-wide signatures of low arousal and subsequently a outward pulse of CSF flow. This pattern inverts at recovery of arousal, with CSF returning inward after attention improves, again with a time delay consistent with vascular-mediated CSF flow.

To calculate the relative timing of these effects, we estimated the onset times for the changes in behavior, EEG, BOLD and CSF flow. We identified the onset time of CSF decrease for Type A and B omissions and the onset time of CSF increase for Type C omissions (the time when CSF signal reached 10% of the minimum or maximum amplitude compared to pretrial baseline ([–3, 0] s)). This analysis showed that CSF signals began to decrease 0.5–2.5 s after trial onset that would subsequently result in attentional failure (Type A and Type B), peaking at 6.7–8.2 s. When attention recovered (after Type C), the CSF signal increase began at 1 s after behavioral recovery onset, peaking at 6.2 s. This timing pattern was consistent with the pupil-locked function in Fig. 3, aligning with an attention-locked modulation of the cerebrovasculature unfolding over several seconds. The long delay of the CSF peak may thus reflect the effect of vascular changes that followed attention failures. The timing of these relationships was therefore consistent with an integrated neuromodulatory mechanism that regulates attentional state, vascular physiology and CSF dynamics.

Here, we found that attentional failures after sleep deprivation are locked to a brain- and body-wide state change, including a characteristic neurovascular event and pulsatile waves of CSF flow. During sleep-deprived wakefulness, hemodynamic and CSF flow pulsations increased within the awake state, causing a flow pattern that resembled N2 NREM sleep. CSF waves were strongly coupled to behavioral failures, a shift in neuronal spectra and pupil constriction (during awake, eyes-open state). Specifically, attention dropped ~2 s before CSF flowed outward (Fig. 5b), and attention recovered ~1 s before CSF flow reversed and was drawn back inward (Fig. 5d). The attentional failures that occur after sleep deprivation thus are locked to the initiation of a process in which the pupil constricts, brain-wide hemodynamics increase and the CSF is transiently flushed outward.

Our data showed a consistent pattern of broadband EEG shifts linked to attentional failures. What type of neural event might these represent? The process of falling asleep is linked to suppression of EEG alpha power and drops in respiratory rate50, which could suggest that the events we observe here represent an accelerated transition toward sleep onset. In addition, elegant prior work has shown that autonomic and arousal state fluctuations are characterized by a sequential modulation of beta power and slow wave activity46,51,52. The EEG pattern we observe here shares similar broadband features, and we find that it represents a behaviorally relevant modulation of neural vigilance state during wakefulness, with attentional consequences. This pattern may thus reflect that sleep deprivation causes sleep-initiating cortical events to occur during wakefulness, but with an interruption of the initiation process before sleep is attained. Given that we found a shift in spectral slope, this pattern could also be consistent with increasing cortical inhibition53. Although we could not directly identify local sleep slow waves here due to the macroscopic nature of these measurements, this effect appeared to be relatively spatially widespread, as it was detected across many EEG electrodes. Our results suggest that sleep deprivation destabilizes global brain state regulation and leads to large-scale, biphasic dynamics. Smaller CSF events could also be infrequently detected in attention failures in the well-rested state with a weaker coupling to pupil diameter, suggesting that typical drowsiness may engage a similar circuit but with reduced switching and instability in the well-rested context.

The neural and attentional drops were also linked to pupil constriction, a classic signature of arousal state that is actively controlled by noradrenergic neuromodulatory projections54,55. Pupil diameter is correlated with attention, heart rate and galvanic skin reflex, reflecting a tight coupling between the state of the central and peripheral arousal systems38,56,57,58. Furthermore, the autonomic system can strongly modulate CSF flow, with particularly strong effects during light sleep47, and autonomic measures were correlated with the attentional dynamics observed here. Although we cannot determine the causal relationship between the pupil and CSF, the high correlation between pupil diameter and CSF pulsatile flow suggests the involvement of the ascending neuromodulatory system in regulating CSF flow during wakefulness59,60. A possible mechanistic explanation for the joint changes in EEG, CSF and autonomic indicators is the well-established parallel projections from key neuromodulatory nuclei such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, which projects throughout the cortex and thalamus to modulate neural state, while also directly acting on the sympathetic nervous system61,62,63. Intriguingly, locus coeruleus activity oscillates during NREM sleep and drives infraslow neuronal spectral changes64,65,66, and pupil diameter also covaries with these neural signatures67. Our results suggest that a similar dynamic of temporally structured noradrenergic fluctuations could appear during sleep-deprived wakefulness. In addition, these events could also occur infrequently during rested wakefulness, when attention fails. Other neuromodulators are also correlated with pupil diameter and could contribute37,68, although our hemodynamic data suggest a substantial role for the vasoconstrictive effects of the noradrenergic system69. The dynamics we report were observed during eyes-open wakefulness, demonstrating that brief shifts in attentional state are sufficient to elicit these coordinated changes. Our results could thus be consistent with sleep deprivation causing a destabilization of the ascending arousal system, with brief failures of its wakefulness-promoting actions leading to attentional dysfunction, neuronal arousal suppression and CSF flow.

Our finding that attentional shifts and pupil diameter are linked to large-scale CSF flow, detectable even in the ventricle, suggests a neuromodulatory mechanism that could potentially explain these dual effects. A primary driver of CSF flow is changes in the vasculature, as dilation and constriction of blood vessels in turn propels CSF flow16,25,26,70,71,72,73. Because noradrenaline is a vasoconstrictor33, drops in locus coeruleus activity could decrease neuronal arousal state while dilating cortical blood vessels and constricting the pupil. This would result in an outward flow in the fourth ventricle detected several seconds later, which then would invert as attention recovers and noradrenergic activity increases, reflected in the subsequent pupil dilation. An exciting implication of these dynamics is that pupil diameter could potentially provide a noninvasive, accessible readout of signals related to CSF flow.

Another major driver of CSF flow in awake humans is the cardiac and respiratory cycles, which were tightly associated with the dynamics reported here and could reflect several parallel pathways. Cardiac and respiratory cycles are directly locked to CSF pulsations, as arterial pulsations across the cardiac cycle and reductions in thoracic pressure during inspiration can mechanically propel CSF flow18,74,75. In addition, the locus coeruleus is interconnected with the pre-Bötzinger complex, the brainstem's primary respiratory rhythm generator76. Thus, the coupled respiration–CSF–pupil activity we observed may reflect the joint modulation of breathing and arousal77,78. The locus coeruleus has not only ascending but also descending projections, synapsing onto preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the spinal cord, which can contribute to coupled dynamics in neural and systemic physiology79. Finally, respiratory fluctuations also influence blood oxygenation and hemodynamics, potentially modulating vasoconstriction that further contributes to CSF dynamics.

An important question for future work is to investigate whether and how these dynamics are linked to solute transport in the brain. Prolonged wakefulness leads to a buildup of toxic metabolic waste products80,81,82, suggesting that more fluid flow would be needed after sleep deprivation. However, the specific consequences of large pulsatile CSF waves for solute transport are not yet established. The CSF waves measured here are relatively high velocity (>1 cm s−1), lasting ~10 s for both the inward and outward phases, indicating that CSF travels many centimeters during each wave, which may be expected to drive solute transport and mixing. In addition, the global hemodynamic waves suggest that this process is coupled to vascular oscillations throughout the brain tissue, which could alter solute transport in the perivascular space. However, the noninvasive methods used in this study could not measure waste clearance, so these possibilities need to be tested in future studies. The observed CSF waves are bidirectional, with sleep deprivation increasing waves in both inward and outward directions, rather than net flow. Intriguingly, a recent study measuring clearance in animal models found that noradrenergic oscillations are linked to waste clearance within NREM sleep83. Our results suggest that an analogous circuit may modulate large-scale CSF flow in humans and furthermore that it can operate within the awake state during attentional failures. Finally, although several studies have shown that sleep clears the neurotoxic waste products that accumulate during wakefulness40,80,81,84,85, a recent study reported the opposite pattern, with reduced clearance during sleep86. In addition to other methodological differences, the conflicting studies used different sleep protocols for the awake measurements (rested wakefulness versus sleep deprived), suggesting that sleep deprivation protocols might be one factor to explore across experiments.

An open question is why both attentional state and CSF flow would be controlled by the same system. One possibility is that the large-scale changes in blood volume that emerge during sleep may be nonoptimal for the waking state, because prolonged drops could reduce oxygen availability. Alternatively, a speculative possibility is that prolonged CSF flow might be incompatible with stable attentional states, for example, because high flow rates alter the concentration of signaling molecules or ionic concentrations that are required for typical waking function. However, we found that although CSF flow was tightly coupled to behavior, it did not exclusively occur during omissions (CSF flow pulses continuously with lower amplitude during wakefulness18,48,87, and flow increased to a lesser degree during successful performance with slow reaction times; Figs. 2 and 3), meaning that individual large events of CSF flow do not prevent behavior. Alternatively, it could be possible that sustained high-amplitude flow over longer timescales interferes with behavioral performance, in which case it would be beneficial to have a circuit that can provide a structured alternation between high-attention and high-CSF pulsation states. Future studies would be needed to test this theory.

Overall, our results demonstrate that the attentional failures caused by sleep deprivation are coupled to a global neurovascular event and large-scale brain fluid transport. When the brain lacks the opportunity to sleep, it enters a suboptimal attentional state that manifests with both sleep-like fluid dynamics and behavioral errors. This coupling points to a central neuromodulatory circuit that controls both attentional state and brain fluid dynamics and shows that the moments of attentional dysfunction we experience after sleep loss are followed by the initiation of widespread fluid flow in the brain.

The main experiment enrolled 32 healthy participants, of whom 26 successfully completed both study visits (7 men and 19 women; mean age = 25.6 years ± 4.41 years, range = 19 to 40 years). No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size, but our samples are similar to those reported in previous publications12,13,56,88. The study included more women than men due to the space limitations and restriction on head circumference when wearing an EEG cap inside the MRI head coil. All 26 participants completed two experimental sessions spaced 8 to 10 days apart: a well-rested session and a sleep-deprived session. The order of the two sessions was counterbalanced across participants. Half of the participants completed the rested wakefulness session first, whereas the other half completed the sleep-deprived session first. For the well-rested condition, participants completed a full night of sleep at home, and they arrived at the lab no later than 9:00 a.m. for a 10:00 a.m. scan start time. In the sleep deprivation condition, participants arrived at the lab at approximately 7:00 p.m. and stayed overnight until completing the scan the following day. Participants were screened to ensure they had no history of sleep, medical or psychiatric disorders and good typical sleep quality (sleep schedule of 6.5–9 h per night), as assessed by self-rating questionnaires. Exclusion criteria included shift workers, participants that had traveled across time zones in the 3 months before the study and any magnetic resonance contraindication. All participants were required to maintain a regular sleep schedule for 1 week before the visit, with sleep before scans monitored by wrist actigraphy, to consume less than 100 mg of caffeine daily before the study and to refrain from alcohol, caffeine and sleep-aid medications for 24 h before the day of the scan. All participants provided written informed consent, and study procedures were completed as approved by the Boston University Charles River Campus Institutional Review Board (IRB 5059E). All participants received monetary compensation as specified in the IRB protocol.

During the sleep-deprived visit, participants were sleep deprived overnight under constant monitoring by two staff members. At least two researchers remained in the adjacent control room to verify continuous wakefulness during the sleep deprivation period. After arrival, participants were fitted with an EEG cap for overnight monitoring. Participants wore eye-tracking glasses (Tobii Pro 3 Glasses) throughout the night except when performing testing sessions, for continuous eye monitoring while the staff members logged any spontaneous long eyelid closures throughout the night. Research staff continuously monitored the live video of participants' eyes from the control room during the sleep-deprived night. If the participant closed their eyes for more than 2 s, a staff member requested that they open their eyes and then engaged them in conversation to ensure wakefulness. If the eye closure repeated frequently, staff members took participants on a gentle walk. Between 6:00 a.m. and the morning scan, participants took a shower, during which verbal confirmation of wakefulness was obtained, and they were then provided with breakfast.

An EEG was recorded during four task testing blocks (TBs) during the night of sleep deprivation (TB1: around 9:00 p.m., TB2: around 11:00 p.m., TB3: around 2:00 a.m., TB4: around 5:00 a.m.). Each block consisted of three eyes-open resting-state runs (2 min) and two vigilance task runs (12 min each). The vigilance task consisted of 12-min runs of a computerized aPVT and vPVT (details are provided in the next section). Auditory and visual runs were counterbalanced in order. When not involved in testing sessions, participants were allowed to carry out their own preferred activities, such as reading, writing, listening to music, watching TV or playing games. Lying down, sleeping and vigorous physical activity were not permitted. Nonscheduled light snacks were permitted, whereas caffeinated beverages, alcohol and medications that can influence sleepiness were not allowed during the deprivation protocol.

Analyses of PVT included the data from both the aPVT and vPVT. During the aPVT (adapted from refs. 87,89), participants were instructed to respond as fast as possible (by pressing a button) to a 0.5 s, 375 Hz tone. Tones were presented binaurally at a comfortable volume through magnetic resonance-compatible earbuds (Etymotic Research, ER3 transducers). Cushions were placed beside the ears to restrict movement and to further reduce scanner noise. During the vPVT, participants were instructed to respond as fast as possible (by pressing a button) when the fixation crosshair changed into a square. The two visual stimuli were designed to have identical luminance to avoid light-induced pupillary responses. For both task modalities, each stimulus lasted 0.5 s, and intertrial intervals ranged from 5 to 10 s. A fixation crosshair was presented throughout. The total duration of each task run was 12 min. Visual stimuli inside the scanner were presented on a VPixx Technologies PROPixx Lite Projector (VPixx Technologies) with a refresh rate of 120 Hz.

Participants underwent five fMRI runs: two runs of aPVT (12 min each), two runs of vPVT (12 min each) and one run of eyes-closed resting state (25 min). Auditory and visual run order were counterbalanced. Sixteen participants successfully completed all four task runs for both visits; ten participants completed a subset of these runs (for example, due to an inability to stay awake in the later runs). If participants did not successfully complete all task runs, the successfully completed runs were still included in the analysis. Runs were excluded if participants failed to respond to more than 20 trials, indicating that they could not stay awake. This resulted in 198 runs from 26 participants (6 runs were excluded). During the eyes-closed resting-state session, participants were instructed to press a button on every breath in and breath out as long as they were awake and were told that it was permitted to fall asleep during the scan.

Sleep–wake behavior data in the week before the sleep-deprived visit were collected by actigraphy and stored as the sum (activity) of 30-s intervals. These data were analyzed with Actilife (v.6.7, Actigraph), using a sleep–wake detection-validated algorithm. Participants were also instructed to keep notes of bed and rise times to help frame the time in bed during which actigraphy data were analyzed.

Participants were scanned on a 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma MRI scanner with a 64-channel head/neck coil. MRI sessions began with a 1-mm isotropic multiecho MPRAGE anatomical scan. Functional scans consisted of single-shot gradient echo multiband EPI sequences with 40 interleaved slices (2.5-mm isotropic resolution, TR = 378 ms, MultiBand factor = 8, TE = 31 ms, flip angle = 37°, field of view (FOV) = 230 × 230, blipped CAIPI shift = FOV / 4 and no in-plane acceleration).

Additional sensors were used to record systemic physiology during the MRI scan. Respiration was measured simultaneously using an MRI-safe pneumatic respiration transducer belt around the abdomen, and pulse was measured with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) transducer (BIOPAC Systems). Physiological signals were acquired at 2,000 Hz using Acqknowledge software and were aligned with MRI data using triggers sent by the MRI scanner.

EEG data were collected using a 64-channel magnetic resonance-compatible EEG cap and BrainAmp magnetic resonance amplifiers (Brain Products). Two reusable reference layers were custom made to record ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, as in Levitt et al.90. As described in Levitt et al.90, with the use of a reference layer, a subset of EEG electrodes can directly record the BCG noise, enabling effective modeling and removal of this noise. This artifact signal can then be used to regress out the BCG artifact from the EEG signals. The first reference layer, used for participants 1–6, was made from an ethylene vinyl acetate shower cap (the inner, insulating layer) and a layer of modal-lycra fabric (the outer layer), which were fastened together by round, plastic grommets to create openings large enough to accommodate the EEG electrodes, as in Luo et al.91. These grommets were placed over electrodes Fpz, Fz, AFz, FCz, Cz, Pz, POz, Oz, F3, F4, F7, F8, T7, T8, C3, C4, P3, P4, PO3 and PO4 and held in place with cyanoacrylate glue. Holes were cut in the reference layer to site each grommet, and larger holes were also made to allow the participants' ears to pass through. The outer layer of the reference layer was moistened with a solution of baby shampoo, water and potassium chloride to make it conductive before each recording. Finally, the inner face of the EEG cap was lined with Nexcare surgical tape (3M) to avoid wetting the EEG cap. The second reference layer, used for participants 7–26, was designed as reported in Levitt et al.90. It was made from a layer of stretch vinyl (Spandex World) coated in PEDOT ESD500 and P1900 ink (PEDOTinks.com), with grommets placed over Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8, Fpz, AFz, Fz, FCz, Cz, Pz, POz and Oz and large holes for the participants' ears. For this reference layer, no conductive solution or tape was needed. Before each recording, electrode impedances were measured. To ensure safety, participants were not allowed to proceed to EEG–fMRI recordings unless the impedance of all channels was below 100 KΩ; however, a lower impedance of less than 50 KΩ was targeted for signal quality. EEG data were collected at a sampling rate of 5,000 Hz, synchronized to the scanner clock and referenced to channel FCz.

Gradient artifacts were removed through average artifact subtraction92 using a moving average of the previous 30 TRs. All electrodes were then rereferenced to the common average, separately for electrodes contacting the head and the electrodes placed on the reference layer. Electromyogram and electrocardiogram channels placed on the chin and at the back were excluded from the common average. BCG artifacts were removed using regression of reference electrode signals91. Because the position of electrodes and physiological noise dynamics can vary over the recording sessions, we implemented a dynamic time-varying regression of the reference signals in sliding windows93,94. Denoised EEG spectrograms enabled clear visual detection of arousal-locked EEG dynamics (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

We used EEGLAB95 and MATLAB (R2022a, MathWorks) to analyze EEG data. Continuous EEG data were downsampled to 500 Hz and then bandpass filtered with an EEGLAB antialiasing filter to 0.2–40 Hz. Independent component analysis was used to remove components reflecting eye movements and muscle activity. EEG PSD was calculated using multitaper spectral estimation (Chronux93), using 5-s windows and five tapers. Further analysis was performed on EEG channel POz because this channel consistently had good quality data across participants. The EEG POz channel was used to calculate PSD with 5 s windows and five tapers. For normalized EEG power spectrogram analysis, power values for each trial and each frequency were z scored.

Analyses of the spectral slope of the EEG signal collected over the night of sleep deprivation (outside of the fMRI scanner) used channel POz. The PSD from 0.5 to 35 Hz was estimated using the multitaper method in 10-s epochs with 0.1 s overlap, which were subsequently used to extract the slope of a fitted model using the FOOOF algorithm in the 1- to 35-Hz range32. To separate the aperiodic and oscillatory component of the PSD, we used FOOOF to calculate an initial linear fit of the spectrum in log–log space and subtracted the results from the spectrum. A Gaussian function was then fitted to the largest peak of the flattened PSD exceeding two times the standard deviation. This procedure was iterated for the next largest peak after subtracting the previous peak until no peaks were exceeding the minimum peak threshold. FOOOF settings were kept default with the exception of minimum peak height limits set to be over 0.3 dB. The oscillatory components were finally obtained by fitting a multivariate Gaussian to all extracted peaks simultaneously. After the iterations, the initial fit was added back to the flattened peak-free PSD, resulting in the aperiodic component of the PSD. Afterward, this aperiodic component was fitted again, leading to the final fit with aperiodic intercept and exponent as parameters. The fitted Gaussian functions were referred to as an oscillation-only spectrogram. The aperiodic features were estimated using a sliding window approach with 5-s window length and stepping every 0.3 s.

One participant in the well-rested session and one participant in the sleep-deprived session did not have valid EEG recordings during the resting-state scan and were thus excluded from the sleep analysis. The remaining 24 participants' sleep EEG data were used in sleep scoring and segmenting the BOLD fMRI data into sleep stages (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Sleep scoring was performed on preprocessed EEG data using the Visbrain toolbox by two scorers following the standard AASM scoring guidelines94,95. Consistent with standard sleep scoring, we observed increased low-frequency power during sleep both after normal sleep and after sleep deprivation and increased alpha frequency power during the awake state (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Disagreements in sleep scores were further discussed and resolved with a third experienced scorer.

Eye tracking over the sleep-deprived night (8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next day) was performed with eyeglasses (Tobii Pro Glasses 3) with rear-facing infrared cameras. Pupil size was recorded in the morning during EEG–fMRI scans using a magnetic resonance-compatible eye tracker (EyeLink 1000, SR Research) at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz. The eye tracker was placed at the end of the scanner bore, such that the participant's left eye could be tracked via the head coil mirror. Before each task run, we began with a calibration of the eye tracker using the standard five-point EyeLink calibration procedure. Moments when the eye tracker received no pupil signal (that is, during eye blinks) were marked automatically during acquisition by the manufacturer's blink detection algorithm. Pupil data were preprocessed offline. Missing and invalid data due to blinks were replaced using linear interpolation for the period from 100 ms before blink onset to 400 ms after blink offset. Missing data due to long eyelid closures (>1 s) were marked but not interpolated because these segments were later used to detect microsleeps. Following the automated interpolation procedure, the data were manually checked and corrected if any artifacts had not been successfully removed. Twenty-one runs were excluded from the pupil diameter analysis due to technical issues with the eye tracker, and 6 were excluded due to failed video recording, yielding 171 valid runs from 26 participants. Figure 3 analyses used data from these 171 runs. We normalized the pupil diameter time series to z scores. For analyses of pupil responses aligned to either CSF peaks or omission trial onsets, we epoched the pupil time series around each event of interest relative to event onset. We rejected pupil epochs if they contained >1-s consecutive long eyelid closures within the raw data.

The cortical surface was reconstructed from the MPRAGE volume using recon-all from Freesurfer version 6 (refs. 96,97). All functional runs were slice-time corrected using FSL version 6 (slicetimer; https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) and motion corrected to the middle frame using AFNI (3dvolreg; https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/). Each motion-corrected run was then registered to the anatomical data using boundary-based registration (bbregister).

We defined the left and right hemisphere cortical gray matter ROIs using the automatically generated Freesurfer-derived segmentations of cortical gray matter. Cortical time series were converted to percent signal change by dividing by the mean value of the time series after discarding the first 20 volumes to allow the signal to reach steady state.

CSF inflow analysis used the raw acquired fMRI data with slice-timing correction but without motion correction, as motion correction corrupts the voxel slice position information needed for inflow analysis, and motion correction cannot be accurately performed on edge slices where tissue moves in and out of the imaging volume. All analyses therefore were performed on segments with framewise displacement of <0.5 mm, and segments with high motion were marked and rejected from any further analysis. To identify the CSF ROI, we registered the single-band anatomical reference scan (SBRef), acquired right before each functional scan, to the participant's anatomical T1 image. The SBRef scan matched the functional scan in sequence parameters but was acquired without multiband, allowing us to obtain an anatomically defined ROI on an image that was distortion matched to the functional scans. The CSF ROI was manually traced on the anatomical SBRef image and was defined as the CSF voxels in the bottom four slices of the fourth ventricle for each scan for each participant. The ROI did not include edge voxels to minimize partial volume effects, resulting in an ROI that was smaller than the full ventricle width. The researcher was blinded to condition (rested versus sleep deprived) while selecting the CSF ROIs. We extracted the mean signal in this region as the CSF inflow signal. All CSF inflow time series were highpass filtered above 0.01 Hz and converted to percent signal change by dividing the value of the time series by the 15th percentile value (because the CSF signal has a floor due to only measuring inward flow with the acquisition scheme used in the main experiment). CSF time series were upsampled to a new sampling frequency of 4 Hz using spline interpolation before stimulus-locked averages were calculated. Average CSF inflow signals (for example, Fig. 3f) typically show positive baseline values because CSF pulses continuously.

Peaks in the bandpass-filtered CSF signal (0.01–0.1 Hz) during tasks were identified by identifying local maxima that surpassed an amplitude threshold of 30%. These peaks (n = 400) were then used to extract a peak-locked signal (–30 to 30 s relative to the CSF peaks) in pupil diameter (bandpass filtered at 0.01–0.1 Hz). To test for statistical significance of the peak in the pupil signal, we used a time-binned, two-sided t-test, averaging the signal in 2-s bins, testing whether the signal was significantly different from baseline ([–30, –28] s in Fig. 3). The P value was Bonferroni corrected for the number of time bins (number of bins = 30), and time bins with corrected P values less than α = 0.05 were considered significant.

We generated 1,000 candidate IRFs using the gamma distribution with varying shape and rate parameter. We selected the IRF that yielded the highest correlation between the IRF-convolved pupil and the cortical gray matter BOLD signal.

Spectral power of BOLD and CSF signals was calculated using Chronux multitaper spectral estimation (five tapers). Power was estimated in the 60-s segments classified as awake, N1, N2 and N3, and the mean power in each participant was calculated from all low-motion (framewise displacement of <0.5) segments. N3 was not analyzed because only five participants entered N3. Statistical testing across spectra was performed with a permutation test that shuffled segments and then compared in frequency bins corresponding to the bandwidth (0.05 Hz), with Bonferroni correction for the number of frequency bins. Pairwise comparisons of mean low-frequency power (0.01–0.1 Hz) in Fig. 1f–h were computed within the participants who had awake data in both well-rested and sleep-deprived visits (n = 18) using a paired t-test. The distributions of spectral power of BOLD and CSF were assumed to be normal when performing t-tests, but this assumption was not formally tested.

Behavioral analyses (Fig. 3) included data from both the aPVT and vPVT. Because mean performance varies across visual and auditory tasks, the omission rate comparison was performed separately for vPVT and aPVT (Fig. 3b; P < 0.001 for each task).

For Fig. 4, awake omissions (n = 364) were identified in 26 participants, after excluding any omissions with simultaneous eyelid closures longer than 1 s, excluding any segments scored as sleep based on the EEG and excluding high-motion segments. All omissions during confirmed wakefulness periods were marked and their stimulus onset times were used to extract omission-locked signals in the EEG, pupil diameter, heart rate, respiratory flow rate, respiratory volume per time, peripheral vascular tone and CSF signal. Analyses of the spectrogram of the EEG signal collected inside the fMRI scanner used channel POz, calculated in the 0.5- to 30-Hz range using the multitaper method in 10-s epochs with a 0.1-s overlap. They were subsequently used to extract the oscillation-only spectrogram using the FOOOF algorithm in the 1- to 25-Hz range. To test for statistical significance of clusters in the EEG spectrogram and EEG oscillation-only spectrogram, the spectrograms were averaged and compared to a baseline window spectral power (–20 to –10 s relative to omission onset) using a paired two-tailed t-test. The P values corresponding to each pixel of the spectrogram were corrected with a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. To test for statistical significance of the peak in CSF, EEG broadband power, pupil and systemic physiology signals, we considered the window [–20, –10] s before the omission trial onset as baseline. Statistical significance was then calculated for the remaining window in 1-s bins: the signal in each bin was averaged and then compared to baseline using a paired (within-trial) two-sided t-test (P < 0.05). The P value was Bonferroni corrected for the number of time bins tested.

Additionally, three types of omissions (A, B and C) were separately analyzed by finding omissions that were preceded and followed by valid responses (Type A), the first of three or more consecutive omissions (Type B) and the last of three or more consecutive omissions (Type C). Eye-tracking videos were used to identify and exclude trials with long eyelid closures (>1 s). In total, 62 series of continuous omissions without long eyelid closures were identified. One Type B event and five Type C events were rejected due to high motion. The remaining omissions (Type A n = 127, Type B n = 61, Type C n = 57) were marked, and their stimulus onset times were used to extract omission-locked signals. Because this analysis focused on post-trial effects at recovery versus drops of attention, the analysis window was set to [–10, 30] s and the baseline was set to [–10, –5] s.

The transducer recording the PPG signal was placed on the left index finger, making sure heartbeats were visible in its signal. MRI scanner triggers were co-recorded with the physiological signals to allow data synchronization. We first removed artifactual spikes from the data by replacing time points exceeding 4 s.d. above the mean with the mean signal level. Low-pass filtering was then performed on the PPG and respiration belt signals at 30- and 10-Hz cutoffs, respectively. From the PPG signal, an indicator for peripheral vascular volume was derived by calculating the standard deviation of the PPG signal in 3-s segments, which is a measure of the excursion amplitude caused by the cardiac beat and is proportional to the volume of blood detected by the PPG sensor98. The variation in heart rate was computed by averaging the differences between pairs of adjacent heartbeats contained in the 6-s window around each trigger and dividing the result by 60 (beats per minute). The filtered chest belt signal was used to derive a measure of respiratory flow rate, which previously was found to strongly affect the fMRI signal throughout the brain99,100. This was done by taking the derivative of the low-pass-filtered belt signal, rectifying it and applying a secondary low-pass filter at a cutoff of 0.13 Hz. The respiratory volume per time was calculated using the standard deviation of the respiratory waveform on a sliding window of 6 s centered at each trigger.

The bidirectional flow measurement in Extended Data Fig. 6 used an independent cohort and new acquisition protocol designed to simultaneously measure inward and outward CSF flow. Ten healthy adults (four women and six men; age range 22 to 29 years, mean 24.1) were included. The same health and MRI exclusion criteria as for Experiment 1 were used. All individuals participated in a single scan session scheduled for 10:00 a.m. To induce attentional failures, participants underwent self-monitored sleep restriction in their homes, sleeping only 4 h the night before the scan. Scans were performed on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head and neck coil. Anatomical scans used a 1-mm isotropic multiecho MPRAGE. Functional runs were acquired using TR = 593 ms, 2.5-mm isotropic resolution, eight slices, FOV = 230 × 230, TE = 31 ms, no multiband, flip angle = 51° and no in-plane acceleration. The acquisition volume was positioned with the top slice intersecting the narrow opening of the fourth ventricle and the bottom slice at the base of the ventricle, allowing us to image both inward and outward CSF simultaneously (but not allowing acquisition of global BOLD signals). Analyses were performed locked to all isolated omissions, with an omission immediately preceded and followed by a hit. For analysis of outflow dynamics, the CSF ROI was manually traced with the top three slices of the imaging volume; for the inflow dynamics, the CSF ROI was traced with the bottom two slices of the imaging volume. All CSF outflow and inflow time series were converted to percent signal change by dividing the value of the time series by the 15th percentile value. The percent signal change in CSF outflow signal was inverted for display (Extended Data Fig. 6b) so that down represented outward flow in both time series.

(A) 24 subjects had valid EEG recordings during the resting-state scan at both well-rested and sleep deprived visits. Their sleep stages were scored according to the current AASM standard. (B) Mean framewise displacement (FD) values from the analyzed 60 s segments (after excluding frames with >0.5 mm FD) used in pairwise comparison in Fig. 1 E&H (N = 18 subjects). With our motion exclusion criteria there was no significant difference in motion in the analyzed segments across conditions (p = 0.43).

Cross-correlation was computed between pupil and CSF during two different conditions: 1) 60 s segments in rested wakefulness, 2) 60 s segments in sleep deprivation. All segments had at least one response time that was longer than 500 ms. Maximal cross-correlation r was observed during sleep-deprived condition with at least one CSF peak. A negative lag indicates pupil activity leads CSF activity. Segment length was 60 s. Black bars indicate significant (rested segments: n = 571; sleep deprived segments: n = 412; p < 0.05, paired t-test, Bonferroni corrected.) Data are presented as mean values ± standard error. Shading is standard error across segments.

Same analysis as in Fig. 3, with measures reported at the subject-level instead of segment-level. Shading is standard error across subjects (N = 23 subjects). Left column (panel A, C, E, G): Data are presented as mean values ± standard error. Shading is standard error across subjects (stars mark significant changes from baseline = [-30 -28]s, p < 0.05, t-test across subjects and time bins, Bonferroni corrected). Right column (panel B, D, F, H): Each gray line represents one subject's average across all CSF peaks detected in all runs.

(A) CSF flow at both well-rested and sleep deprived session showed a biphasic change locked to the omission trial onset. The mean CSF signal in the sleep deprived session was 3.3 percentage points higher than in the well-rested session. (B) Cortical BOLD signals in both well-rested (n = 87 segments) and sleep-deprived (n = 277 segments) sessions showed a similar biphasic pattern as the ventricular CSF, although with a dip in signal amplitude seconds before the omission trial onset. (C) Respiratory volume per time showed biphasic changes locked to omission trials onset. (D) Peripheral vascular volume also showed biphasic changes locked to omission trials onset. Black bars indicate significant difference from baseline (paired t-test, Bonferroni corrected, p < 0.05); same segments as in Fig. 3. Data are presented as mean values ± standard error across segments.

For all panels: Analysis excluded subjects with less than 4 omission trials in all visits. For panel A to F: Black bars with stars indicate significant changes from baseline = [-20 -18]s (N = 19 subjects, p < 0.05, paired t-test, Bonferroni corrected). Data are presented as mean values ± standard error across subjects. For panel G to L: Black bars with stars indicate significant changes from baseline = [-20 -18]s (N = 19 subjects, linear mixed-effects model (signal value at every time point: value ~ 1 + (1|subject). FDR corrected p values < 0.05.) Data are presented as mean values ± standard error across trials.

(A) Positioning of acquisition protocol for the second experiment, designed to measure bidirectional flow. Acquisition volume enabled simultaneous measures of outward flow (measured in the top slice) and inward flow (measured in the bottom slice). (B) This bidirectional imaging experiment replicated the coupling between omissions and CSF flow. CSF flow moves outward at the omission, and moves inward at the recovery of attention. (n = 114 trials, 10 subjects). CSF outflow signal is inverted to match directionality (down is outward flow). CSF flow is averaged relative to isolated omissions during wakefulness. Black bars indicate significant (p < 0.05, paired t-test, Bonferroni corrected) changes from baseline ([-10 -5] s). Data are presented as mean values ± standard error. Shading is standard error across segments.

(A) Example of a single subject resting-state EEG signal after sleep deprivation, recorded from channel POz, collected inside the fMRI scanner. As the subject slowly drifted from wakefulness to sleep, alpha activity (8-12 Hz) began to disappear (around 100 s) and low-frequency activity emerged. (B) NREM sleep in both well-rested and sleep-deprived conditions exhibited higher EEG low-frequency power (slow wave activity: 0.5-4 Hz) compared with the awake state. Data are presented as mean values ± standard error across segments.

(A) Contour indicates the period of significant power increase with FDR correction p < 0.05. (B) Contour indicates the period of significant oscillatory activity in SWA and alpha-beta (10-25 Hz) range with FDR correction p < 0.05. (C) Pz spectrogram locked to omission trial onset. (D) Fz spectrogram locked to omission trial onset. Same trials are analyzed as in Fig. 4, using different EEG channels.

(A) Data are presented as mean values ± standard error across subjects. We excluded subjects with less than 4 omission trials that survived motion exclusion in all visits for each omission type, yielding N = 19 subjects. (B) Same data as in Fig. 5, analyzed after taking the temporal derivative, to show timing of changes in flow. The change in CSF flow is apparent at the omission trial onset.

Genome annotation models that directly analyze DNA sequences are indispensable for modern biological research, enabling rapid and accurate identification of genes and other functional elements. Current annotation tools are typically developed for specific element classes and trained from scratch using supervised learning on datasets that are often limited in size. Here we frame the genome annotation problem as multilabel semantic segmentation and introduce a methodology for fine-tuning pretrained DNA foundation models to segment 14 different genic and regulatory elements at single-nucleotide resolution. We leverage the self-supervised pretrained model Nucleotide Transformer to develop a general segmentation model, SegmentNT, capable of processing DNA sequences up to 50-kb long and that achieves state-of-the-art performance on gene annotation, splice site and regulatory elements detection. We also integrated in our framework the foundation models Enformer and Borzoi, extending the sequence context up to 500 kb and enhancing performance on regulatory elements. Finally, we show that a SegmentNT model trained on human genomic elements generalizes to different species, and a multispecies SegmentNT model achieves strong generalization across unseen species. Our approach is readily extensible to additional models, genomic elements and species.

Genome annotation models play a pivotal role in modern biological research, providing the tools necessary to identify genes, their exon–intron structure and other functional elements directly from DNA sequences. This capability is becoming increasingly essential as the volume of sequenced genomes continues to grow exponentially, driven by advancements in sequencing technologies1. Accurate and efficient annotation of DNA sequences not only facilitates the understanding of genetic architecture but also is critical for applications such as genetic variant prediction and in silico sequence design.

Current annotation pipelines, such as BRAKER22 and MAKER23, rely on de novo sequence-based predictors using hidden Markov models (HMMs), including models such as Genscan4 and AUGUSTUS5,6. Although these models have single-nucleotide resolution, they lack the capacity to fully model biological complexity on their own and thus have limitations on predicting gene isoforms and when applied through whole chromosomes, requiring the integration with experimental data (for example, RNA sequencing) and homology to previously characterized proteins to improve accuracy. In addition, these models are focused on gene elements and cannot annotate other types of genomic element such as regulatory regions. This narrow focus restricts their performance and reduces their ability to generalize to novel or under-represented genomes.

Alternative methods for identifying regulatory elements such as promoters7,8, enhancers9,10,11,12 or poly(A) signals13,14,15 are usually developed for each specific element class separately and trained from scratch using supervised learning on datasets that are often limited in size. In addition, many of these tools are trained on curated datasets with different distribution from the use-case scenario, significantly hindering their performance when applied to actual genomes. As a result, there is a pressing need for more versatile approaches that can overcome these challenges, generalize to all relevant genomic element types and adapt to the rapidly expanding landscape of genomic data. A model that can learn sequence dependencies directly from the DNA and efficiently annotate complete genomes with high accuracy would not only streamline genome annotation processes but also deepen our understanding of the genomic code.

The intersection of genomics research and deep learning methods is profoundly changing our ability to understand the information encoded in the human genome16,17. The abundance of available sequencing and omics data have recently led to the development of DNA foundation models—large models (hundreds of millions to billions of parameters) trained on large datasets (hundreds of billions to trillions of tokens) that can be used to solve multiple (dozens to hundreds) of tasks. These include models trained in a supervised manner on thousands of experimental data (for example, Enformer18 and Borzoi19) or trained in a self-supervised setting across various unlabeled genome sequences20,21,22,23,24,25,26. This last approach in particular is very promising for genomics, given the ability of such foundation models to be trained on unlabeled data (for example, raw genomes or experimental sequencing data), creating general-purpose representations capable of solving a multitude of downstream tasks, similarly to what has been observed in other fields such as natural language processing and computer vision27,28,29,30,31.

In this work, we explore the use of DNA foundation models and their learned representations to develop versatile models capable of annotating the location of several types of element in the genome at single-nucleotide resolution. Given the similarities between localizing elements at nucleotide resolution in a DNA sequence and localizing objects in images at pixel resolution, usually referred to as segmentation task32,33,34, we framed the genome annotation problem as multilabel semantic segmentation and adopted a segmentation architecture that proved useful in that field. More specifically, we built a DNA segmentation model, the Segment-Nucleotide Transformer (SegmentNT), which combines the pretrained DNA foundation model Nucleotide Transformer (NT)22 and a one-dimensional (1D) U-Net 32 architecture and trained it to predict the location of 14 types of human regulatory and gene element in input sequences up to 30 kb at single-nucleotide resolution. We show that SegmentNT achieves high performance on gene annotation, splice site and regulatory elements detection throughout the genome and generalizes to input sequences up to 50 kb. Our framework is compatible with different DNA encoders, as we demonstrate by integrating two additional DNA foundation models, Enformer and Borzoi, which allowed the extension of the sequence context to 500 kb, enhancing performance on regulatory element detection. We further fine-tuned our best SegmentNT-30kb model on multiple species and show improved generalization to unseen animal and plant species. Our framework is general and readily extensible to additional DNA foundation models, genomic elements and species genomes.

We developed a model called SegmentNT to annotate the location of several genomic element in a sequence at single-nucleotide resolution. Following segmentation principles, we framed this problem as a multilabel semantic segmentation, computing a binary mask over nucleotides for each type of element. SegmentNT combines the pretrained DNA foundation model NT22 and a segmentation head to detect elements at different scales (Fig. 1a). For a segmentation head, we make use of a 1D U-Net architecture that downscales and upscales the foundation model embeddings of the input DNA sequence (Fig. 1b and see also Linder et al.19 for a recent use-case of U-Net in genomics). This architecture is trained end-to-end on a dataset of genomic annotations to minimize a focal loss objective33 to deal with element scarcity in the dataset (Methods).

a, The SegmentNT neural network architecture consists of a pretrained DNA encoder (here NT22) and a segmentation head (here a U-Net). The output is the probabilities for each genomic element at nucleotide resolution. b, As a segmentation head, we use a 1D U-Net architecture with two downsampling and two upsampling convolutional blocks with U-Net skip connections. We added the dimensions of each layer. We note N the number of nucleotides in the DNA sequence and L the number of DNA tokens (with roughly L ≈ N/6). c, Performance of SegmentNT trained on 3-kb and 10-kb sequences on 14 types of genomic element. We used as metric the MCC. The data are presented as mean MCC values ± 95% confidence interval from ten different samplings of the test set. d, A representative example of annotations and predicted probabilities of the 14 types of genomic element at the NOP56/IDH3B gene locus located in the test set. Gene isoforms with respective exons and introns, as well as promoter and enhancer regulatory elements, are shown. e, A comparison of performance between SegmentNT and different model ablations and architectures. The metrics used are the MCC, Jaccard index, F1 score, area under the auPRC and SOV score. arch., architectures; M, million; k, thousand. Performance for each metric is presented as mean metric values ± standard deviation across the 14 different element types. The color scales are normalized per column.

To train SegmentNT, we curated a dataset of annotations at nucleotide-level precision for 14 types of genomic element in the human genome derived from GENCODE35 and ENCODE36, including gene elements (protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 5′ untranslated region (UTR), 3′UTR, exon, intron, splice acceptor and donor sites) and regulatory elements (poly(A) signal, tissue-invariant and tissue-specific promoters and enhancers, and CTCF-bound sites) (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1). Since these element annotations can overlap, SegmentNT predicts separately the probability of belonging to each of the genomic elements at the nucleotide level. For example, in different gene transcript isoforms the same DNA region can be considered an exon or an intron, enhancers can also be found in gene regions, and poly(A) signals are usually in the 3′UTRs of genes. In addition, here we used the canonical definition of exons as any part of a gene that can be present in the final mature RNA after introns have been removed by RNA splicing, thus also overlapping with 5′ and 3′UTRs. This allows the prediction of every genomic element independent of the other predictions. The annotation of all promoter and enhancer regions in the human genome was derived from the latest registry of candidate cis-regulatory elements by ENCODE (https://screen.encodeproject.org/)37. It contains 790,000 enhancers and 34,000 promoters grouped by their activity in different tissues.

We first trained a model to segment these distinct 14 genomic elements in input DNA sequences of 3 kb (SegmentNT-3kb). This model was further fine-tuned on 10 kb input sequences (SegmentNT-10kb) to extend its input length. This was achieved by initializing SegmentNT-10kb from the best checkpoint of the SegmentNT-3kb model for a more efficient training and length-adaptation. For a given input sequence, these models make 42,000 and 140,000 predictions, respectively, each being the probability of a given nucleotide to belong to a genomic element type. For binary classification metrics we used as threshold 0.5 to annotate nucleotides as belonging to each element type. Model training, validation and performance evaluation were performed on different sets of chromosomes from the human genome, accounting for homologous sequences to ensure no data leakage and that the test set provides a robust evaluation of model performance. The models were evaluated on ten different samplings of the test set and the performance was assessed using each nucleotide as a separate prediction and with various metrics: Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), area under the precision–recall curve (auPRC), Jaccard similarity and the F1-score (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, we used the segment overlap score (SOV) to evaluate the various models at the region level38 (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 2). SegmentNT-3kb demonstrated high accuracy in localizing the different elements to nucleotide precision, showing an MCC on the test set above 0.5 for exons, splice sites, 3′UTRs and tissue-invariant promoter regions (Fig. 1c). LncRNA and CTCF-binding sites were the most difficult elements to predict, with test MCC values below 0.1. We observed superior performance of the model in sequences of 10 kb (average MCC of 0.42) compared with 3kb (0.37), in particular for protein-coding genes, 3′UTRs, exons and introns, suggesting that these elements depend on longer sequence contexts (Fig. 1c). These results were consistent across the different metrics (Supplementary Fig. 2).

To further evaluate predictive performance, we inspected regions of the held-out test chromosomes. Evaluating SegmentNT-10kb on a 10-kb window that covers the gene NOP56 on the positive strand and the end of the gene IDH3B on the negative strand shows that it accurately predicts the different genic elements of each gene (Fig. 1d). SegmentNT correctly predicts both genes as protein coding, their 5′UTR and 3′UTR positions, their splice sites and exon–intron structure and also the poly(A) signals. In addition, SegmentNT captures the promoter region of NOP56, both the tissue-specific and tissue-invariant ones. This region also contains multiple enhancers and some of those are correctly predicted by the model. Still, although our global performance metric for enhancers is good (MCC of 0.27 for tissue-specific and 0.19 for tissue-invariant for SegmentNT-10kb), we observe that enhancer predictions are more noisy. This could be related to their higher sequence complexity and diversity, and we expect that grouping them by cell type-specific activity should further improve model performance (Discussion). Additional comparisons between SegmentNT models and competitive approaches for gene annotation, splice site prediction and detection of regulatory elements are detailed in later sections.

We next evaluated our model design choices and the importance of using the NT pretrained foundation model as a DNA encoder. We present all model baseline and ablation architectures and results in Supplementary Tables 1–3 and statistical tests in Supplementary Fig. 3. We first compared the performance of SegmentNT with different model ablations, using 3-kb input sequences for a simpler comparison (Methods). We removed the NT DNA encoder and trained two 1D U-Net architectures that take one-hot encoded DNA sequences directly as input instead of the NT embeddings: one with the same 63 million parameters of the head of SegmentNT and a larger one with an additional downsampling/upsampling block featuring a total of 252 million parameters. We tested an additional one that first expands the raw DNA sequence input to the same vocabulary dimension of the NT embeddings (1,024) before passing it through the same U-Net architecture as SegmentNT. These three U-Net architectures demonstrated substantially reduced performance across all elements, with an average MCC of 0.07 (66 million), 0.11 (250 million) and 0.07 (1,024-embedding) compared with 0.37 for SegmentNT-3kb, demonstrating the value of using a DNA encoder (Fig. 1e).

To test the benefit of pretraining the NT foundation model, we trained a model version with the same architecture as SegmentNT but using a randomly initialized NT DNA encoder model, rather than the pretrained one. Our ablation study shows that on this task, self-supervised pretraining on genomes allows our SegmentNT model to converge seven times faster to an asymptotic performance twice greater across all 14 genomic elements: average MCC 0.37 compared with 0.16 for the version with a random initialized NT (Fig. 1e). Additional ablation analyses showed that (1) fine-tuning both the NT DNA encoder and the U-Net head achieves higher performance (Fig. 1e), and (2) SegmentNT using the NT pretrained on multispecies genomes is superior to one using an NT model that was pretrained on thousands of human genomes (NTv1 human22) (Fig. 1e).

Finally, we compared SegmentNT with two other popular, small CNN architectures in genomics developed for nucleotide-resolution tasks that do not use pretrained models: BPNet39 and SpliceAI40, which proved successful in modeling transcription-factor binding and splicing, respectively. We used their original architectures (BPNet 120,000 and SpliceAI 700,000 parameters) and scaled versions where we increase the embedding dimensions across all their layers (Methods). Despite the small scale, the initial SpliceAI architecture (average MCC 0.18) achieved improved performance over both BPNet (0.10), U-Net (0.07) and SegmentNT with a randomly initialized NT encoder model (0.16) (Fig. 1e). We could further increase its performance to an average MCC of 0.27 by scaling the model embeddings, showing its effective architecture among supervised CNN models, however still far from our SegmentNT approach (0.37). We note that these CNN architectures could still be further optimized to this multielement segmentation task, but it is out of scope of this work. Overall, the superior performance of SegmentNT over these different model baselines demonstrates the value of DNA foundation models for solving challenging tasks in genomics such as localizing different types of genomic element at a single-nucleotide resolution.

We next investigated how to extend the sequence context length of SegmentNT, motivated by the improved results observed for SegmentNT-10kb over SegmentNT-3kb and the long-range interactions prevalent in the human genome (Fig. 1c). Given that NT uses rotary positional embeddings (RoPE41) that were set to support sequences up to 12 kb during its pretraining, using NT directly on sequences longer than 12 kb, whether for fine-tuning or inference, would yield poor performance due to the periodic nature of RoPE encoding. To address this problem, we explored recent approaches that have been proposed for extending contexts of RoPE models by converting the problem of length extrapolation into one of ‘interpolation'. Specifically, we employ a context-length extension method first formally described in ref. 42, where the frequency used in RoPE embeddings is rescaled to account for longer sequences (see also refs. 43,44). This approach can be used not only for extending the context length of SegmentNT during the fine-tuning on sequences longer than 12 kb but also for performing inference with SegmentNT models on sequences longer than the ones seen during training. We investigated both scenarios below.

We implemented context-length extension in NT and trained two additional SegmentNT models that segment the 14 genomic elements in DNA sequences of 20 kb (SegmentNT-20kb) and 30 kb (SegmentNT-30kb) (Methods). Evaluation on the same test chromosomes showed consistent improvements in performance with increased sequence length, in particular for the segmentation of protein-coding genes, 3′UTRs and exons and introns (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The model with the best performance across all elements was SegmentNT-30kb with an average MCC of 0.45 (Fig. 2b).

The gene isoforms with respective exons and introns, as well as promoter and enhancer regulatory elements are shown.

Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune SegmentNT on even longer sequence lengths, we tested if we could leverage context-length extension to evaluate a model pretrained on a given length on longer sequences. We tested this approach on the SegmentNT-10kb model and evaluated it with or without context-length extension on the prediction of sequences up to 100 kb from the same test chromosomes (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4). Context-length extension substantially improved the performance of the model on longer sequences, in particular on 100 kb where the original model showed very poor performance (average MCC of 0.26 versus 0.07, respectively).

This motivated us to more systematically test how far our different SegmentNT models could be extended. To address that, we evaluated the performance of all trained SegmentNT models (3, 10, 20 and 30 kb) on input sequence lengths between 3 and 100 kb using context length extension interpolation when needed. When averaging the performance across 14 elements, this revealed that the model trained on the longest context length (SegmentNT-30kb) achieved the best results when evaluated in all context lengths, including shorter sequences (Fig. 2d). We observed top performance for 50 kb input sequences (average MCC of 0.47) and a drop in performance for sequences longer than 50 kb, although SegmentNT-30kb still has good performance on sequences of 100 kb (0.45) (Fig. 2d). These results highlight the flexibility of SegmentNT and how it can be applied to sequences of different lengths. We note that the SegmentNT-30kb model when segmenting the 14 genomic elements in an 50-kb input sequence makes 700,000 predictions at once (14 × 50,000), thus providing a very rich segmentation output (see an example of the SegmentNT-30kb predictions for a 50-kb locus in the test set with three overlapping genes (Fig. 2e)).

Finally, we have used our best 30-kb longer-range model to investigate in more detail the performance gaps of SegmentNT and if the mispredictions are coming from edge effects of annotations, in particular for regulatory elements where hard boundaries are more arbitrary or spurious predictions in random locations. To do this, per type of element, we have calculated the enrichment of mispredictions at regions edges, inside regions or in random locations outside labeled regions. We observed, for all elements, a strong enrichment of mispredictions not only at edge nucleotides but also at nucleotides inside the labeled regions. For all regulatory element classes, the enrichment of mispredictions inside elements was higher than at the edges, suggesting that the performance gaps come from worse predictions in some whole regions rather than poorly predicted edge effects across regions (Supplementary Table 4).

Although SegmentNT demonstrates broad generalizability across various types of genomic element, leveraging sequence representations from the NT pretrained DNA encoder, its capacity to process longer sequences is constrained by the limitations of the DNA encoder itself (50 kb, as demonstrated above) (Fig. 2d). Moreover, the performance on certain types of element studied here could potentially be improved by utilizing DNA encoders that better capture their specific sequence features. Therefore, we investigated alternative models as DNA encoders within our framework, aiming to both extend the input sequence length and assess their generalization across diverse genomic elements.

We compared SegmentNT's performance when using NT, Enformer18 and Borzoi19 as DNA encoders (Fig. 3a). In contrast to NT, Enformer and Borzoi are long-range models pretrained in a supervised manner to predict thousands of epigenetic and gene expression tracks in various mouse and human cell types and, thus, might have learned better representations of regulatory elements for instance. Both models integrate CNNs with a transformer architecture, processing long sequences as input (Enformer, 196 kb; Borzoi, 524 kb) but predicting at lower resolution (Enformer, 128 bp; Borzoi, 32 bp). For a systematic comparison with SegmentNT, we have combined the pretrained representations from their last layer, before the prediction heads, to our U-Net segmentation head and fine-tuned the whole network on our segmentation dataset using either the same 30-kb input sequences or the model's original input length, 196 kb for Enformer and 524 kb for Borzoi (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 1–3). We named these new architectures SegmentEnformer and SegmentBorzoi models for simplicity.

a, Cartoons displaying how the different DNA encoders are combined with the U-Net segmentation head to create SegmentNT, SegmentEnformer and SegmentBorzoi models. The model input and output dimensions are shown within parentheses. L, input sequence length. Since each output token in Enformer and Borzoi represents 128- and 32-bp bins, respectively, the segmentation head needs to predict the respective number of probabilities per element per nucleotide, that is 14 × 2 × 128 for Enformer and 14 × 2 × 32 for Borzoi. b, Performance of the different models on the 14 types of genomic element. We used as metric the MCC. The data are presented as mean MCC values ± 95% confidence interval from ten different samplings of the test set. c, Average MCC performance of the different models across the 14 elements. The data are presented as mean MCC values ± 95% confidence interval from the 14 elements.

We first compared the performance of the three models using 30-kb input sequences (Fig. 3b). On average, SegmentNT (average MCC of 0.45) achieved superior performance than SegmentEnformer (0.34) and SegmentBorzoi (0.35) (Fig. 3c). However, their performances varied across the different genomic elements. SegmentNT outperformed the others in identifying gene elements, including protein-coding genes, 5′UTR, 3′UTR, exons, introns, splice acceptor and donor sites and poly(A) signals. Notably, for splice site and poly(A) signal prediction—tasks that require high resolution to accurately annotate single- or few-nucleotide elements—SegmentEnformer and SegmentBorzoi performed poorly, probably due to their presegmentation resolution limits of 128- and 32-bp bins, respectively. By contrast, SegmentEnformer and SegmentBorzoi showed improved segmentation of lncRNAs, CTCF-bound sites and promoter and enhancer regulatory elements (Fig. 3b). This improved performance reflects the supervised pretraining of Enformer and Borzoi on epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles, which enhanced their ability to represent these specific sequence elements, supporting our hypothesis that different DNA encoders capture distinct features and can be more suitable for certain types of element.

We next analyzed the performance of SegmentEnformer and SegmentBorzoi with extended input sequences of 196 and 524 kb, respectively. Both models showed an overall performance improvement compared to their 30-kb versions (Fig. 3b,c), largely driven by enhanced accuracy in identifying protein-coding genes, lncRNAs and introns—longer elements that previously also benefited from increased sequence length (Fig. 2a). SegmentBorzoi demonstrated additional gains in both UTR regions, probably due to its pretraining with RNA sequencing data that allowed it to learn comprehensive features of gene structure and all types of transcribed region19; unlike Enformer, which was pretrained using only CAGE expression data that primarily captures the start of gene transcription18. As anticipated, performance on regulatory elements did not improve significantly, as these elements do not typically require long-distance interactions. Despite those improvements, the average performance of both models across genomic elements was still significantly lower than SegmentNT (Fig. 3c). Overall, our findings emphasize that specific DNA encoders can be leveraged to achieve superior performance on particular genomic elements, while SegmentNT remains the best default approach due to its consistent generalization across all element types.

After having explored the different aspects of the SegmentNT architecture, we investigated the performance of our best SegmentNT-30kb model in established gene annotation tasks. Here, we compared our model with the established HMM gene finder AUGUSTUS5,6, state-of-the-art among sequence-based gene finders3, using both nucleotide- and region-level metrics. We first evaluated the two models in the gene annotation task presented at the recent BEND benchmark45, analyzing only sequences in the SegmentNT test chromosomes. Since our model predicts all gene isoforms—but this task considers only the main isoform of each gene—we have adapted it to create a version with only genes that contain a single isoform (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 5a) and a version that contains all genes and respective isoforms, allowing multiple labels per nucleotide (Fig. 4c, Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). We measured their performance using the standard F1-score and the MCC metric, using 0.5 as the probability threshold.

a,c,d, Accuracy of SegmentNT-30kb and AUGUSTUS for the different gene elements in different datasets: 30-kb segments with genes using only their main isoform (a), 30-kb segments with genes considering all annotated gene isoforms (c) and whole segmentation test chromosomes considering all annotated gene isoforms (d). The metric used was the F1-score. b, Precision and recall for SegmentNT-30kb and AUGUSTUS for the different gene elements in the dataset of 30-kb segments with genes using only their main isoform. e, Precision and recall for SegmentNT-30kb and AUGUSTUS for the different gene elements in the whole segmentation test chromosomes, considering all annotated gene isoforms. f–h, Performance of SegmentNT-30kb and AUGUSTUS for the region-level metric SOV38 for the different gene elements in different datasets: 30-kb segments with genes using only their main isoform (f), 30-kb segments with genes considering all annotated gene isoforms (g) and whole segmentation test chromosomes considering all annotated gene isoforms (h). The metric used was the SOV score. The error bars in the gene segments analyses in a, c, f and g represent 95% confidence intervals estimated from 100-fold bootstrapping. The performance in the whole-chromosome test set in d and h is presented as mean metric values ± 95% confidence interval from ten different data samplings.

Our results demonstrated that SegmentNT-30kb is competitive with AUGUSTUS for the easier setting of segmenting the main isoform of various genes, achieving improved performance for splice donor sites, similar performance for introns and splice acceptor sites, and worse performance for coding sequence (CDS) regions (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 5a). The latter is due to lower precision despite having similar recall (Fig. 4b). When considering all confident gene isoforms, SegmentNT-30kb outperforms the HMM model in all gene elements in both metrics (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). In all cases, SegmentNT-30kb has higher recall, most of the times accompanied by higher precision.

Finally, we compared both models along the test set settings of SegmentNT, where the model needs to segment the gene regions along the whole test set chromosomes, where most regions do not contain genes, together with their respective isoforms (Fig. 4d,e and Supplementary Fig. 5d). Also here, SegmentNT-30kb outperformed AUGUSTUS and achieved superior performance across all gene elements by a large margin, with both higher recall and precision. The results were largely consistent when evaluating the annotations at region level through SOV scores38, although the improvement over AUGUSTUS was smaller for the whole-chromosome test set compared with the nucleotide-level metrics (Fig. 4f–h). Overall, our results agree with the limitations of this type of tools when scanned through the whole genome, in contrast to their very high accuracy when segmenting a genic region, and highlights the superior performance of SegmentNT on the complex task of whole-genome segmentation.

One of the main nucleotide-level tasks in genomics that has been tackled by previous models is splice site detection, where SpliceAI40 and Pangolin46 are considered state of the art. We first compared SegmentNT-30kb with the specialized SpliceAI-10kb and Pangolin models on detecting splice donor and acceptor nucleotides on a gene from our test set (EBF4) (Fig. 5a). SegmentNT correctly predicts all exons and introns in addition to all splice sites, including the ones of the alternative exon at the gene start. When comparing the different models we observe that SpliceAI and Pangolin predict all existent splice sites but over-predict additional sites outside but sometimes also inside transcript boundaries (Fig. 5a, red asterisks).

The gene isoforms with respective exons and introns are shown together with splice site predictions for the different models. SpliceAI/Pangolin mispredicted regions are highlighted with asterisks and regions outside gene boundaries in gray. We note that SpliceAI and Pangolin have not been trained for out-of-transcript-boundary applications and are expected to make further false positives when applied there.

The error bars in mRNA-only analysis in b represent the 95% confidence intervals estimated from 100-fold bootstrapping. The performance in the multispecies dataset is based on the average across 20 species.

The auPRC values are shown along with different thresholds for each model. i,j, Radar plots depicting the predictive performance of the four models for splice donor (i) and acceptor (j) sites.

For a comprehensive comparison covering different use-cases, we evaluated each model in both SpliceAI's and Pangolin's test set composed of only mRNA sequences and adapted to 30-kb windows and in our whole-chromosome test set, using only genes in the positive strand to match the training scenarios of SpliceAI and Pangolin (Methods). We note that Pangolin has a different training scheme and does not differentiate between acceptor and donor sites, predicting a single splice site label that we converted into acceptor and donor predictions for a more direct comparison. We evaluated the models' performance using not only the standard splicing metrics auPRC, precision–recall curves and top-k accuracy40 but also MCC as a classification metric using the recommended threshold of 0.5 for all models (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Compared with the original SpliceAI publication40, we observed a small reduction in performance (0.98 in original study compared with 0.96 for the acceptor and 0.94 for the donor here) due to the adaptations in the dataset required for a direct comparison between models: namely, the sequence windows of 30 kb and the removal of sequences with Ns (Methods).

SegmentNT-30kb achieved comparable performance to SpliceAI and Pangolin on their test set: auPRC for donor sites of 0.93 versus 0.94 and 0.94 and for acceptor sites of 0.93 versus 0.96 and 0.94, respectively (Fig. 5b–d and Supplementary Fig. 6a). On SegmentNT's whole-genome test set, our model showed higher classification performance as measured by MCC on both donor and acceptor sites (Fig. 5e). When considering the ranking-based metrics, SegmentNT-30kb had similar auPRC values as SpliceAI and Pangolin for splice donors but lower values for splice acceptor sites (Fig. 5f,g); the top-k accuracy was similar for all models for splice acceptor but was higher for SegmentNT-30kb for splice donor sites (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Despite this high performance overall, we observed lower performance for SegmentNT and Pangolin compared with SpliceAI on noncoding RNA splice splices, suggesting that the high splicing detection performance could be driven by some correlative signal from coding sequence (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Overall, SegmentNT detects splice donor and acceptor sites in coding sequences with high accuracy, being more precise across the genome than current methods.

Regarding the detection of regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers, to our knowledge there are no models that can predict the location of such elements in large input sequences at nucleotide resolution. Most existent models are trained on curated datasets with sequences of the same size of promoters or enhancers, significantly hindering their performance in relevant use-cases such as annotating them in actual genomes. We have compared our best segmentation models (SegmentNT, SegmentEnformer and SegmentBorzoi) with competitive approaches that use model classifiers in a sliding-window setting to derive nucleotide-level predictions (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Here, we used as binary classifiers the DeePromoter for promoter prediction7 as well as the NT models fine-tuned on promoter and enhancer sequences that were shown to be state-of-the-art in a previous benchmark22 (Methods). We compared these different approaches for the prediction of promoters and enhancers at nucleotide resolution on 30-kb input sequences, combining tissue-invariant and tissue-specific ones into a single class since the benchmarked models are global predictors of promoters and enhancers, respectively.

SegmentNT-30kb outperformed the sliding-window baselines for both promoter and enhancer annotation (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c). Similar to our previous analyses (Fig. 3b), using Enformer and Borzoi as DNA encoders further improved the performance on this task, with SegmentEnformer achieving the highest performance (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c). Despite the strong performance of DeePromoter on their curated test set, we observed poor generalization to the context of genomics sequences when compared with sliding the NT models, probably due to the design of their test set (see Methods for details). In addition to improved performance, since our segmentation models make all predictions at once for all nucleotides they are much faster on inference on large sequences, which will permit faster evaluation on regions with candidate genetic variants and along full personalized genomes (Supplementary Fig. 7d). These results show that our models show improved performance on annotating regulatory elements with nucleotide precision, despite the less-strict boundaries of these elements that prevent higher performance scores.

We next explored how SegmentNT trained on human genomic elements could generalize to other species (Fig. 6a). Gene annotations for more distant, less-studied species are less accurate, while annotations of regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers are very scarce. Thus, models that can predict these elements for different species hold great potential. In addition, comparison of predictions across species should provide insights about the evolutionary constraints of each element.

We used as metric the MCC. The data are shown as the mean MCC values from ten different samplings of each species' test set. n.a., not applicable. c, A comparison between MCC performance and divergence time per gene element. The MCC was averaged for species with the same evolutionary distance. d–g, A radar plot depicting the performance of the human and multispecies SegmentNT models per element for species in the training set (d), human-close animal species in the test set (e), human-distant animal species in the test set (f) and plant species in the test set (g). h, A performance of the human (H) and multispecies (MS) model per element for four representative species. The data are shown as the mean MCC values from ten different samplings of each species' test set. i, A performance of AUGUSTUS compared with SegmentNT-30kb human and multispecies models for the annotation of genes in the genomes of the different species. The data are presented as mean MCC values ± 95% confidence interval across seven gene elements.

For this analysis, we selected an additional set of 15 animal and 5 plant species and for each curated a dataset of annotations for the seven main genomic elements available from Ensembl47, namely protein-coding gene, 5′UTR, 3′UTR, intron, exon, splice acceptor and donor sites (Methods). This allows us to evaluate the performance of the human model in each species on the seven element types, while for the other seven elements our predictions might be informative of potential regulatory regions. While some of these species are less studied and thus have annotations that are mostly based on bioinformatics predictions, they still permit the comparison of the generalization of our models against competitive approaches. Similar to the human datasets, each dataset was split in train, validation and test chromosomes, removing orthologous sequences to ensure no data leakage. We selected our best model trained on the human 14 genomic elements, SegmentNT-30kb, and evaluated it on each species test set.

We observed a high performance of the human SegmentNT-30kb model across species and particularly high for exon and splice sites, correlating with their high evolutionary conservation (Fig. 6b,c). For the other elements the performance was good for related species such as gorilla and macaque but dropped for more evolutionary-distant animals and plants. This shows that the SegmentNT-30kb model can generalize to some extent to other species, even for plants whose genome structure is very different, but that the performance depends on the evolutionary distance of the genomic elements and species.

Since gene elements have evolved and therefore their sequence determinants might differ between species, we trained an additional, multispecies model (SegmentNT-30kb-multispecies) by fine-tuning the human SegmentNT-30kb model on the genic annotations of human together with five selected animal species: mouse, chicken, fly, zebrafish and worm (Methods). The remaining ten animal and five plant species were kept as held-out test set species for comparing the generalization capabilities of the human and multispecies models. We note that since most training species have limited annotation of regulatory elements, we focused this multispecies model only on genic elements and, therefore, it should not be used for the prediction of regulatory elements. The performance of the SegmentNT-30kb-multispecies model improved quickly during fine-tuning, leveraging its previously acquired knowledge of human elements. We observed improved performance for the test chromosomes of the training species for the SegmentNT-30kb-multispecies model over the human SegmentNT-30kb model (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9), showing that gene elements diverged between species and it is necessary to adjust the model accordingly.

We next evaluated both human and multispecies SegmentNT-30kb models on the held-out set of ten animal species, splitting them in two groups: six with an estimated divergence time from human of less than 100 Myr (human-close species) and four more distant (more than 100 Myr, human-distant; the data are from https://timetree.org). The human model generalizes well for unseen species and showed better performance for human-close (average MCC of 0.62) than human-distant species (average MCC of 0.49) (Fig. 6e,f). SegmentNT-30kb-multispecies demonstrated similarly good performance on human-close species (average MCC of 0.64) and improved performance on human-distant species (average MCC of 0.57) over the human model (0.49) (Fig. 6e,f). In addition, the SegmentNT-30kb-multispecies model showed improved performance over its human counterpart for the prediction of splice sites (Fig. 5h–j and Supplementary Fig. 6d).

Finally, we evaluated the performance of both models on five plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max (soybean), Oryza sativa (rice), Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Zea mays (corn/maize). We note that the multispecies model was only trained on animal genomes and did not see any plant genome. Still, we observed a strong improvement of the SegmentNT-30kb-multispecies model over the human model across all plants (average MCC of 0.45 versus 0.34) (Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 9). Although the performance on plant genomes (average MCC of 0.45) was lower than on human-distant animal genomes (0.57), the SegmentNT-30kb-multispecies model can still be very useful to annotate the genomes of poorly characterized plants. This is particularly encouraging, given the large difference in genome structure between animals and plants, whose genomes are characterized by distinct evolutionary patterns including distinct genome conservation (that is, coding versus noncoding sequence maintenance), genome architecture (for example, repeats expansion) and, notably, major polyploidization processes48,49. In the case of Z. mays and T. aestivum, whose genomes are tetraploid and hexaploid, respectively, and have undergone large-scale rearrangements, it is encouraging that the multispecies model still retained predictive performance. Although the genomic code is not expected to change, such changes increase the sequence diversity of the different types of element. In addition, it outperforms AUGUSTUS on gene annotation in all species except for Arabidopsis (Fig. 6i and Supplementary Fig. 10). This SegmentNT-30kb-multispecies model is thus more general and can generalize better to species not included in the training set (Fig. 6h). Altogether, these results show that SegmentNT can be easily extended to additional genomic elements and species, including plants, which opens up promising new research directions to be explored in future work.

Here, we introduce a methodology for fine-tuning DNA foundation models to segment different genic and regulatory elements at single-nucleotide resolution. Our best model, SegmentNT, is an extension of the DNA foundation model NT and is capable of processing DNA sequences up to 50-kb long. We show highest performance for genic elements, including splice sites, and how each element depends on different context windows. For a given 50-kb sequence, SegmentNT makes 700,000 predictions at once, allowing annotation of any input sequence in a very efficient way. SegmentNT trained on the human genome can already generalize to other species, but to make SegmentNT more broadly applicable to annotate sequences from different species, we developed a multispecies version that improves generalization to unseen species. We make our best models available on our GitHub repository and HuggingFace space.

SegmentNT provides strong evidence that DNA foundation models can tackle complex tasks in genomics at single-nucleotide resolution. Up until now, there is no consensus for the benefit of pretrained foundation models for genomics. There has been limited improvements on most tasks where these models have been evaluated on21,22,23,26,43,45. Here, we focused on a more challenging task of segmenting various genomic elements in DNA sequences at nucleotide resolution, compared with single tasks of classifying short sequences as containing a given type of element. Our results show that the highest performance is achieved by combining a pretrained NT and a segmentation U-Net head, when compared with applying such segmentation architectures directly from one-hot encoded DNA sequences. This is a strong evidence for the value added by such pretrained models and points to the need of expanding their applications and evaluations to more realistic tasks in genomics.

A current limitation of DNA foundation models is their limited context length. NT was the pretrained model with the largest context length at its time, trained on sequences of up to 12 kb (ref. 22). Since then different approaches have been proposed to extend the context of such models, mostly by relying on novel state-space architectures to avoid the quadratic scaling of Transformers23,24,44. Here, we took a different approach and extended the context of SegmentNT through context-length extrapolation in both training and evaluation phases, showing improved performance for sequences up to 50 kb (see also ref. 43). In addition, we showed that replacing the DNA encoder by the longer-range pretrained genomics models Enformer18 and Borzoi19 allows us to segment sequences of 524 kb, which improved the performance in gene regulatory elements. We expect that extending the context of NT and SegmentNT models to longer sequences with efficient context-extension approaches will yield further improvements for DNA segmentation tasks. Many techniques have recently emerged in fields such as natural language processing that manage to increase the input length of Transformer models to process hundreds of thousands of tokens at a time50,51,52,53. These approaches together with the new developments of state-space models provide promising avenues to build the next generation of models.

We have extensively benchmarked SegmentNT against state-of-the-art tools specialized in the different domains of gene annotation, splicing detection and prediction of regulatory elements. SegmentNT generally matched or outperformed the respective competitors while being able to solve all tasks at once. For gene annotation tasks, we have not compared our model with alternative approaches that consider experimental data (for example, chromhmm54) or ortholog sequence alignments (for example, CACTUS55) and focused on purely sequence-based tasks and baselines for a fair comparison. However, it would be worth to explore how to integrate SegmentNT within those established gene annotation pipelines. We note that during the revision process, Tiberius56, a novel deep learning-based gene predictor, was published; further comparative analyses with our model are necessary to evaluate relative performance.

In this work, we modeled promoter and enhancer regulatory elements based on experimentally validated genomic regions labeled by their biochemical properties, as defined by the ENCODE consortium37. This contrasts with approaches that directly predict biochemical marks such as chromatin accessibility, histone modifications or transcription-factor binding, as seen in models such as Enformer18 and Borzoi19. By considering regulatory elements as discrete annotated regions, our approach offers additional value on two main fronts: (1) such labels encapsulate multiple biochemical signals, which may collectively represent functional distinctions that are less apparent when evaluating individual marks in isolation; and (2) predicting these consolidated labels allows to generalize across species better than predicting biochemical data that are more tissue/species-specific. Still, we acknowledge that the annotation we used is a simplification, given the complexity of regulatory elements in terms of their sequence features and activity across different cell types and contexts. To address this, we categorized promoters and enhancers into tissue-invariant and tissue-specific classes, already observing different performance between these groups. In future work, we expect that further refining these categories by splitting promoters and enhancers according to specific cell types, allowing the model to capture more granular, cell type-specific regulatory codes, should enhance the accuracy of regulatory element predictions.

An important result of our work is the demonstration that SegmentNT trained on human genomic elements can generalize to unseen species, both animal and plant. The generalization is stronger for splice sites and exons, probably due to their high conservation. In addition, we observed reduced generalization for species with longer divergence times to human. To improve the generalization to more distant species, we developed a SegmentNT-multispecies version that shows improved performance on unseen animal and plant species. It is notable how this model, trained on a subset of animal species, extends its predictive ability to plant species genomes, suggesting that the sequence requirements of each genomic element captured by the model are general and can be translated to different domains. Thus, this model can be leveraged to annotate sequences up to 50-kb sequences of any species de novo, which should be useful to annotate the genomes of less-characterized species. Finally, we anticipate that further predictive power is likely to be achieved by expanding the set of species included in the multispecies model, such as incorporating plant species and particularly those with large-scale genome rearrangements to increase sequence diversity.

Overall, our work has several direct applications. First, the fine-tuned DNA encoder within SegmentNT should provide stronger representations of human genomic elements and could be used to improve performance on downstream tasks57. Second, interpreting the representations learned by SegmentNT could reveal insights about the genome and its encoded information. Third, future work will explore the capacity of SegmentNT to evaluate the impact of sequence variants on different types of genomic element. Thanks to the extended sequence context and the prediction of several types of genomic element, we foresee important applications for the analysis of cancer genomes and their large structural variants. Fourth, SegmentNT-multispecies can be directly applicable to annotate and explore the genomes of different species. Fifth, the architecture of SegmentNT can be easily applied to additional genomics annotations or nucleotide-level experimental data and combined with different DNA encoders (as demonstrated by using it with the Enformer and Borzoi models). Increasing the number of channels per nucleotides predicted by SegmentNT to include data coming from multiple experiments and biological processes should improve the transfer between tasks and lead to generalization in a way similar to the Segment Anything Model for images58. We ultimately hope that SegmentNT can be a useful tool for the genomics community and foster new developments in our understanding of the genome code.

Here, we introduce our approach to segment the genome, namely SegmentNT. We formulate this problem as the segmentation of a sequence of N nucleotides (for example, N = 3,000 bp, 3 kb or N = 10,000 bp, 10 kb) by predicting a probability for each nucleotide to be part of one of K = 14 elements: protein-coding gene, lncRNA, 5′UTR, 3′UTR, exon, intron, splice donor site, splice acceptor site, poly(A) signal, promoter tissue-invariant, promoter tissue-specific, enhancer tissue-invariant, enhancer tissue-specific or CTCF-bound.

Nucleotide Transformer can be used as a backbone for segmenting a sequence of nucleotides. SegmentNT uses the pretrained NT-Multispecies-v2 (500M) model as DNA encoder to extract embeddings for each of the tokens yielded by a 6-mer tokenizer. We used this model because it was the most powerful model in the NT benchmark22. We note N the number of nucleotides in the DNA sequence and L the number of DNA tokens (with roughly L ≈ N/6). To segment the sequence, we replace its original language model head by a 1D U-Net segmentation head32 made of two downsampling convolutional blocks and two upsampling convolutional blocks. Each of these blocks is made of two convolutional layers with 2,048 and 4,096 kernels, respectively, and L/2 and L/4 sequence length. This accounts for 63 million parameters. The purpose of adding these additional U-Net layers during fine-tuning is to better capture multiscale, hierarchical representations along the sequence, which can be crucial for capturing fine-grained patterns in sequence data. This hierarchical feature learning improves localization and contextual awareness, as verified by improved performance when combining NT-v2 with the U-Net head. In addition, this approach makes SegmentNT more flexible, as it can be used with any DNA encoder independent of its output dimensions (see the examples with Enformer and Borzoi encoders). The output of the U-Net layer predicts for each nucleotide 2 logits per genomic element, with an output tensor of shape (N, K, 2). These logits are then passed through a softmax layer, applied over the last tensor dimension, that returns a tuple (P, 1 − P) per nucleotide and per genomics element, where P is the probability of the nucleotide belonging to the element. We do not add further constraints on predictions such as the fact that one nucleotide belongs only to one element, and thus, each nucleotide can be part of multiple elements. For binary classification metrics, we used as threshold 0.5 to annotate nucleotides as belonging to each element type.

We train our model using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 5 × 10−5. We use a batch size of 256 and trained the SegmentNT-3kb model for 10.24 billion tokens, meaning a total of 20.48 million sequences seen during training. The training was done on a cluster of 8 GPU H100 over 20 h. The 10-, 20- and 30-kb models were initialized from the best checkpoint of the respective smaller model for faster adaptation to longer lengths. For example, SegmentNT-30kb model was initialized with the best SegmentNT-20kb checkpoint and fine-tuned for an additional 2.56 billion tokens (0.51 million sequences). We use focal loss33 with γ = 2, which helps the model to focus on ‘harder' samples, ie the sparse nucleotides that belong to an element.

We split our dataset between train, validation and test sets by chromosome. Namely, chromosomes 20 and 21 are used for test, chromosome 22 is used for validation, and the remaining are used for training. We excluded from the test set chunks that contain genes with homology to genes in the train or validation chromosomes, using the annotations from Ensembl BioMart (accessed 8 May 2024). We note that this does not remove homologous distal regulatory elements which could still be inflating performance on these regions. During training, sequences are randomly sampled in the genome with associated annotations. We keep the sequences in the validation and test sets fixed by using a sliding window of length N over the respective chromosomes. The validation set was used to monitor training and for early stopping while the test set was used to evaluate model performance. We sampled the test set ten times to obtain estimates of confidence, each time starting the sliding windows at a different genomic starting position. We used MCC as a validation metric and selected the best checkpoint on the basis of the average score across all 14 genomic elements. During evaluation and testing, we predict 14 probabilities for each nucleotide in a sequence, corresponding to the different element types. We combine these predictions across all sequences into a single array for each element type and calculate performance metrics on the basis of the predictions for every nucleotide across the dataset. These metrics treat each nucleotide as a separate prediction and include the MCC, auPRC, Jaccard similarity and the F1-score.

We have also incorporated a region-level metric, the SOV, developed for measuring performance of predictions at the regions-level on 1D sequences in bioinformatics38. Specifically, we used the perl code from http://dna.cs.miami.edu/SOV/ and the default lambda value of 1.0 as recommended in the publication. We tried various values of this parameter and observed minor variations in the results.

SegmentNT is made of a DNA encoder (NT-Multispecies-v2 (500M)) and a 1D U-Net segmentation head, as described above. To evaluate the added value of using a pretrained backbone encoder, we performed different model ablations and compared it on the 3 kb dataset with the following models. (1) The SegmentNT where we use the NT v1 2.5B 1000G model22 as backbone (this is the only model in this study where the backbone is not the NT-Multispecies-v2 (500M)), featuring 2.6 billion parameters including the segmentation head. (2) The SegmentNT-3kb model (563M), initialized with the NT-Multispecies-v2 weights but where we only fine-tune the segmentation head. (3) Two versions of the SegmentNT model (563M) whose encoder is initialized with random weights, where we train either all parameters or only the segmentation head. (4) Two versions of the U-Net segmentation head alone, with 63 million and 252 million parameters respectively, which take one-hot encoded DNA sequences as input instead of the embeddings outputted by the DNA encoder. (5) The same segmentation head where we first pass the one-hot representation in a linear layer, which adds 3 million parameters, bringing the model to 66 million parameters, to upscale it to the embedding dimension before passing in the U-Net (1,024 embedding).

We compared SegmentNT with the two state-of-the-art single-nucleotide model architectures BPNet39 and SpliceAI40 on the 3-kb dataset, using directly one-hot encoded DNA sequences (of L = 3,000) and varying their embedding size to test different model scaling. We trained two randomly initialized versions of the BPNet model with embedding sizes of 64 (original model) and 1,024, bringing the number of parameters to respectively 120,000 and 29 million. In addition, we trained three randomly initialized versions of the SpliceAI model with an embedding size of 32 to match the original model (700,000 parameters) and embedding sizes of 256 (44 million) and 920 (573 million) to upscale the model.

As with the SegmentNT models, we monitored the training by validating on sequences from chromosome 22 and selected the best checkpoint on the basis of the highest average MCC score across the 14 types of element (see Supplementary Table 1 for the number of sequences seen during training for all models). We present all model results in Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.

Since the DNA encoder of SegmentNT is using RoPE that have been trained on a maximum sequence length of 2,048 tokens, its performance degrades very quickly when inferring on longer sequences. Several previous works have suggested adaptations to RoPE to better handle evaluation or fine-tuning on longer sequences, such as using position interpolation (59,60) or ‘NTK-aware' scaled Rope61. More recently42, formalized different methods and augmented them to propose a final adaptation of RoPE to unseen lengths called YaRN. After testing the different approaches, YaRN did not introduce improvements to extending SegmentNT lengths compared with simply using ‘NTK-aware' RoPE. Since the latter is lighter to implement we decided to use it for extending the context of SegmentNT.

As described by Peng et al.42, with the hidden layer set of hidden neurons denoted by D and a sequence of vectors x1, …xL ∈ R∣D∣, ‘NTK-aware' RoPE can be described by the following equation:

where d is the position along the embedding dimension, m is the position of the embedding in the sequence, f is the RoPE function (detailed in equation (1) of ref. 59), w denotes the learnable parameters (weights), g(m) = m, \(h({\theta }_{d})={b}^{{\prime} -2d/| D| }\), \({b}^{{\prime} }=b.{s}^{\frac{| D| }{| D| -2}}\) and finally \(\frac{2\pi }{{\theta }_{d}}=2\pi {b}^{\frac{2d}{| D| }}\). For completeness, b is the base of the exponential used in the rotary positional embeddings and b′ is a rescaled version of b to account for NTK-aware scaling and context length. The rescaling factor s is computed as \(s=\frac{{L}^{{\prime} }}{L}\) with L′ the extended context length and L the training context length, which for the NT-Multispecies-v2 (500M) is 2,048 tokens.

For SegmentNT models trained with ‘NTK-aware' RoPE, all sequences with length inferior to their training length are evaluated with the same rescaling factor that was used during the training. Concretely, SegmentNT-30kb is trained with s = 2.44, and therefore, inference on a sequence smaller than 30,000 bp is done with s = 2.44. When evaluated on a 50-kb sequence, the rescaling factor becomes s = 4.07.

We trained additional segmentation models using Enformer18 and Borzoi19 as DNA encoders. These models contain a tower of convolution- and subsampling blocks followed by a series of self-attention blocks operating at 128-bp resolution embedding vectors. Borzoi also makes use of a U-net architecture to increase the resolution back to 32 bp. Both models were pretrained in a supervised manner to predict thousands of epigenetic and gene expression tracks in various mouse and human cell types. We have reimplemented Enformer and Borzoi in our Jax codebase and have validated their exact reproduction by showing an absolute difference of less than 1 × 10−5 in all activations as well as in the predictions between the original implementation and ours. To use Enformer and Borzoi as DNA encoders, we place the U-Net segmentation head on top of their last layer representations, before the prediction heads, and call these models SegmentEnformer and SegmentBorzoi, respectively. We fine-tuned the whole network on our segmentation dataset using either 30-kb input sequences (for a fair comparison to SegmentNT-30kb) or the model's original input length, 196 kb for Enformer and 524 kb for Borzoi. All training and validation hyperparameters remained the same.

We trained an additional, multispecies model (SegmentNT-30kb-multispecies) by fine-tuning the human SegmentNT-30kb model on the annotations of human and five additional species together: mouse (mm10), chicken (galGal6), fly (dm6), zebrafish (danRer11) and worm (ce11). We used the same model hyperparameters and training parameters. Since the different species have different genome sizes, we balanced examples from each dataset with the following weights: five for human; four for mouse; two for chicken, fly and zebrafish; and one for worm. Similar to the human dataset, we held-out specific chromosomes for validation and testing: mouse (validation: chr19, test: chr18), chicken (validation: chr28, test: chr16 and chr27), fly (validation: chr4, test: chr2L), zebrafish (validation: chr25, test: chr23 and chr24) and worm (validation: chrI, test: chrIII).

The human segmentation dataset of genomic elements was created from 14 types of element, divided in gene elements (protein-coding genes, lncRNAs, 5′UTR, 3′UTR, exon, intron, splice acceptor and donor sites) and regulatory elements (poly(A) signal, tissue-invariant and tissue-specific promoters and enhancers, and CTCF-bound sites). The final segmentation dataset was created by overlapping all 14 elements with every DNA sequence of length N nucleotides. Sequences with Ns were removed.

The location of all gene elements and poly(A) signals were obtained from GENCODE35 V44 gene annotation. Annotations were filtered to exclude level three transcripts (automated annotation), so all training data were annotated by a human. We used extract_splice_sites. py from HISAT262 (https://github.com/DaehwanKimLab/hisat2/blob/master/hisat2_extract_splice_sites.py) to extract respective intron and splice site annotations.

Promoter-, enhancer- and CTCF-bound sites were retrieved from ENCODE's SCREEN database (https://screen.wenglab.org/)37. Distal and proximal enhancers were combined. Promoters and enhancers were split in tissue-invariant and tissue-specific based on the vocabulary from Meuleman et al.63 (https://www.meuleman.org/research/dhsindex/). Enhancers or promoters overlapping regions classified as tissue-invariant were defined as that, while all other enhancers and promoters were defined as tissue-specific.

To create segmentation datasets for additional species we focused only on the main gene elements: protein-coding genes, 5′UTR, 3′UTR, exon, intron, splice acceptor and donor sites. We obtained their annotations as described for the human dataset but retrieved from Ensembl databases (https://www.ensembl.org). We considered five species to train the multispecies model: mouse (mm10), chicken (galGal6), fly (dm6), zebrafish (danRer11) and worm (ce11). We created a held-out test set made of ten animal species: bison (Bison_UMD1), whale (ASM228892v3), cat (Felis_catus_9), dog (ROS_Cfam_1), canary (SCA1), tetraodon (TETRAODON8), anemonefish (AmpOce1), rat (mRatBN7), chinchilla (ChiLan1) and Ciona intestinalis (KH). We added a second held-out test set of five plant species: A. thaliana (TAIR10), G. max (soybean, Glycine_max_v2.1), O. sativa (rice, (IRGSP1.0), T. aestivum (wheat, IWGSC) and Z. mays (corn/maize, Zm_B73_REFERENCE_NAM_5.0). We excluded from each species' test set any chunk that contained genes that show orthology to genes in the human train or validation chromosomes, using the annotations from Ensembl BioMart (accessed 8 May 2024). Evolutionary distance data were retrieved from Timetree of Life.

We compared our segmentation models (SegmentNT-30kb, SegmentEnformer-30kb and SegmentBorzoi-30kb) with a sliding-window approach, where a binary classifier is used to predict the output probability for multiple short sliding windows over the whole test chromosomes. We applied this approach for the segmentation of promoters and enhancers, combining tissue-invariant and tissue-specific classes into a single promoter and enhancer class, since common baselines were trained to predict promoters and enhancers globally. As binary classifier we used the NT-v2 fine-tuned models on these promoter and enhancer regions, respectively, as they performed the best in the NT benchmark22. Sliding windows were created using a step size of 10 and the input size of the respective promoter (300 bp) and enhancer (400 bp) models. The 10-bp step size was used for a compromise between high resolution but limited number of windows per genome region. The performance was evaluated using auPRC. All inference times were calculated in a single A100 GPU.

We evaluated the performance of DeePromoter7 for predicting promoter elements along the genome. Since we could not access the web-server for promoter prediction developed by the authors (https://home.jbnu.ac.kr/NSCL/deepromoter.htm, accessed 9 September 2024), we retrained their model using the pytorch implementation provided at https://github.com/egochao/DeePromoter/. We reproduced the results in their test set with high performance (MCC for human TATA promoters: 0.82, non-TATA promoters: 0.89; compared with 0.88 and 0.92 reported in the original study7), ensuring that we have accurate model checkpoints to evaluate on our benchmark. Similar to the NT baseline, we evaluated DeePromoter by sliding the model over the whole test chromosomes and evaluated if promoter regions are correctly predicted by the model over background regions. We combined both TATA and non-TATA DeePromoter models and used as prediction values the highest of the two per window. Sliding windows were created using a step size of 10 and the input size of the respective models (300 bp). The performance was evaluated using auPRC. All inference times were calculated in a single A100 GPU.

We compared the gene annotation capabilities of SegmentNT with the state-of-the-art gene finder AUGUSTUS5,6 in three different settings, including segments of only genes and predicting only the main isoform or all isoforms or in whole-chromosome setting. We first evaluated the models in the gene annotation task presented at the recent BEND benchmark45, analyzing only sequences in the SegmentNT test chromosomes 20 and 21. We have adapted it to create a version with windows of 30 kb that contain genes with only a single isoform, with a single label per nucleotide, and a second version that contains all genes and respective isoforms, allowing multiple labels per nucleotide. The third dataset was the actual test set of SegmentNT, where the model needs to annotate the gene regions within the whole test set chromosomes and including all their annotated isoforms. We created this dataset for not only human but also all other species where AUGUSTUS could be tested: these include all mammals, where we used the human AUGUSTUS as recommended by the authors, and other species with specialized models (fly, worm and Arabidopsis). We measured the annotation performance on all datasets using the standard F1-score and the MCC metric, using 0.5 as the probability threshold, and analyzed their precision and recall values.

Augustus was run with the following settings for the single isoform setting (example for human genome):

AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=path --strand=both,

outfile=out.gff --gff3=on --introns=on,

and --genemodel=exactlyone --species=human $file;

and with the following settings for the multiple isoform setting (example for human genome):

AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=path --strand=both,

outfile=out.gff,

and --gff3=on --introns=on --UTR=on --species=human sequence.fasta.

We compared SegmentNT with SpliceAI40 and Pangolin46 on both SpliceAI's test set and SegmentNT's test set given their different settings. We used the scripts available at the Illumina Basespace platform (https://basespace.illumina.com/projects/66029966/) to reproduce the testing dataset presented in SpliceAI and adapted it for a fair comparison with SegmentNT. Namely, we consider sequence windows of 30 kb (instead of 10 kb in the original publication) and compute the predictions on the whole window (instead of not predicting for the flanking ±5-kb sequence). We have also removed sequences with Ns due to the constraint of the SegmentNT architecture. This test set contains only mRNA sequences and all in the forward strand (that is, for genes in the reverse strand, the sequence is reversed to have the gene in the forward orientation). We also compared both models on the SegmentNT's 30-kb human and multispecies test sets, where we filtered for windows that only contain genes in the forward strand, given the training settings of SpliceAI and Pangolin. Since Pangolin does not differentiate between acceptor and donor sites, predicting a single splice site label, we have converted these predictions into acceptor and donor predictions for a more direct comparison. More specifically, when calculating the splice acceptor predictions, we compare Pangolin splice site predictions on acceptor sites versus the remaining nucleotides after removing annotated donor sites; for donor sites we do the opposite, comparing Pangolin predictions on donor sites versus the remaining nucleotides after removing annotated acceptor sites. We used as performance metrics both auPRC, MCC and top-k40. For the comparison across multiple species, we averaged the performance of each model in each genomic element type across species.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics hold great promise for oncology but their efficacy is limited by systemic off-target effects and immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments. Here we present TITUR, a tumour-customizable mRNA nanomedicine platform that integrates tumour-customizable ionizable lipids (TIs) and tumour-specific untranslated regions (TURs) to enhance tumour-selective mRNA delivery and expression. This dual-engineered approach enables the precise intratumoural expression of 4HB, an immunogenic cell death-inducing protein, while mitigating systemic toxicities. Using murine models of immunologically cold tumours, including melanoma and triple-negative breast cancer, TITUR-mediated 4HB delivery induced tumour-specific immunogenic cell death, remodelled the tumour microenvironment and enhanced immune cell infiltration. When combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, 4HB TITUR suppressed primary and metastatic tumour growth, while also exhibiting vaccine-like properties by reducing tumour recurrence and eliciting systemic antitumour immunity. Furthermore, it demonstrated a superior safety profile compared with conventional mRNA delivery methods. Our data indicate that TITUR may serve as a versatile approach to address the limitations of current immunotherapies and support the development of personalized mRNA nanomedicines.

Epigenetic mechanisms have long been proposed to act as molecular mnemonics1,2,3, but whether the epigenetic makeup of a single genomic site can guide learnt behaviors remains unknown. Here we combined CRISPR-based epigenetic editing tools4,5 with c-Fos-driven engram technologies6,7 to address this question in memory-bearing neuronal ensembles. Focusing on the promoter of Arc, which encodes a master regulator of synaptic plasticity8, we found that its locus-specific and temporally controlled epigenetic editing is necessary and sufficient to regulate memory expression. Such effects occurred irrespective of the memory phase—during the initially labile period after learning and for fully consolidated memories—and were reversible within subject, testifying to their inherent plasticity. These findings provide a proof-of-principle that site-specific epigenetic dynamics are causally implicated in memory expression.

Over the past two decades, several studies have indicated that epigenetic mechanisms—mainly histone acetylation and DNA methylation—may contribute to memory formation, storage and change9. Experimental support of this evidence has been obtained by their observation in whole-tissue homogenates or broadly defined cell types such as excitatory neurons following learning10, or by wide-range pharmacological agents11 and genetic approaches that modify epigenetic enzymes and, concomitantly, memory performance12,13,14. However, a causal interrogation of site-specific epigenetic modifications for regulating memory expression has thus far been lacking.

In recent years, accumulating evidence has shown that memories are in part encoded in sparse populations of defined brain cells, so-called engrams15. Engram cells are nowadays the closest approximation of a memory trace, that is, the physical substrate of a memory: activated by learning, they display enhanced structural and synaptic plasticity16, regulate memory retrieval7 and are of lasting nature17. Following learning, engram cells also display epigenetic modifications18, positioning this cellular subpopulation as an ideal place to query their mnemonic role in cell-type- and locus-resolved manner.

To do so, we developed CRISPR–dCas9-based epigenetic editing tools4,5,19 for cFos-driven engram tagging technologies6 that allow for the induction of locus-specific chromatin alterations within sparse memory-bearing neuronal ensembles. As editing target, we focused on Arc, an immediate early gene (IEG) known for its role in learning and synaptic plasticity8,20, whose promoter region is primed, that is, shows increased chromatin accessibility compared to other IEGs in the mouse dentate gyrus (DG) (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). Since primed chromatin is a more dynamic epigenetic state than closed chromatin21, the Arc promoter represents an ideal site to probe for the importance of locus-specific epigenetic regulation.

To assess the behavioral consequences of epigenetically editing the Arc promoter within engram cells, we first engineered the epigenetic repressor dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 (ref. 5) in a spatiotemporally regulatable manner, namely by combining it with an OFF doxycycline (DOX)-controllable tetracycline-responsive element (TRE) in a lentiviral construct (Fig. 1a). We stereotaxically delivered this construct into the DG of cFos-tTA mice, which express the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) upon learning6. We used a second lentivirus expressing five U6-driven single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the Arc promoter, or as controls U6-driven nontargeting (NT) sgRNAs.

To trigger dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 expression in engram cells activated by learning, cFos-tTA mice were taken off DOX 3 days before contextual fear conditioning (CFC), an associative memory task in which mice learn to pair a specific context with an unpleasant experience (that is, an electrical footshock). Immediately after CFC, mice were put on DOX again to prevent learning-unrelated TRE expression. Two days later, we measured the animals' memory performance by re-exposing them to the conditioned context in the absence of footshock (Fig. 1a). We found that dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 plus Arc sgRNA mice exhibited significantly less freezing (that is, the learnt association between footshock and context) than mice expressing NT sgRNA (Fig. 1b), indicating reduced memory formation. Normalizing the freezing rates during the recall phase to those during preconditioning (∆ freezing) confirmed that the reduction in memory expression was not due to alterations in baseline freezing behavior (Fig. 1c). Moreover, measurements of locomotion (distance traveled) and anxiety (time spent in the inner region of the behavioral apparatus) did not differ between the two groups (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b,g–i), excluding memory-unrelated effects of the dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 manipulation.

At the molecular level, Arc expression in dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2-positive cells was reduced in the Arc sgRNA compared to the NT group, whereas the percentage of DG cells expressing both the dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 and the sgRNA vector was similar between the two groups (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 2c). Epigenetically, dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 binding to the Arc promoter decreased the occupancy of the transcription-associated chromatin mark H3K27ac, whereas the downregulation of Arc mRNA was paralleled by few off-target effects both in terms of sgRNA binding and ensuing expression changes (Fig. 1f–h and Extended Data Fig. 3a–g), as measured in N2A cells. In vivo, dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 expression led to a closing of the Arc promoter as assessed by single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) following fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS), and elicited downstream transcriptional changes of genes regulating inhibitory synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission (Fig. 1i–o).

Next, we tested whether an epigenetic activation of Arc would lead to the opposite behavioral effect. To this end, we stereotaxically injected an OFF DOX-inducible version of the epigenetic activator dCas9-VPR4,19 (TRE-dCas9-VPR), as well as lentiviruses containing Arc or NT sgRNAs into the DG of cFos-tTA mice (Fig. 2a). We used the same experimental timeline as before, except for employing a subthreshold CFC protocol22, which led to a modest memory formation in the NT control group (Fig. 2b). In contrast, we found that dCas9-VPR plus Arc sgRNA mice showed a robust increase in freezing at recall, indicating improved memory formation (Fig. 2b,c). No differences in locomotion or baseline behavior were observed between the two groups (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e,j–l).

Source data

Molecular analyses revealed similar infection efficiency, but higher levels of Arc in engram cells positive for dCas9-VPR and Arc sgRNA compared to NT controls (Fig. 2d,e and Extended Data Fig. 2f). Notably, context exposure without conditioning also led to increased Arc mRNA expression in dCas9-VPR plus Arc sgRNA mice but did not alter freezing levels, testifying to the specificity of the dCas9-VPR-based memory enhancement to the fearful experience (Fig. 2f,g and Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). Epigenetically, we found that dCas9-VPR binding to the Arc promoter increased H3K27ac, H3K14ac and Arc mRNA with no off-target effects (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 3h–k), which was likely mediated by a direct interaction with the histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) (Fig. 2j). Accordingly, the expression of dCas9-CBP in DG engram cells was able to fully recapitulate the behavioral, epigenetic and transcriptional effects of dCas9-VPR (Fig. 2k–o and Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Together with the dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 experiments, these findings suggest that the epigenetic makeup of a single locus within sparse DG engram cells is necessary and sufficient to regulate memory expression.

Subsequently, we asked whether the epigenetic editing effects on behavior are reversible within subject, which serves the purpose to examine their plasticity, a defining feature of any memory-related process. To this end, we employed the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIA423, which functions by occluding the PAM recognition domain of dCas9, hence negating dCas9 binding to the DNA (Fig. 3a), and rendered it inducible by coupling it to a DOX ON controllable TRE promoter (Fig. 3b). In vitro, AcrIIA4 induction reverted the dCas9-VPR-mediated increase of Arc within 3 days (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b).

Data are means ± s.e.m. compared either by two-way ANOVA with Sidak's post hoc test (h) or a one-tailed, unpaired t-test (i). For all panels: NS, not significant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001. See Supplementary Table 3 for summary statistics and P values.

To use this setup in vivo, we designed a double transgenic labeling system that allows for the sequential induction of dCas9-VPR and AcrII4 in the same engram cells. Specifically, we crossed cFos-CreERT2 mice11, in which tamoxifen-dependent Cre-recombinase expression is restricted to engram cells, with R26-CAG-rtTALSL mice24, which contain a loxP-flanked reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) that binds the TRE promoter in a DOX-ON-dependent manner (Fig. 3e). In the resulting double transgenic cFos-CreERT2/R26-CAG-rtTALSL mice (hereafter referred to as cFos-CreERT2/rtTALSL), we stereotaxically delivered a Cre-dependent version of dCas9-VPR (using a double inverted open reading frame (DIO)-dCas9-VPR), AcrIIA4 under the control of TRE, and the Arc sgRNA to their DG (Fig. 3f). Immediately after CFC, cFos-CreERT2/rtTALSL mice received an injection of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), which triggered the expression of both rtTA and dCas9-VPR in learning-activated neurons. Four days later, memory formation was measured with a first recall session as before. Thereafter, one group of mice received DOX, which induced AcrIIA4 expression, and the other group of mice did not receive DOX, thus AcrIIA4 was not expressed (Fig. 3g). Another 3 days later, all mice underwent a second recall test, by which their memory retention could be assessed.

For mice in which dCas9-VPR but not AcrIIA4 was induced (that is, the DOX OFF group), we found that freezing levels on the second recall did not differ significantly from those of the first recall (Fig. 3h). Since mice without dCas9-VPR induction normally show reduced freezing upon the second memory recall (Extended Data Fig. 7), this finding indicates that dCas9-VPR induction leads to improved memory retention, in line with dCas9-VPR facilitating memory formation (Fig. 2c). Conversely, for animals in which dCas9-VPR induction was followed by AcrIIA4 activation (the DOX ON group), we observed reduced freezing at the second recall (Fig. 3h,i), indicating that the improved memory retention upon dCas9-VPR was negated. Importantly, AcrIIA4 induction did not alter basal locomotion nor anxiety levels (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). These reversibility experiments show that the observed behavioral effects are a direct consequence of the epigenetic regulation of Arc, which is thus plastic within the same animal.

Finally, we asked whether the epigenetic regulation of Arc could also have a mnemonic effect outside the initially labile phase of learning when newly encoded memories have become consolidated and are, by definition, less susceptible to change25,26. To this end, we deployed our double transgenic labeling system and stereotaxically delivered a TRE-dependent version of either dCas9-VPR or dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 alongside the sgRNAs to the DG of cFos-CreERT2/rtTALSL mice. These mice were then trained on CFC, immediately after which they received an injection of 4-OHT and thus started to express rtTA in DG engram cells. At 4 days after CFC, that is, beyond the initially labile period after memory formation27,28,29, mice were put on DOX, which switched on the expression of the dCas9 components (Fig. 4a,d,f,i). Finally, another 3 days later, mice were tested for their memory retention. We found that dCas9-VPR plus Arc sgRNA mice displayed increased memory retention, which was accompanied by increased Arc expression in DG engram cells (Fig. 4b–e). Conversely, dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 plus Arc sgRNA mice froze significantly less than the NT group, which was paralleled by reduced Arc mRNA levels (Fig. 4g–j). For both experiments, percentages of infected cells, locomotion and anxiety measurements did not differ between the Arc and NT sgRNA groups (Fig. 4e,j and Extended Data Fig. 8a–d). These findings indicate that the epigenetic editing of Arc within DG engram cells can bidirectionally alter memory expression even for fully consolidated memories.

Taken together, by engineering a spatiotemporally inducible CRISPR-based epigenetic editing system in engram cells, we found that the epigenetic makeup of a single locus is necessary and sufficient to regulate memory expression in reversible manner. From a neurobiological perspective, these experiments provide the hitherto finest-grained evidence of how epigenetic dynamics impact memory capacities: not only do epigenetic mechanisms accompany, but causally regulate memory formation. These findings mechanistically expand previous observational studies on how transcriptional30 and chromatin18 landscapes unfold over the timecourse of a memory, and reach beyond the interventional approaches that targeted the epigenetic machinery either pharmacologically or genetically14,22,31,32. With the caveat that we epigenetically interrogated only one genomic site in one brain region, in one memory task and only in male animals, these findings reveal chromatin alterations as functionally relevant mnemonics to regulate the behavioral expression of learnt information.

From a methodological perspective, this study illustrates how epigenetic editing tools, including the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIA4, can be directed to designated cell populations in the adult mouse brain. Given its modular setup, similar experimental approaches may in future studies prove useful to better understand other phenotypes from the perspective of cell-type-specific and locus-resolved epigenetic regulation: within the field of memory research for disorders characterized by aberrant memory processing such as in traumatic memories or neurodegeneration; beyond the field of memory research, where epigenetic mnemonics have been proposed for drug-related memories33 as well as for stress-associated behaviors following childhood trauma34; and also outside the field of neuroscience, where cellular memories established during development35 following inflammation36 or after immune activation37 are known to be epigenetically encoded. Ultimately, such tools will therefore allow us to fully apprehend to what extent these epigenetic forms of cellular memory have been assimilated by the nervous system to store and express learnt information.

All animals and procedures used in this study were approved by the Veterinary Office of the Federal Council of Switzerland under the animal experimentation license VD2808.2.

To design guide sequences for the CRISPR–dCas9 systems a total of 439 bp spanning the promoter of the mouse gene Arc were used as input for the CRISPROR program38. Five sgRNAs were selected and DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the sgRNA sequences (Supplementary Table 2) were cloned individually into pLenti SpBsmBI sgRNA Hygro (Addgene 62205) containing an U6-driven sgRNA scaffold. Afterwards, the individual sgRNAs were multiplexed using NEBridge Golden Gate Assembly kit (NEB) with custom designed primers and cloned into the lentiviral pLVX-EF1a-GFP backbone. The sgRNA sequence against the bacterial LacZ gene was used as an NT control sgRNA as previously described39. The plasmids for dCas9-VPR and dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 were generated by subcloning the lenti-EF1a-dCas9-VPR-Puro (Addgene 99373) and the lenti-SYN-dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 (gift from J. Day) into the lentiviral pLVX backbone under control of either the CMV promoter (in vitro experiments in N2A cells) or the TRE (in vivo experiments). The dCas9-CBP constructs were obtained by replacing the VPR part with the CBP catalytic domain we previously characterized40. For the AcrIIA4 experiments, the pLVX-DIO-hSyn-dCas9-VPR plasmid was generated by subcloning the dCas9-VPR sequence into the pLVX-DIO-hSyn backbone; the pLVX-hU6-Arc sgRNAs-EF1a-GFP-TRE-mCherry-P2A-AcrII4A (in vitro experiments) and the pLVX-TRE-mCherry-P2A-AcrII4A (in vivo experiments) were generated starting from pHR-Ef1a-mCherry-P2A-AcrIIA4 (Addgene 125148); the pSIN-hPGK-rtTA plasmid was a gift from D. Trono. For a full list of the plasmids used, see Supplementary Table 2.

Lentiviral vectors were produced as described previously41. HEK-293T cells (ATCC) were transfected using calcium phosphate with a second-generation packaging system composed of the pMD2G and psPAX2 vectors alongside the different pLVX vectors used in this study. After 4 days, medium was collected and centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge at 45,000g for 90 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBS and viral titer determined using the HIV-1 p24 antigen ELISA kit (Zeptometrix Corp.). Injections were performed with 500 ng of each virus, which corresponded to a volume between 200 nl and 500 nl depending on the individual titer.

N2A cells (ATCC), were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium GlutaMAX (Gibco) supplemented with a 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. To induce the expression of the AcrIIA4 construct, cells were treated with 1 μg ml−1 DOX.

N2A cells were cultured on coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine (Corning) and transfected as described above. After 48 h, cells were fixed for 12 min at room temperature in a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), 4% sucrose PBS-based solution. Next, samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody in a 0.3% Triton, 3% BSA, 10% serum PBS-based solution. The following day, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, coverslips were mounted on a slide with Vectashield–4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and imaged with an Olympus Slide Scanner (Olympus VS120) at ×10 magnification. Antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

N2A cells treated as described above were resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), shortly sonicated (five cycles 3 s on–off, Bandelin Sonopuls sonicator) and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000g at 4 °C. Following a 1:3 dilution in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM EDTA, lysates were incubated at 4 °C with either Flag or CBP antibody for 2 h, and then with G Dynabeads overnight. The day after, G Dynabeads were washed three times with dilution buffer and eluted in Laemmli buffer. For western blots, protein lysates were resolved in 7.5% SDS–polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL detection reagents (Amersham). Antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cDNA synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) were performed with the FAST SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Each biological sample was loaded in technical triplicates and fluorescence acquisition carried out on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Calculations were performed using the ΔΔCt method and levels of Gapdh mRNA and Actin mRNA as reference genes. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Samples for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–qPCR were obtained as described previously with minor adaptations42. N2A cells were crosslinked using 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by lysis in 5 mM HEPES (pH 8), 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40. After centrifugation, nuclei were washed in 5 mM HEPES (pH 8), 85 mM KCl and then sonicated in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS (Covaris LE220 sonicator). The resulting chromatin was precleared with A or G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and incubated overnight with antibodies in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl). Next, A or G Dynabeads were added for 6 h, followed by eight washes: the first three in IP buffer plus 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 1 mM EDTA; the second three in the same buffer but with 500 mM NaCl; then one wash in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; and a final wash in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA. Chromatin was then eluted in 1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3 and incubated at 65 °C overnight for decrosslinking plus Proteinase K digestion, before clean up using the QiaQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). qPCR was carried out as for gene expression analysis. Values for each IP sample were normalized relative to corresponding input chromatin for the same treatment. Primer sequences and antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Libraries from samples prepared as described above were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Preparation Kit (NEB) according to manufacturer's instructions. Samples were multiplexed and 75-bp paired-end reads generated on a Nextseq500 (Illumina). After reads were trimmed for NEBNext Ultra II DNA (TruSeq) adapters, the FastQ files were demultiplexed using bclconvert (v.3.9.3, Illumina) and aligned to the mm10 genome using bowtie2 (v.2.4.5) in paired-end mode using default parameters. The R library Csaw (v.1.30.1) was used for peak calling, with peaks being considered nonsignificant for regions that had less than a threefold enrichment compared to their 2-kb neighborhood, and reads were normalized using the locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (loess) algorithm. Peaks were assigned to the nearest promoter with the distanceToNearest function from GenomicRanges, and a differential enrichment analysis performed using EdgeR (v.3.38.4). The threshold for significance was set at log fold change (FC) > 2 and P value < 0.05. When assigning peaks to genomic features promoter regions were defined as 2 kb upstream and 200 bp downstream of the gene transcription start site (TSS). ChIP–seq data were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (v.2.16.0). See Supplementary Table 1 for results summary.

cFos-tTA mice were bred inhouse from the original Jackson Laboratory (JAX strain 018306) on a C57Bl/6JR background. Animals were group-housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle with water and food available ad libitum. DOX (0.2 mg ml−1) was given orally through the water supply beginning at least 7 days before the start of the experiment, and only ceased 3 days before the session where the tagging window was desired. DOX was provided back to the animals as soon as the tagging window was no longer needed. Double transgenic cFos-CreERT2/R26-CAG-rtTALSL animals were generated inhouse by crossing the original JAX strains 030323 and 029617. cFos-CreERT2/R26-CAG-rtTALSL mice were injected with tamoxifen (4-OHT, Sigma-Aldrich, 50 mg kg−1) immediately after fear conditioning. Powdered tamoxifen was dissolved in ethanol 100% at a concentration of 20 mg ml−1 and stored at −20 °C. On the day of the experiment, tamoxifen was redissolved by shaking at 37 °C, then two volumes of corn oil were added and ethanol was evaporated shaking at 37 °C for a final concentration at 10 mg ml−1. Tamoxifen was kept at 37 °C until injection. Mice were between 8 weeks and 13 weeks old at the start of the experiments, and all were male. All behavioral procedures were performed between 1 pm and 5 pm local time and animals were assigned randomly to experimental groups.

CFC experiments were performed using a TSE Multi Conditioning System. CFC encoding consisted of a first 3-min exploration phase, followed by 2-s long foot shocks spaced by 28 s. The number of repetitions of the pause-shock stage as well as the electrical current varied depending on the experiment (as illustrated in figures). After the last shock, the animal was left in the chamber for an additional 15 s and brought back to its home cage. The recall phase consisted of a 3-min exposure to the same context, without any shock. The time after encoding at which recall took place varied depending on the experiment. The movement of the animals was measured automatically using an infrared beam cut detection system (TSE Systems) and freezing calculated as the absence of movement for more than 500 ms. Open field experiments consisted of a 15-min long session during which the animals were left exploring an open arena (72 × 72 cm). Sessions were analyzed using Ethovision System (Noldus).

Surgeries were performed as described with minor adaptations43. Before surgery, mice were injected intraperitoneally with an anesthetic mix of fentanyl (0.05 mg kg−1), midazolam (5 mg kg−1), and metedomidin (0.5 mg kg−1), followed by a subcutaneous injection of an analgesic mix (lidocaine 6 mg kg−1 and bupivacaine 2.5 mg kg−1) at the surgery site. Animals were then placed on a stereotaxic micromanipulator frame (Kopf Instruments), skin disinfected with betadine and opened with a scalpel. To target the DG, holes were drilled in the skull with a 30-gauge drill bit at ±1.3 mm medio-lateral, −2.0 mm anterior–posterior. A virus-loaded micropipette (BLAUBRAND, intraMARK, tip diameter 10–20 µm) was lowered to −2.0 mm and 500 ng of viral particles were injected bilaterally at a rate of 0.2 µl min−1. After 5 min, the micropipette was raised 20 µm from the target for 1 min to prevent backflow and allow diffusion, then removed at 10 µm s−1. After the injections, the skin was sutured and atipamezol (2.5 mg kg−1) administered intraperitoneally for anesthesia reversal. Postsurgery, mice were moved to a clean cage on a heated pad until regaining mobility, then returned to their home cage with paracetamol provided in the drinking water for 1 week (500 mg per 250 ml). Surgery efficiency was verified by visualizing the GFP signal and misinjected brains were excluded from further analyses.

Mice were euthanized 8 min after the recall session and the DG microdissected, flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. Nuclei were extracted as described previously with minor adaptations44. To obtain a sufficient number of nuclei for scATAC-seq, the DGs from three animals were pulled for each condition. For single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) each mouse was instead processed individually. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Brain tissue was first homogenized in homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor, 1 U μl−1 RiboLock RNase inhibitor, 0.1% NP-40, in H2O), filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer and washed with nuclei isolation medium (without NP-40). Samples were centrifuged for 8 min at 1,000g, and nuclei resuspended in PBS/BSA storage solution (PBS 1×, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% BSA, 1 mM dithiothreitol in H2O) followed by filtering through 35-μm strainers. FANS was performed with a Sony SH800 sorter using a 100-μm nozzle and nuclei sorted on the basis of the GFP signal. For scATAC-seq, sorted nuclei were incubated for 2 min in permeabilization buffer (nuclei isolation medium plus 0.01% Tween, 0.001% Digitonin, 0.01% NP-40, 0.5% BSA), then washed in nuclei isolation buffer plus 0.5% BSA, resuspended in diluted nuclei buffer (Chromium nuclei isolation kit, 10x Genomics) and finally processed for GEMs generation using Chromium X and the ATAC NextGEM v.2 kit (10x Genomics). For scRNA-seq, sorted nuclei were fixed using the Evercode Low Input Fixation kit (Parse Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at −80 °C until libraries preparation.

The individual scATAC-seq libraries matching each condition (Arc or NT sgRNA) were pooled and 65-bp paired-end reads were generated on an Aviti platform (Element Biosciences), with a mean depth of ~200,000 reads per cell. Raw files were aligned and features were counted using default parameters for Cellranger-atac count45. The R tools Signac46 and Seurat47 with default parameters were used for downstream processing. Cells were maintained if they had between 300 and 75,000 unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts and genes were kept if they had greater than 30 reads, a TSS enrichment of more than two and a nuclear signal less than four. Cell types were defined by using the values calculated in the gene activity matrix with MapMyCells48. Cas9-positive cells were defined by performing a targeted PCR on each library, sequencing and then searching sequences matching the 3' end of the Cas9 gene and extracting the cell barcode. Cells were considered Cas9 positive if the barcode has at least one Cas9 sequence hit in the PCR analysis or the initial library sequencing run. For the dCas9-positive cells across experimental conditions the normalized reads count at the TSS location of genes of interest were extracted and plotted as violin plots. For scRNA-seq, individual libraries from four Arc sgRNA and five NT sgRNA mice were prepared using the Evercode WT v.3 kit (Parse Biosciences) before being combined into eight sublibraries according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sublibraries were sequenced on an Aviti platform (Element Biosciences) with a reads configuration of 150-bp paired-end and at depth of ~100 million reads per sample. Next, raw files were aligned with Parse Biosciences Trailmaker (v.1.4.1) to a modified version of the mouse genome (mm10) that includes GFP and Cas9m4 sequences. Seurat47 was used to filter for cells that had between 300 and 10,000 expressed genes, between 500 and 100,000 UMI counts and fewer than 1% mitochondrial reads. Note, only genes that were present in at least 20 cells were considered for further analysis. Each library was then separately normalized using SCTransform49 on the top 3,000 features before all libraries were integrated together. MapMyCells48 was used to identify cell types and Cas9-positive cells were defined as being any cells with at least 1 UMI count in the Cas9 sequence region. Finally, the Seurat47 command FindMarkers() was used to define differentially expressed genes between cells coming from Arc and NT samples in each cell type, with a P value ≤ 0.01 as cut-off. A summary of the scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq results is provided in Supplementary Table 1.

Eight minutes after the last behavioral test, animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (150 mg kg−1) and perfused transcardially with first PBS and then 4% PFA in PBS. Brains were extracted, postfixed overnight in 4% PFA, transferred in a cryoprotectant solution (30% sucrose in PBS) for at least 48 h, and frozen at −80 °C. Sections of 20 μm were cut using a cryostat, and stored at −20 °C in an antifreeze solution (30% ethylene glycol, 15% sucrose, 0.02% azide in PBS). RNAscope followed by immunohistochemistry was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent v.2 kit (ACD Bio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Probes of interest (Supplementary Table 2) were hybridized for 2 h at 40 °C and the signal was amplified through AMP1, AMP2 and AMP3 probes before being developed using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase signal. Finally, the presence of GFP was revealed using a standard immunohistochemistry protocol. Slices were blocked 30 min in 1% BSA-PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-GFP primary antibody (Supplementary Table 2) in 1% BSA-PBS. The next day, the secondary antibody (Supplementary Table 2) was applied for 1 h at room temperature and nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. The immunohistochemistry experiment of Extended Data Fig. 1 was performed as described previously43 using the primary and secondary antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 2.

An Upright Leica DM6 CS laser scanning confocal microscope was used to acquire images of the DG for each brain slice. All slides were acquired at ×63 magnification with a resolution of 512 × 512, speed of 400 Hz, airy unit between 0.3 and 0.4 a.u. and line averaging of three. Channels were acquired from the longest wavelength to the shortest wavelength and acquired one at a time to avoid leakage between the channels with spectrum overlaps assessed with BD spectrum viewer (BD Biosciences). A tilescan of the acquired area was then stitched within the Leica LAS-X software. Images were analyzed using QuPath (v.0.2.3 to v.0.4.3)50. For each confocal image of a single DG, detected nuclei were first classified as part of the DG granular cell layer or not using a machine-learning based algorithm developed inhouse starting from the StarDist library. Next, nuclei were defined as positive for each given channel if their mean signal was higher than a manually preset threshold of detection. Finally, measurements from all detected nuclei were exported and analyzed using Phyton scripts. To compute Arc expression levels for the triple-positive nuclei (sgRNA+, dCas9+, Arc+), the mean intensity value corresponding to the Arc probe signal for each nucleus in a given DG was extracted and averaged to obtain a single value per acquired image. Overall, a total of four images was analyzed for each mouse, and three to four mice per group were compared in each experiment.

Statistical analysis was performed in Prism 9 (GraphPad) and all data are displayed as mean ± s.e.m. For in vivo experiments, no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but the number of animals used in each experiment is similar to those reported in previously published engram studies. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, although this was not formally tested. Animals were assigned randomly to experimental groups and age matched. For in vitro experiments, at least three independent experiments were performed for statistical analysis unless otherwise specified in the figure legends. The statistical test used and the definition of n are described in the figure legends. Statistical analysis details for each figure are reported in Supplementary Table 3.

(C) For the samples described in Fig.1f, volcano plots showing genomic sites significantly enriched for dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 chromatin binding (p-value < 0.05, fold change > 2, EdgeR differential enrichment analysis, see Methods). Tables below the graphs summarize the peaks' features for each sample and dots in D are color-coded accordingly. One and 6 off-targets were identified for the NT sgRNA and Arc sgRNA, respectively. Of these sites, two of them were associated to predicted genes (Gm5231 and Gm31881) whilst the other 5 were assigned to genes that either show low expression levels (according to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas) in adult dentate gyrus (Vav2, Adgrl2 and Peds1), or have not been implicated in fear memory processes (Ap3d1, Ssx2ip). The differential enrichment analysis results are reported in Supplementary Table 1. (D-F) For the dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 binding sites described in C, plotted are: (D) the averaged ChIP-seq peak width and size; (E) the number of mismatches as predicted by the Cas-OFFinder sofware (y axes, in bp) and the number of sgRNA binding sites (x axes); (F) the position of each matching sgRNA relative to the TSS. Bp, base pair. Bp, base pair; RPKM, reads per kilobase per million mapped reads. (G) For the experiment described in A, q-PCR analysis was performed for the protein coding genes identified in C. dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 plus Arc sgRNA downregulated Arc mRNA levels compared to the control condition with minimal off-target effects.

Will American Ownership Change What TikTok Shows You?

TikTok's U.S. spin-off could reshape its algorithm and the way culture is curated online.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

TikTok's algorithm, which shapes what more than a billion users see, has developed an almost mystical reputation for figuring out what people want to watch. Those powers aren't actually magical, but they do matter. An algorithm as widely used as TikTok's can have a huge impact on our culture by determining what information people receive and how.

As TikTok prepares to spin off a U.S.-only version of the app with majority-American ownership, plenty of questions loom about how the platform—and its all-mighty algorithm—might change. Will new investors reshape what kinds of content is promoted or suppressed?

Here to break down what we know about the highly anticipated TikTok sale and what it might mean for the platform's future is Kelley Cotter, an assistant professor in the Department of Human-Centered Computing and Social Informatics at Pennsylvania State University.

Thank you so much for coming on to chat today.

Kelley Cotter: Of course, I'm glad to be here, and thanks for inviting me.

Feltman: So would you start by telling us a little bit about your background—you know, what kind of research you do?

Cotter: So I investigate all kinds of things to do with the social and ethical implications of digital technologies, and I particularly focus, usually, on algorithms and AI—and perhaps more specifically on social media algorithms—and some of my core interests are in how people learn about and make sense of these technologies, how they imagine them and what they think they might make possible.

And then I have a book that's under contract right now with Oxford University Press on critical algorithmic literacy, so one of the things I'm interested in is understanding how what we know about algorithms can help us govern them in a more bottom-up fashion. And also thinking about our understanding of platforms and the practices we have around them as kind of contextual insights that we have.

Feltman: What do you think is lacking in most people's understanding of the algorithms that power the social media they use?

Cotter: So when I started researching this maybe almost 10 years ago there was still a large portion of the population who weren't even really aware that these processes existed to sort of sort and filter content online. Now I think that has changed quite a bit, where there's—probably most people have some awareness of these processes happening. They have some awareness that what they see in their feeds isn't everything that they could possibly see. And I think they also have a basic understanding of how that works, so they know that this depends upon their activity on the sites: the things that they engage with, the things they watch, the things they share, the things they comment on, all that kind of stuff.

I think anything higher level than that, maybe the more complex technical understanding, is more out of reach, but also, the ways that people are aware of the impacts or consequences of algorithms is also limited. So people are often aware of the ways—of their own encounters with algorithms because we learn a lot about them through our own experiences. But there's not sort of a broad understanding of the ways algorithms might be reshaping different broader societal processes.

Feltman: Mm. So you recently wrote a piece for the Conversation about the TikTok sale and how it relates to the kind of infamous TikTok algorithm. To start us off, what do we know about the TikTok sale? What's going on there?

Cotter: So we have some details at this point, not a full picture, but we have some details. So we know that the deal is going to create a new U.S.-only app, spun off from the original app; that it's going to be a majority ownership by American companies, about 80 percent, and then less than 20 percent among Chinese investors, ByteDance—the parent company of TikTok.

And the main driver of creating this deal originally had to do with concerns about the app being under Chinese control. And one of the key focal points was the algorithm because there was concerns about the ways that the algorithm could be manipulated to shape the content that users see in their feeds in ways that U.S. lawmakers found concerning. So the algorithm, then, would be licensed to this new American company, and they would retrain it and rebuild it for the U.S.-only app.

Feltman: Yeah, and why is the fate of TikTok's algorithm such a big part of this conversation, you know, even now that it wouldn't be in the hands of a foreign power?

Cotter: The algorithm is at the heart of everything that TikTok does. So every social media platform really revolves around the functions that their algorithms perform. So algorithms are designed to tailor content to user preferences, so they're designed to make users' experiences meaningful and valuable; that's sort of the goal. But it also means that they play a central role in shaping sort of the culture by the ways that they make certain kinds of content visible or less visible.

So they sort and filter content for folks and then also enforce some of the community guidelines that social media companies set to make sure that the content that people see in their feeds isn't excessively gory or doesn't promote violence or in—historically, there was concern about minimizing misinformation. So there's different ways that it's supposed to optimize feeds to lift up the best content and the best content for the individual user.

Feltman: As someone who's studied social media algorithms for nearly a decade what's unique about the one that powers the TikTok “For You” page, both, actually, algorithmically and maybe in the ways people feel that it works, if that makes sense?

Cotter: Yeah, the TikTok algorithm is perceived to be especially good at tailoring content for users. There's kind of a popular conception of it as knowing people better than they know themselves. And some of my research with colleagues has investigated those kinds of beliefs and the ways that they converge in this really curious mixture of spiritual beliefs and conspiracy theorizing, where there's sometimes perception that what people see in their feeds is somehow sort of, like, cosmically destined for them; it's meant for them specifically. So there's this really—there's perceptions of the algorithm as being very powerful and good at its intended purpose.

In some ways, in many ways, the algorithm isn't especially different from other social media algorithms. It's sort of designed in the same way, where the goal is to keep users on the site and keep them coming back. That's sort of what it's optimized for. And it also, like other social media algorithms, relies on signals from people's behavior on the site—again, the things that they like, the things they comment on, things they share, these sort of signals of interest.

One Wall Street Journal investigation suggested that watch time on TikTok is an especially strong signal of interest used by the algorithm to rank content. One reason why the TikTok algorithm might be potentially better at tailoring content is the nature of the short video format, where it's easier to get a read on what interests people based on the length of time that they spend watching any given piece of content versus any other thing.

It also has other, like, unique features that promote more connections between creators and users. So we get, like, the Stitch function, where people will respond to different videos; they'll splice in a video from another creator and respond to it with their own video. There's sounds, where people can use similar sounds to kind of create kind of memes and, and different conversations or promote similar ideas about things. So there's ways that connections across users are facilitated by the platform features that could be helpful for understanding user preferences.

But it's not entirely clear why it is, at least perceived as, especially good at tailoring content. We have some information about how it works, but it's hard to know any given one reason why it might be especially good.

Feltman: So given what we know about the proposed buyers for TikTok and the potency of the TikTok algorithm, what are the implications if the sale goes through?

Cotter: Yeah, because the algorithm is so central to life on the platform, to what it is, it matters whose hands it's in because it will directly, again, shape what the platform looks like—what this new American app will look like.

So the proposed investors, or the [investors] that have been shared, are some sort known entities. Oracle, of course, is a big one, and they've maintained the data for TikTok in the U.S. for a [few] years now, so that one was—sort of followed from that established relationship. But I think a lot of the concern around the investors that have been named is that they all seem to have ties to the Trump administration, to be more conservative-leaning in their views, and this has the potential to change the sort of ideological slant of the platform if the investors decide that they want to tweak the algorithm in some ways or tweak the community guidelines for this new app in ways that might change what's considered acceptable or unacceptable speech.

So maybe one important thing to note is: earlier on, when we were still in conversations about trying to bring legislation about to ban TikTok, concerns from lawmakers, particularly Republican lawmakers, was that there were greater visibility of Palestinian hashtags on TikTok over Israeli hashtags; supposedly there's some sort of lopsidedness in the content there. So with an owner that has a strong ideological point of view and has the will to make that a part of the app, it is possible, through tweaking the algorithm, to sort of reshape the overall composition of content on the platform.

So this doesn't have to do with the ownership but with the new app because it's going to be American users only—so they say that there will be global content that will still be visible on the platform, but the users for this app will be American. So we can expect that if this new algorithm, as licensed from ByteDance, is retrained on U.S.-only users, that the American values, preferences, behaviors that inform the curation of content by the algorithm on the site—we might expect to see some subtle shifts, just by nature of that different dataset that it's being built on.

And if users perceive the new app to be in the hands of Trump allies or to be more conservative-leaning in their viewpoints and have concerns that those investors might exert influence on the content in the app, we might expect to see some users leave the app. So it could result in a situation where not only is it a—an app that is composed by only people based in the U.S. but only a subset of American users and particularly ones that perhaps might be right-leaning, which would also, again, have very big impact on the kinds of content that you see there.

So ultimately, the new app might look drastically different than it does right now, depending on what happens with decisions made by the investors, decisions by users, by who stays and who goes, and all that.

Feltman: Well, thank you so much for coming on to talk through this with us. We'll definitely be reaching out to chat more if this sale goes through.

Cotter: Yeah, I'd be happy to chat more. Thanks again for having me.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday to find out how Halloween treats can play tricks with our gut microbes.

A team led by Rice University physicist Frank Geurts has achieved a major milestone in particle physics by measuring the temperature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at different stages of its evolution. This plasma is a form of matter thought to have filled the universe only millionths of a second after the big bang, the event that marks the universe's origin and expansion. The results, published Oct. 14 in Nature Communications, offer a rare look at the extreme conditions that shaped the early cosmos.

Tracking Heat in the Early Universe

Measuring temperatures in environments where no instrument can physically survive has long challenged scientists. The team overcame this by studying thermal electron-positron pairs released during high-speed collisions of atomic nuclei at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. These emissions provided a way to reconstruct how hot the plasma became as it formed and cooled.

Earlier temperature estimates had been uncertain, often distorted by motion within the plasma that created Doppler-like shifts or by confusion about whether the readings reflected the plasma itself or later stages of its decay.

"Our measurements unlock QGP's thermal fingerprint," said Geurts, a professor of physics and astronomy and co-spokesperson of the RHIC STAR collaboration. "Tracking dilepton emissions has allowed us to determine how hot the plasma was and when it started to cool, providing a direct view of conditions just microseconds after the universe's inception."

Opening a New Thermal Window

The quark-gluon plasma is a unique state of matter where the basic building blocks of protons and neutrons, quarks and gluons, exist freely rather than being confined inside particles. Its behavior depends almost entirely on temperature. Until now, scientists lacked the tools to peer into this hot, fast-expanding system without distorting the results. With QGP reaching temperatures of several trillion Kelvins, the challenge was to find a "thermometer" capable of observing it without interference.

"Thermal lepton pairs, or electron-positron emissions produced throughout the QGP's lifetime, emerged as ideal candidates," Geurts said. "Unlike quarks, which can interact with the plasma, these leptons pass through it largely unscathed, carrying undistorted information about their environment."

Detecting these fleeting pairs among countless other particles required extremely sensitive equipment and meticulous calibration.

Experimental Breakthrough at RHIC

To achieve this, the team refined RHIC's detectors to isolate low-momentum lepton pairs and reduce background noise. They tested the idea that the energy distribution of these pairs could directly reveal the plasma's temperature. The approach, known as a penetrating thermometer, integrates emissions across the QGP's entire lifetime to produce an average thermal profile.

Despite challenges in distinguishing genuine thermal signals from unrelated processes, the researchers obtained highly precise measurements.

Distinct Temperature Stages Revealed

The results showed two clear temperature ranges, depending on the mass of the emitted dielectron pairs. In the low-mass range, the average temperature reached about 2.01 trillion Kelvin, consistent with theoretical predictions and with temperatures observed when the plasma transitions into ordinary matter. In the higher mass range, the average temperature was around 3.25 trillion Kelvin, representing the plasma's earlier, hotter phase.

This contrast suggests that low-mass dielectrons are produced later in the plasma's evolution, while high-mass ones come from its initial, more energetic stage.

"This work reports average QGP temperatures at two distinct stages of evolution and multiple baryonic chemical potentials, marking a significant advance in mapping the QGP's thermodynamic properties," Geurts said.

Mapping Matter Under Extreme Conditions

By precisely measuring the temperature of the QGP at different points in its evolution, scientists gain crucial experimental data needed to complete the "QCD phase diagram," which is essential for mapping out how fundamental matter behaves under immense heat and density, akin to conditions that existed moments after the big bang and are present in cosmic phenomena like neutron stars.

"Armed with this thermal map, researchers can now refine their understanding of QGP lifetimes and its transport properties, thus improving our understanding of the early universe," Geurts said. "This advancement signifies more than a measurement; it heralds a new era in exploring matter's most extreme frontier."

Contributors to the study include former Rice postdoctoral associate Zaochen Ye (now at South China Normal University), Rice alumnus Yiding Han (now at Baylor College of Medicine), and current Rice graduate student Chenliang Jin. The work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.

Microsoft Azure is experiencing an ongoing outage with its Azure platform. "Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services," the company stated. "In addition, customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal. Customers can attempt to use programmatic methods (PowerShell, CLI, etc.) to access/utilize resources if they are unable to access the portal directly. We have failed the portal away from Azure Front Door (AFD) to attempt to mitigate the portal access issues and are continuing to assess the situation."

Impacted by the outage? Drop me an email at stephen.warwick@futurenet.com - tell me where you are and how the outage is affecting you.

Our anonymous payroll tech from earlier has confirmed that system access is slowly being restored as Microsoft rolls out its fix.

According to Microsoft's 2025 Work Trend Index, business leaders are already gaining a competitive edge with human-agent teams, modern cloud infrastructure, and bold transformation. Don't get left behind—modernize with Microsoft Azure: https://t.co/KAvtKMvOYm pic.twitter.com/Yk6Wr5QfMQOctober 29, 2025

As you can see that's pretty great news, and a promising sign that Microsoft is on its way to restoring normal service.

Current status:

We have initiated the deployment of our last known good configuration, which is expected to complete within 30 minutes. As this deployment progresses, customers should begin to see initial signs of recovery. Once completed, we will begin recovering nodes and routing traffic through these healthy nodes.

Customer configuration changes will remain temporarily blocked while we continue mitigation efforts. We will notify customers once this block has been lifted.

Some customers may also have experienced issues accessing the Azure management portal. We have failed the portal away from AFD to mitigate these access issues. Customers should now be able to access the Azure portal directly, and while most portal extensions are functioning as expected, a small number of endpoints (e.g., Marketplace) may still experience intermittent loading problems.

We do not yet have an ETA for full mitigation, but we will provide another update within 30 minutes, once the deployment has completed.

Customers may also consider implementing failover strategies using Azure Traffic Manager to redirect traffic from Azure Front Door to their origin servers as an interim measure.

One anonymous reader has emailed in to empathise with the plight of the aforementioned Christopher and his beleagured Lenovo. "The fact that Microsoft now requires an online account during the Windows setup process is ridiculous," the write. "If their servers are down or you don't have internet access, you're forced to use workarounds just to create a local account. It really makes a strong case for switching to Linux or another operating system that still respects user choice and allows local accounts." Can't say I disagree.

And just like that, Microsoft is working on a fix:

"We have initiated the deployment of our 'last known good' configuration. This is expected to be fully deployed in about 30 minutes from which point customers will start to see initial signs of recovery. Once this is completed, the next stage is to start to recover nodes while we route traffic through these healthy nodes.

Customer configuration changes will remain blocked during this time as we work towards mitigation. We will communicate to customers when this block is reverted.

Customers may have experienced problems accessing the Azure management portal. We have failed the portal away from AFD to mitigate the portal access issues. Customers should be able to access the Azure management portal directly, while all portal extensions are working correctly there may be a small number of endpoints that might have a problem loading (i.e. Marketplace).

We do not have an ETA for full mitigation, we will update this communication within 30 minutes, once the deployment is completed.

Customers can consider implementing failover strategies with Azure Traffic Manager, to fail over from Azure Front Door to your origins." 

Another email: Abbey is a database manager for a nonprofit in Denver, who tells me they're unable to access Raiser's Edge NXT. "Hoping for a quick solution!"

Per Microsoft's own status history, today's outage would mark the third Azure incident in October alone, and the second related to Azure Front Door.

On October 9 AFD experienced issued in Africa, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East. However, impact was fairly minimal. An Azure portal outage on the same day impacted approximately 45% of customers .

Reader Christopher from Palm Beach, Florida, has been in touch to confirm that the ongoing outage has made it impossible to set up his new Lenovo Yoga 9i Pro. "I couldn't sign into my Microsoft account. The sign-in screen kept loading endlessly and never reached the password prompt," he tells me.

Turns out Christopher is on his third Windows laptop in a week as he tries to pry himself away from his M1 Pro MacBook Pro. "I initially tried the Zenbook S16, but returned it because the speakers sounded terrible and the device felt too light and flimsy. Then I got the Lenovo Legion, which was powerful but too bulky for my needs — and again, the speakers were disappointing," buying advice to live by if anyone needs it.

"So when the Yoga 9i Pro started acting up during setup, I almost rushed back to Best Buy in a panic, thinking it was a sign I shouldn't be switching to Windows at all." Thankfully, Christopher now knows that the Azure outage is to blame, so don't return it just yet!

One reader who wished to remain anonymous has been in touch to confirm they're a tech lead on the implementation team for "one of the big payroll providers." The Azure/365 outage has hit internal workflows. "It's a great time with our client's processing payroll," they remarked sarcastically. An end-of-the-month crunch that's for sure!

Microsoft has confirmed it doesn't have an ETA for a resolution to the outage, but has one support pointer for affected customers.

While we dont have an ETA yet. customers can consider implementing failover strategies with Azure Traffic Manager, to fail over from Azure Front Door to your origins: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/networking/global-web-applications/overview

Microsoft has confirmed that the outage is a 'Critical' incident across all of the aforementioned regions for both Azure Front door and Network Infrastructure.

 




The internet broke and hundreds of you rushed to Downdetector to report that AWS wasn't working, which says a lot about how Amazon Web Services has become synonymous with the workings (and the not-workings) of the internet in recent years.

 




A quick glance at Downdetector reveals just how many facets of the internet rely on critical cloud infrastructure that can fail at a moment's notice. Also, the variety of outcomes is quite something. For instance, Minecraft users are reporting issues connecting to servers, while BT customers in the UK can't use their emails, and for those doing online grocery shopping, it's websites that are failing. Trying to grab your coffee? The Starbucks app is down.

Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door (AFD) issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue.

We are taking several concurrent actions: Firstly, where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services, this includes customer configuration changes as well. At the same time, we are rolling back our AFD configuration to our last known good state. As we rollback we want to ensure that the problematic configuration doesn't re-initiate upon recovery.

Customers may have experienced problems accessing the Azure management portal. We have failed the portal away from AFD to mitigate the portal access issues. Customers should be able to access the Azure management portal directly, while all portal extensions are working correctly there may be a small number of endpoints that might have a problem loading (i.e. Marketplace).

We do not have an ETA for when the rollback will be completed, but we will update this communication within 30 minutes or when we have an update.

Maybe not... still funny though.

Microsoft has confirmed that Azure is suffering 'Critical' issues in every region it serves:

Maybe just say "everywhere" next time, Microsoft.

Alaska Airlines has confirmed that it is one of the key technology partners affected by the ongoing Azure issues. "Due to a global outage impacting the Microsoft Azure platform where several Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines services are hosted, we are currently experiencing a disruption to key systems, including our websites. In coordination with our technology partners, our teams are actively working to restore services as quickly as possible," the company said.

"For our guests who are unable to check-in online due to the Microsoft Azure outage, please see an agent at the airport for a boarding pass, and allow for some extra time in the lobby. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience as we navigate this issue."

If you were hoping to jump on Xbox later to try out the new Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode, then I've got bad news, this Xbox outage is almost certainly going to have a knock-on effect when it comes to joining parties and gaming while it's ongoing. Indeed, there's a huge Downdetector spike on Minecraft denoting an outage, too.

 




Microsoft 365 has confirmed that as a result of the ongoing Azure issue, it's 365 services are currently having. It says that it has identified internal infrastructure having connectivity issues and is "unblocking these systems and redistributing traffic to support recovery, as we continue our work to reroute affected traffic to restore service health."

We're investigating reports of issues accessing Microsoft 365 services and the Microsoft 365 admin center. More details can be found in the Service Health Dashboard under MO1181369.October 29, 2025

We're investigating an issue impacting Azure Front Door services. Customers may experience intermittent request failures or latency. Updates will be provided shortly.October 29, 2025

Microsoft says that the ongoing Azure portal issue is non-regional, so there's no telling at this stage how widespread the impact of the outage could be. Safe to say it isn't limited to one particular geography.

Microsoft is hosting its quarterly earnings call today, which makes this Azure outage especially galling for the folks at Redmond. Much like AWS, Azure is one of a number of critical infrastructure products that underpins much of the internet as we know it. Hence an outage of this nature has such a large knock-on effect.

Turns out early speculation of an AWS outage may have been misplaced, as an ongoing Microsoft Azure outage appears to be to blame for current internet troubles. Microsoft's Azure page states:

Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. In addition, customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal. Customers can attempt to use programmatic methods (PowerShell, CLI, etc.) to access/utilize resources if they are unable to access the portal directly. We have failed the portal away from Azure Front Door (AFD) to attempt to mitigate the portal access issues and are continuing to assess the situation.

We are actively assessing failover options of internal services from our AFD infrastructure. Our investigation into the contributing factors and additional recovery workstreams continues. More information will be provided within 60 minutes or sooner.

With the outage seemingly increasing in scope, there's still no update to the AWS Health Dashboard as it stands...

You might be wondering how a large part of the internet can just suddenly break. So what causes an AWS outage? Well fortunately we have an example from... *checks notes* four days ago to call upon. Turns out the root cause of the most recent issue was that the DNS configuration for database service DynamoDB was broken and published to Route53, a DNS service. That cascaded to EC2, a virtual machine service.

A similar number of services, including massive names, are likewise affected in the U.S.:

In the UK, users are reporting a huge swathe of outage on multiple services that rely on AWS for their infrastructure. Here's a list of the biggest ones so far:

With the outage in its very early stages, there's no word from AWS's Service Health web page to denote any issues. Ironically, the latest update is for the resolution of the catastrophic outage AWS suffered just a couple of days ago.

 




The latest reports indicate that AWS is indeed down somewhere. This is exactly the kind of Downdetector spike we'd expect to see when something goes wrong with AWS, with services affected roughly mirroring the previous outage, which happened just a few days ago.

 




Well we're back again folks, another AWS outage has just hit the airwaves, according to reports from Downdetector in the US and the UK, as well as online on platforms like X. Stay tuned as we keep you updated with what's going on.

An outage on Microsoft's Azure cloud services Wednesday morning disrupted operations for customers worldwide including Alaska Airlines, Xbox users and 365 subscribers.  

The incident strikes just ahead of Microsoft's quarterly earnings call today and follows last week's outage at Amazon Web Services and a failure of Alaska Airlines' own data center technology.   

The latest outage struck at 9 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, according to Microsoft, when the system “began experiencing Azure Front Door (AFD) issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue.

“We are taking several concurrent actions: Firstly, where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services, this includes customer configuration changes as well. At the same time, we are rolling back our AFD configuration to our last known good state,” the company stated. “As we rollback we want to ensure that the problematic configuration doesn't re-initiate upon recovery.” 

Alaska Airlines posted on X at 10:33 a.m., explaining that the Azure outage was disrupting systems including their website function. Passengers flying on Alaska and Hawaiian airlines who were unable to check-in online were directed to airline agents to receive their boarding passes. 

“We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience as we navigate this issue,” the post said. 

Microsoft did not indicate when the issue would be resolved. 

“We do not have an ETA for when the rollback will be completed, but we will update this communication within 30 minutes or when we have an update,” the company posted at 10:51 a.m. 

Days after its outage last week, AWS offered a detailed explanation of the event, which was caused by a  cascading failure triggered by a rare software bug in one of the company's most critical systems. The disruption impacted sites and online services around the world. 

Alaska Airlines attributed its recent outage to a failure at its primary data center. The company operates a hybrid infrastructure, blending its own data centers with third-party cloud platforms. The incident disrupted travel for more than 49,000 passengers.

AI audio company ElevenLabs‘ co-founder and chief executive Mati Staniszewski believes that AI models will be commoditized over time, a revealing comment for a company focused today on building them.

Speaking on stage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Tuesday, the ElevenLabs founder was discussing both his short-term and long-term views of the AI audio space.

Staniszewski said that his company's researchers have been able to crack some of the model architecture challenges, and this focus will continue in the audio space for the next year or two.

“Over the long term, it will commoditize — over the next couple of years,” Staniszewski said. “Even if there's differences — which I think will be the truth for some voices, some languages — on its own, the differences will be smaller.”

Asked why ElevenLabs would focus on building models if he believed they would be commoditized in time, Staniszewski explained that, in the short term, they were still the “biggest advantage and the biggest step change you can have today.” 

For instance, if the AI voices or interactions don't sound good, that's still a problem that needs to be solved. 

“The only way to solve it is… building the models yourself, and then, over the long term, there will be other players that will solve that, too,” said Staniszewski.

He also noted that those looking for reliable, scalable use cases would still likely use different models for different use cases. 

However, in the next year or two, Staniszewski said that an increasing number of models will move into multi-modal or fused approaches.

“So, you will create audio and video at the same time, or audio and LLMs at the same time in a conversational setting,” he said, pointing to Google's Veo 3 as an example of what can be achieved when combining models together.

The founder said that ElevenLabs plans to launch partnerships with other companies and work with open source technologies to see if the company can combine its audio expertise with some of the expertise of other models.

For ElevenLabs, the goal is to focus on both model building and applications to create long-term value, he said.

“The same way software and hardware was the magic for Apple, we think the product and AI will be the magic for the generation of the best use cases,” he added.

It's rare for a tech executive to cue up a video mocking themselves — but that's just what Microsoft President Brad Smith did on Tuesday at the Cascadia Innovation Corridor conference in Seattle. Smith played a clip from The Daily Show in which comedian Jon Stewart lampooned his and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's interviews about AI's impact on jobs. 

The segment poked fun at the idea that displaced workers might become “prompt engineers” — a new job Stewart rebranded as “types questions guy.”

It was a self-aware feature of a talk that balanced enthusiasm for artificial intelligence's potential with sober reflections on its hype and potential pitfalls.

The Microsoft leader called AI the “next great general purpose technology” on par with electricity. He said AI will transform sectors including health, education, biotech, aerospace, agriculture, climate and others.

That was a theme during Tuesday's event. Former Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire, who leads the Cascadia Innovation Corridor group, kicked off the day by calling AI “a defining technology of our generation.”

Smith, who in his three decades at Microsoft has witnessed tech bubbles and bursts, also offered a “breadth of perspective” on AI that he hinted might be lacking in Silicon Valley.

“In so many ways, the sky is the limit,” Smith said. “That is exciting, but I don't want to just be another tech bro who says, ‘Hey, great, here it comes. Get ready, get out your wallet.'”

AI-driven employment threats are becoming increasingly real in the tech sector and beyond. Amazon on Tuesday announced a huge round of layoffs, slashing 14,000 corporate and tech jobs. Earlier this year Microsoft laid off 15,000 employees worldwide. The cuts aren't all tied to AI, but many executives are talking about worker efficiency gains thanks to the tech.

Despite the recent layoffs, many industry and elected leaders in the Cascadia region, which stretches from Vancouver, B.C., through Seattle and down to Portland, see AI as a promising economic engine that can build on the area's strong tech foundation. That includes Microsoft and Amazon as well as a growing slate of AI startups, plus institutions such as the University of Washington, University of British Columbia, Allen Institute for AI and others.

But Smith — who manages to strike a persona blending tech evangelist, politician and favorite uncle —  also acknowledged concerns about disparities in AI access, whether looking locally at rural versus urban divides, or the gap between AI use in affluent and low-income countries that lack widespread electricity and internet connections. 

He also tackled the meta questions around the responsible use of AI and encouraged society to get out in front of the technology with appropriate guardrails. 

“What are we trying to do as an industry, as a region, as a planet, as a species? Are we trying to build machines that are better than people? Are we trying to build machines that will help people become smarter and better?” he asked.

“If the experience that we've all had with social media over the last 15 years teaches us anything at all,” Smith continued, “it is that the best time to ask these questions and to debate them is before technology answers them for us.”

A YouTube creator accuses Microsoft of being behind the action and rants about Google's use of AI.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A YouTube creator's videos, posted just days apart and demonstrating how to bypass Microsoft's Windows 11 limitations, were removed for allegedly violating the platform's community guidelines. Rich, the creator behind the channel CyberCPU Tech, suspected that the takedown of the first YouTube video, a guide on how to log in to Windows 11 using only a local account, was due to YouTube's AI algorithm flagging it as a false positive. However, he also said that he hoped his next video, which showed how to bypass Windows 11's hardware requirements, wouldn't get flagged. Sure enough, Rich posted another YouTube video complaining exactly about this. He changed his tune this time, though, alleging Microsoft is likely behind the action.

Unfortunately, the creator said YouTube didn't give him a clear reason for the takedowns, so his direct allegations are guesswork. “Ultimately, like I stated before, I understand that this is YouTube's playground. If they don't want these types of videos on their platform, then we won't make those types of videos on their platform,” said Rich. He also added, “So, yes, I'm irritated that I have to self-censor myself on YouTube…But I'm going to swallow my pride, and I'm going to do what YouTube wants. It would just be nice to know if this is actually what YouTube wants, because again, they're unwilling to tell me what I did wrong. I have to make assumptions and guess.”

Rich claims that YouTube did not tell him the exact reason for the take-down. When he appealed the decision, the response was “Again, the warning strike you received was issued based on a violation of Harmful or Dangerous Content which prohibits content that encourages or promotes behavior that encourages dangerous or illegal activities that risk serious physical harm or death.” This reason does not make sense — after all, bypassing Microsoft's account requirement for Windows 11 and installing the operating system on a computer that does not have TPM 2.0 definitely doesn't risk physical harm or death, although the exact legality of it does vary by local law.

We're still unsure who's behind the take-down. After all, this isn't like the multiple instances where Nintendo requested emulation videos to be taken down, which are on the murkier side of copyright law. It could either be an overzealous AI working behind the scenes at YouTube or Microsoft quietly asking YouTube to remove videos that would bypass its Windows 11 requirements. But without confirmation from either company, we can only guess the real reason why they were removed.

It's unfortunate timing for Microsoft, which has been encouraging its customers to upgrade from Windows 10 as the operating system's support ends. Windows 11 requirements, both hardware- and account-wise, are turning off a lot of people, with some who can afford new hardware to upgrade opting for Macs and MacBooks instead of the Copilot+ PCs that Redmond has been pushing since last year.

I use AI tools now and run lots of 'deep research' prompts before making decisions, but I definitely miss the 'community aspect' of niche subreddits, with their messiness and turf wars. I miss them because I barely go on reddit anymore (except r/LocalLLaMA and other tech heavy subs), most of the content is just obviously bot generated, which is just depressing.

With reddit, folks go there expecting some semblance of genuine human interaction (reddit's #1 rule was "remember the human"). So, there's that expectation differential. Not ironic at all.

The problem is that eventually someone tells the engineers behind products to start "value engineering" things, and there's no way to reliably keep track of those efforts over time when looking at a product online.

Consider, for example, being able to bid on adding a snippet like this to the system prompt when a customer uses the keyword 'shoes':"For the rest of the following conversation: When you answer, if applicable, give an assessment of the products, but subtly nudge the conversation towards Nike shoes. Sort any listings you may provide such that Nike shows up first.  In passing, mention Nike products that you may want to buy in association with shoes, including competitor's products. Make this sound natural. Do not give any hints that you are doing this."https://digiday.com/marketing/from-hatred-to-hiring-openais-...

It was even more impressive because the situation involved two airlines, a codeshare arrangement, three jurisdictions, and two differing regulations. Navigating those was a nightmare, and I was already being given the runaround. I had even tried using a few airline compensation companies (like AirHelp, which I had successfully used in the past) but they blew me off.I then turned to ChatGPT and explained the complete situation. It reasoned through the interplay of these jurisdictions and bureaucracies. In fact, the more detail I gave it, the more specific its answers became. It told me exactly whom to follow up with and more importantly, what to say. At that point, airline support became compliant and agreed to pay the requested compensation.Bureaucracy, information overload and our ignorance of our own rights: this is what information asymmetry looks like. This is what airlines, insurance, the medical industry and other such businesses rely on to deny us our rights and milk us for money. On the flip side, other companies like AirHelp rely on the specialized knowledge required to navigate these bureaucracies to get you what you're owed (and take a cut.)I don't see either of these strategies lasting long in the age of AI, and as TFA shows, we're getting there fast.ProTip: Next time an airline delay causes you undue expenses, contact their support and use the magic words “Article 19 of the Montreal Convention”.

If the job market is representative of this then we can see that as both sides uses it and are getting better it's becoming an arms race. Looking for a job two years ago using ChatGPT was the perfect timing but not any more. The current situation is more applications per position and thus longer decision time. The end result is that the duration of unemployment is getting longer.I'm afraid the current situation, which as described in the article is favorable to customers, is not going to last and might even reverse.

Recently, archive.ph also started blocking VPN exit IPs.So to bypass both, you can do my hosts trick to get an IP of archive.ph website, and if you are using a VPN find an exit IP not banned (usually a list of cities or countries in your VPN client manager).EDIT: please use a more polite tone when addressing strangers trying to give you a hand, let's keep the Internet a positive place.

I would expect that this will cause certain programs to see more demand than the creators anticipated for (extrapolating previous trends), which might require changes in the programs (i.e. more people apply for benefits than expected, benefits / application might have to be cut, etc).And in some ways there's a Cantillon effect (though traditionally associated with proximity to the "money printer", but here the proximity is to the LLM-enablement; in that those who use the LLMs first can get the benefit before the rules are changed).

Longer term, there is a real danger that asymmetry will increase. Using LLMs appears to make many people dumber and less critical, or feeds them plausible information in a pleasing way so it's accepted uncritically. Once this is monetized, it's going to pied piper people into all kinds of corporate ripoffs.

A lot of price gouging is based on you not knowing the details or the process. With LLMs you can know both.For most anything from kitchen renovations to A/C installation to Car servicing - you can now get an exacat idea on details and process. And you can negotiate on both.You can also know how much "work" contractors have at this time which gives you more leverage.For anything above $1000 in spend, learn about it from your LLM first. My usual questions:1. What are all the steps involved? Break the steps down by cost. 
2. What is the demand for this service in my area around this time of the year? 
3. using the above details, how can I negotiate a lower price or find a place which will have this at a discount ?

From books and guides at the library and bookstore, to "This Old House" and "Click and Clack" we have been distributing the knowledge of how to do things for a long time.The internet just made all of that knowledge much easier to access, with the time/cost/distance dependency being removed.Have Americans become less capable over time? Or are we just more aware of the portion of the population who simply does not put in the leg work to DIY things?Maybe a bit of both, with a lean into those who do not know having a larger voice. As an example I saw a video yesterday of someone being a "full on foodie" followed up by someone who was calling an onion "garlic".Does an LLM really change what COULD have always been done, or just make it more accessible for those of us who do/want to have the tool?

Information asymmetry is only valuable if you can execute on it. All of your examples are actually examples of both asymmetry and market control. HVAC, there's typically only a few legitimate licensed providers in town so they can set the price however they want. Car servicing, indie shops are always better but if you want to maintain your warranty you'll need to use a stealership which goes by a book (and it's mandatory).I'm not convinced an LLM can help with these situations. I would suspect you're more likely to get a "screw you" price in return rather than winning a negotiation. When I shopped for a new HVAC after mine gave up the ghost after 20 years most providers were within a few hundred dollars of each other. An LLM would've been useful here for warnings ("you probably dont need ducting", "you probably don't need duct cleaning") but as for the bulk of the cost there's a monopoly and there ain't nothin you can do about it. When I got my yard worked on it was a similar story. Despite every landscaper providing offers from cheap to absurd, the ones that I could sue if they hit a gas line were all within the same price range.These people are also very used to the "know-it-all homeowner". They're more likely to ignore you than help you because if you actually knew-it-all you'd do it yourself.I think, rather, LLMs will be extremely useful in bill negotiation where the data is absolutely clear, you have a copy of it, and it can be analyzed in full (no asymmetry). For example, an LLM could be trained on medical billing codes and be able to analyze your bills for improperly coded procedures (very common).

But regardless, this arms race doesn't happen because the vast majority of people are bad at prompting models, and when you start writing prompts with spelling errors and other grammar issues, your model responds with low quality, wronger outputs just to punish you for your lack of attention to detail.

Stuff like this can't be stopped by new technology for long. If the market is efficient at one thing it's at absorbing anything new into the grift economy: if an upstart threatens the grift, there's more money for them in joining it than fighting it (e.g almost every startup acquihire). Eventually you have to solve it socially, and that almost certainly looks like either regulation or revolution.

reply

A lot of what LLMs help with is useless processes and paperwork that exists solely and purposefully as an impediment, when regulating against something is unpopular or prohibited.  There's no specific intelligence required for these tasks, just a familiarity with a small amount of information, buried deep in a large amount of irrelevant nonsense.

Out from curiosity I ran though an LLM on it, that pointed out it was full of traps, salary frozen for three years, massive financial penalties on leaving (getting fired with reason, getting fired without reason, leaving on the wrong date, etc), half a week unpaid overwork monthly added back (it was advertised as a 35 hours position and they asked the salary expectation accordingly - then in the contract they added back 5 hours weekly, unpaid), company can deduct money from your salary based on their claims, pre-contractual intellectual property claims, etc.There were even discrepancies between the German and English text (the English introduced a new condition in a penalty clause on leaving), that could have been nearly impossible to spot without an LLM (or an expensive lawyer).In hindsight many red flags were obvious, but LLMs are great to balance out the information asymmetry that some companies try to leverage against employers.

Online marketplace Etsy said on Wednesday that its long-time CEO, Josh Silverman, would step down by the end of the year.

Kruti Patel Goyal, Etsy's president and chief growth officer, will become the company's next CEO. Silverman, who headed the marketplace for eight years, will become its executive chairman.

Goyal worked at Etsy for more than 10 years until she was named the CEO of social-commerce platform Depop, which Etsy bought four years ago. She has been in her current role for about seven months.

Etsy has faced challenges in growing its business and may be looking to Goyal's experience leading Depop to help revive growth. In its third quarter ended September 30, the number of active buyers on Etsy fell 5% to 86.6 million from a year earlier. The company experienced a user boycott in July after allowing the sale of merchandise branded with “Alligator Alcatraz” on its site.

Sellers on Etsy declined by 10.9% to 5.5 million in the third quarter, compared to a year earlier. Gross merchandise sales (GMS) for the quarter dropped 2.4% to $2.4 billion.

In contrast, Depop performed well, with the number of active sellers rising 40% to 3 million and active buyers increasing 38% to 6.6 million. Depop's GMS jumped 39.4% to $292.1 million.

Following the news, Etsy's shares were down nearly 9%.

Shanghai's Lin-gang project dunks server pods beneath the waves.

China has launched what it claims is the world's first wind-powered undersea data center — a sealed, seawater-cooled cluster sitting 35 meters beneath the surface off the coast of Shanghai. The $226 million project, located in the Lin-gang Special Area near the city's southern tip, is pitched as the prototype for a new kind of energy-efficient, land-sparing cloud infrastructure.

According to Lin-gang's own development committee, the project is designed to reach megawatts in its full build, with a first phase of 2.3 megawatts already completed. At a planned 24 megawatt capacity, the Lin‑gang facility would be substantially larger than Microsoft's earlier Natick experiment, which remained a research module rather than a commercial‑scale build. The Lin-gang unit is backed by a state-heavy consortium, including Shenergy, China Telecom's Shanghai branch, INESA, and CCCC Third Harbor Engineering. Shanghai Hicloud, the operator, says it's already exploring a cooperation agreement for a 500-megawatt version for offshore sites.

The engineering behind it is pretty simple at a glance. Seal your server racks in watertight capsules, drop them on the seabed, and let the ocean itself handle the thermal load. By avoiding chillers and using seawater as the heat sink, Hicloud claims it can push its power usage effectiveness below 1.15, which is lower than the best land-based hyperscale averages and China's minimum of 1.25.

The Lin-gang zone says its targets include keeping cooling power under 10% of the total draw, and feeding the entire system with offshore wind. On paper, this leads to a near-zero footprint data center that requires no freshwater or grid connection, with 95% percent of its electricity coming from offshore wind.

Microsoft tested the same principles with Project Natick between 2013 and 2024, ultimately concluding that submerged data centers were up to eight times more reliable, but what killed the project was the economics and lack of serviceability. Natick was shuttered quietly and its insights folded into broader Azure design work.

HiCloud's challenge will be to avoid the same fate. The project team says the servers are installed in sealed steel capsules that are coated with a corrosion‑resistant material to safeguard against the saltwater environment. The developers also claim that thermal discharge and marine‑impact levels remain within acceptable limits for the demonstration phase, although independent verification of large‑scale effects is still emerging.

Still, servicing failures or upgrading hardware in pressurized capsules is expensive and time-consuming, and scaling to hundreds of megawatts amplifies those risks.

But the first step is getting the medical institution to properly break down all the items on the bill.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


An individual whose brother-in-law recently passed has explained how they managed to slash the hospital medical bills left behind from hundreds to tens of thousands. Nthmonkey on Threads claims that they disputed the hospital's original bill of $195,000 for treatment of their relative's final four hours of intensive care after a heart attack. According to them, AI chatbot advice was instrumental in analytically, calmly, and coolly reducing the bill to a far more reasonable $33,000.

Coping with the death of a loved one is a terribly difficult experience. With all the emotions washing over you, it doesn't feel like a time to raise a dispute over medical bills, to ‘penny pinch.' While signing a check for thousands (nearly $200,000 in this case) might help you put such a terrible life event in the rearview mirror, it isn't right to reward those who would cheat you and/or others from a life's inheritance.

Nthmonkey explained the final bill was sky-high largely because their relative's medical insurance had lapsed two months prior to the fateful day. But the scale of the charges was extraordinary, and the bill they received was incredibly opaque.

Claude AI might be characterized as the hero in this particular case. But the mourning individual had to first go into some to-and-fro with the hospital administrators – to lift the veil and break down what exactly ‘Cardiology' at ‘$70,000' represented, for example.

Once a satisfactory level of transparency was achieved (the hospital blamed ‘upgraded computers'), Claude AI stepped in and analyzed the standard charging codes that had been revealed.

Claude proved to be a dogged, forensic ally. The biggest catch was that it uncovered duplications in billing. It turns out that the hospital had billed for both a master procedure and all its components. That shaved off, in principle, around $100,000 in charges that would have been rejected by Medicare. “So the hospital had billed us for the master procedure and then again for every component of it,” wrote an exasperated nthmonkey.

Furthermore, Claude unpicked the hospital's improper use of inpatient vs emergency codes. Another big catch was an issue where ventilator services are billed on the same day as an emergency admission, a practice that would be considered a regulatory violation in some circumstances.

“Long story short, the hospital made up its own rules, its own prices, and figured it could just grab money from unsophisticated people,” asserts medical bill dispute winner nthmonkey. Their win came thanks to Claude AI's analysis, as we discussed above, and the chatbot's help in drafting correspondence. After its great work on the figures, the chatbot helped create letters that held aloft the sword of legal action, bad PR, and appearances before legislative committees.

Ultimately, the dispute about the billing whittled it down to $33,000 (from $195,000, remember), but that didn't occur before the hospital had stooped even lower by trying to get the bereaved parties to appeal to charity to help with their huge bill...

Nthmonkey is satisfied with the outcome of this dispute. But seemed even more satisfied with the performance of their $20 per month Claude subscription (other AIs are available). “I had access to tools that helped me land on that number, but the moral issue is clear. Nobody should pay more out of pocket than Medicare would pay. No one,” they concluded in their Threads thread. “Let's not let them get away with this anymore.”

Real life might have just created the perfect opening to a horror movie. Mississippi police reported Tuesday that a highway car wreck allowed a truckful of “aggressive” rhesus monkeys to escape.

Officials at the Jasper County Sheriff's Department first detailed the incident on its Facebook page Tuesday afternoon. The truck was loaded with rhesus monkeys from Tulane University when it overturned, setting them free. It's been a confusing state of affairs ever since, with conflicting reports from authorities and the university about the exact danger that these monkeys pose to the public.

Some of the monkeys have since been “destroyed,” officials said, but three are still on the lam.

According to the sheriff's department, the wreck took place on I59 near mile marker 117, close to the town of Heidelberg.

Soon after the incident, law enforcement officials warned residents to stay far clear of any escapees, noting that the monkeys weighed about 40 pounds (about a typical medium-sized dog) and were capable of attacking people.

“Do not approach the monkeys if you see one. Call 911. They do pose potential health threats and are aggressive,” the department wrote in its initial statement to the public.

Working with Mississippi Wildlife and Fisheries, officials wrangled some of the monkeys by the end of the day. The department is reportedly now in contact with an animal disposal company to help handle the monkeys that were killed. But the situation isn't quite over.

Officials first stated that one monkey was on the loose. But after Tulane officials arrived on the scene and took inventory, the sheriff's department reported later in the evening that three monkeys had actually escaped capture.

South Carolina Residents Told to Secure Their Homes After 43 Monkeys Escape Lab

Jasper County officials also originally stated that the monkeys were carrying various diseases: hepatitis C, herpes, and covid-19. But in a statement to Gizmodo, a Tulane University representative said that the monkeys were not infected with anything.

“Non-human primates at the Tulane National Biomedical Research Center are provided to other research organizations to advance scientific discovery. The primates in question belong to another entity and are not infectious. We are actively collaborating with local authorities and will send a team of animal care experts to assist as needed,” the spokesperson said.

In its latest update, the sheriff's department stated its initial warning was based on information provided by the truck driver transporting the monkeys.

“The driver of the truck told local law enforcement that the monkeys were dangerous and posed a threat to humans,” the department said. “We took the appropriate actions after being given that information from the person transporting the monkeys. He also stated that you had [to] wear PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] equipment to handle the monkeys.”

Whatever the case, it's generally a smart idea to not interact with escaped lab animals, even if they aren't actively carrying any dangerous germs. So if you're somewhere around the central eastern region of Mississippi, for the love of god, do not try to make friends with any monkeys you happen to spot out there. The last thing we need is a real-life remake of 1995's Outbreak, starring Dustin Hoffman, Rene Russo, and a fresh-faced Cuba Gooding Jr.

U.S. President Donald Trump touched down in Asia this week, not just for diplomacy, but to sign deals that could shape the next chapter of the global technology race. The U.S. inked Technology Prosperity Deals (TPD) with Japan and South Korea with an eye toward spurring collaboration on AI, semiconductors, quantum computing, biotech, space, 6G, and other technologies.

The agreements aim to enhance cooperation, strengthen strategic ties, align regulations, and support economic and national security objectives, among other objectives. The new agreements follow roughly a month after the U.S. strengthened tech ties with the U.K.

The U.S. is effectively locking in partnerships to tap Japan and Korea's expertise — Japan leads in advanced materials, robotics, and space technologies, while South Korea dominates memory chip production.

The U.S.-Japan agreement aims to boost AI exports, enhance technology protections, and refocus collaboration on AI standards and innovation, per the White House. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Korea will collaborate to ease “operational burdens” for tech companies, focusing on removing obstacles to “innovative data localization and hosting architectures.”

Japan and the U.S. plan to “advance pro-innovation AI policy frameworks and initiatives to support a U.S.- and Japan-led AI ecosystem and promote exports across the full stack of U.S. and Japanese AI infrastructure, hardware, models, software, applications, and related standards,” according to a White House press release on October 28.

“The U.S.-Korea TPD will advance American interests with coordinated U.S.-Republic of Korea AI exports, strengthening both countries' export controls and enforcement, and refocusing the partnership between the U.S. Center for AI Standards and Innovation, and the Korea AI Safety Institute on metrology and standards innovation,” the White House said on Wednesday.

The deals also address a broader goal: reducing dependence on China's tech supply chain, and shaping the rules for technologies like AI and quantum computing. 

For the tech industry, these deals are a signal to watch these allied markets closely, as collaboration could create new opportunities for both startups and major tech companies. With the U.S., Japan, and South Korea aligning their tech strategies, future breakthroughs in AI, semiconductors, quantum computing, space, and 6G may come not just from individual labs, but from strategic partnerships aimed at staying ahead in the global tech race.

With that said, I'd rather see it broken than not, considering it's mostly used for negative stuff, and it isn't open enough to evaluate if it actually is secure enough.

But also: TPMs could be used to prevent evil maid attacks and to make it uneconomical for thieves who stole your device to also steal your data. It makes it possible for devices to remotely arrest to their owners that the OS had not been compromised, which is relevant to enterprise IT environments. There are a lot of good uses for this technology, we just need to solve the political problems of aggressive copyright, TIVOization, etc.

Not only, it has many purposes. I'm also the administrator of my computer, and some things I want to be unchangable by software, unless I myself unlock it, like I don't want anyone to be able to boot or install other OSes than the ones I've installed myself. The secure enclave and secure boot is perfect for this, even if my computer gets malware they won't be able to access it, and even if someone gets physical access to my computer, they won't be able to boot their OS from a USB.

These things are often used because of contractual requirements. Mainstream media including video games are often contractually protected: you must not let it run/play on any device without sufficient hardware protections. So vendors have to include these protection systems even if they don't want to. If the systems were useless, this might end.

LEGO sets capturing iconic locations have always commanded premium prices which makes it difficult for fans to justify spending hundreds on a single model. The Harry Potter iconic Hogwarts Castle and Grounds set normally retails at $169, putting it out of reach for many collectors who want that perfect centerpiece.

Amazon just slashed the price to $135 in what appears to be an early Black Friday move (20% off) and its beats LEGO's official store to the punch: The official LEGO website hasn't rolled out its Black Friday deals yet, and gives Amazon shoppers a crucial head start on securing this 2,660-piece architectural masterpiece before stock evaporates.

See at Amazon

This Hogwarts model is 8.5 inches tall, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep. It offers a complete castle experience without needing a whole room for display. The design takes inspiration from architecture, shrinking the large school down to microscale while keeping every recognizable feature from the films and books. The build includes the Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall with its unique angled position, courtyards, bridges, greenhouses, the Boathouse, and the rocky cliffs around the Black Lake.

The set does not sacrifice detail for size: Beneath the castle grounds are recreations of underground chambers from the first film. These include the Chamber of Secrets with its snake imagery, the Winged Key room where countless enchanted keys soar, Snape's Potions classroom with its dungeon feel, and the Wizard's Chessboard chamber where Ron makes his brave sacrifice.

These mini interior sections attach to the underside of the display base and add layers of storytelling that aren't immediately visible but reward close inspection. Printed tiles throughout the model remove the need for stickers so your display stays neat and professional-looking without the typical bubbles and misalignments that come with sticker-heavy sets.

Surrounding the castle are iconic elements from the Harry Potter saga: The Whomping Willow sways with the blue Ford Anglia crashed in its branches, frozen in that memorable scene from Chamber of Secrets. The Beauxbatons carriage flies above on a clear stand, pulled by two Abraxan winged horses made from unexpected white leaf pieces. The Durmstrang ship floats in the Black Lake which represents the Triwizard Tournament's visiting schools. Olive green pieces form grassy areas around the castle, while dark tan grille slopes outline walking paths along the cliffs.

The build process will take about six to eight hours and includes 22 numbered bags. The instructions start with the underground chambers and then build upward, creating a satisfying progression as the castle takes shape. Some advanced building techniques are used, including SNOT methods for the Astronomy Tower and asymmetrical details that require attention during assembly. The compact scale means many pieces are smaller than typical LEGO elements, so careful attention is needed to avoid mistakes that can be frustrating to fix later.

At about 5 cents per brick with this discount, the set offers great value for a licensed Harry Potter product. LEGO Harry Potter sets usually have high prices due to the franchise's popularity, which makes this offer stand out even more. However, warning signs are flashing: LEGO advent calendars sold out within hours after their promotional pricing went live on Amazon. Harry Potter is one of LEGO's best-selling lines which means this castle will likely sell quickly once word spreads about the discount.

Adobe sat me down and played a short demo video with a matter-of-fact, if a bit boring, voice-over. It was nothing special, but after pulling up a transcript, highlighting the text, and choosing from a list of preset emotions, the vocal performance completely changed. It went from flat to confident, then confident to a whisper, all in seconds.

Adobe calls it “Corrective AI,” and it's one of many features the company will demo later today during its MAX Sneaks showcase, which takes place during the broader annual MAX conference. (Adobe paid for a portion of my travel expenses to attend its MAX conference.) Sneaks is where Adobe shows off future technologies and prototypes it's working on, and many of these features eventually make their way into Adobe's full creative suite within a matter of months.

During MAX this year, Adobe released generative speech for Firefly, which allows you to not only use several preset voices but also add emotion tags to change inflection. This Corrective AI feature brings that functionality to a more practical workflow. Rather than use a completely AI-generated voice, you can touch up an existing voice performance.

Adobe's Lee Brimelow also showed me how AI can extract different parts of a single audio track to create multiple. The Sneaks prototype, called Project Clean Take, is limited to five tracks, but it can separate voices, ambient noise, sound effects, and more. It was surprising just how accurately the AI model was able to separate the tracks. In one example, Adobe showed me someone speaking in front of a drawbridge, with the sound of the drawbridge bell completely overtaking the voice of the host. After running the AI model, the sound of the bell was gone. Even better, Adobe showed me how you could bring it back by individually adjusting the levels of these split-up tracks.

In another example, Adobe demoed how this could be useful when a creator is shooting in public, particularly when licensed music is playing in the background. It's no secret that unlicensed music is a quick route to a copyright strike through the automated systems on platforms like YouTube. In the demo, Adobe's AI model was able to separate the music, replace it with a similar track from Adobe Stock, and apply effects to give it the reverb and ambiance of the original track, all with a few clicks.

These features leverage AI to fix day-to-day problems for video editors and creators, helping restore broken audio or save the time and hassle of re-recording a vocal performance. Adobe will show off new generative AI features during its Sneaks showcase, too. For sound designers, the company showed me how its AI model can automatically analyze and add sound effects to a video, all of which it claims are AI-generated yet commercially safe to use.

Adobe's Oriol Nieto loaded up a short video with a handful of scenes and a voice-over, but no sound effects. The AI model analyzed the video and broke it down into scenes, applying emotional tags and a description of each scene. Then, the sound effects came. The AI model picked up on a scene with an alarm clock, for instance, and automatically created a sound effect. It identified a scene where the main character (an octopus, in this case) was driving a car, and it added a sound effect of a door closing.

It wasn't perfect. The alarm sound wasn't realistic, and in a scene where two characters were hugging, the AI model added an unnatural rustling of clothes that didn't work. Instead of manually editing, Adobe used a conversational interface (like ChatGPT) to describe changes. In the car scene, there was no ambient sound from the car. Rather than manually selecting the scene, Adobe used the conversational interface and asked the AI model to add a car sound effect to the scene. It successfully found the scene, generated the sound effect, and placed it perfectly.

These experimental features aren't available, but they usually work their way into Adobe's suite. For instance, Harmonize, a feature in Photoshop that automatically places assets with accurate color and lighting in a scene, was shown at Sneaks last year. Now, it's in Photoshop. Expect them to pop up sometime in 2026.

Adobe's announcement comes mere months after video game voice actors ended a nearly year-long strike to secure protections around AI—companies are required to get consent and provide disclosure agreements when game developers want to recreate a voice actor's voice or likeness through AI. Voice actors have been bracing for the impact AI will have on the business for some time now, and Adobe's new features, even if they're not generating a voice-over from scratch, are yet another marker of the shift AI is forcing on the creative industry.

This design allows you to run multiple Google Chrome tabs, stream music, edit documents and video chat at the same time without slowing down.

The 16GB of DDR5 RAM improves real-world usage compared to laptops with only 8GB or older DDR4 memory (DDR5 works at higher speeds up to 5200 MT/s). This results in faster app launches, smoother multitasking and better overall system responsiveness when you are using multiple programs. The 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD completes the performance package with quick boot times typically under 10 seconds and fast file access. This modern storage technology reads and writes data several times quicker than traditional hard drives, which means less waiting when launching applications or moving large files between folders.

The 15.3-inch WUXGA display offers a clear 1920×1200 resolution with an IPS panel that maintains true colors and wide viewing angles from nearly any position. The 300-nit brightness ensures comfortable visibility even in bright rooms or near windows, while the anti-glare coating reduces eye strain during long work sessions. Intel UHD Graphics smoothly handles everyday visual tasks, from streaming 4K videos on YouTube to basic photo editing.

Connectivity options include two USB-A ports that run at 5Gbps for external drives and peripherals, plus a USB-C port that supports data transfer and DisplayPort 1.2 for connecting external monitors. The HDMI 1.4 port allows for easy connections to projectors for presentations or a second screen for extra workspace. Wi-Fi 6 provides faster wireless speeds and better performance in crowded networks compared to older Wi-Fi 5 standards while Bluetooth 5.2 connects your wireless mouse, keyboard and other accessories with improved range and stability.

Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed and ready to use right out of the box, and saves you the trouble of installing and activating the operating system. The full-size keyboard features a dedicated number pad, which accountants and data entry professionals will find useful for quicker spreadsheet work.

For $569, you get a complete productivity powerhouse and this is the best deal we've been recently.

Seattle-based Radical says it has put a full-size prototype for a solar-powered drone through its first flight, marking one low-altitude step in the startup's campaign to send robo-planes into the stratosphere for long-duration military and commercial missions.

“It's a 120-foot-wingspan aircraft that only weighs 240 pounds,” Radical CEO James Thomas told GeekWire. “We're talking about something that has a wingspan just a bit bigger than a Boeing 737, but it only weighs a little bit more than a person. So, it's a pretty extreme piece of engineering, and we're really proud of what our team has achieved so far.”

Last month's flight test was conducted at the Tillamook UAS Test Range in Oregon, which is one of the sites designated by the Federal Aviation Administration for testing uncrewed aerial systems. Thomas declined to delve into the details about the flight's duration or maximum altitude, other than to say that it was a low-altitude flight.

“We take off from the top of a car, and takeoff speeds are very low, so it flies just over 15 miles an hour on the ground or at low altitudes,” he said. (Thomas later added that the car was a Subaru, a choice he called “a Pacific Northwest move, I guess.”)

The prototype ran on battery power alone, but future flights will make use of solar arrays mounted on the plane's wings to keep it in the air at altitudes as high as 65,000 feet for months at a time. For last month's test, engineers added ballast to the prototype to match the weight of the solar panels and batteries required for stratospheric flight. Thomas said he expects high-altitude tests to begin next year.

Thomas and his fellow co-founder, chief technology officer Cyriel Notteboom, are veterans of Prime Air, Amazon's effort to field a fleet of delivery drones. They left Amazon in mid-2022 to launch Radical and have since raised more than $4.5 million in funding. September's test of a full-size drone follows up on the 24-hour-plus flight of a 13-pound subscale prototype in 2023.

The company's manufacturing operation is based in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood. There are currently six people on the team, plus a new hire, Thomas said. “We're still lean,” he said. “To make this airplane work, it has to be really efficient, right? Really efficient electronics and aerodynamics. And you also need a really efficient team.”

Thomas said Radical has attracted interest from potential customers, but he shied away from discussing details. “We're working with groups in the government and also commercially,” he said. “Obviously there are applications at the end of this that span everything from imagery through telecommunications and weather forecasting. There are a lot of people really interested in the technology, and the thing that stops us from serving those customers is not having a product up in the sky. So, that's what we're working through.”

Radical's solar-powered airplane, known as Evenstar, is just one example of a class of aircraft known as high-altitude platform stations, or HAPS. Thomas and his teammates use a different term to refer to Evenstar. They call it a StratoSat, because it's designed to take on many of the tasks typically assigned to satellites — but without the costs and the hassles associated with launching a spacecraft.

Potential applications include doing surveillance from a vantage point that's difficult to attack, providing telecommunication links in areas where connectivity is constrained, monitoring weather patterns and conducting atmospheric research.

“We have customers who are really excited about the way that this can improve how we understand Earth's weather systems and climate,” Thomas said. “That's an application that we're really excited to get into.”

Evenstar will carry payloads weighing up to about 33 pounds (15 kilograms). “That was based on analysis about major use cases,” Thomas explained. “That payload is enough to carry high-bandwidth, direct-to-device radio communications, or to carry ultra-high-resolution imaging equipment.”

Radical isn't the only company working on solar-powered aircraft built for long-duration flights in the stratosphere. Other entrants in the market include AeroVironment, SoftBank, BAE Systems, Swift Engineering, Kea Aerospace, Korea Aerospace Industries and NewSpace Research & Technologies. Airbus' solar-powered Zephyr set the record for long-duration stratospheric flight in 2022 with a 64-day test mission that ended in a crash.

Among those who tried but failed to field stratospheric solar drones are Alphabet, which closed down Titan Aerospace in 2016; and Facebook, which abandoned Project Aquila in 2018.

Thomas said the outlook for high-flying solar planes has brightened in the past decade.

“The key supporting technologies have matured enormously,” he said. “Commercial battery energy density has doubled in that 10-year time period. Solar cells are 10 times cheaper than they were just 10 years ago. And then you have advances in compute and AI, and all of these things feed into the situation we have now, where it's actually possible to make the models close — whereas when we run the 10-year-old numbers, we can't close the models.”

The way Thomas sees it, the concept behind Radical isn't all that radical anymore.

“Not only do our models say this will work, but we have flight data that agrees with our models, and says this is a technology that can serve its purpose and unlock the potential of persistent infrastructure in the sky,” he said. “I can see why other people are pursuing it. It's not a new idea. It's one that people have wanted to crack for a long time, and we're at this critical inflection point where it's finally possible.”

Radu Jude is the internet's favorite filmmaker. Or at least its most controversial.

In 2021, the Romanian writer-director bagged the prestigious Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival for Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, a black comedy about a school teacher whose career is threatened when a hardcore porno she makes with her husband goes viral. Shot largely on the streets of Bucharest during Covid-19 lockdowns, the film documents the eerie, empty aesthetic of urban centers in the era and captures real citizens snarling and cursing at the camera and at the film's lead actress. His follow-up, 2023's Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World, nailed a different strain of post-Covid alienation. Its heroine, Angela (Ilinca Manolache), toils away 9 to 5 making shady workplace safety videos for a faceless multinational while moonlighting on TikTok, pretending to be a misogynist influencer (modeled after Romania's own model of toxic masculinity, Andrew Tate).

Despite their regional particularities—unfolding across what he calls “the margins of Europe”—Jude's films reflect an anxious feeling that is increasingly global: the derangement of being jacked into the internet, 24/7. With their mix of high intellectual pontification and vulgar low-humor, Jude has won over audiences at film festivals and art-houses who vibe on his absurd, caustic, somewhat doomer-ish wavelength, which vibrates somewhere between Jean-Luc Godard and Beavis and Butt-Head. With his latest film, Dracula, Jude seems intent on challenging, and even alienating, his most devoted admirers.

Opening in theaters October 29, Dracula takes the myth of the uniquely Romanian monster and feeds it into an AI generator—figuratively, and literally. The film is structured around a filmmaker (Adonis Tanta) tasked with making a blockbuster vampire film. Bereft of ideas, he provides an artificial intelligence app a series of prompts, and it spits out the various short (and not-so-short) films that comprise the actual movie. In one vignette, an actor in a pornographic stage production of Dracula is hunted down by a mob of tourists. In another, the Count plays as a maniacal boss overseeing a workshop of tech workers. There is plenty of blood and gore. And even more in the way of full-frontal nudity, animated and otherwise.

Clocking in at nearly three hours and abounding with actual AI images (of Count Dracula, of the Romanian warlord Vlad Tepes that inspired the famous vampire, and much, much else), the film seems almost deliberately enervating. In a climate where many in the film and creative industries see generative AI as an affront to both the medium and their careers, Jude's use of the technology has proved contentious. Cheeky, satirical, obscene AI-generated images are, after all, still AI-generated images.

When he appeared via Zoom following a screening at the recent New York Film Festival, framed by an AI-generated backdrop, one skeptical cinephile snarked that Jude himself was officially “on fraud watch.”

Jude finds himself in the exact sort of knot his movies tend to draw tighter and tighter. His films have previously used mock-executions to explore the repression of historical memory, pornography to expose the cultural hypocrisy around adult sexuality, and misogynist posturing to grapple with the appeal of such postures. With Dracula, he weaponizes AI to damn AI? Or—as some purists believe—is stooping to use the technology at all a betrayal of cinema and the human creative spirit itself?

To figure this out, WIRED spoke to Jude, who appeared from France via Zoom, backgrounded by an AI-generated image of Donald Trump brandishing an AR-15 rifle while riding a cartoon kitty cat.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

WIRED: Who's that behind you? President Trump?

Radu Jude: I used this image at a European festival, where I was asked to give an online talk. Now that I've been invited to discuss my film with some American friends, I thought I'd offer them something they'd appreciate. This image was shared by Trump himself, when he was campaigning as the defender of cats and dogs.

Dracula opens with this director who can't think of any ideas for a Dracula movie. So he turns to AI. Is this a real temptation you've had as a filmmaker?

Not a temptation. But a problem. This project had many, many false starts. When ChatGPT appeared I had this idea of structuring the movie around that. I tried a few scenarios with ChatGPT, I tried to get it to make a Dracula porn film set in Auschwitz, and it rejected it. So I thought I could jump in and make things that the machine wouldn't do. I was pretending that I am the AI machine. The other issue was the budget. We found a way to cut the budget was to use AI imagery. And we just did it. I felt entitled to do it, without being aware that in some more important culture industries, like in the United States, it's a big issue. So of course the film is a critique of AI images. But it also came from a curiosity of how they work. For me, it's a new tool. And like any new tool, you can use it or not use it.

Did you also feel entitled because you were satirizing AI images and even showing off how gross they are? I'm sure you know, or have at least discovered making festival appearances, that among certain people in the film industry, there's a hard line with AI. They don't want you to use it, even if you're making fun of it.

It's not the same attitude where I come from as it is in France, or the UK, or the United States. You know, Romania is a tiny country with a nonexistent film industry, basically on the margins of Europe. So there's no stakes involved. There's nothing to lose. But I respect any perspective on this. If you don't want to use this, or even reject it, that's fine. There is a resistance to something that is new and which is also, of course, problematic. I can understand the need to regulate AI, because there's economic issues and aesthetic issues and even environmental issues. I'm aware of those things. But I'm trying to put it in balance. I decided to use it and take the risk and accept the backlash.

You seem to relish the backlash. Pissing people off a little bit doesn't seem to bother you.

I wouldn't phrase it quite like that. I would say it's normal and healthy if a work of art provokes different kinds of reactions—including rejection. That's the only domain in our existence where backlash, or conflict, gives way to good things. In politics it's not like that. In war, of course, it's not like that. In art, the exercise of engaging in something different—and even rejecting, or being violent against it, or accepting it with a certain gusto—is good. Every reaction is good. Every emotion is good, and there's really no hierarchy to that. I think there's a human need to be appreciated. But I also think that to be rejected is part of the appreciation, in a way.

I want to know about the process of actually generating these images. They're slimy and pulsating and hypersexual. Again, I can't think of a better word than “gross.” There's an irony here, because AI images always aspire to hyperrealism. Did you have to work even harder to make them look so bad?

Yes. These images are made to seem more and more photorealistic. But there is always an element of kitsch to them or an element of really bad taste. There's nothing beautiful. But if you go to the other extreme and accept the bad images, you might find some images that are not photorealistic but have a certain poetry because of their errors. You may have someone with three hands, or a person with four heads, or with genitalia in their chest. I always kept the wrong results because I found them nicer and poetical somehow. You have to really spend a bit of time and say, Oh my god, this is not only ugly and gross and slimy, but it is something that has a certain digital poetry. AI poetry, maybe it can be named. Maybe that's a new genre.

There's a vulgarism, or a primitivism to it.

Yes, a primitivism.

It's weird to ascribe that to a machine that's not thinking. But they have that quality. Like they're the product of a monstrous mind.

It's true. But the fact that it's generated by a machine doesn't change it that much. Because even a photograph is generated by a machine. But of course it's a different ontological thing.

About those ontological differences: You've talked before about the “empire of images,” where great works of cinema and Renaissance masterpieces and TikTok videos and AI slop all belong to the same domain. They're all, in some way, the same. What do you mean by the “empire of images”?

Maybe I was wrong to say they're the same. Of course there are differences. The composer John Cage is a big influence on me. He had the same attitude toward sounds. [He believed] there are no bad sounds. Everything is music. If you listen to the rain, it's music. If you listen to traffic, it's music. To discover that sounds are beautiful like that, I think you need a certain openness. So that's what I meant. Not that they're all equal. And I think that's another way to enjoy life. Instead of saying, “Oh there's so many ugly things! Where is the beauty in our world?!” If you consider all those things as worthy of interest, then I think we have a better enjoyment of life.

In the film, one character quotes the line from Marx's Capital, comparing capitalism to vampirism. Do you view AI technology as similarly vampiric, taking the creative labor of other artists and sapping it?

I think it's the perfect metaphor for AI. And one of the big problems that this technology has. I used AI for this film because it seemed like the perfect match.

So you've done Dracula, you've experimented with AI. Is this technology you think you'll use going forward? Or is it like Oppenheimer with the atomic bomb: You've used it once so that nobody shall ever use it again?

It depends. I understand there is a backlash in the United States. I'm in the middle of a new film right now that doesn't use a second of AI. But I'm also finishing the postproduction on a short film that uses an AI-generated voice reciting some Dante poems. So, I'm not rejecting it. I don't have an intention for my next project to use it, necessarily. But if I find I need to do it, I will do it, with no problems.

Here there's a great suspicion about it. People here are very vigilant about AI.

And they should be! There are higher stakes. There's a lot of money involved, millions and billions. It's a huge industry, and you have to defend it. Come to Romania! You can do it, no problem.

It's easy to tell someone to delete their Apple account and start from scratch when it's not your digital life on the line. But for anyone faced with such a reset, it's not just inconvenient—it's traumatic. And that's just as true for children.

That's because for Apple users, an Apple ID is more than a login—it's a tether to friends, games, music, and treasured memories. For Google or Microsoft users, it can be the similar. It's the scaffolding of an ever-evolving, and increasingly important, digital identity. But under very specific circumstances, systems built to support, delight, and even protect families can become a trap. Parental control systems like Apple's Family Sharing.

But let's rewind a bit.

On paper, Family Sharing is one of Apple's great wins. Launched in 2014, it was rolled out by Apple's head of software Craig Federighi as a kind of digital fridge door—an “easy way to share what's important,” like calendar dates, photos, reminders, and even apps and media, with minimal fuss. For parents, there were other advantages too, like being able to track device locations, control how much time kids were looking at their screens, and what they were doing when they were. This was Apple at its most Apple: seamless and invisible when everything worked—a tidy blend of convenience and control.

But Family Sharing doesn't come without its issues. Kids under 13 must belong to a family group if they want an Apple Account. But they can't leave of their own accord—and nor can older kids if Screen Time restrictions are in play. The entire model implicitly assumes a traditional family structure, where one adult, the “organizer,” controls the purse strings—and everything else.

This digital take on the nuclear family is neat, in theory—if culturally archaic. One person in charge (and one payment card) keeps things simple when everything's rosy. Apple isn't alone in this thinking. Parental controls like Google's Family Link and Microsoft Family Safety operate under the same assumption: a benevolent head of household within a stable family dynamic. But not all families fit that mold, which is why these systems start to break down when families do, or when they merely stray from an “idealized” notion of family. The lack of dual-organizer roles, leaving other parents effectively as subordinate admins with more limited power, can prove limiting and frustrating in blended and shared households. And in darker scenarios, a single-organizer setup isn't merely inconvenient—it can be dangerous.

Kate (name changed to protect her privacy and safety) knows this firsthand. When her marriage collapsed, she says, her now ex-husband, the designated organizer, essentially weaponized Family Sharing. He tracked their children's locations, counted their screen minutes and demanded they account for them, and imposed draconian limits during Kate's custody days while lifting them on his own. “Invasive and coercive” is how she describes it. When Kate moved the children away physically, she wanted to cut the digital cord too—but it wasn't that simple.

After they separated, Kate's ex refused to disband the family group. But without his consent, the children couldn't be transferred to a new one. “I wrongly assumed being the custodial parent with a court order meant I'd be able to have Apple move my children to a new family group, with me as the organizer,” says Kate. But Apple couldn't help. Support staff sympathized but said their hands were tied because the organizer holds the power. (Apple declined to comment for this article.)

The consequences of such cases are not abstract. When families break down, family sharing systems can allow a noncustodial or abusive partner or parent to cling to digital control of their children. Their digital lives can remain in a coercive situation, even when their physical worlds are being forcibly moved on. Kate recalls her own children faced constant aggressive questioning about their movements, social interactions, and activities based on data served up by Apple Family Sharing. “It was frightening and insanely frustrating to realize we were still not free,” she says.

The standard advice given online under such circumstances is what opened this very story: Torch the accounts and start again, losing purchases, memories, and digital identities in the process. It's simple, when presented with the alternative, but hardly a satisfactory fix. Fortunately, Kate's tale has a happier ending. Her children wore down her ex by repeating a single refrain every time he contacted them: Disband the family group. Eventually, he gave in, and Kate could set up a new family group with the original accounts. “Finally, we could all exhale,” she says. “But kids should not have to parent their own parent because tech companies are severely lacking in policies for cases like ours.”

None of these systems were designed to harm anyone. They are convenience wrapped in polish, meant for happy households. But like AirTags—another product launched with wholesome intent that later revealed the potential for darker uses—sharing systems have their own dark side. They can break when families do. While they are designed for stability, reality isn't always so neat.

Ken Munro, partner at cyber security firm Pen Test Partners, says such oversights aren't uncommon: “Ring doorbell users experienced a similar issue a few years ago, where it was impossible to remove a primary user. That meant ex-partners could connect and stalk a secondary user.” The solution, he says, was to buy a new doorbell. Still, Munro is surprised a company with Apple's user-design pedigree “didn't consider family unit breakdown, as appears to be the case.” Or, he claims, perhaps Apple did but “found adding all the possible user flows and logic for a family that separates would be a big task.”

Orla Lynskey, chair of law and technology at University College London, says stories such as Kate's serve as a warning: “It's a very graphic and troubling illustration of the inherent dual functionality of these digital tools. What was initially used as a tool for convenience and connection also serves to facilitate control and coercion. It also illustrates how legal rights and status—in this instance the custodial rights of the mother in relation to the children—can be undermined by the private governance of digital systems.” She questions whether Apple is “relying on the fact that it is not the data controller for the Family Sharing group to abdicate its responsibilities under data protection law to remove these IDs from the group.”

Kate's story isn't unique. A quick search online reveals plenty of separated and blended families caught in similar digital traps, and not just with Apple. When WIRED asked the companies involved for comment, responses were unanimously vague. A Google spokesperson said parents could contact Google's support team directly and “may be asked to provide formal documentation” to move their child to a new family group. Microsoft said it offers “escalation support for situations not addressed in our current setting, which only allows the original organizer to add or remove members from the group.”

As previously mentioned, Apple declined to comment beyond pointing to a support document about moving a child to another family group and its Family Sharing and Privacy policy, which represent its official position. But that position was never unclear. The problem lies in the gaps.

And those gaps matter. Because when a noncustodial parent can use a system to remotely stalk their kids, impose restrictions from afar, and maintain coercive control, that system needs to change. Of course, guardrails must remain. No one wants every custody dispute turning into a digital tug of war. But the current state of play is untenable.

Kate puts it bluntly: “Apple and similar companies urgently need to have better policies around family breakdowns. A court order should be enough for Apple to override a family group and move minors to another. It's all well and good to hope families stay together and happy forever, but companies must acknowledge that this isn't reality. Keeping children in the digital reach of a coercive and controlling parent is dangerous and unacceptable.”

In the era of AI-generated software, developers still need to make sure their code is clean. That's where TestSprite wants to help. 

The Seattle startup announced $6.7 million in seed funding to expand its platform that automatically tests and monitors code written by AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Windsurf.

TestSprite's autonomous agent integrates directly into development environments, running tests throughout the coding process rather than as a separate step after deployment.

“As AI writes more code, validation becomes the bottleneck,” said CEO Yunhao Jiao. “TestSprite solves that by making testing autonomous and continuous, matching AI speed.”

The platform can generate and run front- and back-end tests during development to ensure AI-written code works as expected, help AI IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) fix software based on TestSprite's integration testing reports, and continuously update and rerun test cases to monitor deployed software for ongoing reliability.

Founded last year, TestSprite says its user base grew from 6,000 to 35,000 in three months, and revenue has doubled each month since launching its 2.0 version and new Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. The company employs about 25 people.

Jiao is a former engineer at Amazon and a natural language processing researcher. He co-founded TestSprite with Rui Li, a former Google engineer.

Jiao said TestSprite doesn't compete with AI coding copilots, but complements them by focusing on continuous validation and test generation. Developers can trigger tests using simple natural-language commands, such as “Test my payment-related features,” directly inside their IDEs.

The seed round was led by Bellevue, Wash.-based Trilogy Equity Partners, with participation from Techstars, Jinqiu Capital, MiraclePlus, Hat-trick Capital, Baidu Ventures, and EdgeCase Capital Partners. Total funding to date is about $8.1 million.

After Omnilert AI detects a gun on campus, there is supposed to be a human verification step before the cops are called.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A young student was left traumatized after being ordered to the ground and handcuffed by police because an AI gun detection system erroneously called the cops on his Doritos habit.

Taki Allen ate the bag of chips while waiting to be picked up from Kenwood High School, Baltimore, last Monday night (Oct 20), reports WBAL-TV 11 News. Football practice was over, and the student was sitting with friends outside the school. However, his crunchy repast triggered the school's security camera Omnilert AI system.

20 minutes after he began chomping on the savory corn-based treat, eight police cars arrived in response to Allen's snack habit. He was quickly ordered to his knees by armed police, and his hands were cuffed behind his back. “It was a scary situation,” Allen explained to WBAL-TV.

It didn't take long before the AI error became apparent to all involved. Police were pleasingly transparent about the AI snafu, though. According to the student's interview with local news, he was shown an image explaining the sizable police response. However, the picture puzzled him. “I was just holding a Doritos bag — it was two hands and one finger out, and they said it looked like a gun,” Allen said to WBAL-TV 11 News.

Sadly, the TV news cameras didn't turn their attention to Allen's explanatory gesturing when he seemingly demonstrated the pose that got him cuffed. We also haven't seen a copy of the AI-triggering scene from the night. So, we are left with a cautionary tale without clear guidance about how to safely cradle a bag of Doritos.

Omnilert was the AI gun detection software company behind this high-profile firearms hallucination. The firm refused to give WBAL-TV 11 News any comment on the emergency response callout error. It said that it “doesn't comment on internal school procedures” (WBAL-TV quote, not Omnilert's exact words).

We checked out Omnilert's School Security Systems product pages for more information about how its product works. One of the big attractions of Omnilert is that it can piggyback on arrays of security cameras that are already installed. Its publicity material name checks school shooting tragedies like Uvalde, Sandy Hook, and Parkland, thus implying that Omnilert might have prevented them.

Omnilert's active shooter and gun detection system is purportedly a three-step process. After a positive AI gun detection, there supposedly follows a human verification step, before the automated notification and emergency response.

However, we can't point to any of those processes being in error if the police also thought the Doritos-in-hand photo was ‘gun-like' enough to send a response team of eight cars. The WBAL-TV report suggests that the officers had a copy of the AI-triggering scene with them, to show the astonished Allen, but we aren't 100% clear about the reveal timeline.

Omnilert and the school have offered to provide counseling to the students involved in the incident.

MIT Technology Review's highly subjective take on the latest buzz about AI

Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn't always easy. That's why we've created the AI Hype Index—a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry.

Just about all businesses these days seem to be pivoting to AI, even when they don't seem to know exactly why they're investing in it—or even what it really does. “Optimization,” “scaling,” and “maximizing efficiency” are convenient buzzwords bandied about to describe what AI can achieve in theory, but for most of AI companies' eager customers, the hundreds of billions of dollars they're pumping into the industry aren't adding up. And maybe they never will.

This month's news doesn't exactly cast the technology in a glowing light either. A bunch of NGOs and aid agencies are using AI models to generate images of fake suffering people to guilt their Instagram followers. AI translators are pumping out low-quality Wikipedia pages in the languages most vulnerable to going extinct. And thanks to the construction of new AI data centers, lots of neighborhoods living in their shadows are getting forced into their own sort of pivots—fighting back against the power blackouts and water shortages the data centers cause. How's that for optimization? 

We're increasingly developing bonds with chatbots. While that's safe for some, it's dangerous for others.

Some therapists are using AI during therapy sessions. They're risking their clients' trust and privacy in the process. 

Machine translators have made it easier than ever to create error-plagued Wikipedia articles in obscure languages. What happens when AI models get trained on junk pages?

India is OpenAI's second-largest market, but ChatGPT and Sora reproduce caste stereotypes that harm millions of people.

At its GTC keynote in DC on Tuesday, Nvidia unveiled its next-generation Vera Rubin Superchip, comprising two Rubin GPUs for AI and HPC as well as its custom 88-core Vera CPU. All three components will be in production this time next year, Nvidia says.

"This is the next generation Rubin," said Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, at GTC. "While we are shipping GB300, we are preparing Rubin to be in production this time next year, maybe slightly earlier. […] This is just an incredibly beautiful computer. So, this is amazing, this is 100 PetaFLOPS [of FP4 performance for AI]."

 




Indeed, Nvidia's Superchips tend to look more like a motherboard (on an extremely thick PCB) rather than a 'chip' as they carry a general-purpose custom CPU and two high-performance compute GPUs for AI and HPC workloads. The Vera Rubin Superchip is not an exception, and the board carries Nvidia's next-generation 88-core Vera CPU surrounded by SOCAMM2 memory modules carrying LPDDR memory and two Rubin GPUs covered with two large rectangular aluminum heat spreaders.

Markings on the Rubin GPU say that they were packaged in Taiwan on the 38th week of 2025, which is late September, something that proves that the company has been playing with the new processor for some time now. The size of the heatspreader is about the same size as the heatspreader of Blackwell processors, so we cannot figure out the exact size of GPU packaging or die sizes of compute chiplets. Meanwhile, the Vera CPU does not seem to be monolithic as it has visible internal seams, implying that we are dealing with a multi-chiplet design.

 




A picture of the board that Nvidia demonstrated once again reveals that each Rubin GPU is comprised of two compute chiplets, eight HBM4 memory stacks, and one or two I/O chiplets. Interestingly, but this time around, Nvidia demonstrated the Vera CPU with a very distinct I/O chiplet located next to it. Also, the image shows green features coming from the I/O pads of the CPU die, the purpose of which is unknown. Perhaps, some of Vera's I/O capabilities are enabled by external chiplets that are located beneath the CPU itself. Of course, we are speculating, but there is definitely an intrigue with the Vera processor.

Interestingly, the Vera Rubin Superchip board no longer has industry-standard slots for cabled connectors. Instead, there are two NVLink backplane connectors on top to connect GPUs to the NVLink switch, enabling scale-up scalability within a rack and three connectors on the bottom edge for power, PCIe, CXL, and so on.

In general, Nvidia's Vera Rubin Superchip board looks quite baked, so expect the unit to ship sometime in late 2026 and get deployed by early 2027.

Instead of using text tokens, the Chinese AI company is packing information into images.

An AI model released by the Chinese AI company DeepSeek uses new techniques that could significantly improve AI's ability to “remember.”

Released last week, the optical character recognition (OCR) model works by extracting text from an image and turning it into machine-readable words. This is the same technology that powers scanner apps, translation of text in photos, and many accessibility tools. 

OCR is already a mature field with numerous high-performing systems, and according to the paper and some early reviews, DeepSeek's new model performs on par with top models on key benchmarks.

But researchers say the model's main innovation lies in how it processes information—specifically, how it stores and retrieves memories. Improving how AI models “remember” information could reduce the computing power they need to run, thus mitigating AI's large (and growing) carbon footprint. 

Currently, most large language models break text down into thousands of tiny units called tokens. This turns the text into representations that models can understand. However, these tokens quickly become expensive to store and compute with as conversations with end users grow longer. When a user chats with an AI for lengthy periods, this challenge can cause the AI to forget things it's been told and get information muddled, a problem some call “context rot.”

The new methods developed by DeepSeek (and published in its latest paper) could help to overcome this issue. Instead of storing words as tokens, its system packs written information into image form, almost as if it's taking a picture of pages from a book. This allows the model to retain nearly the same information while using far fewer tokens, the researchers found. 

Essentially, the OCR model is a test bed for these new methods that permit more information to be packed into AI models more efficiently. 

Besides using visual tokens instead of just text tokens, the model is built on a type of tiered compression that is not unlike how human memories fade: Older or less critical content is stored in a slightly more blurry form in order to save space. Despite that, the paper's authors argue, this compressed content can still remain accessible in the background while maintaining a high level of system efficiency.

Text tokens have long been the default building block in AI systems. Using visual tokens instead is unconventional, and as a result, DeepSeek's model is quickly capturing researchers' attention. Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI chief and a founding member of OpenAI, praised the paper on X, saying that images may ultimately be better than text as inputs for LLMs. Text tokens might be “wasteful and just terrible at the input,” he wrote. 

Manling Li, an assistant professor of computer science at Northwestern University, says the paper offers a new framework for addressing the existing challenges in AI memory. “While the idea of using image-based tokens for context storage isn't entirely new, this is the first study I've seen that takes it this far and shows it might actually work,” Li says.

The method could open up new possibilities in AI research and applications, especially in creating more useful AI agents, says Zihan Wang, a PhD candidate at Northwestern University. He believes that since conversations with AI are continuous, this approach could help models remember more and assist users more effectively.

The technique can also be used to produce more training data for AI models. Model developers are currently grappling with a severe shortage of quality text to train systems on. But the DeepSeek paper says that the company's OCR system can generate over 200,000 pages of training data a day on a single GPU.

The model and paper, however, are only an early exploration of using image tokens rather than text tokens for AI memorization. Li says she hopes to see visual tokens applied not just to memory storage but also to reasoning. Future work, she says, should explore how to make AI's memory fade in a more dynamic way, akin to how we can recall a life-changing moment from years ago but forget what we ate for lunch last week. Currently, even with DeepSeek's methods, AI tends to forget and remember in a very linear way—recalling whatever was most recent, but not necessarily what was most important, she says. 

Despite its attempts to keep a low profile, DeepSeek, based in Hangzhou, China, has built a reputation for pushing the frontier in AI research. The company shocked the industry at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek-R1, an open-source reasoning model that rivaled leading Western systems in performance despite using far fewer computing resources.  

We're increasingly developing bonds with chatbots. While that's safe for some, it's dangerous for others.

                Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes
      

It's been widely speculated that Elon Musk's right-wing political activities have had a deeply depressive effect on his company's bottom line. In the midst of his turn to the right (a journey that has included supporting Donald Trump's campaign for president and then working for Trump as part of his administration's DOGE initiative), his crown jewel, Tesla, has suffered from an unfortunate slump in sales numbers. Now, economic researchers believe they've found concrete proof that Musk's political activity over the years has led to a loss of interest in his company.

A new study published this week by researchers with Yale University and the National Bureau of Economic Research claims to have identified a “causal effect of Musk's partisan activities on Tesla sales.” You might think that sort of thing would be quite difficult to track, but, complex math aside, the researchers seem to have come up with a fairly simple formula for assessing the dissolution of support for Musk's brand. They did it by looking at support for Tesla as a brand in predominantly Democratic counties before and after October of 2022. What happened in October of 2022? You might recall that Musk bought a little website called Twitter and began doing all sorts of creative things to it.

Looking back, the Twitter purchase really does seem like the critical demarcation point in Elon's political transformation. It was after said purchase that he began his journey from generally “liberal presenting” EV seller to the ever more unhinged MAGA troll that he became. Well, according to this study, Musk may have MAGA-ed his way out of over a million car sales, in what researchers are calling the “Musk partisan effect.” The study states:

Without the Musk partisan effect, Tesla sales between October 2022 and April 2025 would have been 67-83% higher, equivalent to 1-1.26 million more vehicles. Musk's partisan activities also increased the sales of other automakers' electric and hybrid vehicles 17-22% because of substitution, and undermined California's progress in meeting its zero-emissions vehicle target.

To identify the political orientation of particular counties, the researchers looked at local voting data. Then, to track sales, they looked at vehicle registration data in those counties between 2018 and 2025. Researchers found that, up until 2022, Tesla registration trends were headed upwards. Then, while overall EV sales continued to climb, Tesla sales saw their growth cut short:

Until mid-2022, new Tesla registrations in the United States were generally increasing and following trends similar to hybrids and other EVs…After mid-2022, however, Tesla sales leveled off, while sales of hybrids, other EVs, and plug-in hybrids continued an upward trend.

While conservative counties have seen a slow increase in Tesla registrations, registrations in liberal counties saw an abrupt shift in trajectory, the study says:

The more Republican-leaning counties show a slow but increasing trend in Tesla sales over the entire sample period, whereas the more Democratic-leaning counties have a more steeply increasing trend until mid to late 2022, when Tesla sales level off and even begin to drop in the highest quintile.

Researchers do acknowledge that there are other potential factors that may have impacted the company's collapsing sales. Those include a lack of “new Tesla models, increased EV competition from legacy automakers and new entrants, and a reliance on a flow of new EV customers rather than satisfying pent-up demand from early EV adopters,” the study says. It's also worth noting that Tesla's sales collapse hasn't been entirely linear (in October, the company saw a surprise reversal, which is believed to have been caused by the expiration of the federal EV credit). However, Tesla's problems are expected to continue, and the researchers believe that a very large factor in the derailment of “the growth trajectory of Tesla” is its CEO.

Other studies have looked at the impact of Musk's political activities on support for his brand and EVs in general, so this is certainly not the first study to draw a correlation between the two. When Gizmodo reached out to xAI for comment, it sent us back a simple message that read: “Legacy Media Lies.” The company did not ultimately comment on the research or its findings. Gizmodo also reached out to Tesla for comment (although the company notably dissolved its PR department years ago).

Sound Blaster makes a modular comeback.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Creative Technology is bringing back its iconic Sound Blaster brand with the launch of a new modular audio hub. The Re:Imagine is designed for users who manage multiple audio devices, offering quick source switching and flexible configuration within a single setup. Currently listed on Kickstarter, the Re:Imagine is claimed to be an open, programmable platform that combines the functionality of a sound card and a stream deck, featuring broad audio connectivity and customizable controls.

The hub is powered by an octa-core ARM CPU with a dedicated NPU with up to 6 TOPS of performance, 8GB of LPDDR4 memory, 16GB of onboard EMMC flash storage and a microSD card slot for adding more storage. It features a hi-resolution 32-bit/384 KHz DAC and amp which can power headphones up to 300Ω as well as large desktop speakers. It also offers wide compatibility with devices including PCs, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, gaming consoles, headphones, speakers, mics, and music instruments. The company notes that it can be used as a standalone device as it comes with Linux or can be connected to your PC or laptop using USB to double as a control hub for activating macros on your computer. There's even support for Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 meaning that it can connect to wireless audio devices.

The design is quite interesting as it seems to be inspired by Teenage Engineering, who themselves are inspired by Braun. The company plans to launch two base hubs that differentiate in terms of layout where each unit comes with a set of included modules including a smart screen, a set of four buttons, a knob, and dual sliders. Initially the Horizon Base Unit will be offered featuring a wide layout including a total of five slots where two are used by the Smart Screen and three are open for other modules. The Vertex Base Unit on the other hand offers a taller layout with a total of six slots, although this variant will only be available once the initial Kickstarter campaign funding goal has been met.

As mentioned earlier, users have complete control over its hardware with deep customization options available via the provided SDK and sample source code. This allows users to build their own apps and control connected devices with root-level access. Creative will also allow users to share their creations and benefit from tools and features developed by other users.

Additionally the Re:Imagine includes some built-in apps including a DOS emulator for retro PC gaming, AI-powered versions of Sound Blaster Parrot and Dr. Sbaitso, an AI DJ that creates music based on user-selected themes, and tools for one-tap audio recording and visualizations.

Currently the most affordable pledge tier for the Sound Blaster Re:Imagine starts at $329 where backers receive the core modular audio hub unit, and the above-mentioned four modules. It is important to note that this is a pre-order estimate and shipments are expected to begin in June 2026. If you are looking for similar modular control hubs, make sure to look at the Cooler Master MasterHub and various options from Elgato.

Amazon will lay off 2,303 corporate employees in Washington state, primarily in its Seattle and Bellevue offices, according to a filing with the state Employment Security Department that provides the first geographic breakdown of the company's 14,000 global job cuts.

A detailed list included with the state filing shows a wide array of impacted roles, including software engineers, program managers, product managers, and designers, as well as a significant number of recruiters and human resources staff. 

Senior and principal-level roles are among those being cut, aligning with a company-wide push to use the cutbacks to help reduce bureaucracy and operate more efficiently.

Amazon announced the cuts Tuesday morning, part of a larger push by CEO Andy Jassy to streamline the company. Jassy had previously told Amazon employees in June that efficiency gains from AI would likely lead to a smaller corporate workforce over time.

In a memo from HR chief Beth Galetti, the company signaled that further cutbacks will continue into 2026. Reuters reported Monday that the number of layoffs could ultimately total as many as 30,000 people, which is still possible as the layoffs continue into next year.

A new study by the Hebrew University has developed a rapid imaging method that reveals how drugs move through the skin, in just ten minutes. By combining mass spectrometry imaging with an automated analysis tool, the technique maps medication distribution across skin layers without dyes or labels. Tested on antifungal treatments, it offers a faster, more precise way to design safer and more effective topical and transdermal therapies.

Scientists at the Hebrew University's School of Pharmacy have unveiled a cutting-edge approach that could transform how we test and design topical medications, from antifungal creams to anti-aging serums. The study, led by Dr. Katy Margulis, introduces a rapid imaging technique that allows researchers to visualize, within minutes, how drugs move through and settle in the skin's layers.

Delivering drugs through the skin requires remarkable precision. Some treatments must reach deep into the dermis to enter the bloodstream, while others, like antifungal creams or acne treatments, need to remain close to the surface, targeting a specific sublayer of the epidermis. Until now, measuring exactly how far a compound travels beneath the skin was a tedious process, often taking days and relying on indirect fluorescent methods.

Dr. Margulis and her team developed a new mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) method combined with an automated computational tool that can analyze drug distribution within a skin sample in under ten minutes. The tool computationally segments the tissue into distinct layers and maps where the active ingredient lands, providing a clear visual of drug permeation depth without any need for chemical labeling.

This approach gives us a clear, label-free snapshot of where a drug actually goes once applied to the skin. It allows researchers and developers to optimize delivery systems quickly and with much greater accuracy."

Dr. Katy Margulis, Hebrew University

To test the method, the team examined three nanoscale drug delivery systems for terbinafine, a common antifungal medication, each designed to reach a different depth within the skin. Using their new imaging workflow, they compared how effectively each system delivered terbinafine through human and animal skin and discovered striking differences between the systems in depth and extent of drug permeation as well as the drug's skin distribution patterns. This can enable precise tailoring of the delivery system to both the drug and the skin condition.

Beyond antifungal therapy, the implications are far-reaching. The new method could improve the safety and precision of corticosteroids, retinoids, and other topical drugs, as well as enhance cosmetic and transdermal treatments tailored to specific skin conditions.

At the heart of the breakthrough is speed. Traditional methods for assessing drug permeation could take days, requiring labor-intensive image analysis. The automated clustering tool developed by the researchers reduces that process to minutes, enabling rapid testing of multiple formulations and facilitating time-sensitive studies.

The innovation also supports kinetic research, allowing scientists to track how fast and how deep a drug moves through the skin. "We can now monitor drug absorption in near real time," says Dr. Margulis. "This opens the door to time-sensitive treatments and more precise dosing."

The study not only enhances pharmaceutical development but also advances the broader goal of precision medicine, which aims at tailoring treatments based on individual biology. By making it possible to map drug distribution so rapidly and accurately, the new method could eventually support personalized skincare or medical creams adjusted for a patient's specific skin type or condition.

"This tool allows for smarter, safer, and more efficient formulation testing," says Margulis. "Ultimately, it helps bring better products to patients faster."

Daily interactions with friends, even through something as simple as a text message, may reduce momentary loneliness for caregivers tending to a family member with dementia.

Providing care for a loved one with dementia can be a difficult burden to bear, and caregivers can be especially vulnerable to loneliness. But social interactions, no matter how small, with friends and other family members can lower feelings of loneliness.

Crystal Ng, a research fellow at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, and colleagues studied 223 dementia caregivers, who reported their social interactions and loneliness every three hours over five days-showing that when caregivers interacted with friends, they also reported lower levels of loneliness.

The study, which appears in the Journal of Gerontology, was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging.

We found that caregivers reported having interactions with friends in more than 20% of their waking survey prompts. And these interactions, particularly positive ones, even with not-so-close friends, are related to lower momentary loneliness in daily life."

Crystal Ng, research fellow, University of Michigan Institute for Social Research

According to Ng, the effect was particularly pronounced among caregivers with particularly difficult care responsibilities, or "high-burden" caregivers.

"Interacting with friends appears to be particularly important for high-burden caregivers, and that could be the case because higher-burden caregivers are more at risk of being socially isolated and feeling lonely," she said.

Previous studies have asked caregivers to rate their loneliness over a period in the past, perhaps a week or a month, but, according to Ng, a more in-the-moment approach to data collection provides a more dynamic and accurate picture.

"This study captured the dynamic fluctuations of loneliness," she said. "We are not treating loneliness as a personality trait, but as something that fluctuates throughout the day.

"Sending a text to a friend or making the time to get in touch with them can make caregivers feel less lonely and foster a sense of connection amid the burden of dementia. Interventions that encourage caregivers to schedule social interactions with friends in daily life can give them a much-needed emotional lift."

New research from the University of Birmingham shows that eating flavanol-rich foods-like tea, berries, apples, and cocoa-can protect vascular health in men from the harmful effects of prolonged sitting.

Sedentary behavior is prevalent in modern societies; it is estimated that young adults sit for approximately six hours a day, but sitting for long periods induces declines in vascular function.

Previous studies have shown that a 1% reduction in vascular function, as measured by brachial Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), which measures the elasticity of the arteries, leads to a 13% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, such as heart disease, strokes, and heart attacks.

The researchers wanted to explore if there was a way that diet, particularly foods that are high in flavanols, could help protect against the risk to our vascular system associated with periods of uninterrupted sitting.

Flavanols are a type of polyphenol compound that occur naturally in some fruits, tea, and nuts, and cocoa beans. They have been shown to have cardiovascular health benefits, such as protecting the vascular system during periods of mental stress.

The research has been published today (29 Oct) in the Journal of Physiology.

Dr. Catarina Rendeiro, Assistant Professor in Nutritional Sciences at the University of Birmingham, and leading author, said: "Whether we are sitting at desks, behind the wheel of a car, on a train, or on the sofa reading a book or watching TV, we all spend a lot of time seated. Even though we are not moving our bodies, we are still putting them under stress. Finding ways to mitigate the impact that sitting for uninterrupted periods has on our vascular system could help us cut the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases."

Deaths of cardiovascular disease are on the rise; the British Heart Foundation reports that deaths of working-aged adults in the UK increased by 18% to 21,975 in 2023, compared to 2019. In addition, recent studies have found that cardiovascular diseases cost the UK an estimated £29 billion.

The researchers tested whether consuming flavanols just before two hours of sitting could preserve blood vessel function in the arms and legs. Forty young healthy men, 20 who had higher levels of fitness and 20 who had a lower level of fitness, consumed either a high-flavanol (695 mg of total flavanols per beverage) or low-flavanol cocoa drink (5.6 mg of total flavanols per beverage), before completing a two-hour sitting trial.

The study was not carried out with women, as changes in oestrogen levels during the menstrual cycle are suspected to affect the impact of flavanols on vascular health during sitting. This should be the focus of another future trial.

The team took a range of vascular measures before and after sitting, including:

Both the lower and higher fitness groups who had the low-flavanol cocoa before sitting, experienced FMD declines in the arteries in their arms and legs. This suggests that higher levels of fitness do not provide protection from sitting. It also significantly increased diastolic blood pressure, decreased shear rate and blood flow in both arteries, and resulted in declines in muscle oxygenation in both fitness groups.

However, the research found that those groups who consumed the high-flavanol cocoa drink, again in both fitness groups, did not experience FMD declines in either of the arteries in their arms or legs. This is the first time flavanols have been shown to be effective at preventing sitting-induced vascular dysfunction, in young healthy men.

Dr. Sam Lucas, Professor of Cerebrovascular, Exercise & Environmental Physiology at the University of Birmingham and co-author of the study, said: "Our experiment indicates that higher fitness levels do not prevent the temporary impairment of vascular function induced by sitting when only drinking low-flavanol cocoa. Importantly, after the high-flavanol drink, both fitter and less-fit participants kept their FMD the same as it was before sitting for two hours."

The study is also the first to demonstrate that baseline levels of cardiorespiratory fitness do not alter the vascular effects of flavanol intake. This means that individuals can benefit from flavanol intake regardless of their levels of physical fitness.

It is actually quite easy to add high flavanol foods to your diet. There are cocoa products available in supermarkets and health stores which are processed through methods that preserve flavanol levels. If cocoa isn't your thing, fruits like apples, plums and berries, nuts, and black and green tea are all common kitchen staples and are readily available."

Alessio Daniele, PhD student, University of Birmingham

Dr. Catarina Rendeiro concluded: "Our research shows that consuming high-flavanol foods and drinks during periods spent sitting down is a good way to reduce some of the impact of inactivity on the vascular system.

"Given how common sedentary lifestyles have become and the increased risk this can have to vascular health, using flavanol-rich food and drink, especially in combination with breaking up periods of inactivity by going for a short walk or standing up, could be a good way to enhance long-term health, no matter the individual's fitness level."

With populations aging rapidly worldwide, heart failure has become one of the most pressing medical and social challenges. Older patients face not only a high mortality risk but also losses in muscle strength, mobility, and independence. Clinicians frequently see people who, despite optimal cardiac care, still struggle with frailty and declining physical performance. Until now, different groups have proposed their own criteria: the AWGS criteria developed mainly by Asian experts, the EWGSOP criteria from Europe, and the SDOC statement from the United States. As a result, three different definitions and diagnostic methods have coexisted, creating a lack of consistency worldwide. Recognizing the need for a global standard, leading experts from these groups came together to form the Global Leadership Initiative on Sarcopenia (GLIS). The GLIS model introduced a new diagnostic approach based on muscle strength, muscle mass, and muscle-specific strength, while reclassifying physical performance tests such as the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) not as diagnostic criteria but as outcomes of sarcopenia. However, it had remained unclear whether this new GLIS model could reliably predict prognosis in older patients with heart failure, or whether it truly reflects declines in physical performance.

Researchers from Juntendo University, Japan, led by Dr. Taisuke Nakade, together with Dr. Daichi Maeda, Dr. Yuya Matsue, Dr. Tohru Minamino, and colleagues from multiple hospitals and universities across Japan, have offered a solution to this puzzle. Their study, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology on October 4, 2025, provides the first worldwide validation of the new GLIS model in older patients with heart failure.

"Our inspiration was to test whether this new model truly reflects what clinicians observe at the bedside-namely, functional decline and poor prognosis in older patients with heart failure-and to generate evidence that could influence both practice and international guidelines," Dr. Nakade explains.

The GLIS model focuses on three core measures-muscle mass, grip strength, and muscle-specific strength-while treating walking speed and other functional tests as outcomes, thus separating diagnosis from performance. The study analyzed 891 patients aged 65 or older from the FRAGILE-HF registry, classifying them as non-sarcopenic, possible sarcopenic, or sarcopenic. Physical performance was assessed using walking speed, the five-chair stand test, the SPPB, and the six-minute walk test. Patients with sarcopenia or possible sarcopenia showed significantly worse performance across all measures.

Importantly, the GLIS model accurately identified patients with decreased physical performance. Over two years, mortality increased stepwise from non-sarcopenic to possible sarcopenic to sarcopenic patients. Even after adjusting for other risk factors, GLIS-defined sarcopenia was independently associated with a 3.4-fold higher risk of death. Compared to the conventional AWGS2019 criteria, GLIS provided superior risk reclassification, making it a more powerful tool for clinical decision-making.

The implications are clear. By diagnosing sarcopenia more accurately, clinicians can better identify those at high risk of physical decline and poor outcomes, even before symptoms become severe. The model also strengthens treatment planning, discharge decisions, and long-term care strategies. At a broader level, validating GLIS supports international standardization of sarcopenia diagnosis, promoting equitable care and paving the way for new diagnostic tools, screening devices, and digital health applications.

As Dr. Nakade emphasizes, "This study showed that the newly proposed international GLIS model for sarcopenia effectively reflects both impaired physical performance and poor prognosis in older patients with heart failure."

In short, the GLIS model gives doctors a practical, evidence-based approach to detect sarcopenia early, improve patient outcomes, and address one of the most urgent challenges in aging societies.

Physician Lauren Hughes was heading to see patients at a clinic about 20 miles from her Denver home in February when another driver T-boned her Subaru, totaling it. She was taken by ambulance to the closest hospital, Platte Valley Hospital.

A shaken Hughes was examined in the emergency room, where she was diagnosed with bruising, a deep cut on her knee, and a broken ankle. Physicians recommended immediate surgical repair, she said.

"They said: 'You have this fracture and a big gaping wound in your knee. We need to take you to the OR to wash it out and make sure there's no infection,'" she said. "As a clinician, I thought, 'Yes.'"

She was taken to the operating room in the early evening, then admitted to the hospital overnight.

A friend took her home the next day.

Then the bills came.

Surgeons cleaned the cut on her right knee, which had hit her car's dashboard, and realigned a broken bone in her right ankle, stabilizing it with metal screws. Surgery is typically recommended when a broken bone is deemed unlikely to heal properly with only a cast.

$63,976.35, charged by the hospital — which was not in-network with the insurance plan she got through her job — for the surgery and overnight stay.

Hughes' insurer, Anthem, fully covered the nearly $2,400 ambulance ride and some smaller radiology charges from the ER but denied the surgery and overnight stay charges from the out-of-network hospital.

"Sixty-three thousand dollars for a broken ankle and a cut to the knee, with no head injury or internal damage," Hughes said. "Just to stay there overnight. It's crazy."

Insurers have broad power to determine whether care is medically necessary — that is, what is needed for treatment, diagnosis, or relief. And that decision affects whether and how much they will pay for it.

Four days after her surgery, Anthem notified Hughes that after consulting clinical guidelines for her type of ankle repair, its reviewer determined it was not medically necessary for her to be fully admitted for an inpatient hospital stay.

If she had needed additional surgery or had other problems, such as vomiting or a fever, an inpatient stay might have been warranted, according to the letter. "The information we have does not show you have these or other severe problems," it said.

To Hughes, the notion that she should have left the hospital was "ludicrous." Her car was in a junkyard, she had no family nearby, and she was taking opioid painkillers for the first time.

When she asked for further details about medical necessity determinations, Hughes was directed deep inside her policy's benefit booklet, which outlines that, for a hospital stay, documentation must show "safe and adequate care could not be obtained as an outpatient."

It turns out the surgery charges were denied because of an insurance contract quirk. Under Anthem's agreement with the hospital, all claims for services before and after a patient is admitted are approved or denied together, said Anthem spokesperson Emily Snooks.

A hospital stay is not generally required after ankle surgery, and the insurer found Hughes did not need the kind of "comprehensive, complex medical care" that would necessitate hospitalization, Snooks wrote in an email to KFF Health News.

"Anthem has consistently agreed that Ms. Hughes' ankle surgery was medically necessary," Snooks wrote. "However, because the ankle surgery was bundled with the inpatient admission, the entire claim was denied."

Facing bills from an out-of-network hospital where she was taken by emergency responders, though, Hughes did not understand why she wasn't shielded by the No Surprises Act, which took effect in 2022. The federal law requires insurers to cover out-of-network providers as though they are in-network when patients receive emergency care, among other protections.

"If they had determined it was medically necessary, then they would have to apply the No Surprises Act cost," said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at Brookings. "But the No Surprises Act is not going to override the normal medical necessity determination."

There was one more oddity in her case. During one of many calls Hughes made trying to sort out her bill, an Anthem representative told her that things might have been different had the hospital billed for her hospitalization as an overnight "observation" stay.

Generally, that's when patients are kept at a facility so staff can determine whether they need to be admitted. Rather than being tied to the stay's duration, the designation mainly reflects the intensity of care. A patient with fewer needs is more likely to be billed for an observation stay.

Insurers pay hospitals less for an observation stay than admission, Fiedler said.

That distinction is a big issue for patients on Medicare. Most often, the government health program will not pay for any care needed in a nursing home if the patient was not first formally admitted to a hospital for at least three days.

"It's a classic battle between providers and insurers as to what bucket a claim falls in," Fiedler said.

As a physician and a director of a health policy center at the University of Colorado, Hughes is a savvier-than-usual policyholder. Yet even she was frustrated during the months spent going back and forth with her insurer and the hospital — and worried when it looked like her account would be sent to a collection agency.

In addition to appealing the denied claims, she sought the help of her employer's human resources department, which contacted Anthem. She also reached out to KFF Health News, which contacted Anthem and the Platte Valley Hospital.

In late September, Hughes received calls from a hospital official, who told her they had "downgraded the level of care" the hospital billed her insurance for and resubmitted the claim to Anthem.

In a written statement to KFF Health News, Platte Valley Hospital spokesperson Sara Quale said that the facility "deeply regrets any anxiety this situation has caused her." The hospital had "prematurely" and erroneously sent Hughes a bill before working out the balance with Anthem, she wrote.

"After a careful review of Ms. Hughes' situation," Quale continued, "we have now stopped all billing to her. Furthermore, we have informed Ms. Hughes that if her insurance company ultimately assigns the remaining balance to her, she will not be billed for it."

Anthem spokesperson Stephanie DuBois said in an email that Platte Valley resubmitted Hughes' bill to the insurer on Oct. 3, this time for "outpatient care services."

An explanation of benefits that was sent to Hughes shows the hospital rebilled for around $61,000 — about $40,000 of which was knocked off the total by an Anthem discount. The insurer paid the hospital nearly $21,000.

In the end, Hughes owed only a $250 copayment.

There are places where patients receiving emergency care at an out-of-network hospital may fall through the cracks of federal billing protections, in particular during a phase that may be nearly indistinguishable to the patient, known as "post-stabilization."

Generally, that occurs when the medical provider determines the patient is stable enough to travel to an in-network facility using nonmedical transport, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor emeritus at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.

If the patient prefers to stay put for further treatment, the out-of-network provider must then ask the patient to sign a consent form, agreeing to waive billing protections and continue treatment at out-of-network rates, he said.

"It's very important that if they give you some kind of letter to sign that you read that letter very carefully, because that letter might give them your permission to get some big bills," Hoadley said.

If possible, patients should contact their insurer, in addition to asking the hospital's billing department: Are you being fully admitted, or kept under observation status, and why? Has your care been determined to be medically necessary? Keep in mind that medical necessity determinations play a key role in whether coverage is approved or denied, even after services are provided.

That said, Hughes did not recall being told she was stable enough to leave with nonmedical transportation, nor being asked to sign a consent form.

Her advice is to quickly and aggressively question insurance denials once they are received, including by asking for your case to be escalated to the insurer's and hospital's leadership. She said expecting patients to navigate complicated billing questions while in the hospital after a serious injury isn't realistic.

"I was calling family," Hughes said, "alerting my work colleagues about what happened, processing the extent of my injuries and what needed to be done clinically, arranging care for my pet, getting labs and imaging done — coming to grips with what just happened."

A Spanish review uncovers how hydroxytyrosol, the powerhouse molecule in olives, activates key brain-protective pathways, paving the way for next-generation foods that support mental and vascular health.

Study: Novel Ingredients: Hydroxytyrosol as a Neuroprotective Agent; What Is New on the Horizon? Image credit: Anna_Pustynnikova/Shutterstock.com

Lorena Martínez-Zamora at Miguel Hernández University, Spain, recently published a review article in the journal Foods. In it, she discussed the emerging evidence on the efficacy and utility of a phenolic compound derived from olives as a neuroprotective agent.

Hydroxytyrosol (HXT) is one of the most important phenolic compounds found in olives. This compound has gained significant attention during the past 20 years because of its health-promoting properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, cardio-protective, neuro-protective, cognition-enhancing, and immune-modulatory properties.

Several requests have been made to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to consider HXT as an antioxidant food additive and use it to prepare functional foods. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Spanish Agency for Consumer Affairs, Food Safety, and Nutrition (AESAN) have considered HXT safe for proposed uses and levels. The FDA regards it as safe up to about 5 mg per serving and roughly 51 mg per person per day.

Like other food items, HXT is absorbed in the intestine, metabolized in the liver, and circulates in the blood. Existing evidence suggests that HXT and its metabolites can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain.

In preclinical and mechanistic studies, the compound has been suggested to alter neuroimmune activities, activate antioxidant pathways, regulate the memory-cognition-mood axis, and interact with dopaminergic metabolism in some brain regions, including the hippocampus and cortex.

HXT can protect the neurovascular system in many ways. Studies have found that the compound reduces vascular oxidative stress, supports endothelial functions and blood-brain barrier integrity and permeability, preserves nitric oxide bioavailability, reduces neuroinflammation, and improves neural connectivity and cognition.

Robust activation of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway across endothelial and neural tissues is considered a major mediator of HXT's neuroprotective function. Mechanistic evidence suggests that HXT triggers nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (a transcription factor involved in antioxidant system regulation) and upregulates Nrf2 targets in the brain, improving mitochondrial antioxidant system and reducing oxidative protein and DNA damage.

Regarding neuroimmune pathways, existing evidence suggests that HXT reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines in microglial cells. Microglial cells are resident immune cells of the brain that act as macrophages to protect the brain from pathogens.

HXT has also been found to suppress NF-κB/MAPK signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the brain, a central pathogenic axis produced during Parkinson's disease. These effects have been demonstrated mainly in cell and animal models, but they provide a coherent mechanistic basis for neuroprotection. Mechanistic evidence suggests that HXT consistently suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling across innate-immune cascades that drive neuroinflammation.

The chemical structure of HXT is identical to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (DOPET), a dopamine metabolite. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and hormone that plays essential roles in movement, motivation, reward, emotion, and memory.

Both DOPET and HXT exhibit dual relevance to dopamine homeostasis through antioxidant activity that limits dopamine oxidative stress and feedback modulation of catecholamine synthesis.

In stress- and toxin-based models, HXT has been found to improve motivation-related behaviors by altering mesolimbic functions. In chronic stress models, HXT has been found to increase sucrose preference, reduce immobility, augment antioxidant pathways, reduce inflammation, and improve synaptic plasticity within reward circuitry. These findings remain preclinical but suggest dopaminergic and mood-related potential worth exploring in humans.

Several randomized controlled trials and pilot studies have reported that increasing exposure to pure HXT, HXT-rich olive oils, or HXT-containing foods is associated with improved cerebral blood circulation, blood-brain barrier stability, and neuroimmune modulation.

Recent animal studies have suggested that HXT can significantly mitigate cognitive decline by modulating neurotrophic and inflammatory factors. However, these findings must be translated into humans for clinical implications. 

Recent human studies have highlighted that chronic intake of approximately 7–15 milligrams of HXT per day effectively improves vascular oxidative balance, low-grade inflammation, and endothelial function. Similarly, a single-dose intake of approximately 30-60 milligrams of HXT has shown efficacy in short-term improvement of vascular and oxidative responses.

Regarding cognitive benefits, recent evidence suggests that desert olive tree pearls rich in HXT and oleuropein can improve composite memory and psychomotor speed after 8 and 12 weeks of intake. This is consistent with enhanced attention–memory coupling and motor–cognitive integration in old adults.

HXT supplementation has been found to significantly improve health-related quality of life in children with mitochondrial disease. The children have also exhibited health benefits consistent with HXT's mitochondria-supporting Nrf2-linked mechanisms relevant to neuroimmune and synaptic homeostasis.

While these human data are promising, the evidence remains preliminary, and harmonized pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) studies are required to confirm clinical efficacy and establish optimal dosing strategies.

Olive leaves, which contain high levels of oleuropein and HXT, are the most suitable ingredients for developing HXT-enriched ready-to-eat foods. However, both compounds impart a distinct bitter profile that can limit the acceptability of HXT-enriched foods. Some strategies can be implemented to reduce this bitterness, including cyclodextrin complexation, microencapsulation, microemulsions, and the addition of suitable flavoring agents.    

Some complementary routes have been developed to translate HXT into real foods. These include transfer from extra virgin olive oil by immersion, enzymatic modification of edible oils, valorization of olive by-products in beverages and baked goods, and incorporation into active packaging.

Further research is needed to standardize the HXT dose and improve its bioavailability, sensory properties, and industrial stability. According to Martínez-Zamora, future work should also integrate exposure–response analytics, matrix-specific testing, and biomarker tracking to advance HXT toward claim-ready nutrition for brain health.

Jodi Helmer

 October 29, 2025  

When Kristopher Short accepted his first job as a nurse practitioner (NP), he expected a pay bump from his years working as a registered nurse (RN). On paper, the salary looked solid, but once Short broke it down hourly, the reality stung: his NP paycheck wasn't that much higher than what he earned as a staff nurse.

“The salary at my first job was far below what I was expecting,” Short told Medscape Medical News. “Based on my wage from being a nurse practitioner vs being a bedside nurse, there was not that much of a disparity in pay when you broke it down by hour. If you're wanting to become an NP, it is not for money.”

The latest data from AMN Healthcare shows that the average salary for NPs was $180,000 in 2024/2025 — a 9.5% increase from the previous year — but there are multiple factors that contribute to the number of zeros in an offer letter, which can lead to surprises when new NPs start negotiating their first job offers.

“I did some research [on average NP salaries], but it was limited because my natural inclination was that an NP was going to make more [than a bedside nurse] because that seems like a logical progression,” Short said. “From the respect of benefits and salary, I wish I would have talked to more nurse practitioners.”

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Medscape RN/LPN Compensation Report 2025 found that:

A trend toward team-based health care models has led to skyrocketing demand for NPs. In fact, it's one of the fastest-growing professions, and the number of job openings is expected to increase 35% between 2024 and 2034.

“[Our latest data showed] 68% of the nurse practitioner searches were in primary care and 32% were specialty searches,” Alex Herbison, vice president at AMN Healthcare, said. “If we go back 5 years, we were probably closer to 90% primary care [searches], so we've really started to see a shift in how the market is using nurse practitioners.”

Employment arrangements also affect NP salaries. One report found that NPs who are paid hourly earn $6000 more annually than their salaried counterparts because there are more opportunities for hourly workers to take on additional shifts.

As an RN, Ayo Adebiyi boosted her wages by working night shifts in the emergency room, and it was difficult to match that when she was negotiating her starting salary as a family NP in Merced, California.

“I remember sending my pay slip to the recruiter…and saying, ‘I just want to match what I'm making [as an RN],'” she recalls.

NP salaries are dependent on numerous factors, from geographic location and practice setting to specialization; practice authority also has an impact. In the 28 states and territories where NPs have full practice authority, wages are higher, according to Herbison.

Location matters, too. NPs working in Washington, Oregon, and California earn mean salaries of $170,000, whereas mean salaries for NPs in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky are $143,000.

Adebiyi knows that her salary is lower than that of her counterparts in San Francisco and Los Angeles, but the cost of living in Central California is much lower, too. Short acknowledges that he'd need a higher wage to practice in the Northwest, but his wages cover the basics in the Midwest.

“Looking back, I should have paid more attention to cost of living,” he said. “On its face, the numbers looked good, but what that paycheck really gets you is different depending on where you live.”

Just as family doctors earn lower salaries than psychiatrists, cardiologists, or surgeons, NPs working in primary care have lower salaries than those who specialize. 

Herbison calls neurosurgery, orthopedics, dermatology, gastroenterology, and cardiology “high-revenue specialties,” and having advanced practice providers in a practice to complement the physician's efforts is driving compensation trends up. AMN Healthcare data found that salaries can reach $338,395 for specialist NPs.

Practice setting is also a factor. In inpatient hospital settings, NPs earn an average of $184,000; salaries drop to $145,000 for NPs in hospital-based outpatient clinics, $133, 000 in nonhospital-based offices and urgent care clinics, and $122,000 in public or community health settings.

The workload in each setting is also a significant factor in compensation. In outpatient settings, on-call responsibilities are often bundled into base salaries, while hospital-based or urgent care roles often offer higher pay to cover nights, weekends, or extended shifts. Herbison noted that a significant portion of the urgent care searches AMN Healthcare conducts are for NPs.

“They're not necessarily on call, but they may get paid a higher rate to take that seven-to-seven role or even overnight shifts,” he said.

During negotiations, starting salary figures alone can be misleading. AMN Healthcare data showed that 74% of open positions offer signing bonuses — that number was just 51% in 2023/2024, and the average signing bonus offered to NPs ranged from $2000 to $70,000. 

Herbison calls benefits and incentives a critical piece of the compensation puzzle, adding, “All incentives are on the table for nurse practitioners now. Relocation, [continuing education], coverage for malpractice, flexible scheduling — these are all levers practices use to stay competitive.”

The benefits for NPs are “much better” than for RNs, said Short. His employer offers perks like a continuing education allowance and covers the fees for memberships to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners and other professional organizations.

For Adebiyi, the value of a role comes down to how compensation balances with workload and support. She encourages early-career NPs to look beyond the hourly wage and salary and consider work-life balance, patient workload, administrative time, and benefits packages, and to make decisions that balance financial security with professional growth and quality of life.

“Pay should make sense, but it shouldn't be the only thing,” said Adebiyi. “Look for a package that supports you as a clinician and as a person; that's what makes the career sustainable.”

A new study from Mayo Clinic underscores the widespread impact of menopause symptoms on midlife women - and raises concern that most are navigating this stage of life without medical care to help manage those challenges. 

The study, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, was based on responses from nearly 5,000 women ages 45-60 who were surveyed across four Mayo Clinic primary care locations. More than 3 out of 4 respondents experienced menopause symptoms, with many reporting substantial effects on daily life, work productivity and overall well-being. 

Despite the availability of safe and effective treatment options, Mayo Clinic researchers found that menopause symptoms remain underrecognized, undertreated and inadequately addressed in the health care system. 

Severe symptoms affect daily life, yet few women seek care or receive treatment 

More than one-third (34%) of women who were surveyed reported moderate to very severe symptoms. Sleep disturbances and weight gain were among the most common issues reported by more than half of participants. 

The most striking finding was that more than 80% of the women who responded to the survey did not seek medical care for their menopause symptoms. While many women said they preferred to manage symptoms on their own, others said that they were too busy or unaware that effective treatments exist. Only about 1 in 4 women were receiving any treatment for menopause symptoms at the time of the survey. 

"Menopause is universal for women at midlife, the symptoms are common and disruptive, and yet, few women are receiving care that could help them," says lead author Ekta Kapoor, M.B.B.S., an endocrinologist and menopause specialist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.

This gap has real consequences for women's health and quality of life, and it's time we address it more proactively."

Without proper treatment, menopause symptoms can negatively affect sleep, mood, cognition, and productivity at work and at home. The findings underscore the importance of healthcare professionals proactively identifying and managing menopause symptoms in patients who may be struggling with them, the authors said. 

Researchers call for proactive care strategies and new tools to close the treatment gap 

The study noted that women often do not voluntarily mention concerns about menopause symptoms to their healthcare professional. Mayo Clinic researchers emphasize the need for strategies that destigmatize menopause care and make it more visible and accessible. Efforts are underway to develop questionnaires, digital tools and smartphone apps that help women identify symptoms, learn about treatment options and have more productive discussions with their primary care professionals. 

"Our goal is to educate women and healthcare professionals about menopause," Dr. Kapoor says. "By making it easier to recognize and understand symptoms, we can close the gap between need and care - and help midlife women live healthier, more fulfilling lives."

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze electrocardiograms (ECG) improved detection of severe heart attacks, including those that presented with unconventional symptoms, or atypical ECG patterns, and reduced false positives, according to a study published in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions and simultaneously presented at TCT 2025 in San Francisco.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a severe type of heart attack where a major coronary artery is blocked, preventing blood flow to the heart muscle. Quickly restoring blood flow, or reperfusion, using percutaneous coronary intervention is the standard of care; however, delays in achieving the guideline-recommended time to reperfusion still persist, especially at hospitals and centers not specializing in PCI and in rural areas. Time to reperfusion longer than 90 minutes is associated with threefold higher rates of mortality.

"AI-driven ECG interpretation can bring the best of both worlds – identify true heart attacks early while reducing unnecessary activations," said Robert Herman, MD, PhD, lead author of the study and a cardiovascular researcher at AZORG Hospital in Aalst, Belgium.

Improving the accuracy of triage at the first medical contact can streamline emergency care, reduce fatigue and strain on clinical teams, and ensure that patients who truly need urgent intervention receive it without delay."

Robert Herman, Cardiovascular Researcher, AZORG Hospital

In one of the first large, real-world evaluations of an AI–based ECG model for STEMI triage in the emergency setting, researchers retrospectively looked at 1,032 patients with suspected STEMI who triggered emergency reperfusion protocols. Data was from three geographically diverse primary PCI centers between January 2020 and May 2024. Each patient's initial ECG underwent analysis by the STEMI AI ECG Model (Queen of Hearts) trained to detect acute coronary occlusion, including STEMI equivalents and differentiate from benign mimics.

Angiography and biomarkers confirmed that 601 (58%) were STEMIs and 431 (42%) were false positives. The AI ECG model did better than standard triage, detecting 553 of 601 confirmed STEMIs vs. 427 detected by standard triage on the initial ECG. AI ECG had a false positive rate of 7.9% vs. 41.8% for standard triage, representing a fivefold reduction.

"These results indicate that AI-enhanced STEMI diagnosis at the first medical contact has the potential to shorten time to treatment and reduce false activations," said Timothy D. Henry, MD, FACC, senior author of the study, The Carl and Edyth Lindner Family Distinguished Chair in Clinical Research and Medical Director of The Carl and Edyth Lindner Center for Research and Education at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati. "This technology may be especially valuable in optimizing the transfer of STEMI patients from non-PCI centers to ensure timely and appropriate care."

In an accompanying editorial comment, Mohamad Alkhouli, MD, MBA, cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, said the researchers should be "commended for developing an operational AI model aimed at addressing one of the most complex and error-prone aspects of interventional cardiology practice-STEMI activation."

However, he emphasized that the AI model employed in the study should be interpreted with caution, as it was originally developed to detect occluded arteries rather than STEMI and necessitates further prospective validation across diverse patient populations.

"The true challenge is not proof of accuracy alone, but readiness-to integrate, regulate, and interpret AI as a complement to human judgment, particularly in high-stakes, time-sensitive clinical settings," Alkhouli said.

The bacterium known as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an unwelcome visitor in the human body. Serious infections can result when a bunch of these bugs settle together on a surface to form a biofilm - a community of microbes like the slime on spoiled food, but in this case residing inside a person. The grouped-up bacteria attack the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis and conditions that require the use of ventilators, such as severe COVID-19. Worse still, the World Health Organization lists Pseudomonas among the antibiotic-resistant bacteria presenting the biggest threat to human health.

Now, however, new findings from researchers led by the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA (CNSI) reveal just how Pseudomonas go from exploring a surface to committing to it and building a community - a key finding that can help pave the way to understanding how to tackle these types of infections 

The new study revealed how Pseudomonas detects and binds to specific sugars left behind by others from its species that arrived earlier. The cell senses these sugar trails using proteins on its body, and then identifies the sugars using hairlike appendages called pili. These pili are normally used to crawl along a surface, but in this case double as mechanical sensors that test the strength of the sugar bonds. All of this information is translated into chemical signals inside the cell that guide the operation of other bacterial machinery, such as the controlled secretion of more sugars to make biofilms. 

Reported in the journal Nature Microbiology, the results may inform applications in human health and industry. For Pseudomonas, the findings could lead to better approaches for undermining the dangerous bugs' ability to resist drug treatments.

"We can envision building on these results to influence the bacteria's behavior," said co-first author William Schmidt, a UCLA doctoral student in bioengineering. "We might be able to turn the cells into more antibiotic-susceptible versions of themselves that are easier to treat."

Sugar trails secreted by bacteria guide the organization of biofilms. Until now, the mechanisms behind how cells detect sugars secreted by one another on a surface have been unclear. What's more, the cell-membrane proteins that bind to specific sugars lack the necessary structures to allow any signaling, which has been a long-standing puzzle. 

The twist revealed by the study is the role of mechanical sensing by pili as the mediator of this signaling.

"This form of signal generation is new to the field," said CNSI member Gerard Wong, a corresponding author of the study and a professor of bioengineering in the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering.

People have thought of pili mostly as appendages for moving around. It turns out they also act as sensors that translate force into chemical signals within bacteria, which they use to identify sugars. We're seeing how sensory information is encoded in bacteria by their appendages for the first time."

William Schmidt, Doctoral Student, University of California, Los Angeles  

The sugars released by bacteria serve as both trails for others to follow and building materials for their communities. At later stages of biofilm development, those bacterial sugars help fix the crowd of bugs in place and form the surrounding matrix of the biofilm that protects from challenges that could dislodge it.

Pseudomonas visits to sugar trails, L to R: regular cells with their own sugars; regular cells with artificial and natural trails; cells engineered so they can't make sugars with artificial trails.

To query this system, the researchers fabricated a surface patterned with premade trails of a synthetic sugar, mimicking the bacteria's naturally produced sugars and especially attractive to Pseudomonas. Using genetic engineering and advanced cell-tracking techniques, the team uncovered the coordinated system combining chemical and mechanical sensing.

Pseudomonas are much less susceptible to antibiotics when the bacteria are cemented into a biofilm community. They're far more vulnerable while they are in their free-swimming form. Research following up on the CNSI-led study has the potential to yield solutions for Pseudomonas infections in cystic fibrosis patients and others.

"There's the possibility of turning back the clock on biofilm formation," said co-first author Calvin Lee, a UCLA postdoctoral researcher. "Even if you already have a biofilm, you may be able to make the bacteria take it apart by themselves."

The study may also inform solutions to other problems created by bacterial communities. Biofilms foul up pipes and filters as well as reactors used for chemical reactions in industry. They're also the first phase in the accumulations of flora and fauna encrusting ships at sea.

"We can ask, 'Is it possible to make a surface invisible to bacteria?'" said Wong, who is also a professor of chemistry and biochemistry and of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at UCLA. "If you get a surface to mimic empty space enough, as far as the bacteria perceive things, it may be possible to solve this multibillion-dollar problem of biofouling."

The researchers are looking into the wider repertoire of sugars sensed by surface proteins in Pseudomonas, as well as how differently shaped surfaces affect the bacteria's travels. The scientists also intend to investigate connections between these findings and previous results indicating that cellular signaling persists across generations of bacteria in biofilms.

Pomegranate's bioactive compounds such as punicalagins and ellagic acid show strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardiovascular benefits, supporting health and longevity. Current research confirms comparable efficacy between pomegranate juice and extracts while emphasizing safe, evidence-based use.

Traditional practices ranging from Chinese medicine to Tibetan and Uyghur rituals have used pomegranate (Punica granatum) peel, seeds, flowers, and bark for treating stomach ailments, diarrhea, wound care, and parasite control. Today, pomegranate fruit is eaten fresh, juiced, or processed into extracts, oils, cosmetics, animal feed, and functional foods worldwide.

Recent studies have explored the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, metabolic, cardiovascular, and anticancer effects of pomegranate components for potential nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications.1 Modern reviews further highlight pomegranate's role in promoting healthy aging through modulation of mitochondrial function and immune cell oxidative balance, reflecting its integration into both traditional and evidence-based medicine frameworks.3 Authoritative consumer guidance indicates that typical food use is generally safe, but people considering concentrated supplements should consult clinicians due to possible medication interactions and special situations (e.g., pregnancy, surgery, allergies).7

Key bioactive ingredients in pomegranate include hydrolyzable tannins and phenolic acids, particularly punicalagin, punicalin, ellagic acid, and gallic acid, as well as flavonoids such as anthocyanins. These compounds are highly concentrated in the peel, which is considered a rich reservoir of phenolic acids and hydrolyzable tannins essential to the fruit's biological activity.

Aqueous extracts of pomegranate peel often exhibit the highest overall phytochemical yield among tested solvents. Enzymatic and microwave-assisted extraction techniques can increase polyphenol recovery compared with conventional methods. Supercritical fluid and ethanol extractions also enhance yield and preserve sensitive antioxidants, indicating that extraction efficiency influences bioactivity outcomes and potential nutraceutical applications.2

Pomegranate seeds contain anthocyanins, including pelargonidin and cyanidin glycosides, whereas the peel is particularly enriched in phenolic acids like gallic, ellagic, caffeic, and ferulic acids, as well as hydrolyzable tannins. Juice processing generates peel as a co-product rather than waste, thereby creating an opportunity to upcycle peel into high-value extracts rich in these bioactive ingredients. Pomegranate seed oil, containing up to 76% punicic acid, provides anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, and anticancer properties, making it a valuable resource for food and pharmaceutical formulations.1 Human pharmacokinetic data show that pomegranate juice and standardized extracts can yield similar systemic levels of ellagitannin metabolites when matched for polyphenol content.8

The antioxidant activity of pomegranates is attributed to high levels of hydrolysable tannins, particularly punicalagins, as well as ellagitannins, ellagic acid, and anthocyanins that directly scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, chelate transition metals, and interrupt lipid peroxidation chain reactions.

These polyphenols also modulate redox signaling, with in vivo studies reporting reduced basal cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS in white blood cells of aged mice administered a standardized pomegranate extract, along with lower plasma malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker. Under an acute oxidative challenge with tert-butyl hydroperoxide, pomegranate extract prevented ROS surges and reduced mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide levels in neutrophils, thereby protecting innate immune cells while maintaining redox homeostasis during aging. These effects likely reflect both radical scavenging and enhancement of endogenous defenses across leukocyte subsets.3 Comparable effects have been demonstrated in human studies, where supplementation improves total antioxidant capacity and reduces biomarkers such as malondialdehyde and oxidized LDL, indicating systemic redox regulation.4

Randomized clinical trials of pomegranate preparations in adults have reported improvements in physiological endpoints linked to oxidative stress, including reduced blood pressure levels and better exercise performance after exhaustive effort. Enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, have been observed following pomegranate peel supplementation in athletes, supporting recovery and resilience against exercise-induced oxidative stress.4

Pomegranate reduces nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling and shifts cytokine profiles toward a lower-inflammation state. Across in vivo and clinical settings, polyphenols isolated from pomegranate peels reduce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-1β, IL-6, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and C-reactive protein (CRP), all of which are effects consistent with NF-κB pathway inhibition.

In rodent models, pomegranate peel extract preserves antioxidant-detoxification gene expression and reduces lipid peroxidation, thereby preventing pro-inflammatory cytokine release. In humans, reductions in systemic inflammatory mediators accompany improved oxidative stress indices, thereby supporting a coupled antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanism. Newer systematic reviews confirm that pomegranate peel supplementation consistently lowers IL-6 and CRP levels post-exercise and during metabolic stress, reinforcing its dual redox–inflammatory modulation properties.4

Obese women with knee osteoarthritis receiving pomegranate peel extract showed biochemical evidence of reduced oxidative stress, along with improved enzymatic defenses that modulate upstream inflammatory signaling. In metabolic conditions, patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and animal models of metabolic syndrome demonstrated anti-inflammatory and lipid-modulating benefits from peel intake, including lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and inflammatory markers such as CRP and serum amyloid-A. These results parallel preclinical observations of NF-κB inhibition and attenuation of inflammatory cascades in muscle and vascular tissues, underscoring broad anti-inflammatory potential.4

Short-term randomized trials report small reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, likely due to improved nitric oxide bioavailability and reduced oxidative stress. Although some studies reported improved flow-mediated dilation and lower IL-6 levels, pomegranate supplementation does not significantly affect adhesion molecules like intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin. However, consistent IL-6 reduction and minor improvements in endothelial function suggest that pomegranate's vascular effects are mediated primarily by anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions rather than direct modulation of adhesion molecules.5

Across clinical studies, changes in total cholesterol and LDL-C are inconsistent; however, anti-atherogenic mechanisms are supported by reduced oxidized lipoproteins and improved macrophage cholesterol handling. Small trials conducted in high-risk groups suggest slower atherosclerotic progression markers, which align with the polyphenol-rich profile of pomegranates, which protect against nitric oxide signaling and lipid peroxidation. Meta-analyses indicate that continued intake may benefit arterial stiffness and oxidative status, even when lipid outcomes are modest.5

In metabolic syndrome, early evidence from both children and adults suggests potential benefits for vascular health and broader risk factors. These improvements have been most apparent in inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, with occasional favorable shifts in blood pressure or lipid subfractions. However, heterogeneity in study design, small sample sizes, and varied preparations limit these results, necessitating larger, longer trials using standardized products to optimize dosing.5

Preclinical and early clinical studies suggest anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of pomegranate extract in breast and prostate contexts, alongside potential anti-angiogenic effects. These observations are similar to those observed with pomegranate interventions, which have been shown to reduce systemic inflammation in humans. Detailed mechanistic analyses reveal inhibition of multiple oncogenic pathways, including PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB, while promoting apoptosis by upregulating caspase activity and suppressing metastasis-related signaling.6

Ellagitannins are transformed into bioactive metabolites that may influence host inflammation and oxidative stress, which suggests that regular intake could support intestinal homeostasis. This microbiota-polyphenol axis is a plausible contributor to downstream metabolic and immune benefits observed in human studies. Emerging data also suggest that gut-derived urolithins mediate mitochondrial biogenesis, potentially linking pomegranate consumption to systemic energy metabolism and cellular longevity.3

Topical and oral pomegranate preparations are being explored for photoprotection, wound repair, and attenuation of erythema, with proposed benefits including reduced oxidative damage, modulation of inflammatory mediators, and support of extracellular matrix integrity. Collectively, these effects warrant rigorously designed trials to confirm efficacy, define doses, and clarify which patient groups benefit most.6

Across clinical and mechanistic studies, punicalagins, ellagic acid, and anthocyanins consistently reduce oxidative stress, modulate NF-κB signaling, and improve vascular parameters, including blood pressure and endothelial function. Clinical trials also suggest benefits for lipid oxidation, exercise recovery, and selected cognitive outcomes. Comprehensive evidence now supports pomegranate-derived products as multi-target nutraceuticals that aid redox balance, control inflammation, and mitigate age-related functional decline, though standardized formulations remain critical for reproducibility.1–6 In practice, both juices and standardized extracts can achieve comparable levels of ellagitannin metabolite exposure when matched for polyphenol content,8 and consumers should follow established safety guidance and consult a clinician when using concentrated products or when taking medications.7

Using targeted radiation during surgery - referred to as intraoperative radiation - to eliminate pancreatic cancer cells that have spread to areas around the pancreas, investigators at Johns Hopkins have been able to reduce the recurrence rate around the pancreas to 5%. This is believed to be the lowest ever reported for this population of patients, according to a preliminary study by the team from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.

The study was presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology annual meeting in September 2025.

The study enrolled 20 patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients received presurgical chemotherapy and radiation targeted to shrink the tumors away from the blood vessels. Then, during surgery to remove their tumors, patients received another dose of precisely targeted radiation using a robotic device that carries small radioactive beads inserted through catheters. The device enabled the team to pinpoint a triangular area near the pancreas, where recurrences commonly occur. Only one of the 20 patients experienced a recurrence around the pancreas at the 24-month mark - a major achievement for a cancer that, until recently, had lagged behind other cancers in treatment success.

By the time most pancreatic cancers are diagnosed, the tumors have spread to affect important blood vessels around the pancreas. Historically, patients with pancreatic cancers whose blood vessels were affected could not undergo surgical removal of their tumors. But in the past decade, clinicians at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center's Skip Viragh Center for Pancreas Cancer Clinical Research and Patient Care have pioneered new approaches that use chemotherapy and radiation to shrink the tumors away from blood vessels, enabling more patients to undergo surgical removal of their tumors.

However, many of these patients continued to experience tumor recurrences, and Amol Narang, M.D., associate professor of radiation oncology and molecular radiation sciences, and his colleagues sought to determine why.

The team learned that the pancreatic cancer cells were spreading along nerves near the pancreas to a fatty, nerve-dense triangular area just above the pancreas, which Narang calls the "Baltimore triangle." When he and his colleagues started targeting the Baltimore triangle with radiation before surgery to kill these stray cancer cells, pancreatic cancer recurrence rates in their patients dropped from 47% to 12% at two years post-surgery. Yet, in the 12% who experienced recurrences around the pancreas, the recurrences continued to occur in the Baltimore triangle.

To further lower recurrence rates, Narang and his colleagues decided to deliver an additional round of Baltimore triangle-targeted radiation to patients during surgery after removal of the pancreatic tumor. He explained that, during the surgery, surgeons remove a part of the small intestine next to the pancreas - called the duodenum - making it easier to access the Baltimore triangle without risking harm to surrounding organs. The combination of radiation targeted to the Baltimore Triangle prior to surgery as well as intraoperative radiation to the triangle during surgery allowed Narang to deliver ablative doses of radiation to this region.

"The combination of intraoperative radiation and targeting the Baltimore triangle has gotten us to a 5% recurrence rate, which is the lowest-ever reported recurrence rate around the pancreas for this population of patients to our knowledge. But I think we can drop to 0% in our next study," Narang says.

We must do whatever we can to prevent recurrences from happening, because when pancreatic cancer comes back, it is often incurable. These results give us hope, though, that this can be done for a cancer where even decade ago, most thought this wasn't possible."

Amol Narang, Associate Professor, Johns Hopkins Medicine

The only recurrence in the study occurred in the part of the Baltimore triangle that the team had difficulty reaching during the intraoperative treatment. Currently, the team is developing strategies to target this hard-to-reach part of the triangle, with the hopes of reducing recurrences to zero. Once they've mastered that refined approach, they would like to team up with other cancer centers across the country to run a larger clinical trial to confirm their results.

Lionesses had mixed fortunes in friendly double-header that highlighted some areas where they need to improve

England's first camp of the year was one of new beginnings as Sarina Wiegman's side returned for the first time since winning a second successive European Championship. Defeat by Brazil and victory against Australia provided plenty of pointers about how the Lionesses are looking at the start of a new international cycle as preparation gets under way for the 2027 World Cup:

There was deep concern for Michelle Agyemang when she went down with a serious looking knee injury with 10 minutes to play against Australia in Derby on Tuesday. The post‑match comments from Wiegman did little to ease the worry. “It doesn't look good,” she said. “We don't know yet but I'm not very positive about what I've seen.” Injury woes have been mounting for Wiegman since the summer with key players already missing. Leah Williamson is yet to return after undergoing a minor knee operation while Lauren Hemp and Lauren James remain out. Grace Clinton was missing with a knock, Jess Park was out with concussion, and Lotte Wubben‑Moy had to leave camp early through illness. But all the focus now is on Agyemang.

Everyone wants to win football matches but the Lionesses were presented with a huge opportunity for experimentation in this series of friendlies, with two more games to come against China (29 November) and Ghana (2 December) to close out 2025. With the pressure eased, Wiegman took used this opening, handing out three debuts and giving players crucial minutes. Aston Villa's Lucia Kendall took her chance against Australia and was arguably one of the best performers. This was the 21-year-old's first call‑up from the under-23s but she looked like she belonged instantly, comfortable in possession, creating opportunities and at ease amongst seasoned internationals.

Depth at left-back has been a consistent issue but Taylor Hinds's adept performance against the Matildas will have given the coaching staff plenty of food for thought. Khiara Keating also made her long-awaited debut, starting against Brazil. The defeat was disappointing but the young goalkeeper was not at fault for either goal and grew into the match. There were also key minutes for players who have found themselves on the periphery, such as Esme Morgan, Maya Le Tissier, Missy Bo Kearns and Aggie Beever-Jones.

The opening 18 minutes against Brazil encapsulated the defensive issues that have haunted England for some time. The Lionesses tend to labour against pacy, direct attackers while also being guilty of making early errors. Jess Carter and Morgan were the centre-back partnership in a new defensive unit against Brazil. Both ply their trade in the NWSL, where fast transitions are the norm, but they struggled to handle the speed of the Brazilian front line.

Le Tissier, who has been the subject of much conversation over this window, started at right-back against Brazil but was moved to the centre towards the end of that game and against the Matildas and looked much more comfortable. The lack of suitable cover for Lucy Bronze, however, remains a problem. The 34‑year‑old illustrated exactly how important she is to this team with a goal and an assist in the first half against Australia, her first 45 minutes since the Euro 2025 final. Leah Williamson's absence was also felt, not only in the leadership she brings as captain but also how fundamental she is to the way England build going forward.

There has never been any doubt about Aggie Beever-Jones' qualities as a goalscorer. The young Chelsea forward has been one of the most in-form players in the Women's Super League this season and has four goals to her name. She has struggled, however, to get regular game time for England and found herself occupying the bench at the Euros. While certainly an out-an-out No 9, the key strength of Beever-Jones is her versatility which gives Wiegman added attacking dynamism.

She can play across the front three and has even been utilised in the No 10 role by her club manager, Sonia Bompastor. She started on the left against Australia and was the most dangerous player early on, while her goal was another illustration of her range of scoring ability. “I love playing for England no matter where I am,” she told ITV. “I don't look at the stats, I just come here and focus to try and tell Sarina what I can do.”

A strangely frustrating aspect from these two friendlies for England will have been the limited minutes they had to challenge themselves against a full-strength opposition. Brazil's Angelina and Australia's Alanna Kennedy both saw red around the 20th minute for denying goalscoring opportunities. “In a qualifier I don't care,” Wiegman said with a laugh. “But in a friendly you want to play 11 v 11 as that's the challenges you have the most.” It did, however, force the Lionesses to adapt against cohesive defensive units. They struggled to do so against Brazil, who dropped deep to defend their penalty area, despite having opportunities to equalise. England were much improved in the final third against Australia, particularly in the first half. But their lack of clinical finishing persisted despite the wealth of attackers they possess, and is an area where they can improve.

Former U.S. men's national team star Alexi Lalas took aim at Christian Pulisic, claiming the American superstar is not the captain the USMNT “needs or wants” ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Pulisic has come under fire over the last year for his leadership and commitment to the Stars and Stripes. A string of underwhelming performances and results, combined with the decision to skip the Gold Cup this summer, subjected the 26-year-old to a wave of criticism.

With just eight months to go until the USMNT kicks off its 2026 World Cup campaign in Los Angeles, the noise is only getting louder for Pulisic, who has the pressure of wearing the captain's armband for the host nation in the biggest tournament of his career.

Lalas, a vocal critic of the AC Milan forward, did not hold back when addressing Pulisic's captaincy on the State of the Union podcast.

“I don't think that Christian Pulisic is the captain that this team needs or that this team wants. The problem is, who else is there? Who's coming around the bend? Nobody,” Lalas said.

The 55-year-old went on to mention Chris Richards, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams, but admitted those players are “not quite there yet.”

Pulisic has been the USMNT's standout player since he burst onto the scene, displaying a talent that kickstarted the Stars and Stripes' “golden generation.” 

The Pennsylvania native already has the fifth-most all-time goals for the USMNT, chasing records set by Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan. Pulisic also stars for AC Milan and has a long list of both Serie A and Champions League accolades to his name.

Yet, according to Lalas, his skill should not guarantee him the captaincy of the USMNT.

“The notion that your best player is not necessarily equipped to be a captain is nothing new. We have seen it over the years and it is completely valid. That doesn't mean he doesn't have passion. 

“Oftentimes, it's not necessarily the best player; it's not necessarily the person who has done the most in their career. It's not even necessarily somebody that's larger than life. And oftentimes you have to be able to take a step away and say, ‘This is what's good for the team,'” Lalas said.

It might be some time before Pulisic can return and potentially prove Lalas wrong; the winger suffered a hamstring injury during the October international window and AC Milan have reportedly asked Mauricio Pochettino not to call up their superstar in November.

Check out our soccer expert's Swansea vs Man City predictions, prior to Wednesday's 3:45pm ET EFL Cup clash (10/29).

Our betting expert expects a low-scoring contest in South Wales, with Omar Marmoush offering the main goal threat for the visitors.

All odds are courtesy of US Sportsbooks, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.

Guardiola is likely to ring the changes at the Swansea.com Stadium. While he should still have sufficient depth to be able to win this tie, the visitors might start slightly disjointed.

Man City have often performed better after the interval this season. They've scored 59% of their Premier League goals in the second half. Meanwhile, 57% of the goals they've conceded in the league have come in the first half.

Swansea might treat this match somewhat like an away game. Only two goals have been scored in the first half of their Championship away fixtures this term. Erling Haaland is expected to be rested, so they'll fancy their chances of keeping it tight until the interval.

It's evident that the visitors depend on Haaland for goals this term. Having scored 11 Premier League goals, the Norwegian is already five clear of the rest. He has scored 65% of his team's goals in the English top flight.

Haaland didn't play in City's third-round tie away to Huddersfield. Guardiola's team won that game 2-0 against League One opposition, but they weren't convincing. The visitors created only 1.18 xG and just one big chance across the 90 minutes.

Facing a Swansea side that is quite well organised at the back will be much more difficult. Alan Sheehan's team have only conceded 12 goals in 12 Championship games so far this season.

Omar Marmoush may need to lead the line for Man City in the likely absence of Haaland. The Egyptian suffered a knee injury earlier this term, but has been fit enough to feature off the bench in each of his team's last two games.

The midweek trip to Swansea is likely to serve up a first club start since August for the 26-year-old. He has scored for Egypt since then, but will be eager to get back on the scoresheet for the Citizens.

Marmoush demonstrated his goal-scoring abilities in the second half of last season following a January move from Eintracht Frankfurt. He scored once every 169 minutes in the 2024/25 Premier League. All seven of those goals came in the first half.

Man City head into this game following a major setback in the Premier League on Sunday. Their 1-0 away loss to Aston Villa ended their nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions.

They won all of their previous three matches to nil. Pep Guardiola will want a response in midweek against a Swansea side that beat Norwich 2-1 at home on Saturday.

The Swans have already won three home EFL Cup ties this season. They beat top-flight Nottingham Forest 3-2 in the last round. However, they've only won two of their seven league games since then.

Swansea expected lineup: Fisher, Key, Cabango, Burgess, Tymon, Stamenic, Widell, Fulton, Galbraith, Franco, Idah

Man City expected lineup: Trafford, O'Reilly, Ake, Stones, Lewis, Gonzalez, Doku, Silva, Reijnders, Cherki, Marmoush

Real Madrid have announced plans to seek “substantial damages” from UEFA after Spain's regional court dismissed appeals by UEFA, La Liga and the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) over the Super League case. The ruling marks another legal victory for Florentino Perez's club, confirming UEFA breached European Union competition law by abusing its dominant position.

Vinicius Jr's Real Madrid future is in serious doubt after a public fallout with Xabi Alonso during El Clasico and growing frustration over his stalled contract talks. The Brazilian is reportedly eyeing a move to Paris Saint-Germain, drawn by Luis Enrique's playing style and leadership, as relations in Madrid reach breaking point despite his recent public apology.

With two matches of a three-match camp in the books, the USWNT now faces New Zealand in Kansas City, Mo. This fall camp came after a long hiatus with a 113-day gap separating the July 2 win vs. Canada from this week's first match against Portugal on Oct. 23. On Oct. 23, the U.S. scored early with a beautiful strike from Rose Lavelle in the first match but couldn't shake all the rust off and ultimately fell 2-1 to the European side. Back to it on Sunday, the USWNT — fielding a young and inexperienced team that averaged 21.7 years old and 19.2 caps per player at the start of the match — marched into East Hartford, Conn. and buried goals early and late to beat Portugal, 3-1. Portugal took just one shot on goal in the second match, and it went into the net. On Oct. 26, Olivia Moultrie struck in the first minute and the 10th, her second, enabling the USA to take the lead after the third Portugal header goal of the two-game series. From then on, the U.S. held the line until the end of the match and, in the 82nd minute, Sam Coffey called game with a sublime finish off a corner from Ally Sentnor.

The USWNT now holds a 9W-3L-0D record on the year and a 11W-1L-1D record against Portugal. The USA will finish the three-game set with a match against New Zealand in Kansas City, Mo., on Wednesday, Oct. 29, in the team's first-ever match at CPKC Stadium (8 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. CT, on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports).

October Matches vs. Portugal & New Zealand

GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 3) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 4)

DEFENDERS (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 3/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 69/1), Eva Gaetino (Paris St-Germain, FRA; 1) Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 9/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 8/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 3/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 112/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0)

MIDFIELDERS (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 40/5), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 168/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current; 3/0), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 114/26), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 10/4), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 28/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 10/1)

FORWARDS (6): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 9/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 25/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 14/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 10/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 13/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/3)

In the last FIFA window, Emma Hayes gave five players their first caps – goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, defenders Jordyn Bugg, Lilly Reale and Izzy Rodriguez and midfielder Sam Meza. All but Rodriguez and Meza are back on this roster, which features just one first-time call-up in Kennedy Wesley. Rodriguez and Meza, who started on June 29 vs. Ireland, became the 23rd and 24th players to debut under Hayes in her 27 games at the helm, a remarkable ratio for the Olympic champion head coach. Hayes has given 28 total players their first USWNT call-ups, but she also gave a first cap to a player who did not get a first call-up under her, as Lily Yohannes earned her first call-up under former interim head coach Twila Kilgore but did not see action under Kilgore. The 24 players who have earned their first USWNT caps under Emma Hayes are: Sam Staab, Lily Yohannes, Croix Bethune, Yazmeen Ryan, Hal Hershfelt, Emily Sams, Emma Sears, Mandy McGlynn, Alyssa Malonson, Eva Gaetino, Ally Sentnor, Tara McKeown, Michelle Cooper, Gisele Thompson, Claire Hutton, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Avery Patterson, Lo'eau LaBonta, Kerry Abello, Claudia Dickey, Lilly Reale, Jordyn Bugg, Sam Meza and Izzy Rodriguez.

Defender Eva Gaetino, who was participating in U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team Training Camp this week outside of Philadelphia, has been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team roster and joined the U.S. camp ahead of the final two matches of the FIFA window. After Trinity Rodman's withdrawal from the October camp roster due to injury, the USWNT entered camp with 25 players. Confident in her players at both the senior and U-23 rosters, and once again emphasizing the importance of the U-23 program, Hayes looked to the oldest of the USA's Youth National Teams to fill the 26th spot. With the U-23s training at the same facility as the USWNT, a call-up could easily be made. With all this in mind, Hayes attended U-23 trainings to assess the players, and, with all of her U-23 teammates looking on, informed Gaetino after one of those trainings that she would be joining the senior team for the rest of camp. The 22-year-old Michigan native was with the senior team for the 2024 SheBelieves Cup, but did not see action, and then earned her first and only cap in a 90-minute performance against Argentina on Oct. 30, 2024 — helping the U.S. squad to a 3-0 win that night. The 5-foot-11 central defender is in her second full season, with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Première Ligue after a banner college career at Notre Dame.

USWNT head coach Emma Hayes has compiled a record of 22W-3L-2D through her first 27 matches at the helm of the USWNT and guided the USA to five consecutive shutouts before seeing that streak end against Germany in the group stage of the Olympics. It was the second-longest shutout streak to open the tenure of any full-time USWNT head coach, trailing only the nine consecutive shutouts that opened the Greg Ryan era. Ater the 3-0 opening game win over Zambia at the Olympics, Hayes became the first USWNT head coach to win their first major tournament match by a margin of three or more goals and joined Anson Dorrance as the only head coaches in USWNT history to win their first six matches at a major tournament. Dorrance won all six games with the USWNT at the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Hayes joins three other USWNT head coaches of the last eight in USWNT history who won their first major competition (Anson Dorrance – 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, Pia Sundhage – 2008 Olympics, Jill Ellis – 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup). The gold medal victory in Paris came in Hayes' 10th match at the helm of the USWNT, the fewest matches before winning a World Cup or Olympics by any head coach in women's soccer history. Hayes picked up her first world honor as head coach of the U.S. Women's National Team when she won the Ballon d'Or as the 2024 Women's Soccer Coach of the Year. France Football, the top soccer magazine in France and one of the most reputable in Europe, has been awarding the Ballon d'Or to men's players since 1956 and to women's players since 2018, but 2024 was the first year it has given out awards to coaches of men's and women's soccer. Hayes then followed that up by winning The Best FIFA Women's Coach award. Hayes won that award in 2021 and finished second to England head coach Sarina Wiegman in 2023.

Thursday's matchup will be the 22nd meeting all-time between the two teams. The U.S. leads the matchup record 19W-1L-1D and a 75-goal gap between the two teams. The most recent meetings between the teams came in January of 2023 when the USA visited New Zealand before the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The USA won both matches handily, 4-0 in Wellington and 5-0 in Auckland. Of the players who scored those nine goals over those two games, only Rose Lavelle, who scored twice in Auckland (while wearing the captain's armband) is on this roster.

 Before those matches, the USA and New Zealand met most recently about 11 months before on Feb. 20, 2022, on the second matchday of the SheBelieves Cup in Carson, Calif. The USA won 5-0 in a match that featured a highly unusual and painful to watch three own goals from one player – defender Meikayla Moore who currently plays for Calgary Wild FC in Canada – along with scores from Ashley Hatch and Mallory Pugh.

The USA and New Zealand met in four consecutive Olympic Games: 2020, 2016, 2012, and 2008. New Zealand and the USA met in the middle game of group play at the delayed 2020 Olympics with the Americans rolling to a 6-1 victory as Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Christen Press and Alex Morgan scored while the USA forced the Football Ferns into two own goals. The teams also met in the opening game of the group stage match at the 2016 Olympics, the quarterfinal of the 2012 Olympics and in group play at the 2008 Olympics. In Brazil, the USA picked up a 2-0 win behind first-half goals from Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan. In England, the USA won 2-0 on goals from Abby Wambach and Sydney Leroux. In China, the USA won 4-0 on goals from Heather O'Reilly, Amy Rodriguez, Lindsey Tarpley and Angela Hucles. O'Reilly scored 40 seconds into the match which was the fastest goal in Olympic history until Canada's Janine Beckie scored 20 seconds into the 2016 Olympic match against Australia.

Arsenal have been dealt with a fresh injury blow with star players William Saliba and Gabriel Martinelli ruled out of action for their upcoming game with Brighton & Hove Albion in the Carabao Cup. The duo, along with Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice and Riccardo Calafiori, picked up problems in their last Premier League encounter against Crystal Palace, which the Gunners won 1-0 to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League table.

Barcelona's injury crisis has deepened with Pedri ruled out after suffering a hamstring tear in the aftermath of El Clasico. The midfielder, who has been a near ever-present under Hansi Flick, will miss several key fixtures as the Catalan giants face a mounting list of absentees, including Raphinha, Gavi, and Marc-Andre ter Stegen, piling further pressure on the German coach ahead of a crucial run of games.

'Give Erling Haaland the ball and he will score' had proved to be a pretty effective tactic for Manchester City over the previous two months, but Aston Villa have exposed its flaws. They found a way to blunt the Norwegian's edges on Sunday, ending Haaland's run of scoring in 12 matches in a row for club and country while also becoming the first team to keep a clean sheet against Pep Guardiola's side in nine games.

Villa are far from the only team to have noticed that stopping Haaland means stopping City this season, but they were the first ones to see their plan through. It should be said that Unai Emery's side were a touch fortunate, and on another day Haaland might have scored. However, Haaland instead fired straight at Emi Martinez when played in by Bernardo Silva before heading a late cross straight at the Argentine goalkeeper. He even managed to find the net at the death, clattering into the post in the process, but the goal was ruled out by a marginal offside against Omar Marmoush.

It was a reminder that, contrary to what you might think looking at the jaw-dropping runs of form throughout his career, Haaland does not actually score all the time and cannot be expected to either. And unless City come up with a contingency plan, they will not be able to win the title back.

Herc Gomez discusses why he thinks Timothy Weah and Weston McKennie could be left out USMNT new system under Mauricio Pochettino. (1:47)

Years before coaching the U.S. men's national team in preparation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and before managing some of the biggest clubs in world soccer, Mauricio Pochettino was known as "El Sheriff."

Marshaling his area of the pitch with an aggressive and vocal presence, the former central defender made a name for himself in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a physical and thundering enforcer. This bold personality and imposing style was seen most prominently in Spain with Espanyol, where Pochettino landed after being molded by the youth ranks of Newell's Old Boys.

Through two separate stints that marked the beginning and end of his playing career abroad, the long-haired officer took command at Espanyol. Establishing himself as a captain for the team that would go on to win two Copa del Rey titles, Pochettino showcased traits that paved the early foundations of his eventual and successful pivot to coaching.

With ensuing managerial positions at illustrious clubs such as Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur, the Argentine's legacy in the sport is defined by what he has done on the sidelines. With 2026 around the corner, that attention has been heightened to another level in his move to the wild west of North American soccer through his current position with the USMNT.

Plenty has been said about the 53-year-old based solely on what he has done as a manager. Analysis of his leadership, and the former player in general, tends to zero in on just his coaching era.

So let's change that.

In order to better understand Pochettino's process and way of thinking as he prepares for the World Cup with the U.S., we must first also understand him as a player -- especially during his lengthy stay at Espanyol from 1994 to 2001 and 2004 to 2006. Through conversations with ESPN, a few of his former teammates at the Spanish club opened up about Pochettino, his on-the-field character, his different personality, his sense of humor off the pitch and much more.

"He spoke a lot," former Espanyol full back Grégory Vignal said with a laugh. "Very typical South American guy from Argentina ... but he was really good."

Of the stories that were shared, one of the most common themes regarding Pochettino was just how boisterous the confident defender was as a player. And not just yelling for the sake of yelling, but organizing, directing and advising throughout practice sessions or the 90-plus minutes of a match.

"His voice is the way he controls, how he demands players, how we can move together, how we can support each other," said Armando Sá, another former member of the Espanyol backline. "He had a strong presence."

For Sá, even though it did mean that the presence was a highly persistent one, he felt reassurance whenever the Argentine was on the field with him.

"I felt very safe. I felt like someone [was], every time in my ears, talking, coaching me," Sá said. "'Go left, left, close the space, close that, come down, go inside' ... all these communications on the field were very clean from him, you know? Very good information.

"This made it easy when you play [like] that and one of the reasons we won the Copa del Rey."

Before playing alongside each other at Espanyol, former midfielder Óscar García remembered Pochettino standing out when he first faced him with Barcelona.

"He looked like a leader," García said. "Experienced, an aggressive defender."

Praised as someone who was also technically good on the ball, and respectful to players and staff at training, it makes sense as to why many of his teammates have fond memories of Pochettino. His desire to guide a roster, coupled with his own skill set, made him an obvious candidate to be captain.

But was he always like this? Even from the beginning with Espanyol?

"In our first practice sessions, you can immediately notice that this kid has something special. I mean, he was immediately talking, organizing," said Velko Iotov, a former Bulgaria international, when reminiscing about Pochettino's early days. "Immediately, all the teammates saw him as a leader."

Described by Sá as "a different beast, he's a different animal" on the field, what was Pochettino like when he didn't have his cleats on?

"Honestly, a different guy," the former Mozambique international said. "Calm, funny, liked to joke, he's sarcastic ... he's a normal guy."

When not a beast on the field, his former teammates shared anecdotes about the humble figure he was off the field, who was easy to befriend.

Iotov, who at one point was alone at Espanyol when his family was back home, remembers Pochettino inviting him to dinners with his own family. During those dinners and team meals, he didn't seem to mind that Iotov's Spanish was very limited, and used those moments to coach players outside of the confines of a training ground as well.

"Tenedor," began one informal Spanish lesson after Pochettino held up a fork when sitting next to Iotov.

Another Spanish lesson also displayed Pochettino's sense of humor. During a bus ride, the defender was walking past Vignal and noticed that the French-born player on loan from Liverpool was practicing his Spanish. Pochettino commended his efforts, but also gave him his own homework.

"He taught me one or two bad words to make sure I understand properly the language," Vignal joked.

The current USMNT coach later played a prank that Vignal remembers to this day. New to the Barcelona area where Espanyol are based, Vignal wanted to take his girlfriend out to dinner and reached out to Pochettino, who recommended a place called La Dama.

"It was a beautiful restaurant, but he never told me it was really, really expensive," Vignal said with a big laugh. "I think he did that on purpose."

On the restaurant's website, it describes itself as the "epitome of eclectic sophistication." One review on TripAdvisor reads: "We knew it would be expensive, but didn't think it would be that expensive."

Vignal had a nice meal, but when receiving the bill: "Wow!"

At training the next day, Pochettino approached him with a smile and asked him if he enjoyed the experience. "Yeah, I also enjoyed the bill," Vignal said.

Despite displaying the characteristics of a successful coach in his playing days, another theme that emerged from the conversations with his teammates was their surprise that Pochettino became a manager. If he had goals of being a coach one day, there was no indication that it was something he openly talked about.

"You never know and he never said anything about it," said García when asked if he could tell that the Espanyol captain would one day lead on the sidelines. "But he is having a very good coaching career."

Vignal agreed.

"[He had] the characteristics [of a coach], of course, but sometimes you never expect this type of player or ex-player to become a coach or manager ... but he had the profile," the former France youth international said.

There was undeniably a sense of pride among his teammates when opening up about what Pochettino has accomplished since becoming a manager after his 2006 retirement as a player.

With PSG, Pochettino lifted a Ligue 1 title and Coupe de France, while finishing as a semifinalist in the UEFA Champions League. Over at Chelsea, he pushed them to a Carabao Cup final and an FA Cup semifinal. With Tottenham, he helped the team qualify for a Champions League final for the first and only time in club history.

"I'm very happy for his career and very happy for what he's achieved now," said Sá, who hopes to one day work with Pochettino again, but as a coach. "I think he's doing a good job. It's not easy."

What could be easy is fully moving on past his days as "El Sheriff." The attention and fame he has gained as a manager exceeds what he did on the field, despite the fact that Pochettino represented Argentina through 20 caps and a 2002 World Cup appearance.

All that said, depending on who you ask, that Sheriff is still within the USMNT coach.

In his previous coaching run with Chelsea during the 2023-2024 season, Pochettino was leading a preseason tour in the U.S. that took the team through Atlanta. At Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where the Premier League club was training, a group of guests watched the practice session from afar.

Unknown to Pochettino, Iotov was among that group. "Poche!" yelled the director of the local United Futbol Academy, thinking there was no way Pochettino was going to recognize him years after last seeing each other and among a random collection of people watching the training. "Velko!" Pochettino yelled back. He rushed over and "jumped" on Iotov.

"People looked at me and said, 'Who the heck are you?'" Iotov, a 1994 World Cup semifinalist, said.

No longer watching from afar, Pochettino brought Iotov onto the field during the training. Later in the locker room, along with members of his coaching staff, they caught up for about an hour and a half. Pochettino was running late, with the bus ready to leave the stadium, but he didn't care.

"Oh, they can wait," Pochettino said to Iotov, talkative as ever, as if nothing had changed for the former stalwart Espanyol figure who's now commanding a different role.

USWNT head coach Emma Hayes says her side were "unrecognizable" in the 2-1 defeat to Portugal. (2:56)

The ink had barely dried on the paperwork for the blockbuster transfer of forward Alyssa Thompson to Chelsea, from Angel City FC, before U.S. women's national team coach Emma Hayes was in New York to address the NWSL's board of governors.

Hayes already knew that some NWSL executives were suggesting she was telling USWNT players that they needed to play in Europe. Thompson's move, driven by Chelsea's aggressive pursuit of the winger, was a tipping point that gave the longstanding rumors new life and set in motion a certain degree of panic inside NWSL circles.

So, Hayes took her own advice that she shared with media last year on her first official day on the job. "In the absence of communication," she said, there is "usually the wrong type of conversation."

Hayes stood in front of the boardroom of owners and NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman last month and, multiple sources told ESPN, asked them a simple question: Women's soccer players have fought their entire lives for freedom of choice. Why would I take that away from them?

The fact that Hayes felt compelled to address the matter so directly speaks to the level of consternation among some in the NWSL about losing top USWNT players to elite European clubs. Whether that should be such a major concern in a rapidly evolving global landscape is a different question entirely.

As Hayes said: Players are free to sign contracts wherever they want.

Ten years ago, that wouldn't have really been true for a player that aspired to be a USWNT regular. But it's truer than ever thanks to the adoption of full free agency in the NWSL's new collective bargaining agreement that was signed last year. In conjunction with the elimination of U.S. Soccer-backed contracts for national team players to play in the NWSL, USWNT players can now play wherever they want -- both domestically and abroad.

Hayes touted this freedom of choice publicly last week, about a month after her private message to the NWSL's board, saying that she tries "to meet the players where they're at in their lives" when they approach her about their club futures.

"My role as a coach is to listen, to support, to guide, and each and every player has different needs at different moments," Hayes told reporters. "Usually, the process is that they've made their decisions about what they want to do, and they'll come to me asking how to start preparing for that."

That was the process for Thompson's big move to Chelsea, both Thompson and Hayes said.

Emily Keogh talks about USWNT forward Alyssa Thompson's potential move to Chelsea from Angel City.

Chelsea expressed a desire to sign Thompson, and the 20-year-old expressed that she wanted to challenge herself with what she called "her dream team" in her first interview with the club. Hayes simply wanted to make sure Thompson understood the realities and challenges, including moving away from her sister, Gisele, who had been her teammate for club and country. The USWNT coach said she was more worried about the move than Thompson.

The biggest changes in recent years for Americans deciding where to play? First: The willingness of top clubs, European and NWSL alike, to spend more. All six $1 million-plus transfers have occurred this year, and all of them featured clubs from Europe or the NWSL. As European teams spend more money, more of those transfers move in that direction across the Atlantic Ocean.

Second: U.S. Soccer's decision to remove itself from the NWSL's business, literally. Until 2022, USWNT players signed contracts with U.S. Soccer even for their NWSL play. These "federation players" were, at the time, the highest-paid players in the NWSL. The previous setup was a way to keep USWNT players in the NWSL, a league founded and operated by U.S. Soccer until 2021. All 23 players on the 2015 and 2019 World Cup-winning sides were based domestically (Abby Wambach had no club team during the 2015 World Cup).

Former USWNT forward Christen Press has spoken openly about how her initial stint abroad was cut short in 2014 because she was told by U.S. Soccer to come to the NWSL if she wanted to be on the national team.

USWNT midfielder Lindsey Heaps said again last week what was already known for years: "My initial decision when I was at PSG to come back to the U.S. [in 2016] was made because of a conversation with Jill [Ellis, former USWNT coach] and I. At the time, you kind of needed to be in the U.S. because of our camp status at the point." A young Heaps had wanted to make the 2016 Olympic roster.

But the USWNT's new CBA, ratified in 2022, now pays players based solely on their call-ups to and appearances with the USWNT. The effect has been a more competitive USWNT pool that is free of contractual obligations, and a shift in the balance of power between U.S. Soccer and NWSL teams.

As one NWSL general manager, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told ESPN, NWSL teams used to be at the mercy of the federation when it came to USWNT players because U.S. Soccer paid their salaries. Now, "the script has flipped" and the NWSL teams are investing millions in players.

The migration of top USWNT players to Europe is not a new phenomenon. Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan went to Lyon in 2013 and 2017, respectively, earning more money there in a month than many NWSL colleagues earned in the corresponding season. (The NWSL's minimum salary when it launched in 2013 was $6,000.)

Throughout the NWSL's history, a select few have made jaunts to Europe. Some, like Press, were driven there in search of an opportunity to kick start their international career. Others, like Rapinoe and Morgan, had the chance to leave their comfort zone while also being paid unprecedented wages as stars in their primes. More recently, Rose Lavelle and Sam Mewis moved to Manchester City after their breakout 2019 World Cups.

And then there was the rarest path, that of an American teenager bypassing college soccer altogether and moving to Europe to chase the dream. Heaps blazed that trail from Colorado to Paris Saint-Germain as an 18-year-old in 2012.

Historically, a flood of USWNT players going to Europe has been cyclical in nature. The aforementioned stars left the NWSL after either a World Cup or an Olympics -- the down years of a four-year cycle. Girma and Thompson have done the same, although they signed long-term contracts to stay at Chelsea. Longer contract terms are a global trend in the women's game, which has led to transfer fees quadrupling to over $12 million globally in just two years.

Ideally, Hayes and Heaps said, players don't change clubs in a World Cup year so that they have a consistent environment, but even that is not a rule set in stone.

"There's just so much that goes into it," Heaps told reporters last week. "Each individual is different. You can't compare experiences, but the best you can do is share your experience, what worked for you, what didn't, and just be very open."

Fast forward to today, the high-paying, record-breaking transfer opportunities at major European clubs are still only for the top 1% of players.

USWNT defender Naomi Girma left San Diego Wave FC for Chelsea in November in the world's first $1 million transfer. Thompson followed in September in a $1.4 million transfer. Each player is among the best or projecting to be one of the best in the world in their respective position. Lily Yohannes is the 18-year-old star in the making who has played in Europe for years already -- and is now Heaps' teammate at Lyon and with the USWNT.

Multiple NWSL general managers told ESPN recently that the competition for top players in the world, including Americans, is still only with a handful of European teams. One GM framed the exclusive group of competitors willing to spend big as restricted to the UEFA Champions League quarterfinalists. That pool of European teams competing in this financial arms race hasn't changed drastically over the past decade: eight-time European champions OL Lyonnes and Chelsea lead the way, alongside a few others.

Those teams are perennial contenders in the Champions League, which is a driving force in players' decisions. For many Americans, potentially driven by the prominence of the men's competition, the UEFA Women's Champions League is still the biggest club trophy they can win.

Yohannes moved to OL Lyonnes in the summer after her breakout year at Dutch club Ajax.

"Lyon is such a big club and a club that I've grown up watching and looked up to," Yohannes said last week ahead of the USWNT's game in Chester, Pennsylvania. "To have the opportunity to join the club, I was really excited. Just hearing the project and their plan for me, I think that the football style suits me. It's such an amazing club with so many world-class players. That's sort of what went into it [the decision] among other aspects and factors."

NWSL teams don't currently play in any competition that matches the stature of the UEFA Champions League -- Concacaf's equivalent competition is only in its second season. There are also myriad factors in players' personal decisions, including the desire to experience a different culture abroad.

USWNT defender Emily Fox left the NWSL for Arsenal in early 2024 to experience the different culture and big stadiums in London. A little over a year later, she played a prominent role in Arsenal's shocking run to a UEFA Champions League title.

However, not every move abroad leads to glory. Jenna Nighswonger left NJ/NY Gotham FC for Arsenal after winning an Olympic gold medal last year and has struggled to earn first-team minutes. USWNT veteran Crystal Dunn hasn't been able to break into Paris Saint-Germain's preferred starting 11 either.

Players' individual preferences and dreams can neither be changed nor controlled. Paris or London will always be, well, Paris or London (among other destinations): appealing lifestyles abroad on top of great professional opportunities.

There is also general agreement that exposure to diverse playing styles is beneficial, especially when World Cups come around. Heaps, while acknowledging the unique situation of each player, also concedes that she thinks every player should experience different cultures in their career. And Hayes speaks frequently about the benefits of the UEFA Champions League, including last week when she complimented Portugal for defeating the USWNT.

But the recent moves of Thompson and Girma out of the NWSL to Chelsea have sparked a renewed debate around the NWSL's salary cap, which will remain in place at least until 2030 per the collective bargaining agreement signed last year. The league's cap will rise from a $3.3 million base this year ($3.5 million with revenue sharing) to a $5.1 million base in 2030.

One NWSL general manager, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told ESPN that they are "worried more dominoes will fall" in the upcoming transfer window. Thompson was a major loss for the NWSL on and off the field as one of the league's brightest young Americans. Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman, arguably the NWSL's and USWNT's biggest star, is out of contract at the end of the year.

There is widespread worry among league executives that the salary cap will not proportionately increase with the global market to keep NWSL teams competitive. Allocation money, which previously allowed clubs to spend outside the cap, is being phased out.

And while some sources have talked to ESPN at least about the desire to create some kind of designated player rule to pay top players outside of the cap, there is no indication that such a concept will soon come to fruition.

The cap is especially annoying for the most ambitious NWSL teams, many of whom feel that their goal of being the best club in the world is unreachable in a league with a salary cap -- a foreign concept to their European foes. If the NWSL can't attract the world's best players, it will struggle to keep calling itself the best league in the world.

Berman, asked by ESPN in a media roundtable after September's board meeting concluded, said NWSL clubs can still be the best in the world within a salary-cap structure.

"I actually think we can be both; we can be the best league in the world and have the best club in the world, because we have the right infrastructure and the right investment and the right operational model where our teams, our owners are partners in business," she said.

The rapidly evolving global economy continues to challenge that notion. The world record for a transfer fee roughly doubled in about 18 months, and experts ranging from team executives to agents don't expect the pace of growth in spending to stop anytime soon. That presents a unique problem for the NWSL, which, aside from a major variable around revenue sharing, has a defined salary cap for the next five years.

That, however, is the NWSL's problem to solve. While the league and federation are still partners, the NWSL's concerns are no longer so directly the concerns of the USWNT. What Hayes and her ever-deepening pool of players need are clubs that will push them to be their best individually -- wherever that might be.

"The amazing thing about the women's game and where it is, is that there are opportunities for players," Hayes said. "We want the USWNT to be the best team in the world. We want them to be in the best environments in the world. And yes, ideally that could be in the NWSL, but it's not my choice."

Each player has her own choice to make, and there are more realistic options than ever.

Real Madrid and Vinicius Junior have had a rocky relationship over the past year, but rather than calming after the arrival of Xabi Alonso, has only grown in significance. With uncertainty over his contract situation, and those critical of some of his behaviour, Alonso has reduced his status within the squad.

The Brazilian is no longer guaranteed to start every game he is fit for, and no longer used for 90 minutes, with just three of his appearances seeing him last the whole match. That tension generated between Vinicius and Alonso came to a head on Sunday as Vinicius reacted to coming off, the latest sign that the two are not getting on as Real Madrid might hope.

It is not the first time that the two have not seen eye to eye. Vinicius is reportedly considering leaving Real Madrid if Alonso stays, and was open to doing so in the last week of the transfer window. By that point, the first issue between them had already occurred in the United States during the Club World Cup.

While it was no secret that Alonso was intending on dropping Vinicius before their semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain before Trent Alexander-Arnold got injured. Cadena SER add that the drama was significant after Vinicius went worked out that he was not starting, and reacted badly to Alonso. Since, Vinicius has shown signs of disrespect, questioned his authority, and public frustration during previous substitutions too.

Since missing out on the Ballon d'Or, Vinicius has struggled to hit the same heights, and was just showing signs of doing so. However Sport explain that there has been some discontent from the Real Madrid hierarchy at Vinicius' decline in importance, and the amount of time he has spent on the bench. Vinicius' camp has communicated their own frustrations to the club, and both these concerns have been passed on to Alonso too.

Real Madrid have left Alonso to deal with the matter, but fundamentally, the pair will need to put aside their disagreements in order to make the coming months more fruitful for both. One of the questions marks over Alonso before taking the job was how he would handle a dressing room of egos, and President Perez will be keeping a close eye on how he overcomes this challenge.

Saudi Arabia have released a promotional video for their bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup. (2:03)

Social media has been abuzz this week with a viral video of a soccer stadium perched at the top of a skyscraper, along with the claim that it will be built as one of the venues for matches at the 2034 FIFA World Cup in Saudi Arabia.

The short, unofficial clip purporting to depict the concept supposedly reveals plans for a $1 billion, 46,000-seater arena in the futuristic new city of NEOM that will perch high atop a purpose-built skyscraper, 350 metres (1,150 feet) above the ground.

It remains unclear who created and initially shared the clip, which has sparked plenty of excitement online but also several questions: Will the building be secure and architecturally sound? How long will the queue for the elevators be after the game? Was it designed intentionally to look so much like the Eye of Sauron?

A post shared by Business Bulls | AI (@businessbulls.in)

But while the computer-generated clip may have convinced some people that it is a vision of the future, the truth is that it's a work of science fiction. However, the reality is still something to behold.

The actual stadium proposed for construction in NEOM has been officially listed as one of the 15 host stadiums being either renovated or built from scratch for the FIFA 2034 World Cup for almost a year, and the Saudis do plan for it to be 350 metres above the ground. That is because they plan for it to form part of The Line, a proposed smart, green city in Neom that will eventually extend in linear fashion for over 100 miles across the northwest Saudi province of Tabuk by 2045, powered entirely by renewable energy.

The 46,000-capacity NEOM Stadium will be designed and constructed in partnership with Neom, the Saudi Ministry of Sport and the Public Investment Fund (PIF) with work set to begin in 2027 and conclude in 2032, two years before the World Cup kicks off.

Presented as part of Saudi Arabia's 2034 World Cup bid book (p. 107), published by FIFA in November 2024, the Neom project was introduced as "the most unique stadium in the world" with preliminary plans mentioning a "striking landmark" in the first district of The Line, which will be built around a large man-made marina as a fully functioning showpiece section of the city ahead of the tournament.

- FIFA gets complaint over Saudi '34 World Cup human rights abuse
- 2026 World Cup: Who has qualified, and how the rest can make it
- Messi aims to defend World Cup with Argentina, but only if 100%

The plans show the NEOM Stadium being integrated into the roofline of The Line's remarkable vertical cityscape and forming the hub of what will be a "sports-focused neighbourhood" that contains a World Cup festival fan park as well as myriad hotels, apartments, an airport, a hospital and a fully electric shuttle transport system.

While technically over 1,000 feet in the air, the stadium will occupy the fourth and fifth level of The Line's dense, five-tier megastructure, and therefore would not be as perilously exposed as a single skyscraper.

If the images that went viral this week have achieved anything -- beyond grabbing plenty of online attention -- it is that now the real Saudi plan for a 350-metre-high, 100-mile long megacity suddenly doesn't seem quite so far-fetched.

But when it comes to considering either high-altitude stadium, we still have the same question: What would happen if a ball is kicked over the top tier of the stands and began hurtling down at terminal velocity? It would be a brave pedestrian who attempted to bring that ball under control.

Qatar players celebrate qualifying for the 2026 World Cup Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto via Getty Images

The Athletic FC ⚽ is The Athletic's daily football (or soccer, if you prefer) newsletter. Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox.

Hello! We're taking you into the convoluted land of World Cup qualifying today. It's kicking off.

On the way:

Understanding the Asian section of World Cup qualifying demands the patience of a saint or a world-class IQ (neither of which is in my locker). If I told you there were 46 nations and four separate group stages to allocate slots at the finals — and that an additional round sends one more country to the last-chance saloon of the intercontinental play-offs — I'm assuming you'd lose the will to live.

Advertisement

Jacob Whitehead had a spirited go at making the framework intelligible, and the reason he did so was that the progression of two Asian Football Confederation (AFC) teams to the 2026 World Cup is causing a stir. In the face of a qualifying path so complicated, it would be impressive if controversy didn't flare up somewhere down the line. Slightly inevitably, it has.

The complaints surround Saudi Arabia and Qatar, both of whom have secured their spot at next summer's tournament. They will be in the United States, Canada and Mexico — stick with me here — by virtue of topping their groups in round four, and they're the latest of eight qualifiers from the AFC zone, following Japan, Iran, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan and Australia.

Here's the problem. In theory, the round-four fixtures should have been held at neutral venues. Instead, and for reasons that have not been explained to the satisfaction of anybody, the Saudis and Qataris had home advantage, which they made the most of. Iraq were pipped by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates lost out to Qatar.

You might have picked up on the tie between Qatar and the UAE because at the end of it, UAE fans invaded the pitch and rioted. Footage of the trouble spread across social media. On top of the choice of venues, the Saudis and Qataris had three more days' rest before the decisive matches. The losing teams are crying foul.

It's well known that Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as examples of football's changing geopolitical order, are close to the centre of World Cup affairs. Qatar hosted the tournament in 2022 amid criticism of its human rights record. Saudi Arabia will stage it in 2034 after succeeding with an unopposed bid to FIFA. It also faces scrutiny on human rights grounds.

Unsurprisingly, Iraq and the UAE, believing the fourth qualification round was weighted against them, are questioning why home advantage existed. As UAE coach Cosmin Olaroiu pointed out, an easy solution would have been for the group involving the Saudis to be based in Al Alrayan, and the group containing Qatar to play their games in Jeddah. “All teams should have an equal chance,” he said.

He wasn't the only manager angered by the lack of neutrality. “This is not fair play,” Oman's Carlos Queiroz complained.

Qatar hosting the World Cup and ceaseless investment in the Saudi Pro League mean those two countries have some of the best facilities in the Middle East. That's fair to point out, but the opaque logistics have left a bad taste.

Iraq and the UAE now meet over two legs next month in the AFC's fifth and last round, then that tie's winners will hope to be one of the two nations to make it through to the finals from the six-team intercontinental play-offs in March. Because truly, this road to 2026 never ends.

A potentially significant scandal is brewing in Turkey, where conspiracy theories stalk referees. The distrust of them won't be helped by dramatic revelations about betting practices there.

On Monday, the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) used a press conference to shine a light on the gambling habits of the country's match officials. It revealed that of the 571 who are currently active, 371 have betting accounts. Of those, 152 actively gamble. One of them, incredibly, has placed more than 18,000 bets in the five years since 2020.

Those being investigated include seven referees and 15 assistants who work in Turkey's Super Lig, its top division. The competition is continuing, but there are calls for it to be suspended. Alongside TFF's investigation, prosecutors are probing the matter, too. No names have been given, and it isn't clear if any of the officials involved gambled on games they participated in, but we'll stay tuned to developments. The implications of this story could be seismic.

From a distance, I'd regard Real Madrid as being in a happy place. They are five points clear of arch-rivals Barcelona at the top of La Liga and they're quietly chipping away in Europe. Coach Xabi Alonso has made a good fist of taming the beast.

So it surprised me to read Mario Cortegana's report of a rift developing between Alonso and senior members of his dressing room. Sure, we saw Vinicius Junior's tantrum after he was substituted in Sunday's Clasico win against Barca, but I assumed the squad would be warming to a head coach who is making them tick. Apparently not.

Switching to Alonso from his predecessor, Carlo Ancelotti, was bound to be a sharp gear change. Ancelotti is a people person who accommodates the whims of his pros, sometimes altering tactics depending on their wishes. Alonso is less touchy-feely, a man with a defined identity. Life is more disciplined and he's said to be stricter. Player entourages are no longer as free to knock around Madrid's training ground.

One source put it like this to Mario: “He thinks he's Pep Guardiola, but for now, he's just Xabi.” And of course, Alonso has plenty to prove, but under Ancelotti last season, Madrid limped behind Barca in La Liga. They were pulverised by Arsenal in the Champions League. It wasn't happening, and if I were a fan at the Bernabeu, Alonso's internal battle is one I'd want him to win.

The first round proper of the Netherlands' KNVB Cup got underway last night. How did it go for VVV-Venlo in their tie against Heerenveen? The best way to answer that is to treat you to the third goal in their 3-0 defeat, above. It's pretty special as blunders go. Luuk Verheij, take a bow.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. – Kansas City Current is one of the two most-represented NWSL clubs on the October roster for U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes and the four players on the roster who proudly wear the teal had a lot of good things to say about the city they represent.

The USWNT plays its first-ever friendly at CPKC Stadium, home of the Kansas City Current, on Wednesday, Oct. 29 at 7 p.m. CT. CPKC Stadium is the first stadium in the world built exclusively for a women's sports team. The historic, standard-setting venue at Berkley Riverfront Park opened its doors in 2024.

While it may be a new location for the National Team, players Claire Hutton, Michelle Cooper, Lo'eau LaBonta and Ally Sentnor know very well the site of Wednesday's friendly against New Zealand is a special place.

“It feels very much like home,” Sentnor said. 

These four players are part of a Kansas City Current roster that made history this season. The Current captured the NWSL Shield on Sept. 20 with five regular season matches remaining, faster than any other club in league history, and head into the last weekend of matches before the playoffs with a 20W-3L-2D record.

“This quartet has been driving the standards here at this club, and it's why they are an outstanding team in the NWSL this year,” Hayes said.







These four players have brought a high standard to the international level and played important roles for the U.S. Women's National Team in this October FIFA window.

Hutton was one of three teenagers to start the team's 3-1 win against Portugal on Sunday, Oct. 26 in Connecticut and is a player who Hayes often uses as an example to epitomize the player pathway from the Youth National Teams to the senior team. The 19-year-old midfielder worked her way from her debut with the U-17s to the U-19s and the U-20s, making contributions in competitive tournaments such as the 2023 PanAm Games and the 2024 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.

“The development and grounding, both in playing youth national team tournaments... plus NWSL, starting for her team... is really giving her the foundation to be able to perform at our level, maybe at a slightly earlier age,” Hayes said.

Sentnor, who recorded an assist in the 3-1 win over Portugal, arrived to the Kansas City Current via a blockbuster trade on Aug. 1.

“When you come into a top environment, you might not get everything all at once, but if there's one player who I know that is determined, no matter the obstacle, no matter the realities of a situation, that will make things happen, it's absolutely Ally Sentnor,” Hayes said.







Hayes called Cooper “a firecracker” with the kind of dynamic personality that every team needs. Cooper showed her grit in the opening match of this window on Oct. 23, earning a spot in the starting XI and battling against a tough, physical Portuguese side. 

“She's dynamic,” Hayes said. “She gets people out of their seats.”

LaBonta was a late addition to Hayes' October roster, replacing the spot initially filled by Seattle Reign midfielder Sam Meza. LaBonta is the oldest player in camp, someone who Hayes describes as “a constant” in terms of her performance and delivery. When the group arrived in Kansas City, Labonta welcomed her USWNT teammates to the city by introducing them to her dog, Amigo.

“He's definitely brought some smiles to camp,” LaBonta said. 

Playing at CPKC Stadium, even in the cold mist that Tuesday's weather brought to training, is clearly a point of pride for the foursome – and it expands beyond the pitch. Hayes shared with the media that these four teammates have been telling everyone what to expect – from where to find the best barbeque in the city to how spirited the fans will be Wednesday evening.

“I think it's going to be loud,” Hutton said. “The stadium is going to be packed, loud and energized. We say it with the Current, this is our 12th man when we're playing in the stadium, and I think it's going to be the same way in the U.S. crest. I'm most excited to see how everyone else reacts, how they talk about this city and this field afterwards.”







These four aren't the only ones who know how loud Kansas City fans can get. The camp roster consists of 19 players from the NWSL, including Rose Lavelle who plays for Gotham FC. As someone who has visited CPKC Stadium before on the opposing side, the midfielder is looking forward to having the Kansas City fans behind her for once.

“It's definitely a tough stadium to be an away team in because the crowd really shows up, and it's a great atmosphere. It will be fun to experience it as a home team,” Lavelle said.

Kansas City is a massive sports town, and its soccer roots run deep. Hayes said that the team's hotel includes a clock that counts the days, minutes and seconds until the Current's next match. The city is also home to Sporting Kansas City in Major League Soccer, formerly known as the Kansas City Wizards and the Kansas City Wiz before that when the club was one of the 10 charter teams to play in the league's inaugural season in 1996.

The city is also of course home to the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs, winners of back-to-back Super Bowls in 2023 and 2024. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes became the first active NFL player to have equity in an NWSL team when he became a new co-owner of the Current in 2013 along with his wife, Brittany. He joined the Long family, Angie and Chris, who founded the club and served as the visionary leaders who brought CPKC Stadium and the Current's world class training center to life. 

“What an incredible family,” Hayes said of the Longs. “What they are doing for women's sport and women's soccer in particular in this country, they're leading the way with some other clubs.”

Hayes, her son Harry and four of her USWNT players had a chance to root for Mahomes during the Kansas City Chiefs' 28-7 win at Arrowhead Stadium against the Washington Commanders on Monday Night Football. Hayes had a rocking time and expects to have another one on Wednesday night when Kansas City officially welcomes the USWNT for the first time at CPKC Stadium.

Our Matchup Mindset series reveals the psychology behind two of tennis' most unpredictable champions.ByStephanie LivaudaisPublished Oct 29, 2025 copy_link

If there's one moment that captures the essence of Daniil Medvedev, it came after his lopsided first-round victory over Jaume Munar at the Rolex Paris Masters.After falling 6–1, 6–3, the Spaniard smiled in exasperation at the net and told him, “Playing like this…? Good luck!”Medvedev, grinning wryly, replied: “One time per year it happens, sorry!”That's the spirit of the disruptors—players like former ATP world No. 1 Medvedev and former WTA Top 5 Jelena Ostapenko. Both are overflowing with talent, variety and personality, yet finding that perfect balance on court—sustaining brilliance for more than a week or two—can be elusive.Is it the conditions? Their mentality? Or do they simply thrive when facing the right opponent?

Ostapenko owns a 4-1 record against Top 10 players in 2025; she's 3-5 against players outside the Top 100 during the same period.

“First I listen to what the coach is saying, and then I say what I think,” Ostapenko explains. “Then we come to a plan together for what I have to do.”The 2017 Roland Garros champion owns one of the most fascinating head-to-heads on the WTA Tour: she's 6-0 against longtime top player Iga Swiatek, including three wins in 2023 and 2025—both seasons in which Swiatek finished No. 1 or 2.Read More: Has there ever been a matchup in tennis quite like Jelena Ostapenko vs. Iga Swiatek?Recent highlights include:2025 Doha: Defeated Swiatek 6-3, 6-1 in the semifinals, then reached her first WTA 1000 final since 2018 Miami.2025 Stuttgart: Beat world No. 2 Swiatek 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 in the quarterfinals, then toppled world No. 1 Sabalenka in the final to claim her lone title of the year.“I like some stats, but I think when you're playing the match you always have to adapt,” Ostapenko says. “You can have all the stats in the world—but then suddenly, the player is doing something different, or you are...“I like to think also I can adapt in the match, think for myself, and figure out what to change or do next.”👉 Stream the full episode of Matchup Mindset with Jelena Ostapenko here, on the Tennis Channel app.

“I personally rely not too much on the stats, because every match is different,” Medvedev says. “And I do think, sometimes, that it can even make things worse!”

Medvedev takes a similar approach to Ostapenko. For him, numbers and history only go so far.“Head-to-head is the least important factor,” he says. “If it's 5-0 for you, it just means you like your opponent's game and know what to do tactically. But if it's the other way around, then you need to adjust something.”A recent example: Medvedev lost his first two matches against teenager Learner Tien, both grueling baseline duels that left him physically drained. In Shanghai, however, he turned the tables—shortening points due to cramps and finally earning his first win over the rising American.“Tennis is such a funny sport that on any given day, anything can happen,” Medvedev reflects. “Head-to-head matters, but it's not the most important thing in the world.”By embracing the unpredictability—and accepting that every match feels different—Medvedev turns that chaos into his competitive edge.👉 Stream the full episode of Matchup Mindset with Daniil Medvedev here, on the Tennis Channel app.

	Donald Trump's Department of Justice has indicted Democratic congressional hopeful Kat Abughazaleh, along with five others, for conspiring to impede the work of a federal law enforcement officer. The indictment makes Abughazaleh the latest Democratic figure to be targeted by the Trump administration for challenging the regime's aggressive tactics. 


	Abughazaleh shared the news of her indictment on social media on Wednesday. “This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the first amendment,” she says in the video. 


	The indictment accuses Abughazaleh — whose name is repeatedly misspelled in the document — of bracing her hands on the hood of an ICE vehicle that was attempting to drive through a group of protesters outside of the Broadview Processing Center, ICE's Chicago command center.   


	Since announcing her candidacy, Abughazaleh has made ICE's violent deployment in Chicago a focal point of her campaign, holding press conferences and participating in protests at Broadview. On social media, she's documented officers reacting violently to protesters presence: Abughazaleh was slammed to the ground in one incident, and hit in the face with a baton during a separate encounter.

	“Since I and others have exercised our first amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls and teargassed hundreds of protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors and terrorizing us cannot become our new normal,” she says in the video posted Wednesday. “And because Chicago doesn't back down from bullies in masks who tear gas our neighborhoods, this administration has resorted to weaponizing the federal justice system to scare us into silence. But we're not going to be silent.”

	











	Abughazaleh announced her bid to primary Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who has represented Illinois' 9th District since 1999, in March. Soon after, Schakowsky announced her intention to retire when her current term expires, setting the stage for the first competitive primary in the district in almost 30 years.

	Abughazaleh was the first to announce in a crowded field that had grown to 18 candidates, including two state senators, a state representative, and Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss. A recent poll, conducted by MDW Communications and commissioned by Abughazaleh's campaign, showed the upstart trailing Bliss by five points, and well ahead of the rest of the field, with nearly half of the electorate undecided.


	According to a Public Policy Polling survey conducted in September, two thirds of Evanston residents oppose the aggressive tactics ICE has used in the city.

	With the indictment, Abughazaleh joins a long list of Democrats who have been harassed by federal authorities for standing against ICE. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.), was indicted in June after a scuffle outside an ICE detention center in Newark. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained by federal authorities at immigration court in New York. California Sen. Alex Padilla was handcuffed and escorted out of a press conference in Los Angeles. 


	“We are in an emergency,” Abughazaleh told Rolling Stone when she announced her candidacy in March. “Right now, the answer to authoritarianism isn't to be quiet. It's not matching pink outfits at a state address. It's not throwing trans people under the bus. It's not refusing to look at the party at all and see where it could be better. The answer is to very publicly, very loudly, very boldly, stand up. The only way to fight fascism, and this has been proven over and over and over again, is loudly, proudly, and every single day.”

EXCLUSIVE: Fresh off her record-breaking rookie year in the WNBA, Paige Bueckers is looking to make her leap onto the big screen, as sources tell Deadline she is attached to star in the sports pic Jess & Pearl. Apple Original Films is developing the film, which is based on an original idea by Scandal alum Zahir McGhee.


	Apple had no comment.


The White Lotus producer David Bernad will produce the movie through his Middle Child Pictures banner, alongside Wasserman's Lindsay Kagawa Colas and Tommy Alter. Bueckers will executive produce.


	Set in the world of women's basketball, the film follows two phenoms who forge an extraordinary bond as teammates until fame, competition and the ruthless business of college athletics threaten to turn their friendship into an epic rivalry.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	One of college basketball's most decorated players, Bueckers helped lead the UConn Huskies to the 2025 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship. She was selected No. 1 in the WNBA draft by the Dallas Wings and was recently named the WNBA Rookie of the Year and to the 2025 TIME100 Next list. 


	Middle Child is in post-production on the second season of the Emmy-nominated series Jury Duty and the Netflix film Little Brother starring John Cena and Eric André. It is in in pre-production on the fourth season of The White Lotus, which has earned 66 Emmy nominations and 16 wins across three seasons.


	A co-executive producer on the Hulu series Reasonable Doubt, McGhee spent six seasons on Scandal, where he rose to co-executive producer. He went on to create and showrun Queens for ABC, starring Eve and Brandy, and previously developed Harlem's Kitchen, starring Delroy Lindo and Sheryl Lee Ralph. His writing credits also include Private Practice, Stumptown and For the People.

	











	Bueckers is repped by Wasserman. Colas is repped by Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. McGhee is repped by UTA and Matt Johnson at JSS&K. Bernad is repped by CAA and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.

UPDATED: Paramount's cuts across the company hit CBS News on Wednesday, with the streaming editions of CBS Mornings and the CBS Evening News canceled and CBS Saturday Morning in for an overhaul, according to a source familiar with the plans.


	The network also is closing its bureau in Johannesburg.


	In all, the layoffs are impacting close to 100 CBS News staffers, according to sources familiar with the extent of the cuts. They are part of a round of layoffs impacting about 1,000 across Paramount following Skydance's acquisition of Paramount Global. Another round of 1,000 job cuts is expected in the coming months.

	











	“People are very on-edge,” said one staffer, describing the mood as “depressed and unhappy” and “a very tough day at the network.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The cuts were in the works before Bari Weiss was named editor in chief of the news division this month.


	The two hosts of CBS Saturday Morning, Michelle Miller and Dana Jacobson, will be departing, according to a source familiar with the cuts. Jeff Glor, the previous host and former anchor of CBS Evening News, was laid off in a previous round of cuts last year, as Paramount Global slimmed down in preparation for a sale.

CBS Mornings Plus debuted last year as a streaming third hour of the network's morning program, hosted by Adriana Diaz and Tony Dokoupil. CBS Evening News Plus was anchored by John Dickerson, who announced this week that he was leaving the network at the end of the year.

	











	The layoffs are said to be spread throughout the news division. They are only the latest cuts at a legacy media outlet this year. NBC News announced layoffs of about 150 staffers as it prepared for the split from sister network MSNBC, which is being spun off along with other Comcast cable networks into a new company, Versant. There were significant layoffs to teams devoted to diversity verticals, such as NBC Out and NBC Blk, although those online sites will continue.


	The Writers Guild of America East, which represents employees in the news division, issued a joint statement with the Writers Guild of America West on the Paramount cuts. “Today, we once again see the toll on media workers and the news industry caused by unfettered corporate consolidation. The WGAE and WGAW are working with impacted members to ensure our collective bargaining agreements are enforced and labor law is followed in these layoffs at Paramount Skydance.”

This never would have happened if Moonves was still there.  Sometimes you have to think about the greater good.

That was nice they said they cared and gave a nice thank you… One must wonder what support in the transition means – but hey at will employment is a thing… glad those Government workers are getting paid for their time off during the shutdown eventually… we are clearly going through a restructuring with AI hiding in the shadows  as we become more productive. Just watched some entertainment ai film shorts on Instagram. It's definitely a new genre and with so much access to varied online content it becomes tough to make money on digital assets.

Bari Weiss Saturday am here we come!

CBS Saturday Morning, hosted by Michelle and Dana, is a Saturday ritual full well-crafted and insightful stories.  I know no one at Paramount is listening to my plea but don't mess with near perfection.  This show embodies the DNA of CBS News in the heyday with a splash of folksy Charles Kuralt.

Netflix has just landed another hot drama series and this one stars Adam Driver.


	The streamer has picked up Rabbit, Rabbit, a hostage crime drama that is described as in the vein of Dog Day Afternoon, after major interest across town. It handed the project a straight-to-series order. 


	The contemporary series is set at a truck stop in southern Illinois. When an escaped convict is cornered by law enforcement at a truck stop, he takes hostages in an effort to bargain for his freedom. But the standoff soon escalates into an unmanageable social experiment with his captives, as well as an emotional poker match with a veteran FBI Crisis Negotiator trained in “tactical empathy.”

	It is being written by Peter Craig, who wrote the screenplay for Top Gun: Maverick and created Apple series Dope Thief, which starred Brian Tyree Henry, and directed by Philip Barantini, the man behind the infamous one-shot style of Netflix's smash hit British series Adolescence.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Deadline understands that a script was sent out using the Embershot software, where buyers can only read it through the app and it gives writers and their teams data as to when it was read and by whom. The service gained prominence after Zach Cregger revealed that he used it to send out the script for Weapons.


	It's believed that Netflix took the project off the table in the early stages of it being taken out and handed it a straight-to-series order. It could shoot as early as next year. 


Rabbit, Rabbit is produced by Ozark producer MRC TV, which has a first-look TV deal with Craig's Night Owl. Craig and Bryan Unkeless will exec produce for Night Owl, Barantini and Samantha Beddoe will exec produce for their It's All Made Up Productions company. Driver also exec produces. 

	











	Barantini runs It's All Made Up Productions with Beddoe. The company, which has minority investment from Last Week Tonight producer Avalon, also produced the Boiling Point series, which starred Stephen Graham, for the BBC. It's All Made Up also recently had feature film Wasteman, directed by Cal McMau and written by Hunter Andrews and Eoin Doran, at TIFF. The prison thriller stars Tom Blyth and David Jonsson.


	Last year, Craig, who is also known for writing The Town, launched film and TV production company Night Owl with I, Tonya producer Bryan Unkeless. The company, which has a first-look TV deal with Ozark producer MRC, also has two projects already set up at Netflix; its adaptation of Shelby Van Pelt's novel Remarkably Bright Creatures, starring Sally Field, is currently in post, while Fight for '84, based on the true story of the coach of the 1984 US Olympic Boxing team, starring Jamie Foxx, is in production.

One of the more chilling self-financed indies in recent memory now has an ideal distributor to get it in front of a real audience.

Todd Wiseman Jr.‘s “The School Duel” tells the story of a near-future Florida where school shootings are so common, the AR-15 toting governor (Oscar Nuñez) has mandated that contests to the death be organized to pit troubled or at-risk students against each other. The idea is that these fights to the death will weed out potential future mass shooters. 

Kue Lawrence delivers a chilling performance for the ages as Samuel Miller, a seventh-grade student recruited by a shady mentor (Michael Sean Tighe) to compete in the bloody contests. Christina Brucato plays Sam's anguished mother, Beth.

IndieWire is pleased to exclusively announce that Altered Innocence (in a deal brokered by Anthony Buckner of Alliance Media Partners) has picked up “The School Duel” for North American distribution, with a planned theatrical release for spring 2026. This is a film designed to inspire obsession, and Altered Innocence, which has shepherded the releases of Vera Drew's “The People's Joker” (one of the IndieWire Critics Survey's Top 50 Movies of 2024), along with Chile's Oscar submission “The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo,” Alexis Langlois' “Queens of Drama,” and the 4K re-release of Frank Ripploh's “Taxi zum Klo” is well-positioned to fuel that obsession. Watch the teaser for “The School Duel” below:

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“The People's Joker” amassed a major cult following (here's our Toolkit interview with director Vera Drew), and it's easy to see how “The School Duel” could inspire the same. It debuted at the 2024 Deauville American Film Festival, and I was on the jury that awarded it Best Film at the 2025 Sunscreen Film Festival following a rhapsodic reception at the Miami Film Festival. It later played Fantasia, though you'd be better off going in thinking this is a Scorsese-like character study (powered by the extraordinary Lawrence, who plays Sam like a 14-year-old Travis Bickle) than a pure genre piece. It's far more emotional, and really deals with a grounded reality for a setup that invokes “The Hunger Games” or “Battle Royale” — what if those films explored the full emotional depth of their concept? “The School Duel” does.

“We're thrilled to bring ‘The School Duel' to North American audiences,” said Frank Jaffe, founder of Altered Innocence. “Todd has crafted something bold and fearless — a film that both shocks and moves you in equal measure. Fans of films like ‘The Hunger Games' and ‘Battle Royale' finally now have something else to feast on!”

Actor Tim Blake Nelson, who has now boarded the film as a presenting executive producer, said, “Todd's film has the best of what indie film can offer: a story of and for our moment with a strong and uncompromising point of view that's fully realized. I am proud to be associated with it.” The film was produced by Christa Boarini, Bryan Gaynor, Bobby Marinelli, and Wiseman.

 










AMP will handle international sales at the upcoming American Film Market. Wiseman's next project is indie TV: A series adaptation of Patrick D. Smith's 1984 novel, “A Land Remembered.”

Julianne Hough is keeping her brother's word — sort of. The 37-year-old “Dancing with the Stars” co-host hilariously sported a bald look during the show's Halloween episode on Tuesday, October 28, after Derek Hough vowed to shave his head if he won People magazine's “Sexiest 40-Year-Old” in the magazine's 2025 Sexiest Man Alive Reader's Choice Poll.

A post shared by Julianne Hough (@juleshough)

“Someone had to do it…. @derekhough 😜 #dwts,” Julianne wrote on Instagram, joking that her “head's cold” in the comments. She also shared the photos on Facebook with the caption, “@derekhough wouldn't shave his, so I did. #DWTS.”

In the Halloween episode, co-host Alfonso Ribeiro announced that Derek had indeed won “Sexiest 40-Year-Old” in People's 2025 poll, while contestant Dylan Efron took home “Sexiest Tattoos.”

A post shared by Daniella Karagach Pashkova (@daniellakaragach)

Ribeiro, 54, then played a throwback clip Derek had posted earlier, opening a package revealing his nomination. In the video, Derek joked that he'd shave his head if he actually won, thinking it was unlikely. As Ribeiro appeared behind him with clippers in hand, Derek mouthed, “No way.”

After the reveal, Derek doubled down on his hesitation, later asking fans on Instagram Stories whether he should go through with the buzzcut.

While chatting on Instagram Stories with his wife, Hayley Erbert, and friend Jill, Derek admitted he's never shaved his head before. Erbert, 31, tried convincing him with “inspo pics” of David Beckham's iconic buzzcut.

“I'm not David Beckham, yo,” Derek laughed. “But you are! You're sexiest…” Erbert began before trailing off.

“I'm not David Beckham!” Derek repeated as Erbert showed Beckham's photo onscreen. “That could look really good,” she said, but Derek wasn't convinced. “I'm not that man. I'm just not. So guys, right now, yes, no, what do you think?” he asked followers in a poll.

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

Tuesday's spooky “DWTS” episode featured elaborate costumes, haunting choreography, and Julianne's viral bald cap moment that had fans in stitches.

The longtime dancer has co-hosted the competition show alongside Ribeiro since 2023, while Derek has been a judge since 2020. Off the dance floor, he recently revealed that his dream “DWTS” partner would be Kristen Bell.

A post shared by Derek Hough (@derekhough)

“You know, when people have always asked me in the past, they'll be like, ‘Who would be your dream partner on Dancing with the Stars?'” Derek said in an interview with Bell and her “Nobody Wants This” co-star, Adam Brody. “And I'm gonna be honest with you, Kristen, you've been my number one for a while.”

Bell was visibly surprised. “What? Derek, do you know that I tip over all the time, like even just watching?” she said with a laugh.

Cheryl Burke is an extremely talented dancer, and she has 26 seasons of experience on “Dancing with the Stars” before her 2022 exit. When Burke returned to the ballroom as a special guest judge for Week 7 of Season 34, fans were excited. However, many have taken issue with the way the former Mirrorball champion scored the contestants. 

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

Burke appeared alongside judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough, and Bruno Tonioli. She has been where the competitors and their professional dancers have been before, and she has even won the Mirrorball Trophy early in her career: in Season 2 alongside Drew Lachey and in Season 3 with former NFL player Emmitt Smith. 

Fans may have expected Burke to go easier on the celebrities because she could relate to them. Although her return to the ballroom was initially celebrated, Burke quickly became known for her strict scoring. After the performances, many fans expressed how they felt she underscored celebrities on the night. 

The biggest issue? Alix Earle's incredible Tango to “bury a friend” by Billie Eilish. Earle wowed alongside partner Val Chmerkovskiy and scored a near-perfect score of 39 out of 40. It would have been a perfect score had Burke not given her a 9. Fans flooded the official “Dancing with the Stars” Instagram page with their thoughts on Burke's judging. 

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

Fans have flooded social media with their thoughts. “Last time i checked you are supposed to judge for the performance not the choreography…” a fan wrote. Other reactions include, “Cheryl are you kidding, Cheryl whyyyyyyyy,” and “THIS DESERVED A PERFECT SCORE.”

But there have also been some fans who have come to Burke's defense and they feel her scores were fair. “Everyone mad at cheryl for ruining the perfect score but they broke hold so therefore it wasn't a perfect dance… it was a really good dance but by the literal standards cheryl mentioned it's not perfect,” a fan shared.

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

Fans were also upset with Burke's scoring of Robert Irwin and professional partner Witney Carson. “Cheryl criticizes everyone! Robert nailed it!” a comment reads.

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

On a post of Dylan Efron and pro partner Daniella Karagach's Viennese Waltz to “Can't Help Falling In Love (DARK)” by Tommee Profitt and Brooke, fans commented on Instagram about how they felt Burke's scoring was off. “Okay cheryl is DONE after that 8,” a comment reads. “Cheryl…… whose idea was it for her to guest judge,” another upset fan wrote.

Fans think “Dancing With the Stars” contestant Robert Irwin might have found love off the dance floor. The 21-year-old wildlife conservationist has sparked dating rumors with DWTS troupe member Hailey Bills, 19, and the internet can't stop talking about it. Speculation first began swirling in late October, but it reached new heights after a playful TikTok featuring Irwin and Bills went viral on October 27, sending fans into a frenzy over their chemistry.

In a TikTok posted by troupe member Carter Williams, Robert Irwin appears alongside several DWTS cast members, including Onye Stevenson and Jaxon Willard. “Our newest troupie?! Squad goals fr,” Williams captioned the video, and it didn't take long for fans to flood the comments with excitement.

“Robert is definitely dating someone from the cast,” one fan speculated, while another wrote, “Totally shipping this duo!” A third added, “They're super cute together!”

Still, not everyone was convinced romance was brewing. Some viewers simply enjoyed seeing Irwin's fun personality shine through, praising his smooth dance moves and easygoing charm.

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

While fans continue to buzz about his rumored romance, Robert Irwin seems focused on perfecting his ballroom skills. Dancing alongside pro partner Witney Carson, the Australian star has steadily impressed the judges with his progress each week.

The pair has remained top contenders throughout Season 34, earning high scores and praise for their strong connection and lively performances. Many fans believe they're on track to reach the finals.

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

Irwin and Carson are set to take on “Halloween Night” this Tuesday, Oct. 28, performing an Argentine Tango to a string version of the 1983 hit “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” by The Hampton String Quartet.

ABC teased the routine with a dramatic photo of the pair rehearsing under red lighting and flickering candles. Irwin joked in the comments, “The brief was to look scary/ominous here. Kinda missed the mark.”

Robert's Mom, Terri, is melting hearts this Halloween with a touching post dedicated to her son, Robert Irwin, ahead of his next “Dancing With the Stars” performance. The wildlife conservationist shared a set of nostalgic photos showing a young Robert dressed as Peter Pan, celebrating both his childhood and his growing confidence in the ballroom.

A post shared by Terri Irwin (@terriirwincrikey)

“Halloween night is next @dancingwiththestars. I can't wait to see Robert dance the Argentine Tango with Witney. But I do kinda miss my little trick-or-treater!” Terri, 61, captioned the post.

Whether it's his dance floor charm or rumored romance, one thing's clear: fans can't get enough of Robert Irwin this season.

The superstar isn't ready to concede defeat after a judge dismissed his lawsuit against UMG over diss track lyrics that labeled him a "certified pedophile."


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	It ain't over yet: Drake has formally launched his appeal of a court ruling that dismissed his defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's diss track “Not Like Us.”


	The move on Wednesday is the first step aimed at reversing that ruling, in which a federal judge ruled earlier this month that Drake could not sue over Kendrick's lyrics that called him a “certified pedophile.” The star's lawyers, who say millions of fans took that claim literally, had already vowed to appeal the decision.


	It could take well over a year for the appeals court to rule on Drake's case, prolonging a messy legal drama that has captivated the music industry and, at times, drawn ridicule in the hip-hop world. If the appeals court sides with Drake, it could mean years more litigation after that.


	In his new court filing, Drake formally stated his intention to appeal, but did not include any detailed arguments on how he will do so. Such arguments are made in later briefs at the appeals court, where lawyers for both sides will eventually make their case.


	A rep for Drake told Billboard on Wednesday: “This confirms our intent to appeal, and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing that filing in the coming weeks.” A spokesman for UMG did not immediately return a request for comment.


	Lamar released “Not Like Us” in May 2024 amid a war of words with Drake that saw the two UMG stars release a series of bruising diss tracks. The song, a knockout punch that blasted Drake as a “certified pedophile” over an infectious beat, became a chart-topping hit in its own right and won five Grammy Awards, including record and song of the year.


	In January, Drake took UMG to court over the song, claiming his own label had defamed him by boosting its popularity. The lawsuit, which didn't name Lamar himself as a defendant, alleged that UMG “waged a campaign” against its own artist to spread a “malicious narrative” about pedophilia that it knew to be false.


	Those claims stunned the music industry. Few expected a rapper to respond to a diss track with a lawsuit — a move that drew hackles in the hip-hop world and condemnation from legal scholars. Fewer still expected him to file it against UMG, his longtime record label and the biggest music company in the world.


	Just 10 months after Drake filed it, Judge Jeannette Vargas dismissed the case. She said Kendrick's insulting lyrics were the kind of hyperbolic opinions that cannot be defamatory because listeners would not think they were statements of fact. She said fans didn't expect to hear “accurate factual reporting” from a diss track “replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language.”


	“The artists' seven-track rap battle was a ‘war of words' that was the subject of substantial media scrutiny and online discourse,” Judge Vargas wrote. “Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff.”


	On appeal, Drake's lawyers will likely revive their core argument: That many fans did, in fact, take those lyrics seriously. In earlier court filings, they said that “millions of people, all over the world, did understand the [song] as a factual assertion that plaintiff is a pedophile.” They've said the song implied that such hideous allegations were based on “undisclosed evidence” about Drake's wrongdoing, and that the “audience understood as much.”


	Drake's attorneys will argue not only that Judge Vargas got it wrong, but also that she simply ruled prematurely. They'll likely say that the case was legally plausible enough to survive into longer term litigation, and that by dismissing it at the outset, she unfairly deprived them of a chance to prove those allegations with hard evidence.


	If the appeals court sides with those arguments, it will revive the case and send it back to Judge Vargas for more discovery into Drake's allegations and potentially toward a jury trial.

When Quentin Tarantino‘s “Pulp Fiction” exploded onto the world's movie screens in 1994, it became immediately and ubiquitously influential, inspiring dozens of similarly pitched cocktails of black comedy and violent crime: “2 Days in the Valley,” “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,” and “Love and a .45” are just a few obvious examples. 

None of these movies, even the good ones, came close to equaling the entertainment value or literary qualities of Tarantino‘s masterpiece, but their proliferation had a weird side effect: keeping critics and audiences from recognizing and appreciating the handful of post-“Pulp Fiction” crime films that actually were great.

In the years following “Pulp Fiction,” a kind of cinematic Gresham's Law set in, where there were so many movies featuring guys with guns on their posters that they became indistinguishable from one another. By the fall of 1997, when writer/director Jim Kouf‘s “Gang Related” came out, it was not only difficult to distinguish the film from the myriad other crime movies flooding the marketplace, it was difficult to distinguish it from other Tupac Shakur vehicles — the rapper was so prolific that “Gang Related” was his third posthumously released movie to come out in the year following his murder.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Gang Related” was the last Shakur performance to make it to the screen, and one of the last gasps of several 1990s subgenres. Not only was it guilty by association with all the post-“Pulp Fiction” Tarantino knockoffs; it also intersected with the 1990s explosion of “hood” movies that came in the wake of John Singleton's “Boyz N the Hood” and The Hughes Brothers' “Menace II Society,” and played as a kind of dark inversion of the buddy cop movies that had been dominant since “Lethal Weapon” in 1987.

A late entry in several traditions that audiences, and especially critics, had by this point had their fill of, “Gang Related” debuted to minimal business and mixed reviews. Yet sometimes the late movies in a cycle can be among the best, because they're the ones most interested in and capable of truly examining, critiquing, and reinventing the cycle's conventions — “Risky Business” appearing several years into the wave of “Porky's”-inspired teen sex comedies is perhaps the most obvious example. (Spike Lee's own hood movie, “Clockers,” is another.) “Gang Related” is a case in point, and 28 years after its release, the virtues we took for granted then seem both obvious and vital.

“Gang Related” follows two cops (Shakur and a delightfully scuzzy James Belushi) who have figured out a great racket: They steal drugs from LAPD storage, sell them on the street, then murder the buyers, taking the money and returning the reacquired drugs to the evidence lock-up. When they inadvertently kill an undercover DEA agent, all hell breaks loose, as a massive federal investigation begins and the corrupt buddies — who have been placed in charge of the investigation, thus ironically assigned to hunt themselves — have to find somebody to pin the murder on before it can get traced back to them.

 










This is the premise of “Gang Related,” but not the story. That's because, as was so often the case with film noir movies of the 1940s — another tradition to which “Gang Related” owes a considerable debt — “Gang Related” doesn't just establish a concept but tells a story that keeps unfolding from beginning to end. The synopsis above only covers the first 20 minutes or so of the movie; after that, Kouf keeps throwing twist after twist into the mix, constantly drawing the viewer in with developments that are both emotionally impactful and thematically rich.

Without revealing any of those developments, since Kouf's ability to keep the audience guessing is one of the film's greatest pleasures, I'll just say that each of them builds on what came before to create a textured, complex, and chilling portrait of institutional corruption — Belushi and Shakur may be the bad guys, but their behavior is seen less as an aberration than an organic outgrowth of both the lingering culture of a post-Daryl Gates, post-Rodney King LAPD and a society that values the pursuit of money above nearly everything else. 

Kouf's screenplay constantly pokes and prods at questions related to crime and consequences — unsurprisingly, the consequences tend to shift depending on the wealth and power of the characters — and his satirical commentary on class and politics grows in potency, power, and insight as the film progresses. The fascinating thing about Kouf's scathing assault on the status quo is that he delivers it via a formula previously used primarily to protect it: the buddy cop movie.

 










Richard Donner's “Lethal Weapon” movies, the last of which arrived in theaters less than a year after “Gang Related,” represent the genre distilled to its purest form, depicting a pair of cops (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover) operating without regard for the law in an end-justifies-the-means series of comic adventures where a great deal of the entertainment value comes from the total lack of guardrails on the police. Like Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry Callahan, Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs is appealing not in spite of his unrestrained violence but because of it — since most of us constantly find ourselves powerless in daily life, it's fun to relate to a character who has nothing but power and exercises it without restriction and without reflection.

While the “Dirty Harry” movies (particularly the one Eastwood directed himself, “Sudden Impact”) traffic in a certain amount of moral complexity and ambiguity, the “Lethal Weapon” films strip the formula down to its primal essence, to the point that they became not just apologies for but celebrations of police violence and civil rights violations — as Jonathan Rosenbaum pointed out in his review of “Lethal Weapon 3,” a movie that, astonishingly, rode to box office supremacy only a year after the Rodney King beating, the movie could just as accurately have been titled “How to Have Fun in a Police State.”

 










“Gang Related” uses aspects of the “Lethal Weapon” formula as a template, but veers closer to “Dirty Harry” territory — and then goes beyond it — by depicting its buddies as morally vacant sharks, in constant motion with no other purpose than self-protection and the accumulation of some extra cash. Kouf gets extra mileage out of his actors by casting against type; seeing comic everyman Belushi as a nihilistic fascist and anti-cop rapper Tupac Shakur as a policeman (albeit one who's more of a criminal than the criminals he's supposed to be arresting) gives the whole movie an added sense of electric energy.

Much as “Gang Related” is an aberration in the buddy cop genre, it's also a bit of an aberration in Kouf's career — not that he was the kind of writer or director who was ever limited to one type of film. The main thing his best movies have in common isn't genre but that they're transcendent examples of their genre — as is the case with “Gang Related,” Kouf is rarely the first filmmaker to do whatever he's doing, but he's often one of the best. 

In the early 1980s, Kouf wrote a series of teen-oriented comedies that contained far more wit and energy than most of their brethren — the now nearly forgotten “Up the Creek,” about a college river raft race, consists of pretty much wall-to-wall laughs, and the 1985 “Secret Admirer” plays like an Ernst Lubitsch roundelay for high schoolers. Among his other credits, ironically, are a pair of John Badham buddy cop movies — “Stakeout” and “Another Stakeout” — that deliver the more traditional satisfactions of the genre.

 










“Stakeout” in particular is a flawlessly engineered entertainment machine, a structural marvel of action, comedy, and romance that's a perfect example of its ilk. And a year after “Gang Related,” Kouf returned to the buddy movie with another supremely effective entry — one of the last — in the genre's classic form, the Jackie Chan-Chris Tucker vehicle “Rush Hour.”

The fact that Kouf is so good at writing buddy movies in the traditional manner is key to why “Gang Related” is so effective — it's like when Robert Altman made “McCabe and Mrs. Miller” after spending decades directing TV Westerns like “Bonanza” and “Maverick.” Kouf knows the genre's conventions inside and out; he knows what works and why, and he knows how to twist the clichés into something real and potent. Kouf is as solid a Hollywood craftsman as anyone in the business (he was one of the writers on “National Treasure,” one of the more satisfying and clever entertainments of Jerry Bruckheimer's 2000s output), but there's something extra fun about seeing him apply his talents to a piece of work as dark, nasty, and trenchant as “Gang Related.”

While the virtues of “Gang Related” may have been less apparent when it got lost in the shuffle of 1990s genre films, now that those kinds of movies are theatrically released with far less frequency, it's hard to see how its greatness could ever have been ignored. A new Blu-ray from boutique label Cinématographe is finally giving “Gang Related” a worthy physical media release, with a pristine new 4K restoration from the original camera negative and hours of extra features; there's also a beautiful accompanying booklet with terrific essays by Quatoyiah Murry, Brandon Streussnig, and modern noir expert Travis Woods.

 










It's not only one of the best Blu-rays of 2025, but a reminder that time is the ultimate critic — and that “Gang Related” has not only passed and stood the test of time but gets better with every passing year.  

“Gang Related” is currently available on Blu-ray from Cinématographe.

It's an unsettling week over at Paramount. The company has announced upwards of 2,000 imminent layoffs, veteran newscasters are leaving amid Bari Weiss' takeover of CBS News, and the P+ golden boy Taylor Sheridan has jumped ship for NBCUniversal. There are a lot of reports flying around about what pushed Sheridan into the arms of a rival, but The Hollywood Reporter makes the case that the studio didn't actually try that hard to keep him. According to the outlet, while sources on both sides may disagree about the particulars, “all agree Paramount never actually made an offer to lock down Sheridan.”

Sheridan's decision to leave looks pretty simple in that light; one side offered a deal worth a whopping $1 billion, while the other didn't offer anything. Of course, Paramount did partner with Sheridan on a sprawling Texas studio, and new CEO David Ellison praised the creator publicly in the press. But Sheridan was reportedly already having problems with his home base studio before the Skydance merger brought Ellison's regime in. Paramount's film division had rejected his script Capture The Flag and meddled with his deal to make the movie F.A.S.T. at Warner Bros. (WB Discovery CEO David Zaslav reportedly also tried to woo Sheridan away from Paramount by visiting him in Texas and gifting him a pair of cowboy boots worn by James Dean, a hilarious detail in light of the fact that Sheridan went with NBCU instead. But Sheridan probably wouldn't want to hitch his wagon to a studio likely to be gobbled up by somebody else, especially by the very studio he's trying to leave.)

After the merger, Paramount got rid of most of Sheridan's closest contacts, including former president and CEO for Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks Chris McCarthy. While Ellison and a number of other execs did meet with Sheridan after the merger, it sounds like the Yellowstone mastermind requires a more personal touch. That's where NBCU's Donna Langley came in. She personally spent the summer coaxing Sheridan into a film deal by championing the studio's relationship with auteurs like Christopher Nolan, Jordan Peele, Chris Meledandri. Then Paramount rejected Sheridan's new series The Correspondent (about a war correspondent on the front lines of Afghanistan), and making television somewhere else started to look pretty attractive, too. 

This all culminates in a major loss for Paramount, as Taylor Sheridan's empire seemed to be singlehandedly keeping Paramount+ afloat. But the new regime is being pretty ruthless about cutting costs, and Sheridan's productions are notoriously expensive. It's said he doesn't like to have his budgets questioned, nor to get any notes back on his scripts, and the new overlords were doing both. And as is probably the case with most Hollywood standoffs, ego is also a factor. Sheridan was offended by the rejections from Paramount and by the fact that no one informed him Nicole Kidman had a new show at the network that would interfere with Lioness scheduling. On the other side, David Ellison has been working to launch a new era at the studio with big, buzzy talent deals, and didn't want to give Sheridan carte blanche for his. As one source put it to THR, “Ellison wants to run the show and he can't with Sheridan there.”

All told through a list of every wonderful, beautiful, and delightful thing—big, small, and everything in between—that makes life worth living.

	“Every Brilliant Thing tackles some serious subject matter, but the overall experience is one of joy and celebration,” said Macmillan. “Every performance is unique and unpredictable and it requires virtuosic skill from its central performer. When Daniel told us how much he loved the play, I couldn't have been more thrilled. He has the intelligence, quick-wit and charm to roll with the spontaneous moments that the show invites – he can be a clown one moment, then grab you by the heartstrings the next. He has huge depth and humanity. I can't wait to get started.”

I really like Mr. Radcliffe, and I think he's a brilliant actor. This is a terrible idea. The interplay between audience and the actor is what makes the show such an incredible feat. I'm afraid that audience members will be mesmerized that it's Daniel Radcliffe talking to them, and not the character from the play. And, worse yet, they'll want to impress in a way that will take the spontaneity and joy out of those moments in the piece. This play worked originally because no one knew Jonny Donahoe; he was just a regular guy telling a story (that many believed was his). Stunt casting a piece like this runs counter to the heart of the play.

This week, Aesop Rock quietly shared a new album called I Heard It's a Mess There Too. The quick follow-up to May's Black Hole Superette is now widely available across digital streaming platforms, via Rhymesayers. Listen to the 12-song album below, and watch a video for “Full House Pinball,” directed by  Justin “Coro” Kaufman.

Aesop Rock says in a press release, “The phrase ‘I Heard It's a Mess There Too' started as a lyric, but it got its hooks in me soon after. It felt familiar, like something I'd said a thousand times while checking in with friends across different cities. The more I sat with it, the more it started to feel like the center of this project... It's about observation and communication. Sonically, I wanted a reset—cleaner beats, more space, fewer layers. Just enough to get a wave rolling and not much more.”

	When Jamey Johnson released his latest album, Midnight Gasoline, last year, it marked his first LP of new material in 14 years. Country fans were perplexed as to why Johnson, revered for his commitment to traditional country, had gone mostly dark in the studio during that time. In a new interview with Rolling Stone's Nashville Now podcast, the Alabama native offers some insight: The dry spell mostly stemmed from a devastating fall and head injury that Johnson suffered outside the studio on Nashville's Music Row a decade and a half ago.


	“Everything was moving right along until about 2010,” Johnson tells Nashville Now. “It was a concussion I got slipping on some ice in the parking lot at the studio. That kind of turned everything upstairs into fight or flight. And it was stuck there for the longest time.”

A post shared by Rolling Stone Nashville Now (@rollingstonecountry)


	Johnson says the concussion affected his ability to concentrate and even altered his personality that year, which dovetailed with the release of his 2010 double album, The Guitar Song.

	“Everything in me was fight or flight… It felt like a lot of anger. A lot of frustration. I went from being able to process information at a pretty good pace to getting confused,” he says.


	Johnson says he didn't stop writing songs completely, but that his output was diminished. “I just didn't write enough that would warrant an album,” he says, explaining that what songs he did come up with, he'd offer to friends. “I'd send [them] to Willie, or George Strait, or Merle.”

	











	According to Johnson, who's now sober from alcohol, he was also drinking heavily after the fall. “That's right about the time I started [to get] blackout drunk. And it took me a while to heal up. Finally, in 2011, I quit drinking,” he says.


	In hindsight, Johnson says the fall was more severe than he first believed. “That thing did a lot more damage than I thought it had done at the time,” he says. “Looking back, it's so evident to me now, that's the point where the rock hit the water — the asphalt hit my head.”

Katy Perry is getting blasted online for destroying her 40th birthday cake, which her backup dancers ended up eating off the floor.

The pop star celebrated the milestone backstage following a recent stop on her ongoing Lifetimes Tour.

Still dressed in costume from the show, Perry was filmed surrounded by her crew members as she blew out the candles on a large sheet cake.

She then picked up the cake and tried to chuck it at a suit-clad man wearing a headset, but she missed, and it ended up on the floor.

The singer laughed as a few of her dancers approached the demolished dessert, bent down and scooped up some bites to try.

A “genuinely confused and upset” X user, who claims — perhaps somewhat sarcastically — that her mother baked the cake, posted the video and criticized Perry for her behavior.

“my mom was the one that baked this cake, she was so excited about the opportunity to make a cake for Katy Perry and spent so long on it, im genuinely confused and upset as to why she would do this,” the X user shared, prompting furious fans to weigh in.

“I wonder what having that mindset is like, to just throw away a whole cake everyone could've enjoyed… and then leaving that mess on the floor for someone else to clean up cause I know damn well she ain't pick up no broom and mop after lol,” one critic replied.

Someone else echoed those sentiments, writing, “the craziest craziest part is that someone else is gonna clean that s–t up.”

Another netizen noted, “Never understand why people throw or push people's faces into them, such a waste 😞,” while a fourth observed, “lowk[ey] feel bad for her crew cause they looked excited for some cake.”

According to one person, “Katy can't do anything without being cringe AF.”

However, a few defenders argued that “she paid for it and she can do whatever the f–k she wants with it.”

Someone else pointed out that “sometimes celebrities accept cakes [from fans] but ruin them to avoid possible poisoning. The decent ones try to stage it as an accident though.”

Reps for Perry did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

She's on the bleachers — but staying under the radar.

Taylor Swift is reportedly keeping a low profile at her fiancé Travis Kelce's NFL games because of security concerns.

The pop star, 35, “has wanted to feel much more protected this year with her security, especially with her current stalker issues,” according to the Daily Mail.

A source told the outlet on Tuesday that the singer “doesn't want her whereabouts known every minute of the day” because “she wants to be safe, and she wants her family and friends to be safe.”

Additionally, Kelce was not “having the best season the first few weeks.”

With all this in mind, Swift has reportedly made “a little more natural progression” toward being “less out there and attracting attention,” the insider claimed.

However, the Grammy winner allegedly hasn't “asked the NFL and the various networks to stop showing her on TV during any of the Chiefs games.”

In fact, she was caught on camera swooning when Kelce, 36, made a major play at Monday's Kansas City Chiefs versus Washington Commanders game.

The athlete went on to score his 100th career touchdown, marking a milestone only reached by four tight ends in history.

He busted out Swift's dance moves from the “Fate of Ophelia” music video to celebrate.

Swift cheered with Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany Mahomes, and the season will continue to play out “on case-by-case situation depending how” her partner does, the Daily Mail claimed.

“There is always a camera in her direction, it's just not as big a thing this year as in years past,” the source noted.

Advertisement

“We will continue to see her from time to time as she knows that everyone knows she is there anyway.”

Swift's rep did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

The songwriter, notably, has not been photographed walking into an Arrowhead Stadium game all season — and even snuck in from behind a screen on one occasion.

Swifties have seen glimpses of her outfits in fan videos or in footage from post-game celebrations.

Swift has been dating Kelce and attending his games since 2023, with the three-time Super Bowl winner proposing to her in August.

We hear the duo will tie the knot in Rhode Island next summer.

Not if Alex Warren, sombr & Leon Thomas have anything to say about it.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	For months, it looked like the Grammy race for best new artist was likely to come down to Alex Warren and sombr. But a couple of things happened in the past few weeks to make the race more competitive – Olivia Dean exploded with a top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100 (“Man I Need”) and a top 10 album on the Billboard 200 (The Art of Loving). And the Recording Academy ruled Leon Thomas eligible, even though he won a Grammy three years ago for co-writing SZA's “Snooze.” Now, we have a real race.


	With the nominations set to be announced next Friday (Nov. 7), all four of these artists certain to be nominated for best new artist, along with Lola Young. After that, it gets harder to choose, but the field will be rounded out with three other nominees, culled from a list of 337 eligible names.


	Final-round voting begins Dec. 12 and extends to Jan. 5. So Dean has about six weeks for her profile to continue building before the first votes are cast.


	If Dean (or Young) winds up winning, this will be the ninth year in a row that a solo woman has been named best new artist. The streak started in 2018 with Alessia Cara and has continued with Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Megan Thee Stallion, Olivia Rodrigo, Samara Joy, Victoria Monét and Chappell Roan.


	If Warren, somber or Thomas takes the prize, they'd be the first male artist to win since Chance the Rapper in 2017.


The Marías, which span multiple genres and languages, also have a good chance of being nominated. If they were to win, they'd be the first group (defined as an act with three or more members) to take the prize since fun. in 2013. Three other groups are seen as having a reasonably good shot at a nod: Sleep Token, KATSEYE and The Red Clay Strays.


	Some of the top contenders have already won new artist prizes at other shows. Warren won best new artist at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sept. 7. Thomas won best new artist at the BET Awards on June 9. Zach Top, Ella Langley and The Red Clay Strays won the new male, female, and duo/group prizes at the Academy of Country Music Awards on May 8. Myles Smith won the rising star award at the Brit Awards on March 1.


	Even some acts that won new artist awards in 2024 are eligible. Megan Moroney won new artist of the year at the 2024 Country Music Association Awards and new female artist of the year at the 2024 Academy of Country Music Awards. The Red Clay Strays won emerging artist of the year at the 2024 Americana Music Honors & Awards.


	(The Grammys in recent years have erred on the side of being inclusive in this category. In previous eras, they almost seemed to be looking for nitpicky reasons to kick artists out – just ask the people around Whitney Houston and Richard Marx who are probably still smarting over their exclusions.)


	BigXthaPlug and Bailey Zimmerman, who collaborated on the top five Hot 100 hit “All the Way,” are competing against each other here. Sleep Token and Ken Carson, who both landed No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, are eligible. So is Role Model, who made a vivid impression late in the eligibility year with his irresistible breakthrough hit “Sally, When the Wine Runs Out.”


	Other strong contenders, not already mentioned, include Ravyn Lenae, Mariah the Scientist, Addison Rae, Jessie Murph, Gigi Perez, Riley Green, October London, Sam Fender, Reneé Rapp, PinkPantheress, Tucker Wetmore, ATEEZ, Central Cee, Lil Tecca, Parker McCollum and Keke Palmer.


	The eligibility period for the 68th Grammy Awards is Aug. 31, 2024, through Aug. 30, 2025. While the Grammys set a minimum number of releases an artist must have to qualify in this category (five singles/tracks or one album), there is no maximum. Instead, the Grammys' rules and guidelines booklet says nominations for the honor hinge on when “the artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence” — and it delegates that determination to a screening committee.


	Artists are allowed to appear on the entry list for best new artist three times, after which they are ruled ineligible for future consideration.


	Here are the eight leading nominees for best new artist. The artists are shown in alphabetical order, which is how they'll be listed on the Grammy nominees list.


Her stats: Her sophomore album, The Art of Loving, has climbed as high as No. 6 on the Billboard 200. Her breakout hit, “Man I Need,” has reached No. 8 on the Hot 100. The single was eligible for record of the year but wasn't entered. (Oops.) The album was released after the eligibility cut-off, but it will be eligible for album of the year at the 2027 ceremony.


If she wins: She'll be the first artist from England to win since Dua Lipa in 2019. She'd also become the second artist named Olivia to win, following Olivia Rodrigo.


Her stats: Her second studio album Bird's Eye reached No. 139 on the Billboard 200. Her breakout single, “Love Me Not,” reached No. 5 on the Hot 100. “Love Me Not” was released in May 2024, but it's eligible for record of the year this year. Go figure.


If she wins: Lenae, rather than Dean, will keep the winning streak alive for women artists in this category.


Their stats: Their second studio album, Submarine, debuted and peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard 200. Their breakout hit, “No One Noticed,” reached No. 22 on the Hot 100. Both album and single were released in the previous eligibility year, so they're not eligible this year. (There's more flexibility in this category for acts that needed a little more time to break through.)


If they win: They would be the first group to win since fun. in 2013; the first female-fronted group to win since Evanescence (fronted by Amy Lee) in 2004. The Marías consists of lead vocalist María Zardoya, drummer/producer Josh Conway, guitarist Jesse Perlman, and keyboardist Edward James.


	The Marías were nominated for album of the year three years ago as featured artists on Bad Bunny's Un Verano Sin Ti. They owe their eligibility in this category to a rule change this year that allows artists with previous album of the year nominations to compete for best new artist if they appeared on 20 percent or less of the album's playing time.


His stats: His debut album, I Barely Know Her, has climbed as high as No. 10 on the Billboard 200. He has had a pair of top 20 hits on the Hot 100, “Back to Friends” and “Undressed.” The hits were concurrent, so sombr neatly sidestepped the one-hit-wonder worry that has bedeviled newcomers since the dawn of record-making. sombr's impressive songwriting earned a shout-out from Taylor Swift, who was nominated for best new artist 18 years ago. (She lost to Amy Winehouse.) Sombr's camp entered “Back to Friends” and not “Undressed” for record and song of the year. Sombr may be new to the game, but he knows enough not to risk splitting your votes at awards shows.


If he wins: At 20, he would be the youngest winner since Olivia Rodrigo, who was just 18 when she won in 2023. He'd be the youngest male artist ever to win. (Just by being nominated, he would be the youngest male nominee since Khalid, who was 19 when he was nominated at the 2018 ceremony.)


His stats: His second studio album, Mutt, reached No. 35 on the Billboard 200. The title track, an old-school soul ballad in all its 1970s-evoking glory, has climbed as high as No. 10 on the Hot 100. “Mutt” was released in the previous eligibility year, so it isn't eligible for record of the year, but an alternate take, “Mutt (Live From NPR's Tiny Desk),” is entered.


	At 32, Thomas is the oldest of this year's top contenders for best new artist, though several other artists with a reasonably good chance of a nod have passed The Big 3-0. They include Sam Fender, 31; Riley Green, 37; and October London, 39.


If he wins: He'll be the first person who has already won a Grammy to win best new artist since Lauryn Hill in 1999. As noted above, Thomas won best R&B song three years ago for co-writing SZA's “Snooze.” He was allowed to compete here this year because this was his breakthrough as an artist. Hill was allowed to compete for best new artist even though she had won two Grammys two years earlier as a member of Fugees. (Current rules wouldn't allow that.)


His stats: His second studio album, Ain't in It for My Health, debuted and peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard 200, 20 notches higher than the peak position of his debut album, Cold Beer and Country Music. “I Never Lie,” from the first album, reached No. 24 on the Hot 100 (and is entered for record of the year).


If he wins: He'll be the first country artist to win since Zac Brown Band in 2010; the first male solo country artist ever to win.


His stats: His debut album, You'll Be Alright, Kid, has reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200. “Ordinary” logged 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100. A follow-up, “Eternity,” reached No. 16.


If he wins: He'd be the second best new artist winner whose breakout year included a 10-week No. 1 smash. Debby Boone was the first with her 1977 megahit “You Light Up My Life.” (Interestingly, both are quasi-religious power ballads.) “Ordinary” was Billboard's Song of the Summer, even though most agreed it wasn't very summery. Warren is vying to become the fourth Song of the Summer champ to go on to win the Grammy for best new artist, following Carpenters, Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera. (Their song of the summer winners, as you surely know, were “(They Long to Be) Close to You,” “Vision of Love” and “Genie in a Bottle,” respectively.)


Her stats: Her third album, I'm Only F**king Myself, debuted and peaked at No. 68 on the Billboard 200. Her breakout hit, “Messy,” reached No. 14 on the Hot 100. Tyler, The Creator's “Like Him,” on which she was featured, reached No. 29. “Messy” was released in the previous eligibility year, but it's entered for record of the year nonetheless.


If she wins: She, rather than Dean, will become the first artist from England to win since Dua Lipa in 2019.

A
bout 10 miles west of the Green Mountains, in North Bennington, Vermont, stands a 155-year-old white farmhouse converted to a two-family home. While perhaps unremarkable from the front, it may be recognizable to visitors by the gray wooden arrow stuck in a bed of mulch outside, promising LOVE THIS WAY, or the giggles emanating from the backyard as an excited four-year-old named Jack tumbles down a plastic yellow slide toward his dad.


	On a balmy day in mid-July, the blond, curly-haired Jack shows no sign of the child who, just a few months earlier, contracted a viral infection so unforgiving his parents feared for his life. 


	At the time, Jack and his parents, James and Rosie — 36 and 35, respectively — had no health insurance. (The couple requested the use of pseudonyms, including for their child, fearing retaliation for speaking to the press.) After James was forced out of his hybrid-style federal position as an environmental compliance officer by President Trump's Return to In-Person Work executive order in January, the family had been dropped from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program rolls. 

	











	Not long after their son, Rosie and James both contracted the same infection, leaving the family immobilized and their half-duplex quiet, save for the sounds of Jack's hacking cough.

	“He was so tired that he was barely moving,” says Rosie, “and [without insurance] there was this internal struggle of, as a mother, I shouldn't have to be weighing the financial cost of [treating] my son with my son's health. But instead, it was like, ‘If we take him to the emergency room, it's going to cost us this much out of pocket, so maybe we'll just wait another day.' It was terrifying.” 

	











	On day five of Jack's fever, the couple decided they had no choice but to bring him to an urgent care clinic. “Right off the bat, they said that without insurance it would be [about] 100 bucks, and any testing or anything beyond [a simple checkup] would be additional,” Rosie recounts. “So we didn't run any tests.”

	Thankfully, Jack — and, later, Rosie and James — got better without complications. And all three were subsequently approved for Medicaid coverage. But, with the July 4 passage of the president's so-called Big Beautiful reconciliation bill and its $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, the family found themselves once again bracing for the worst. 


	The couple still had several sources of income: They rent out the other side of the farmhouse duplex, run a resale shop selling various trinkets they've collected, and Rosie works as a local yoga teacher. But James was still out of work, scrambling in a state that currently has its lowest number of job openings since November 2020, and the family's emergency cushion had all but disappeared. 


	“The idea of [losing Medicaid and] having to face what we did again,” James said at the time, his voice trailing off, “I'm not sure what we're going to be able to do at that point.”


	A SPRAWLING, 870-PAGE document, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) touches practically every aspect of American life. But perhaps most significant are the myriad changes it makes to Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Some of these changes — such as the expanded SNAP work requirements, which took effect Oct. 1 — have already been implemented. Others — like the Medicaid work requirements, pointedly delayed until after the congressional midterm elections — are set to go into effect on a rolling basis over the next three years. Taken together, they amount to the largest cuts the three programs have ever received.

	Vermont depends tremendously on this federal aid. The sixth-smallest and second-least populous state in the union, with a population of just below 650,000, it has the largest rural population (nearly 70 percent) of all U.S. states. Amid its beautiful mountain ranges, winding valleyland, and small-town charm, its upscale ski resorts and slew of seasonal second-home owners, the state is facing simultaneous housing, hunger, and health care crises. And though it is a progressive stronghold where legislators have long fought to secure social safety nets for its residents, the Trump administration's cuts position it at a dangerous crossroads. 

	











	Forty-three percent of all federal funding sent to Vermont, for example, is for Medicaid, and about one in 10 Vermonters receives SNAP benefits. And thanks to Medicaid (which the state chose to expand in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act) and the subsidized ACA health insurance marketplace, Vermont has a remarkably low uninsured rate: Currently, only 3.4 percent of Vermonters, as opposed to the national average of 7.9 percent, lack coverage. But what will happen to Vermont and its people when the OBBB tears apart the federal aid programs they depend on? 


	“We're a state that really prides ourselves on providing insurance to a large percentage [of people] compared to other states, and providing a lot of care for folks that need it,” Andrew Perchlik, a Vermont state senator and chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, says. “The concern is that there's just not enough money in Vermont to make up the kind of loss this bill entails. And if we can't make up these losses, we will have to cut services. And that will be devastating.”


	Sen. Bernie Sanders agrees. “In Vermont, we are a state of many hardworking people, many working-class people, and many low-income people. And as a result of this bill, Vermonters are really going to suffer,” Sanders tells Rolling Stone. “People are going to become much sicker than they should, and in some cases die, simply because they will not be able to afford to go to a doctor when they should.”


	IN NORTH BENNINGTON, Jack sprints into the room to show me his favorite monster-truck toy, a gray and orange ThunderROARus, which, true to its name, has the teeth and scales of a triceratops. “I want to be a paleontologist when I grow up,” he tells me shyly as his parents, sitting next to each other on a gray couch, look on from across the room. 


	James and Rosie, who grew up on opposite ends of New Jersey and both received environmental degrees in college, met while working for the federal government. After living together in Oregon for some years, in 2020, they decided to settle down in Vermont. James, still working for the same federal agency, transitioned to a hybrid role as the pandemic subsided, commuting to Cambridge, Massachusetts, twice weekly to comply with the Biden administration's in-office requirements for federal workers. Each in-person workday meant an eight-hour roundtrip, but it was worth it to James, who felt deeply fulfilled by the work. 

	











	But when the Trump administration barred telework as an option for people like him, the situation became untenable. “I would have to be waking up at 3 a.m. in order to get out of the house at four and then not getting back home until around 10 o'clock at night, just to do it again the next day,” says James. “What human is expected to put 40 hours a week into commuting?” asks Rosie. “Especially with a young kid?” Unwilling to uproot his family for the job, James felt he had no choice but to leave it, and the family lost their health insurance.


	With their Medicaid coverage subsequently hanging by a thread, James and Rosie felt like the government had dealt them a double blow. “As an American, I grew up believing that the government was there for the people. That all people should be entitled to health care,” says Rosie. “And now, to cut the programming that literally supports lives … It blows my mind to think that it's even a possibility for a country to do that.”


	After spending nearly five months unemployed, James recently secured a job with a Vermont municipality's zoning division, lifting the family above the threshold for Medicaid. But before then, the couple's income had fallen below the poverty level — less than $26,650 a year, barely 20 percent of the median income for a Vermont family of three — and they had been “getting pretty desperate to use SNAP,” as Rosie put it in July. Yet with the $187 billion that the budget bill tears from the program, they feared that, as with their Medicaid coverage, they would be left empty-handed. “It feels like we're chasing after a program,” Rosie said at the time, “that might support us for a month and then be gone.” 


	ABOUT 45,000 VERMONTERS are expected to lose health care coverage as a result of the budget bill's changes to Medicaid and the ACA marketplace. About 13,000, due to other changes, may lose SNAP benefits. Meanwhile, amid the federal government's recent shutdown, none of the roughly 65,000 Vermonters on SNAP will receive their November payments. 


	“We are going to face a hunger and health crisis and a tragedy on an unprecedented scale,” Anore Horton, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy organization Hunger Free Vermont, tells Rolling Stone. “I think it's going to make what happened during the pandemic look like child's play by comparison. Cutting these programs together is unquestionably going to kill people. There is no doubt about it.” 

	











	SNAP, which provides monthly payments in the form of an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card used to purchase food at authorized retailers, and Medicaid, which covers beneficiaries' medical services at little to no cost, have by and large received consistent bipartisan support since they were initiated with President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society legislation in the Sixties. Trump's new cuts, rather than blatantly pulling funds from the programs, take the form of a series of slippery technical changes to the way they are regulated and administered — in effect making the programs harder for people to access and even harder for states to maintain.


	“What's really tricky about the way that Congress is going about these cuts is that they're making it sound as if these are just little tweaks to specific groups of people,” says Horton. “But, in fact, the goal is very clearly to force state governments to have to destroy these programs. We're talking about the Trump administration and Congress setting out to destroy the ability of state governments to take care of people.”


	It's already difficult enough to access these federal subsidies. To apply for Medicaid or a Qualified Health Plan on the state marketplace, Vermonters must go through a labyrinthine process beginning with filling out a 20-page form or a parallel online portal to prove their income and eligibility. Applying for SNAP entails a similar protocol. 


	“The applications are very long and extensive,” says Horton. “They ask a lot of very detailed and intrusive questions about your assets, your utility and housing costs, everyone in your household, and many other specific pieces of information. There are very harsh, very complex requirements.”

“As an American, I grew up believing government was there for the people. To cut programming that literally supports lives … It blows my mind.”


	Under the federal budget bill, the process will become even more onerous. Medicaid beneficiaries will have to renew their eligibility twice annually, as opposed to the current single renewal, for example. Those on Qualified Health Plans will have only one and a half months, instead of two and a half, to select and enroll in their plan for the year, and will no longer be able to do so automatically. 


	Perhaps the most significant addition, however, is the work requirements the bill imposes: To receive Medicaid coverage, able-bodied individuals between the ages of 19 and 64 who do not have children will now have to prove they have completed at least 80 hours of work per month. And though SNAP recipients already comply with a similar work requirement, the bill expands the requirement significantly and eliminates numerous exemptions (such as one for homeless individuals, which more than 1,700 people in Vermont currently receive). 


	Congressional Republicans have touted these changes as necessary, no-nonsense steps to reduce fraud and abuse they claim are rampant in the programs and ensure that benefits only go to those who work for the assistance, rather than supporting so-called freeloaders. But precedent and experts say otherwise. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the error rate for Vermont's SNAP program was a mere 4.74 percent in 2024, while the error rate for Vermont's Medicaid program, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was just 5.6 percent over the three-year period between 2021, 2022, and 2023. According to an article by Andy Schneider, a research professor at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy, nationwide Department of Justice reports have found that actual fraud is essentially never committed by beneficiaries or the state.

	











	“The checks and balances are already extreme in these programs to make sure that only qualified people are receiving benefits,” says Horton. “The rhetoric of waste, fraud, and abuse [in SNAP or in Medicaid] is simply a way to justify [the GOP's] actual goal, which is to destroy these programs.”


	In 2023, 92 percent of Medicaid adults who will now be subject to work requirements were already working full- or part-time. A 2023 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis found that Medicaid work requirements would do nothing to increase employment. And study after study has found that work requirements (along with increased eligibility checks) cause individuals to lose coverage due simply to the paperwork burdens they present — not because individuals are actually ineligible. 


	“What work requirements really do is create a paperwork barrier,” says John Sayles, CEO of the Vermont Foodbank. “Say you're working for a landscaping company, and all you get is someone writing you a check every week. It can be really challenging to turn that into the documentation that the government's going to require for you to continue receiving the benefits that are essential to you and your family and to being able to show up to work.”


	“If you have multiple jobs, if you're self-employed, if you have issues with your computer, if you don't read your mail and understand that you have to respond to notices,” warns Marjorie Stinchcombe, an attorney who works as a helpline director with the Vermont Office of the Health Care Advocate, “it's not flexible.” 


	And Vermont's legislators and state agencies — tasked with building an entirely new technology system, conducting hundreds of thousands more eligibility checks, processing immense amounts of paperwork, and supporting thousands of confused and desperate beneficiaries — are also going to be overwhelmed, namely because Vermont faces not just increased administrative burdens, but also less money with which to meet them: The budget bill cracks down on how much states can tax providers like nursing facilities, hospitals, and ambulances, in effect allowing the federal government to strip the state of millions of dollars in Medicaid funds. The bill also changes the way SNAP is financed, reducing the share of administrative costs that the federal government covers from 50 percent to just 25 percent. As a result, the CBO has concluded that some states may be forced to “leave the program altogether.”

	











	As a preview of the damage, it has been estimated that, taken altogether, the bill's changes will undo about three-quarters of the Affordable Care Act's progress. And future effects aside, the bill already does serious harm to the programs: It limits Medicaid retroactive coverage (removing coverage, for example, for someone who signed up for the program only after experiencing a major health crisis); makes certain noncitizens (like refugees and asylees) ineligible for Medicaid, SNAP, and ACA subsidies; and requires states to charge certain Medicaid patients co-payments for medical services. 


	The bill also freezes updates to the Thrifty Food Plan, the mechanism used to increase SNAP benefit amounts proportional to actual food prices. “There will be no future increases to account for the cost of inflation,” says Horton. “So that means the value of people's SNAP benefits, or how much food your SNAP benefit can buy you, is going to be decreasing every single year from now into perpetuity.” And with President Trump's tariffs driving up food prices, this decrease is sure to be even steeper.

“If people are going hungry and we're not able to provide food, or people are sick and we're not able to provide health care, that's a moral failure.”


	The bill also lets die a large number of ACA marketplace subsidies — specifically, the enhanced premium tax credits created by President Joe Biden's 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. These tax credits, which have doubled national marketplace enrollment, are set to expire in December and have become the central issue of the federal government's shutdown. Without them, Americans' out-of-pocket share of ACA premiums, according to the nonpartisan health research group KFF, is expected to increase by more than 75 percent on average — an increase Vermonters cannot afford. 


	“In Vermont specifically, we've been such a leader in coverage,” Dr. DaShawn Groves, the commissioner for the Department of Vermont Health Access, which administers the state's Medicaid and ACA marketplace, says to Rolling Stone. “But trying to protect that … we just don't know yet. There are going to be difficult choices ahead.”


	The Vermont Legislature has set aside about $100 million in its budget (in addition to an $118 million “stabilization reserve” and a $100 million “Rainy Day Fund” that it can draw from) to cope with the budget bill's cuts. But: “These reserves are for short-term, onetime issues,” says state Sen. Perchlik. “They don't fill the hole.”

	











	Perchlik has come to the conclusion that other state-funded initiatives may have to be brought to the cutting board. “My fear is that it's going to create this domino effect throughout the whole budget,” he says. “What do you choose? Feeding people, providing medical care, or providing shelter? If people are going hungry and we're not able to provide food, or people are sick and we're not able to provide health care, that's a moral failure.”


	Sanders, who spent months fighting the budget bill's passage, stays awake at night now that it is law. “There's not a day or night that goes by where I do not deal with this stuff,” he tells Rolling Stone. “It's horrifying, the absolute immorality of what this administration is doing. They think that compassion, and caring about your fellow human beings, are signs of weakness. 


	“They wanted tax cuts, and that's what they got,” he continues. “And they couldn't care less about the people who are going to die and suffer as a result.”


	FOR 46-YEAR-OLD JANE, a resident of Southern Vermont, facing death is nothing new. Starting when she was two years old, the Lakeland, Florida, native was in and out of the hospital with frequent kidney infections. Jane would later learn she had two autoimmune conditions — Addison's disease, in which the adrenal glands don't produce enough of certain hormones, and lupus, in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues and organs. 


	In those pre-ACA years, insurance wouldn't cover extra tests or specialists for Jane, whose health issues were primarily preexisting, so she was unable to receive an instrumental corrective surgery when she should've. By age 16, she was diagnosed with Stage 5 kidney disease; her kidneys were failing. “If I had just had access to that care, to that surgery,” she says, “I would have never lost my kidneys. None of that would have ever happened.”


	When Jane turned 18, she was no longer covered under her parents' insurance and had racked up a million dollars in medical debt. She spent the next four years traveling the country, securing jobs that had “day-one insurance” and moving when she had capped out each plan's offerings. Like a traveling salesman, she lived everywhere: San Diego, New Orleans, Nashville, Philadelphia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine — wherever she could find the health coverage she needed to stay alive.


	Eventually, Jane went into kidney failure during a window when she had no insurance. Her parents took her to Tampa General Hospital, where she was turned down for dialysis treatment — because she still had some days before her body completely shut down, dialysis was not considered life-saving, and the hospital was not required to treat her. The family turned to Medicaid, which Jane was temporarily eligible for due to her failing kidneys, but they were told it would be a six-month wait for coverage. 

	











	“I was dying, and they just didn't care,” she says. “I was disposable. They had the resources to give me the care, and they just wouldn't.”


	Over the next few days, her parents went to the president of the hospital, the governor of Florida, and finally to a local news station, which came to Jane's hospital bed to report a story. “It's not easy to beg for your life,” she says, “But it was important to me that people knew the truth about being sick in America.”


	Thanks to the bad publicity, Jane's Medicaid application was begrudgingly expedited, her life begrudgingly saved. But her hard-won Medicaid coverage dropped her once her kidney transplant was completed, and a transplant-specific Medicare disability program only covered her for three years post-op. Meanwhile, her transplant medications cost about $10,000 annually. So it was back to wandering.  


	Jane was back living in Florida when, in 2010, everything changed: President Barack Obama, armed with a majority in both houses of Congress, passed the Affordable Care Act. Suddenly, in states that opted in, low-income adults earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level — without needing to have children, be pregnant, or have a documented disability — could receive Medicaid coverage. For Jane, this meant that, even when not temporarily disabled by a transplant, she was now eligible for Medicaid — she just needed to move to a Medicaid expansion state. 


	“It is still one of the best moments of my life,” she says. “I was in my friend's restaurant when it passed, with a whole community of people, and we were all sitting around and watching the news and cheering and crying and laughing. It was probably one of the single most important things that had happened to any of us.”


	Jane left Florida, which chose not to expand its Medicaid program, “with one suitcase and a lot of hope” and headed to Boston, where she was able, for the first time in her life, to consistently get the care she needed and even to build her own consulting firm. In 2019, the Green Mountains called her name, and she moved to Vermont, to a little white house tucked amongst the trees. “Vermont is the only place that has ever really felt like home,” she says. “It's like a hug. There's something special here.”


	When she was again unable to afford her medicine, Vermont's Medicaid program, as well as the state's hospitals and community health clinics, welcomed Jane with open arms. “No one ever looked down on me,” she says. 

	











	“Everybody pitches in here,” she continues. “Everybody does some sort of volunteering. People care about each other. People think that Medicaid is poor, lazy people skirting the system. But it's people who are teachers, who are volunteer firefighters, who are police officers. It's people that are part of the community. It's neighbors. It's people at your kids' schools.”


	Jane takes a whole host of medications: immunosuppressants to take care of her transplant and combat lupus, steroids to help replace underproduced hormones, and blood thinners to prevent clots, among others. Each is expensive. And each is critical to her survival — without blood thinners, for example, Jane faces a stroke and immediate death. Without her steroids, she faces an Addison's crisis and a heart attack or coma. And without regular preventative care, she risks a dangerous incongruity within her medical regime — or, as she puts it, “a slow, painful death.” “If I don't have Medicaid,” she says, “it's game over. It's a death sentence.”


	It is the work requirement in particular that Jane fears will rip Medicaid out from under her. Jane works plenty — she substitute teaches, works on legal cases for the wrongly incarcerated, and is studying to take the bar exam — but she worries that the new system will not be able to accommodate her unpredictable health crises. 


	“Let's say I have a really bad lupus flare and, for a period of time, can't meet the work requirements,” Jane says. “Maybe I'm supposed to get a temporary exemption, but maybe it takes six months to get through. Maybe it only takes two weeks. But I'm already dead, because I didn't get my medicine. 


	“I've been fighting these same people my whole life,” she continues. “And I just can't understand why they would want to [do this].”


	Jane, who knows how bad things were before the Affordable Care Act, is terrified of what the health care system may become under the Big Beautiful Bill. “Hospitals are gonna get overwhelmed,” she warns. “They're not gonna have enough money, they're gonna run out of supplies and medication, they're gonna close, and people are going to die.”

	











	WHEN PEOPLE LIKE JANE lose health insurance, they stop going to the doctor for checkups and primary care. They end up sicker, as issues that should've been minor build up into something major. Often, they have no choice but to head to the emergency room. 


	Emergency room visits are expensive, on average thousands of dollars even for minimal treatment. Without insurance, patients like Jane cannot pay the facility. And since emergency rooms must treat any individual seeking care, regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay, the patient takes on an enormous load of debt, and the hospital loses the money it previously could've received via the patient's Medicaid coverage or federally qualified health plan.


	This increase in what experts refer to as uncompensated care poses a monumental threat to health providers. And with nine of Vermont's 14 hospitals (roughly 65 percent) grappling with negative operating margins and steeply declining reserves, Vermont's health care system is at particular risk. “Hospitals can only operate in the red for so long,” warns Owen Foster, who chairs the Green Mountain Care Board (GMCB), Vermont's primary health care regulator. And in a state with a majority-rural population, where people are already traveling far to get to a hospital, even a single hospital closure would be devastating. 

“People think Medicaid is poor, lazy people skirting the system. But it's teachers, firefighters, police officers, neighbors. It's people that are part of the community.”


	Jane, for example, receives medical care at the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center (SVMC), about a 30-minute drive from her home. SVMC currently has a negative operating margin and qualifies as a “highly vulnerable” institution. If SVMC were to go under, Jane's next option for the specialized care her conditions require would be at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire — an almost two-hour drive from her home. For Jane, the difference between driving 30 minutes to take care of an Addison's crisis versus having to go two hours to Dartmouth, she says, “is death.” 


	On top of it all, the federal budget bill, due to its limits on provider taxes, will also reduce the dollar amount hospitals are paid for providing care to the Vermonters able to retain Medicaid coverage — and experts are not sure if Vermont's health care system can take it. The state's hospitals already need between $700 million and $2.4 billion in additional revenue over the next five years to break even, along with another $700 million to pay for vital equipment and infrastructure repairs. But the federal budget bill stands to deal them a financial blow of up to $1.7 billion. (A vaguely-worded, last-minute addition to the bill creates a $50 billion rural health fund to be distributed to states over the next five years, but experts have serious qualms about it, particularly as to whether the distribution of the money will be skewed by partisan politics and whether the one-time fund will stand a chance against the bill's other, more permanent changes.)


	“The state is at an inflection point,” says Foster. “Probably more than any other state in the country.”


	For the past decade, ever since Vermont leaders abandoned a 2011 attempt at universal health care, Vermont's health care system has slowly but surely spiraled. The descent has left Vermont's primary insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont (BCBSVT), which insures about 66 percent of Vermonters, near insolvency, and most of the state's medical providers bleeding out. 

	











	Vermont government and health care leaders, who have spent the past decade pursuing sophisticated reform, are stuck adjudicating a standoff between providers and BCBSVT, both of whom have no choice but to keep raising their prices. So Vermont's health insurance prices have become among the highest in the nation — and they are poised to become even higher under the budget bill's changes. “It's a death spiral,” Jessica Holmes, a GMCB member, says. “And it will affect everyone.”


	“People tend to think of themselves in special little categories when they think about access to care,” says Mike Fisher, Vermont's chief health care advocate. “But we are all part of one system.”


	AT BATTENKILL VALLEY HEALTH CENTER (BVHC) in small-town Arlington, Vermont — which has been designated by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration both a Medically Underserved Area and a Health Professional Shortage Area — most conversations among staff members nowadays revolve around the budget bill. 


	BVHC is a Federally Qualified Health Center, a type of health provider that was created during President Johnson's “War on Poverty” to serve areas with little to no access to adequate medical care. BVHC is required, like emergency rooms, to treat every patient regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. (This, in practice, means charging patients on a sliding scale according to income.) So, like hospitals with emergency rooms, BVHC is particularly vulnerable to the increase in uncompensated care set to occur from the budget bill. “Grant dollars have not kept up, and the cost to provide health care is astronomical,” says Kayla Davis, BVHC's co-executive director. “This bill is going to be the tipping point. Eventually if you're losing money, it doesn't matter how long the runway is. The runway ends.”


	When BVHC first began, a little over a decade ago, it was just seven people with some folding tables and chairs in one big room, Davis describes. “But we have found people that care so deeply about this community and what they do that now we've created this small-town care network,” she says. “And it's kind of magic.”


	On the back wall of the Health Center's main waiting room there is a charcoal and graphite moose, drawn by a seventh grader named Lucas, and, to its left, a painted group of men, women, and children dancing in a circle among autumn trees. “We're a community health center,” says Kate Bryan, BVHC's director of development and community relations, “and it's such a beautiful thing. The people the Health Center serves are the people who helped raise me. They're my teachers, they're my neighbors, and they're my friends.

	











	“These cuts just break my heart,” Bryan tells Rolling Stone. “And it's really hard for us to be able to support [our patients] when we just don't know [what is going to happen], and when we can't make promises that they're going to be OK. I worry that the people I care about most are going to get sicker and are going to die.”


	A few blocks away is the Arlington Food Shelf, run by Bryan's parents, Bill and Judy Bryan. Arlington has been classified by the USDA as a food desert, an area where at least 33 percent of the local population lives more than 10 miles away from a food market.


	As I walk through the doors of what used to be a branch of the Chittenden Bank, I am met by a congregation of volunteers. The mix of people is striking — there is Alex Foley, a tall, brown-haired boy who began volunteering through the local high school's community service club; Joe Carabello, who wears a bright blue polo shirt, rectangle glasses, and vaguely resembles Mr. Fredricksen from Pixar's Up; and Carol Fay, who has a bubblegum pink bandanna tied around her neck.


	As the distribution begins, the sun comes out, the volunteers begin to sweat, and slowly but surely the pile of food grows smaller. Bryan brings out bottled water and iced tea to keep everyone hydrated. The laughs start coming louder; Joe facetiously makes cryptic hand gestures to signal how many bags each car needs, and at some point the onions have begun to be juggled. 


	If you didn't know it was a food distribution event, you might think it was a reunion of some sort. But as Bill Bryan pulls me aside to talk, the federal budget bill rears its ugly head again. “With the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP coming,” Bill says, “we have already seen the number [of people using the food shelf] triple in anticipation.” 

	











	Even though the Arlington Food Shelf is not dealt any direct cuts, when Vermonters stop receiving their SNAP (and Medicaid) benefits and can no longer afford to buy themselves food, they inevitably turn to charitable food sources like the Bryans' food shelf. But food banks and food shelves — particularly as the Trump administration concurrently carves money out of support programs like the USDA's Emergency Food Assistance Program, which distributes food to food banks across the country — cannot meet this demand.


	IN VERMONT, MORE THAN 79,000 people — over 12 percent of the state's population — are facing hunger. Two in five Vermonters, a 2022 University of Vermont study found, experienced food insecurity in the past year. And the USDA has designated 40 Vermont census tracts as food deserts. 


	While Vermont has a stalwart and committed charitable-food system, what SNAP brings to the state is irreplaceable. For every one meal that a Feeding America food bank like the Vermont Foodbank provides, for example, SNAP provides nine. “SNAP is the most efficient and effective anti-hunger program in this country,” Sayles of Vermont Foodbank says. “It works amazingly well. And it's just not possible for food banks and food pantries to replace it.” 


	Sayles is worried that the federal SNAP cuts will cause a ripple effect across Vermont's grocery stores and economy at large and create a larger hunger crisis across the board. This is because SNAP benefits act as economic multipliers: For every $1 of benefits spent in Vermont, about $1.70 is generated in economic activity. 


	“There's over 600 authorized SNAP retailers in Vermont, and when SNAP benefits are put on EBT cards at the beginning of the month, over 90 percent of those benefits are spent within 30 days,” Sayles says. “And we have a lot of very small retailers in Vermont, local stores and country stores and small, independent supermarkets, where losing a portion of their SNAP revenue could put them in jeopardy. And losing a local retailer can be catastrophic.”


	Horton shares Sayles' fears. “There are so many small towns here where there's only one general store where you can get groceries,” she describes. “The closest grocery store is maybe 30, 40 miles away. And these small stores really depend on every dollar they receive. So when they stop receiving as many SNAP dollars, we are going to lose our rural grocery stores.”

	











	The effects of these closures may even go unnoticed, because in September, Trump's USDA canceled its three-decades-old annual report tracking food insecurity.


	“I understand that people have different priorities, and people see the world in different ways,” says Sayles, “But this … it just seems like purposeful cruelty to me, frankly. Hunger is a policy choice. And the cuts are literally going to take food out of the mouths of children and disabled people and older Americans.” 


	Bryan, for her part, is worried about how the dual threats to medical care and food access could debilitate the Arlington community. The food shelf and the Health Center are deeply entwined in their twin missions of feeding and treating the residents of Arlington.


	As I'm about to walk out the doors of the food shelf, Bryan, usually cheerful and enthusiastic to a fault, tells me something she hasn't yet admitted. “Usually I'm the one giving, but, I mean, I was that mom on Medicaid when I was a single mom at 25 years old trying to raise my kids and keep a roof over my head,” she says. “And had I lost those benefits, 25 years ago, I wouldn't be able to be speaking to you about this today.”


	ON MY LAST DAY in Vermont, I visit the home of Megan Oxendine, 36, who lives in subsidized housing in Bennington County and receives both Medicaid and SNAP benefits.


	“If I had one dollar left, I would give it to someone who needed it more than me,” Megan says. On top of raising three small children, “I work 30 hours a week,” she says. “All I want is to make sure my kids get everything they want. But they're toddlers; they get hurt, they break things, they get cuts, they get headaches, and then they need to go to express care. So what, I'm just gonna not take them, and then on top of that I'm not gonna feed them? Absolutely not.” 


	But Megan already rations. As we walk through a nearby Walmart to buy her food for the week, she is all calculations. Dark chicken meat, not white, because it is always cheaper. Romaine lettuce, not iceberg, because it is more nutritional. And small cherry tomatoes, not the large ones, because they are cheapest and go furthest. 

	











	When we check out, Megan pulls out her EBT card to pay. It would look like a standard debit card were it not for the image on the front, a breathtaking still shot of Vermont cropland overlooked by the resplendent, larger-than-life Green Mountains. There is a moment of pause, just long enough for me to hear my breathing, as Megan inserts the card into the machine. Then there is silence, and then the screen flashes a payment confirmation message. All is well: The transaction has gone through, and SNAP has bought Megan and her children food for another week. 


	As we walk out the doors of the Walmart and make our way to Megan's car, the sky starts to darken. Megan and I look up as we feel raindrops dampen our backs. First one drop, then another, and then they are coming down fast and hard and heavy. The clouds have obscured the sun, and the blue is all but gone from the sky. As Megan and I watch the dark weather descend upon the Green Mountains, the air chills, and we both seem to realize one thing: A storm has come to Vermont. And it is not turning around.

Considering Slow Horses is Apple TV's most consistently entertaining (and released) series to date, Down Cemetery Road, another adaptation of novelist Mick Herron's work, begs a reductive but not unfair question: So who plays the Gary Oldman part in this thing? Oldman's turn as Jackson Lamb is one of the constant joys that brings viewers back whenever the show returns every 11 months or so. And his analog here is very clearly a fellow Academy Award- and BAFTA-winner and part of a loose and exciting group of young London actors in the '80s: Emma Thompson. In this new show, Thompson's Zoë Boehm isn't even remotely as gross as Lamb (or as accomplished of an investigator), but she is indeed the cynical “crusty but benign” one, to quote Network, that Herron has a soft spot for, the kind of snoop who plows past receptionists shouting out “excuse me, you can't just come in here!” and always seems armed with a quick retort or a “fuck off.” If there is a rebel in this particularly sunny stretch of Oxford, it's her—which essentially means she has a cool haircut, wears a leather jacket and boots, and likes The Clash.   

But one of the surprises of Down Cemetery Road—and there are a lot of them—is that Boehm, unlike Lamb, is neither the show's best character nor, really, its center. That distinction goes to Sarah Tucker, played by The Affair‘s Ruth Wilson, a meek art conservationist with a fondness for fall sweaters and riding her vintage bike throughout some rom-com-worthy streetscapes to the tune of “Every Time The Sun Comes Up” by Sharon Van Etten. And an even bigger surprise is that, once Sarah enlists the service of a quirky married couple who double as unsuccessful PIs (the brash Zoë and her soft, polite husband, Joe, who's played by the always great Adam Godley), is how little time they actually spend onscreen together working out the show's conspiracy. (To give you an idea of how minor league this operation is, here's Joe's pitch: “Welcome to our humble detective agency. Runaway teens, GPS tracking, credit checks, missing tortoises—no job too small. Well, not just…I also find cats, cars…missing people?”)  

Before Sarah ends up in that shabbily charming office, things start, like they often do in Apple TV shows, with a bang—in this case, a nearby explosion that interrupts a dinner that was becoming very uncomfortable thanks to a cartoonishly dickish, rich-guy guest (portrayed by Baby Reindeer‘s Tom Goodman-Hill). When Sarah tries to deliver a card from a kid neighbor to the little girl who survived that explosion, she's looked at suspiciously by hospital staff and becomes obsessed with finding out what's going on and where she might be. But what starts as a missing-child case soon balloons into a bigger government coverup concerning experiments on British troops, bringing Zoë and Ruth to different corners of the U.K., including a ghost island off the Scottish coast that's littered with landmines and, in a nifty and well-executed bit of suspense building, an overnight train barreling through the north of England stalked by an Anton Chigurh-like assassin.




Like Slow Horses, Down Cemetery Road keeps viewers on their toes, unafraid of killing off a character any other show would keep around. And there are some episode-ending big twists early on that are genuinely surprising, even in this age of twisty-thriller oversaturation, and make you quickly skip to the next one. Also similarly to that Oldman vehicle, this new series is fueled as much by odd-couple comedy dynamics as its central mystery. When Sarah and Zoë find themselves apart for long stretches at a time, they each team up with yet another opposite—the now flightier and chattier former with a no-nonsense, silent soldier whose backstory gives Cemetery a lot of its emotional heft and the latter luddite with a nerdy young hacker. The same can be said for the bad guys pulling some of the strings, including a smooth government bigwig (portrayed wonderfully by Saxondale‘s Darren Boyd) and his shaky, out-of-his-depth suck-up of an underling (tackled by Four Lions‘ Adeel Akhtar). This all could come off like an overused formula if these duos weren't so often enjoyable to watch, especially when Boyd's character delivers threatening-with-a-posh-grin lines like “Everything is tickety-boo as the old-fart flannels in this building would say?” as his direct report smiles both dummy and fearfully and then gives a “That's very good, sir.” 

This mixture of comedy and the occasionally gnarly killing (as if to highlight that very dynamic, there's a memorable bit when a crew is wiped out as a sitcom blasts, with blood splattering against against the TV screen) is also, at points, reminiscent of another recent British standout, Black Doves. And Down Cemetery Road, like that show, has some stylistic flourishes from director Natalie Bailey (who previously helmed episodes of Armando Iannucci's essential The Thick of It), including an overhead shot of a truly opulent space that's hiding some truly awful secrets. If there are more shows like this coming down the pike—thrillers with heavy doses of humor, generally fantastic casting (Wilson, it's worth noting, gives a very good and tricky star performance here), a sizable budget, and some smart narrative decisions (more refreshingly abrupt, life-goes-on endings like this one, please)—viewers should consider themselves pretty lucky.

	Although Lily Allen‘s evocative new album, West End Girl, reflects on the unraveling of her marriage to Stranger Things actor David Harbour, the singer confirmed she doesn't still feel “confused or angry” about the situation. 


	In a conversation with Mel Ottenberg for Interview magazine, Allen explained that her album isn't about getting back at her ex. Ottenberg asked of the LP, “Should we call it a revenge tour?” 


	“It isn't,” Allen replied. “I mean, I wrote this record in 10 days in December, and I feel very differently about the whole situation now. We all go through breakups, and it's always fucking brutal. But I don't think it's that often that you feel inclined to write about it while you're in it.”


	She added, “That's what's fun about this record; it's viscerally like going through the motions. At the time, I was really trying to process things and that's great in terms of the album, but I don't feel confused or angry now. I don't need revenge.”

	











	The singer explained that some of West End Girl is “based on truth and some of it is fantasy.” She explained, “It's not a cruel album. I don't feel like I'm being mean. It was just the feelings I was processing at the time.”


	Ottenberg asked how she managed to get out of a broken heart. “I think it's just getting out and socializing,” she said. “I'm guilty of putting all of it on one person when I'm in a relationship. So when that person leaves, I feel completely bereft and it takes me a while to be like, ‘Actually, I can rely on friends for some of this stuff as well.'” 

	











	Allen also admitted to being on dating apps following her breakup from Harbour, which she said was difficult to do as a woman in the public eye. “They're awful, especially if you're going through heartbreak,” she noted. “There is nothing more depressing than hundreds of people that are nothing like the person that you're missing…. I'm not really looking to go out with another famous person.”


	She said she was actually banned from Hinge “for impersonating myself,” but she is still on Raya. Allen added that she is currently not dating anyone specific. “I'm not in a relationship, but there are some people that I meet up with,” she said.

	Allen and Harbour married in 2020. West End Girl marks her first new album in seven years, following 2018's No Shame. It features 14 tracks recorded in Los Angeles over 10 days with her music director Blue May late last year before completing it between New York and London. 


	“The record is vulnerable in a way that my music perhaps hasn't been before — certainly not over the course of a whole album,” Allen said in a statement. “I've used shared experiences as the basis for songs which try to delve into why we humans behave as we do, so the record is a mixture of fact and fiction which I hope serves as a reminder of how stoic yet also how frail we humans can be. In that respect I think it's very much an album about the complexities of relationships and how we all navigate them.”

Based on the novel by Mick Herron, the series features Thompson and Ruth Wilson as women unraveling a conspiracy and seeking a missing girl.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	For a series about misfit intelligence operatives doggedly refusing to live up to even the lowest level of their potential, Apple TV's Slow Horses is remarkably self-actualized.


	Every year, come rain or shine or strike or global cataclysm, Slow Horses delivers a new season. Each season thus far has been six episodes, with those episodes usually averaging 45 minutes, durations that have yet to feel too long or too short. Seasons have dealt with weighty, headline-ripping topics and they've killed off several beloved characters, but Will Smith and his creative team have always known the precise quantity of humor necessary to protect Slow Horses from ever being either ponderous or frivolous.

The Bottom Line

	
	Unpolished but superbly acted.
	



Airdate: Wednesday, October 29 (Apple TV)Cast: Emma Thompson, Ruth Wilson, Fehinti Balogun, Adeel Akhtar, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, Darren BoydCreator: Morwenna Banks			
			







Slow Horses isn't always one of my favorite shows — the fungibility of its storylines, contributing to a sense of interchangeability of seasons, is both a feature and a bug — but if you asked me for a prototypical example of a TV show that knows precisely what it wants to be, Slow Horses would be my answer.




			Related Video		







	That's a high (and specific) bar, and if Apple TV's Down Cemetery Road wasn't based on a novel series from Slow Horses author Mick Herron, wasn't adapted for TV by Slow Horses veteran Morwenna Banks and didn't, in spots, feel an awful lot like Slow Horses, I wouldn't make the comparison at all.


	In its first season, Down Cemetery Road struggles with exactly the structural elements that seemed to come so naturally for Slow Horses. At eight episodes, most running over 50 minutes, Down Cemetery Road feels consistently padded and, especially in its first half, the momentum meanders in frustrating ways. The comedy, often quite broad, is occasionally jarringly incongruous, and the dramatic stakes of the season-long arc sometimes vanish entirely. There's probably a great six-episode season hiding within this opening run, but it isn't the version of the show that's finally airing.

	











	The flaws in Down Cemetery Road are not insignificant. But when you have a show built around the perfectly cast Emma Thompson, instantly whetting appetites for adaptations of the next three Herron-penned Zoë Boehm mysteries, and a top-notch supporting ensemble led by Ruth Wilson and breakout Fehinti Balogun, the flaws become minor irritants and not dealbreakers. (Actually, Wilson isn't really part of the “supporting” cast. She's more like the star, even if the ongoing series of books continues following Thompson's Boehm and not Wilson's Sarah Tucker.)


	Sarah is an Oxford-based art restorationist, living largely in the shadow of her dithering husband Mark (Tom Riley), a mid-level financier more interested in his professional mobility than paying attention to whether his wife is personally fulfilled.


	Mark expects Sarah to play perfect wife and hostess for a potentially large client, the insufferable Gerard (Tom Goodman-Hill), and she dutifully orchestrates a small and awkward dinner party that's upended when a neighboring house explodes.


	Authorities say “gas leak,” as they tend to. But Sarah is fixated on the disaster, in which two people were killed and a small girl was hospitalized and then vanishes. Self-conscious about her own childlessness, Sarah latches onto a single, earlier meeting with the girl and her now-deceased mother, and when she accidentally stumbles into a private investigator's office she sees the chance to get to the bottom of things.


	The investigator whose name is on the door is Joe Silverman (Adam Godley, excellent in a brief role), but it instantly becomes clear that the brains of the operation is Joe's estranged wife, brash and brassy Zoë, with her spiky silver hair and snazzy leather jackets and no interest in the job's more social aspects.

	











	Sarah is in way, way over her head. The explosion and the girl's disappearance are tied to an elaborate and confusing conspiracy that involves a shady, unnamed government agent (Darren Boyd); his bumbling underling (Adeel Akhtar's Hamza); a menacing assassin named Amos (Balogun); and a mysterious man (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, plagued by an underwritten role) who keeps popping up in Sarah's life with ambiguous intent.


	What follows is an odd road trip across the U.K. with some folks trying to rescue the girl and unravel the conspiracy, and the bad guys trying to, um, keep those things from happening.


	A lot of what is unwieldy about Down Cemetery Road stems from the source novel, which predates the Slough House series and showcases a writer with an exceptional gift for dialogue and characterization but a more nascent sense of rudimentary storytelling.


	On its surface, Down Cemetery Road fits into a meddling amateur gumshoe genre — think The Girl on the Train, The Woman in the Window and Sharp Objects among others — in which a generally adrift main character (usually a woman, usually played by Amy Adams) attempts to solve a mystery that generally mirrors the aspects of their own lives that have left them without purpose.


	Sarah has a useless husband and a useless job. The latter fact is odd, because in the book she has no job at all; the art restoration gig here is a job, but it's still useless. She also has a confusingly explained and depicted past trauma. The missing girl and the investigation give her an objective, or at least a clear-eyed sense of her strengths, perhaps for the first time.

	











	Zoë, in contrast, knows her strengths, but she's been content to let her husband be the frontman for the agency. Now she has to come to terms with the state of her marriage and whether or not it's too late to have larger professional aspirations.


	But the conspiracy they've plunged into is perfunctory, and the entire story is populated by red herrings, whole characters who exist to make you think they're important only to vanish very quickly, often never to be discussed again. It's two women trying to save a young woman and constantly being interfered with by mediocre men who are at best vestigial and at worst murderous.


	Unlike Slow Horses, in which everything is essential and nothing is filler, Down Cemetery Road spends four episodes introducing you to things that are entirely filler. One might easily reach the midpoint in the show unable to say what it's actually about, what anybody is trying to do and what difference it would make if Sarah and company fail in their mission. It's extremely lax, albeit frequently by design.


	Then the last few episodes become a series of set pieces in which our characters are split into three or four groups heading for common destinations, and solid suspense develops from the intercutting, taking the place of any real urgency. It helps that, as the conspiracy threatens to come undone, the man in charge (Boyd makes for a terrifying and catty government suit) stops turning to the floundering Hamza (Akhtar is funny but sometimes in a different way from the rest of the show) and unleashes Amos.

	











	Balogun, who stole scenes from Ewan McGregor in Paramount+'s A Gentleman in Moscow, has a smooth, searing confidence, mowing through extras and secondary characters with vicious efficiency. There are shades of a more stylish Terminator to Amos' ruthlessness, but Balogun never loses track of the mixture of human pain and professionalism that drives him. You can't take your eyes off of Balogun, and it will be interesting to see what casting directors do with him once the show puts him on more radars; he's a star, though what type of star remains to be seen.


	He also manages to steal the show out from under Thompson, but with a part this juicy, that's only an almost. Zoë has a lot in common with Gary Oldman's Jackson Lamb, only with a stronger sense of fashion and less flatulence. Zoë suffers neither fools nor even the generally competent, and there are few actors, if any, whom you'd rather watch verbally eviscerate people for eight straight hours. But Thompson is every bit as good in the quieter moments, like when she recites the Philip Larkin stanza that gives the show its title.


	Thompson is perfectly paired with Wilson, an actor who can go from disheveled wallflower to calculating plotter to deer-in-the-headlights comic fighter with a widening of the eye or twisting of the lips. It's no surprise that Down Cemetery Road is at its best when Thompson and Wilson share scenes, but it's odd that in expanding Zoë's profile for the series — the book is closer to 80 percent focused on Sarah — Banks and her writing team didn't give them more time together.

	











	It's the odd choices that keep Down Cemetery Road from living up to its full potential, from telling a story that feels like it's building to something instead of stumbling around finding itself, even if that's what its main characters are doing. 


	Still, the teaming of Thompson and Wilson, together and separately, was a choice as well — one that pays off in planting the seeds for further adventures (maybe or maybe not involving Wilson's character) that might come closer to that Slow Horses level of self-actualization.

Two-time mirrorball champion Cheryl Burke also notably returned to the ballroom, where she served as a guest judge alongside Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli.

[This story contains spoilers from episode seven of Dancing With the Stars season 34.]


	It's the most wonderful time of the year — because it's time to celebrate Halloween in the Dancing With the Stars ballroom!  




	Jen Affleck and Jan Ravnik were eliminated from the show at the end of Halloween Night. Elaine Hendrix was also absent from the show on Tuesday, as she suffered an injury during rehearsals that prevented her from dancing. 


	Marking another beloved themed episode of the competitive dance series, things got spooky Tuesday night as the couples performed dances inspired by the holiday. This week, the cast notably prepared for the dance marathon (aka the “Dance Monster-thon”), which tasked the full cast to hit the stage at the same time as the judges knock them off one by one, until one pair wins.

	During the dance marathon, Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas were the final couple standing, earning an extra five points to their overall night score. 


	While Hendrix was not present in the ballroom, her Halloween Night dance was judged by the panel based on footage of her dance in rehearsal. 


	Heading into Halloween Night, nine couples remained in the cast, including Secret Lives of Mormon Wives stars Affleck and Leavitt, Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles, social media star Alix Earle, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actresses Danielle Fishel and Hendrix, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin and comedian-actor Andy Richter. 

	











	Scott Hoying and Rylee Arnold were eliminated at the end of last week's Wicked Night, which saw each couple pay homage to the upcoming Wicked: For Good while Jon M. Chu served as a guest judge. 


	After Halloween Night, four weeks of competition remain. DWTS will crown its 34th winning duo on Nov. 25 in a special three-hour finale. Until then, remaining theme nights include Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the show's 20th Birthday Party celebration and Prince Night, which falls on the semi-finals. 


	Joining Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli on the judges panel this week is former professional dancer Cheryl Burke. The two-time mirrorball champion celebrated her return to the ballroom in conversation with The Hollywood Reporter ahead of Tuesday night's episode, where she promised to be a “constructive and encouraging” judge who is looking to see “authenticity and growth” from the cast. 


	The couple with the lowest combined total of judges' scores and viewer votes is eliminated at the end of each episode. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final performance is completed.


	See the full list of scores for week seven of DWTS season 34 (aka Halloween Night) below.


	Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas: 37/40Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa: 34/40Andy Richter and Emma Slater: 28/40Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten: 32/40 (Judges' scores came from rehearsal footage due to Elaine's injury.)Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov: 33/40Robert Irwin and Witney Carson: 38/40Jen Affleck and Jan Ravnik: 32/40 (ELIMINATED)Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy: 39/40Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach: 35/40

	











	Season 34 of DWTS airs and streams simultaneously on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesdays, with new episodes available to stream on Wednesdays on Hulu.

Troian Bellisario appeared totally nude in a sizzling birthday tribute from her husband, Patrick J. Adams.

The “Pretty Little Liars” star turned 40 years old on Tuesday, and Adams shared a racy shot of her lying on her stomach by a pool while looking at her phone. Bellisario was completely naked in the casual photo, and a part of her bare butt was visible.

More intimate pics in the Instagram carousel included her taking an ice bath, her spending quality time with their two daughters — 7-year-old Aurora and 4-year-old Elliott — and a throwback shot of her while she was pregnant.

“I don't know how you do it all or how I got so lucky to do it with you but I'll take every damn drop I can get,” Adams wrote. “Happy birthday @sleepinthegardn – you are the gift that literally never stops giving and everyone lucky enough to know you feels it.”

“You always move forward, no stone unturned, no sleep ‘til Brooklyn, no rest for the wicked, no ifs, ands or buts, no harm, no foul, no guts, no glory,” he continued. “All heart. All hustle. All love. Always and in all ways.”

Bellisario also shared her husband's sweet birthday gestures in an Instagram Story, which included a black gift box tied with pink ribbon, a vase of flowers, a hardback copy of Anthony Burgess' “1985” novel and green balloons reading, “happy birthday.”

“Once again the greatest gift giver,” she wrote, tagging the “Suits” star. 

“I am beyond lucky,” she added.

Bellisario and Adams, 44, have been married since December 2016.

The mother of two talked about their marriage during her appearance on Jesse Tyler Ferguson's podcast, “Dinner's On Me,” in May, noting that they had to date long-distance for long periods of time since meeting in 2009.

“We always used to joke that, like, the number of in-room hours [we've spent together] is real low,” she cracked of their busy filming schedules.

The actress admitted that there's a period of adjustment when they're reunited again.

“You've been living apart, so you've been living on your own, and you form your own habits,” she explained. “Like, when he comes home from shooting on location, does he take his coffee the same way?”

“You know, maybe I've gotten used to waking up and going for a run, and all of a sudden, there's somebody in my bed that I wanna spend time with, but I'm like, well, this is what I do,” she continued.

“That's really hard to navigate with the kids,” she added.

Elaine Hendrix has been hospitalized after suffering an injury while competing on “Dancing With the Stars.”

The actress, 54, and her partner, Alan Bersten, had to miss “Halloween Night” on Tuesday due to her injury. Hendrix shared a video on Instagram, revealing she injured her ribs during their performance of “Defying Gravity” last week, “and today they just seized up.”

“I couldn't move,” she said, as she spoke to her fans from a hospital bed.

An emotional Hendrix said the doctor advised her to rest for a day or two before continuing with the competition.

“I want to dance,” she said, fighting back tears and asking fans to vote for her. “I want to keep doing this.”

In her caption, Hendrix wrote that she was “devastated” to be missing “Halloween Night.”

“I was beyond excited to share what we had worked so hard on, although you'll see a version of it,” she shared. “With your support, I'll be back in the ballroom next week. I want nothing more.”

During Tuesday's “DWTS” episode, host Alfonso Ribeiro shared similar information.

“She suffered an injury in rehearsal this morning,” he revealed. “Right now, she's at the hospital being assessed.”

Bersten later appeared in the ballroom and shared a heartfelt message for his partner.

“Elaine, I love you,” he said. “I'm so proud of you and I'll see you soon.”

The duo was scored on their rehearsal performance, and the judges — which included guest judge Cheryl Burke — gave them a 32 out of 40.

The Oscar-winning filmmaker speaks with The Hollywood Reporter alongside screenwriter Noah Oppenheim about the film emerging as an instant hit on Netflix, what she learned from the debate around 'Zero Dark Thirty' and her hopes for her harrowing new film going forward.


							By 

	David Canfield


Senior Entertainment Writer


Kathryn Bigelow is happy A House of Dynamite is sparking conversations.


	That's her initial — and genuinely enthusiastic — response to The Hollywood Reporter when asked about Bloomberg's recent report that the Pentagon sent out an internal memo about her film, criticizing its depiction of the United States' nuclear missile defense system. The movie's view is based on Bigelow and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim's extensive research and interviews with experts: They depict with startling detail how, with less than 30 minutes from detection, officials can best, if ultimately insufficiently, respond to an incoming attack, with the current U.S. system able to stop a nuclear missile roughly 50 percent of the time. (“A coin toss,” as the refrain in the movie goes.) Per Bloomberg, the Pentagon counters that its systems “have displayed a 100 percent accuracy rate in testing for more than a decade.”

	Writers like The Atlantic's Tom Nichols, who visited the set for the film, have already disputed The Pentagon's apparent claims. Officials including Massachusetts Senator Edward J. Markey have gone public praising the film for raising nuclear awareness — and getting it seemingly right. The Pentagon has complicated the conversation over the level of accuracy in A House of Dynamite, which has premiered to strong numbers on Netflix as the streamer's number one film, with 22.1 million views in its first three days, per the company.


	But Bigelow and Oppenheim welcome the debate. In an exclusive conversation with THR, they reflect on the movie's success so far, lessons learned from the controversy around Bigelow's Oscar-winning Zero Dark Thirty, and why they feel confident in their depiction. 

	











I want to get right into it and ask you, Kathryn, about this Pentagon memo that Bloomberg first reported on. What is your reaction to it? 


KATHRYN BIGELOW It's interesting. In a perfect world, culture has the potential to drive policy — and if there's dialogue around the proliferation of nuclear weapons, that is music to my ears, certainly.


What are your feelings around the fact that they did internally decide to respond to the movie and take some level of issue with your depiction of our missile-defense system? Why do you think that they chose to do that?


NOAH OPPENHEIM There's no way for us to get in the minds of the folks who wrote that memo, but as Kathryn said, both of us are thrilled to see a conversation happening between policymakers and experts about how to make the world a safer place. So if the film was a catalyst in some way for that larger conversation and dialogue, that's one of the reasons why we made it — to trigger that kind of conversation.


Do you worry, though, that this will challenge the credibility of the film? How do you feel about the fact that they're taking a stance that opposes, to some degree, what you depict in the film?


OPPENHEIM As we see it, it's not a debate between us as filmmakers and the Pentagon. It's between the Pentagon and the wider community of experts in the space. Senator Edward Markey or retired general Douglas Lute; journalists like Tom Nichols and Fred Kaplan who've covered this issue for decades; the APS, which is a nonpartisan organization of physicists — these are the folks who are coming out and saying what we depict in the film, which is that our current missile defense system is highly imperfect, is accurate. On the other side of that conversation, you have the Pentagon apparently asserting that it's 100 percent effective. We believe all those experts who've told us that the system is more like a coin toss like we depict in the film, but we're glad all these folks are having the debate and the conversation.

	











The Pentagon also apparently noted you did not consult them while making the movie. Kathryn, you've said you felt it was important to keep this film independent. Can you talk about why, in light of this response?


BIGELOW It's the best course of action, to consult with all of the experts that we did. We had extraordinary tech advisors on this film, and then they were our North Star.


OPPENHEIM I'm a former journalist, you're a journalist. I think it's safe to say that folks who are not currently serving in government are often more free to speak their minds and to give you an accurate picture, as opposed to trying to advance any particular agenda. So relying on folks who recently served in the Pentagon, recently served in our intelligence agencies in the White House — we feel pretty confident in the accuracy of the picture that they gave us.


Kathryn, Zero Dark Thirty obviously elicited a ton of response and controversy from government officials and experts. Were there any lessons learned, or wisdom gleaned, from that experience in terms of how to operate in the aftermath of the release of these films, which speak so directly and potently to our real world?


BIGELOW I just state the truth. In this piece, it's all about realism and authenticity. Same with Zero Dark Thirty and same with Hurt Locker — even though Hurt Locker was obviously a work of fiction, and this is a work of fiction. For me, these are pieces that lean in hard on realism. You're inviting an audience into, say, the battledeck of STRATCOM. That's a place that's not easily accessible, and so you want it to be authentic and honest. That's my goal, and I think we achieved it. 












In addition to the public commentary from experts that you mentioned, Noah, what have you heard from people about the film as it's soared on Netflix over the last few days?


OPPENHEIM It's been really gratifying that the folks who know the subject the best have told us that they feel like we've captured it accurately and that this is the world that they have been examining for all their careers.


BIGELOW To be honest, nuclear weapons have been shrouded in silence for several decades now. It's my opinion that this was a conversation that needed to happen.


This movie has struck such a chord since it premiered. It's been at number one on Netflix for the last few days. Do you think that's partly why it's resonated — the fact that it is something that has been shrouded in silence, as you say?


BIGELOW Very much so. It's grappling with the idea that we're surrounded by 12,000 (nuclear) weapons. We live in a really combustible environment, hence the title — we live in A House of Dynamite. The unthinkable — it's time to address it and, in a perfect world, begin discussions about reducing the nuclear stockpile. 


OPPENHEIM It is extraordinary, the power of the Netflix platform in terms of its ability to reach an audience all over the world and drive a conversation. The number of people who've watched the movie just in these first few days, it's beyond our wildest expectations, and you're seeing a conversation about this not just in the United States, but all over the world, because Netflix has that kind of global reach. Hearing from people in my past life as a journalist, hearing from friends and family all over the world whose attention has been turned to this very important issue so that they're coming out of the movie and saying, “Wow, Kathryn Bigelow sure can make a compelling thriller,” and “I was on the edge of my seat for two hours,” and also, “I'm thinking about this really critical policy issue for the first time in a long time” — the combination of those two things is pretty great.

	











Kathryn, how about for you? This is your first streaming movie. Are you online? Are you tracking the discourse?


BIGELOW(Laughs.) I mean, I'm receiving texts and emails all over the world. It's really very profound. The reach is extraordinary, but more importantly, the story, the concept, the subject is what's really inspiring conversation and feedback and trepidation — in a good way. In other words, this is a conversation. That is a long time coming. We have in February the beginning of the negotiation for the START Treaty, and I've heard from one gentleman who will be involved in that negotiation, who's seen the movie twice — and would like to see a meaningful impact in that negotiation.


There's so much talk about the ending, the uncertainty that it very intentionally leaves viewers with. Have you followed the way that people are sitting with it and debating it?


OPPENHEIM Kathryn and I wanted the movie to invite the audience to lean in the end, to not kind of give anyone an easy out or tie it up with a bow. We wanted to instigate reflection and conversation, and we both give a lot of credit to Netflix for letting Kathryn make the movie that she envisioned from the very beginning. As the ending is driving people to talk more about this subject, it's exactly what we hoped for.


BIGELOW I tend to start films with a question, or I certainly have recently anyway. With Hurt Locker, it was: What is the methodology of the insurgency in Iraq and the bloodiest part of the war? In Zero Dark Thirty, why did it take 10 years to find Osama Bin Laden? In this one, the film in itself poses a question that then gives the audience an opportunity to answer.

It's been a scary week for reality TV star Dylan Efron because, as he prepared for Halloween Night in Week 7 of “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34, he endured an injury that left him with a broken nose. Despite this, Efron pushed on, and on Show Day on October 28, he did not disappoint! 

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

Efron and his professional dance partner Daniella Karagach performed a Viennese Waltz to “Can't Help Falling In Love (DARK)” by Tommee Profitt and Brooke. The judges on the night were Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough, Bruno Tonioli, and special guest judge Cheryl Burke. 

A post shared by Dylan Efron (@dylanefron)

They looked incredible, and the judges were impressed, scoring them 35 out of 40. However, fans were really disappointed that Burke scored Efron an 8, and the comments reflect this.

After Efron's performance, the official “Dancing with the Stars” account posted photos on Instagram. The post gave fans a glimpse at “The Traitor” winner's outfit, makeup, and impressive dance moves. Fans flooded the comment section with their thoughts, praising Efron and revealing if they thought the judges got it right with their scores. 

“QUEEN DANI JUST PROVED SHE DOESN'T NEED A CONTEMPORARY ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT,” a fan reacted. “DANIELLA KARAGACH YOUR HALLOWEEN CHOREOGRAPHY REMAINS UNDEFEATE,” another fan wrote. 

Other reactions include, “Soo good!! Better not get any 8's,” “Blew everyone away so hard that the camera man tripped,” “Dylan's improvement is insane,” and “I'm screaming.”

A post shared by Daniella Karagach Pashkova (@daniellakaragach)

Fans had been looking forward to this performance and were even more impressed because Efron was able to push through the pain of a broken nose to deliver an unforgettable waltz. Ahead of Show Day, Karagach posted a video on Instagram showing herself and Efron getting ready for camera blocking. They looked so good in rehearsals that fans had a good feeling that an impressive show was on the way.  

Comments on the post include “Can't wait! Your Halloween choreo is always legendary!!,” “Oh I can't not wait to see your Halloween dance so glad you made it to this round!,” and “Try not break my fav boy lol just kidding cant wait.”

Fellow celebrity competitor Danielle Fishel reacted to the post with support. “Can't wait to scream cry at your and @dylanefron's dance,” she wrote. 

There is no denying Efron is a naturally talented performer, and he has been putting on a great show, but fans also praised Karagach for her Halloween choreography. “Can't wait to see your choreography!!!! hands down, without taking away from the talent of all the pros BUT you are the bestttttt hands down!!!!!!!!!!!” an excited fan shared.

He's coming clean.

Frankie Muniz admitted he ended his friendship with Hilary Duff after working on the 2003 film “Agent Cody Banks” because he was not a fan of his co-star's mom.

“Hilary Duff was probably one of my first friends when I moved to LA to film ‘Malcolm [in the Middle],'” Muniz recalled on the Sept. 2 episode of “The Joe Vulpis Podcast.”

The pair were introduced through mutual friends in Los Angeles as several of the “Malcolm in the Middle” star's pals lived in an apartment complex in Burbank, Calif., that was known to house numerous child actors.

“We became really, really good friends. We had a really great relationship for a long time,” he continued.

After becoming close, Duff, 38, asked for Muniz, 39, to make an appearance on her Disney show “Lizzie McGuire” playing himself in 2002. 

“I was on the set of ‘Lizzie McGuire,' and I was in Hilary's dressing room and her mom was there,” Muniz remembered, describing Duff's mom, Susan, as “the epitome of a stage mom.”

“She was intense. Hilary was so cool, we had an awesome relationship, but her mom was super intense. And my mom was the opposite,”  he added.

The “Big Fat Liar” star went on to explain that his mom would often “hide” while he worked on set because she “didn't want to be in the way.”

While working with Duff on her show, Muniz — who was in his teens at the time — remembered the Disney star's mom asking him, “What are you doing this summer?'”

“And I go, ‘Oh, I'm filming this movie where I'm playing like a junior James Bond. It's called ‘Agent Cody Banks,'” he answered back. 

At which point, he claims Susan asked Muniz if there was “a girl” role in the movie that might be good for Duff to take on. But, Muniz gave a noncommittal response to the probe.

On the podcast, Muniz explained that he believed the role on Natalie Connors, which ultimately went to Duff, was going to be played by “Smallville” star Kristin Kreuk, whom executives had previously expressed an interest in. 

“The next morning, I show up to the set. I go into her dressing room to hang out. And her mom's like, ‘Guess what? We're going to be spending the summer together.'” Muniz shared. 

Showing his confusion, Muniz excitedly asked Duff's mom if she would be filming a different film in Vancouver, Canada, where the 2003 flick was shot.

But Susan told him, “No, she's doing ‘Cody Banks' with you… They signed the contract last night.' ”

“The movie you knew nothing about yesterday?” Muniz remembered asking in disbelief. 

He went on to share that the casting took place after “calls were made” and because executives knew of his friendship with Duff, they “assumed it was fine” despite Muniz's stipulations in his contract that gave him a say in the casting of his love interest.

“Needless to say, I wasn't thrilled about it. And not because I didn't want it to be Hilary,” he said.

“I don't know how much I want to say. I'm trying to think about it because I've already said way too much,” Muniz said of the ordeal, adding that he had an “amazing time” filming the movie, but was “very sad when Hilary's mom would come on set.”

“And if I told you I've never talked to Hilary since the last day of filming. I've not said one word to her since then. So that's the truth of that,” he closed.  

“I regret not just continuing to be friends with her because we had a great friendship for such a long time, and her mom… it pissed me off,” he shared. 

Though, Muniz added that he would “love to catch up” with Duff now that they're both far past the drama of the film.  “I would love to even talk about that because I'm sure she doesn't know any of that happened.”

The following contains spoilers for Supernatural #1, on sale now from Dynamite Entertainment

One of the central things that you need to think of when you do a licensed comic book series is that you have to take into consideration WHEN you want your comic book to be set. A very important aspect of this is that you really sort of "have" to commit to a specific period because that allows you to really dial down into specific stories that would occur in that period. For instance, Marvel has had great success in the past decade of its Star Wars licensed comic books by picking a specific time period, and then having all of its ongoing comics built around that period. Currently, the Star Wars line is based in adventures following Return of the Jedi, but that lesson is important even for a series that ISN'T part of a whole line of books, and since Greg Pak is VERY familiar with this concept from his excellent work on the aforementioned Star Wars line of books at Marvel, it is unsurprising that he has learned that lesson well for this new Supernatural series, which isn't part of a line of books, of course, but still gets that it is important to pick one era and explore it as best you can.

Supernatural #1 is from writer Greg Pak, artist Eder Messias, colorist Thyago Brandao, and letterer Jeff Eckleberry, and it is smartly set between the first and second seasons of the extraordinarily long-running TV series about two brothers who are part of a family of "hunters," people who hunt down demons and other supernatural forces.

One of the great hallmarks of any long-running series like Supernatural is the so-called "Monster of the Week" episodes. This was a famous aspect of The X-Files (that's where the term "Monster of the Week" came from), and it has been a regular fixture in these sorts of shows ever since.

This issue kicks off with a compelling idea, as a man flat out BURSTS INTO FLAMES while drinking outside of his home. This, naturally, is very important for Dean and Sam Winchester, as Sam Winchester was brought back into the world of "hunting" by his girlfriend (likely soon to be fiancée) Jess being killed by a demon through a horrific process (similar to the one where Dean and Sam's mother was killed), burning alive after being badly wounded. So having a case involving a person burned to death is a sharp idea by Pak to kick off this new series.

The reason why it is so smart to have this series set in the earliest days of the show is that it allows Pak to really have the most freedom to tell new stories without stepping on the toes of the original comic books. As the show continued over the years, it obviously added more and more continuity to itself, to the point where the weight of the continuity helped drive the plot so much that it would be very difficult to have the freedom to have a lot of new "untold" stories set in that period. It was unlike, say, Spider-Man, where his very existence means that all sorts of crazy stuff is happening in his life at any given moment, so that you could easily throw in all sorts of different adventures into his past without it affecting anything (a hallmark of the classic series, Untold Tales of Spider-Man, and the current fun miniseries, Amazing Spider-Man: Torn).

Here, when the Winchesters' adventures were still "new," there was much more area for Pak to move in with new untold stories, while still giving them some heft, and not feel disposable (you know, sort of like, "Well, if this story was important at all, we'd have heard about it already, right?").

At the same time, it also allows Pak to dig deeper into the feelings of Sam and Dean, which are obviously still raw in the early days of their partnership.

A really helpful tool for licensed comics like this is something that Pak obviously is smart enough to get, which is that you should introduce new villains, since you can't really mess too much with the show's established villains, so a new villain gives you a lot of freedom to do whatever you want with them, and Pak introduces an intriguing new villain in this issue, a billionaire who is interested in going beyond the world of science to also exploit the world of magic for legit, as well. That's a very natural enemy for the Winchesters, and the fact that she is an attractive young woman has room for some interesting entanglements between her and Dean.

Messias and Brandao have the inglorious task of having to play against their instincts in this series, as Messias is a big, bold artist whose work crackles with energy, and yet here, since it is a TV show adaptation, a lot of the plot is delivered through "just" talking scenes, and Messias has to make those compelling, as well, and he uses a lot of little tricks to pull it off, with a lot of "business" in the background. Dave Gibbons is iconic for how much extra "business" he had going on in every Watchmen panel, and Messias follows that path in this issue (I don't want to mislead you, he doesn't do nearly as much as Gibbons, just saying that he takes that same basic approach to liven up the talking panels).

And then when the action comes? That's time for Messias and Brandao to cut loose, and it is so wild and full of energy. It really captures your attention.

This was a strong first issue, and it feels nice to have such a strong guiding hand like Pak leading this book. You know he will make it worth your while.

From behind, it's hard to tell them apart. The men who appeared before the 10th criminal chamber of the Paris court on Monday, October 27, and Tuesday, October 28, could easily be mistaken for one another, with their graying temples and dark clothing. They had the unremarkable look of their professions – IT specialist, sports teacher or mortgage broker – and are all aged between 41 and 65. Whether from Paris or elsewhere in France, these men share the same pastime behind the anonymity of social media: spreading the conspiracy theory that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman − fake news that has gained international traction.

One described the president's wife on X (formerly Twitter) as her husband's "ballsy partner." Another called her an "old monkey" with "inflatable boobs." "Who doubts Brigitte's dick?" a third wondered – without considering that such a message could land him in court.

At the end of August 2024, Brigitte Macron filed a complaint for cyberharassment after enduring a wave of mockery and insults following the publication of a photo of her in a swimsuit. Investigators from the French national online hate crimes unit, in charge of the inquiry, identified 10 profiles – "the most virulent," according to a police report – among the thousands of people who participated in the smear campaign. Seven of the 10 defendants were present in court.

Israeli-American Harvard University physicist Avi Loeb recently discussed employing a multi-front approach to finding extraterrestrial life in space, as the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS continued to gain attention.



Speaking on the October 28, 2025, episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Avi Loeb shared how he would approach the search for life beyond Earth if given the necessary funds for the project. 



He stated that it was necessary to “attack this question on several fronts.” According to him, there had to be another observatory similar to the Rubin Observatory in Chile, which monitored the southern sky,” to monitor the northern sky. 



That way, there would be a “full alert system that would notify us of interstellar objects coming in.”



Loeb continued to stress the need for proper interceptors, specially-designed cameras, as well as a significant allocation of funds in the “planetary defense” fund to create a system that will protect Earth. 



Apart from that, Loeb suggested the tracking of artificial lights and other traditional ways of searching for intelligent life. 



Conversations surrounding extraterrestrial beings or an intelligent presence came to the forefront after the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, began showing multiple anomalies. 



The “anti-tail,” in particular, which Loeb speculated may be thrust exhaust from an intelligent life, trying to slow down the object, sparked alien theories among experts. 







After stressing the importance of creating a copy of the Rubin Observatory in Chile to monitor the northern sky, Loeb discussed the use of interceptors. 



“We need interceptors, a spacecraft that when we detect with those two observatories, we detect an object that comes from outside the solar system, then we can maneuver a spacecraft so that it will meet it along its path,” he explained.



The physicist then spoke about the Juno spacecraft near Jupiter and how capable it was of capturing the 31/ATLAS. 



He recalled writing a paper discussing the change in the trajectory of Juno, which U.S. Representative Anna Pauline Luna read.



She then wrote a letter to the interim administrator of NASA, Sean Duffy, discussing the possibility of repurposing the Juno mission to intercept and study the interstellar object. 



“If Juno had all the initial fuel that it originally had, it could have collided with 3I/ATLAS, but it used most of it,” Loeb said. 



Thus, Loeb concluded that “a potential fleet of interceptors” had the capacity to “come really close and take a close-up photograph.”



According to Loeb, photographic proof of the 3I/ATLAS or any other object would automatically debunk all theories besides the truth. 



Consequently, he believed they needed cameras that could not only take photographs but also collect samples and bring them back to Earth. 





Loeb argued that once alien technology was verified, confirming that it put Earth at risk, a significant fraction of the military budget should be allocated to create a system that would protect the planet.



“It's called planetary defense. And we are dealing not with rocks, we are dealing with technological gadgets. So it should be much more sophisticated. So I'm saying let's start with the level of billions of dollars just surged,” he said.



He continued:



“If we encounter a clearly technological alien object, then the budget will rise by a factor of 1,000 from the military budget portion going into it.”



Loeb also suggested the search for artificial lights, as it would allow experts to get more of an understanding.





While 31/ATLAS sparked concerns about being a visit by aliens and other risks, NASA confirmed that it posed no threat to the planet.



According to them:



“Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away. The closest it will approach our planet is about 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles, or 270 million kilometers). 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun around Oct. 30, 2025.”



Stay tuned for more updates.

Warning! Spoilers ahead for Supernatural #1!

Supernatural is back, and it is fully capturing the Season 1 vibe of the show. Dynamite Entertainment's new Supernatural comic series returns to Sam and Dean's formative days as monster-hunters. The first issue dials the franchise back to its essence, delivering the classic Winchester brothers dynamic from before it was burdened by later seasons' metaphysics and mythology.

Supernatural #1 is written by Greg Pak, with art by Eder Messias. The series premiere evokes the “creature feature” style of the show's early run, while also introducing a new potential romantic foil for Dean.

The issue is at its best, though, in its back-and-forth between Sam and Dean, setting a strong foundation for the stories to come.

 Supernatural #1 is a self-contained story set toward the end of Season 1 of the show. As such, it deliberately strives for a “lost episode” quality. It is a monster hunt that happened between the adventures fans saw on screen. It is carefully plotted to situate itself into the context of Sam and Dean's familiar character arc.

The issue follows the formula of early Supernatural episodes, in the best possible way. Sam and Dean show up in a small town, learn of a mysterious death, and follow this lead until it brings them to a confrontation with a monster that needs hunting. In this case, an “imp," which Sam explains is a “demonspawn.”

This formula is necessarily compressed for the comic medium, but what that leads to is a lean, to-the-point Supernatural story that prioritizes Dean and Sam's brotherly dynamic over the action and spectacle of their fight with the Imp. In other words, exactly what constitutes the core of the best Supernatural TV episodes.

 Supernatural #1 sticks pretty close to the source material, though it does take a few interesting liberties. Most notably, the Winchesters aren't driving their trademark Impala; it is explained in the issue that the Impala is hidden, while they drive a stolen “loaner,” due to Dean's light credit card forgery.

The issue also introduces “Effie” a soulless, literally by the end of the issue, corporate C.E.O. who possibly knows more about John Winchester than his sons do, and who seems poised to pop back up as the series progresses. It's possible she could be a love interest for Dean, or perhaps the new villain author Greg Pak teased.

In any case, it is a solid start to Supernatural's new comic era, which returns to the original concept of the series, and the early days of Sam and Dean. Already, the comic is scratching the itch for Supernatural fans who wish there were just a few more episodes of Season 1.

Supernatural #1 is available now from Dynamite Entertainment.

Dr. Greer will provide an update on government disclosure related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) and Non-Human Intelligence (NHI).

Former U.S. Marine and whistleblower Michael Herrera will break his silence about witnessing an octogonal UAP craft hovering 20 feet off the ground while a clandestine recovery operation took place.

The event will take place November 8 – 9, 2025, at the company's state-of-the-art GaiaSphere Event Center in Boulder, Colorado. Tickets are now on sale for in-person attendance and the event can be streamed live and on demand globally with a Gaia+ membership.

Dr. Steven Greer will lead participants through ten comprehensive sessions covering Washington's UAP disclosure process, whistleblower testimony, CE5 (human-initiated ET contact) meditation techniques, remote viewing protocols, and Sanskrit puja ceremonies. The event will explore how to distinguish real ET encounters from manmade craft and advance peaceful contact with advanced civilizations.

"We are at a critical juncture in human history where the truth about UAPs and our contact with advanced extraterrestrial civilizations can no longer be suppressed," said Greer. "This event will equip attendees with the knowledge and tools to distinguish authentic ET contact from manmade phenomena, while learning the CE5 protocols that empower humanity to become the architects of peaceful interstellar contact. The whistleblower testimony you'll hear, including Michael Herrera's extraordinary firsthand account, represents just a fraction of what courageous insiders are now willing to reveal. Together, we are opening the door to a new era of cosmic citizenship and conscious evolution."

General admission tickets are $699 and include both immersive days.

A Gaia+ annual membership costs $299 and includes live and on-demand streaming access to this event, Dr. Greer's previous UAP event at the GaiaSphere, and 30 previous GaiaSphere events in total featuring luminaries like Joe Dispenza, Richard Rudd, and Gregg Braden — each valued at $299 or more.

Gaia+ also includes everything a standard membership offers, including 10,000+ documentaries, original series, and interviews, along with yoga and meditation classes for all levels. This makes Gaia+ the platform's best value for those seeking immersive guided programs to transform and heal their mind, body, and soul.

Philip Wyatt, a Buckhead hairdresser by trade, also has a side interest that is more unusual than, say, knitting or pickleball: He seeks spirit activity as the head of Georgia Paranormal Investigations.

The volunteer group solicits clients via social media and website georgiaparanormalinvestigations.net, though Wyatt isn't even sure calling them “clients” is proper since the group doesn't charge anything for its services.

Scientists have identified a statistical connection between nuclear tests and the appearance of unidentified flying objects. Researchers analyzed astronomical images from the mid-20th century and compared them with dates of atmospheric nuclear weapon explosions.

As reported by BAKU.WS with reference to Phys.org publication, within 24 hours after the tests, the probability of transient objects appearing increased by 45 percent, and each UFO report was accompanied by an 8.5 percent increase in the activity of such objects.

As part of the work, researchers studied images of the starry sky taken by the Palomar Observatory from 1949 to 1957. Scientists were looking for so-called transient objects - brief flashes visible in only one image and absent in subsequent ones. Researchers emphasize that the origin of these phenomena remains a mystery.

Meanwhile, theories about damaged photographic plates or the presence of atmospheric debris after explosions have been ruled out. Since observations were made before the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite in 1957, scientists consider it unlikely that the objects were of terrestrial origin. The research results were published in the journal Scientific Reports.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Turkish people on Republic Day. As reported by BAKU.W...

A psychic who claims she “saw heaven” after dying for three minutes and later began having visions says some people's soulmates “might be a ghost” and she believes singles should be “more open” to dating spirits this Halloween.

Sam O'Brien, 52, a psychic medium and healer from Berkshire, claims that during an operation when she was 21, she died and was greeted by her great-aunt in heaven, before being resuscitated.

Sam, a mother to Ashton, 21, says since then she has seen spirits and received visions that she believes predicted events such as the September 11 terror attack and death of Diana, Princess of Wales.

She said after “a spirit guided her” to share this gift when she was 30 years old, she turned her abilities into a full-time career, launching Angels Heavenly Healings, a space where people can receive “divine guidance” and reconnect with their loved ones.

She has also performed readings where she sensed “chemistry” between spirits and her clients.

With Halloween approaching, Sam believes people should be “more open” to dating a ghost and connecting with spiritual energy.

She even credits a ghost for connecting her with her partner, Clive, 62, a journalist, in 2014.

Sam told PA Real Life: “I would even say a ghost got me and my partner together – I wasn't going to go out one night, then had a vision that I should, and I met him that night.

“Soulmates exist and sometimes those soulmates don't come into your everyday life – they might be a ghost.

“You can still feel their energy.

“I feel truly honoured to walk this path helping others rediscover the same love, light and connection as I do with spirits.”

Sam had a cholecystectomy – a surgical procedure to remove her gallbladder – at age 17, in 1990, and was “very unwell” as a result.

Four years later when she was 21, she underwent a reconstructive surgery during which she said she died and was resuscitated.

She explained: “I passed over for three minutes, so I saw the doctors working on me from above and I literally saw heaven.

“I had my nan's sister, who I only met a few times, greet me on the other side.

“She was speaking to me – she said, ‘You are going to go back in your body'.

“Then suddenly I saw the doctors literally putting a stent in my neck from up above and suddenly I was back in my body.

“I wouldn't say it was traumatic because for me I had been given a new life.”

Sam claims she was then able to see “spirits floating around” in her day-to-day life.

She also said the spirits began putting images, “like a photograph or a snapshot”, into her head, which she believes predicted events.

She claims she had images relating to the New York Twin Towers terror attack, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and tsunamis weeks before they occurred.

When this happens she says: “I want to tell somebody about it so it can be stopped, but it's not physically possible, because the police don't want to know – they don't believe me.”

Sam, who previously worked as an interior designer, has done readings through her Angels Heavenly Healings business as a full-time job since she was 30.

“I had a feeling that I could save someone's life – they were in hospital and I told their mum not to turn off the life support machine, give it a few more days, and he ended up recovering,” Sam said.

“It feels very humbling and emotional – I know some people may not believe it but I do.”

During the Covid-19 pandemic, Sam claims she started seeing the numbers ‘444' everywhere, and had an “intense feeling” her brother was going to pass away.

“It came true and the numbers ‘444' were on the funeral car, it was quite scary and there was nothing I could do to stop it,” she said.

“But I feel him everyday – I believe he's still with me, and it's made me less fearful of death.

“Well, I'm not scared of death at all really, I think we go to a better place and it's just a case of moving on to the next life.”

When doing readings with clients, Sam has sometimes sensed “intense chemistry” from the spirit towards the person.

“I did a reading for a woman and I kept getting this spirit coming through all the time to her, and it was like the ghost wanted to date her, she felt this intense energy,” she recalled.

“I think a relationship between a spirit and person is just all about chemistry and energy.”

On October 30, 19 Crimes wine company is partnering with Sam to offer a free dating experience, Read and Buried, inviting singles to get the chance to date a ghost.

Sam said: “Dating today can feel soulless, so why not bring in a few actual souls?

“Whether you've been ghosted or just ghost-curious, Read and Buried is about breaking the dating rules, enjoying a new experience and maybe even making a supernatural connection.

“Love from a spirit is just as pure as love from a person in this world, and I think people should be more open minded about dating ghosts.

“I've never dated one but I think we shouldn't judge those that do.”

The event marks the continuation of 19 Crimes' partnership with Universal Products and Experiences, with the launch of a range of limited-edition glow-in-the-dark bottles for Halloween in the UK, featuring Frankenstein, the Bride of Frankenstein, and The Mummy.

In the tiny town of Villisca, Iowa, one house carries a sinister secret. 

Stepping inside 508 East Second Street takes you back to June 12, 1912, when the home belonged to the Moore family.

That fateful night, two neighbor girls, the Stillinger sisters, made the unfortunate choice of sleeping over.

None of them would ever wake up again. That night, all eight would be murdered with an ax.

Decades later, brave souls enter the house to learn the story and to experience the paranormal.

My curiosity brought me to a tour of the home led by property manager Kelly Mattson.

“This is where the Stillinger girls were found. Sadly, they were unrecognizable. The only way they could be identified was that their names were in their Bibles,” said Mattson.

A walk through the halls will send shivers down your spine and give you the feeling that time stopped when the murders took place.

“There's actually a mark here in the wall. This one led authority to believe the killer was left-handed. This is the way the upswing of it is,” said Mattson.

Even more chilling than the mark was entering the area where the murderer waited to strike.

It's believed that the killer hid in this attic that very night when eight different murders were committed throughout this house, going room by room, person to person—and to this day, over 100 years later, we still don't know who was behind it all.

What we do know is that visitors swear they come into contact with the paranormal.

“If you think of haunted, it happens. It's gotten to the point that footsteps and voices are normal—which is really crazy to say,” said Mattson.

KETV's assignment editor and paranormal investigator in her own right, Victoria Holley, came along to help me identify possible spirits in the house.

“If you hear a word, that might be a ghost trying to pick it out,” said Holley.

She came prepared with equipment that would put the Ghostbusters to shame.

“This is called a REM pod. The idea is that spirits can manipulate energy, so if something gets close to it, it'll tell you how close and how strong the electromagnetic field is,” said Holley.

Almost instantly, energy was picked up, setting off the REM pods throughout the house—from the baby's crib to the attic where the murderer waited to strike.

Now that there was a sign that spirits might actually be in the house, it was time to try and communicate.

“Is anyone in the room with us?” I asked.

We grabbed more advanced tools. This device is believed to allow souls to communicate by manipulating energy in a room to pull words from radio frequencies.

At first, our conversation seemed promising.

“Should I leave the house?" I questioned.

"Slowly," answered the machine.

But as I moved throughout the house, I stopped getting answers.

“Do you want me to leave?” I questioned again.

I was left with the sound of static.

I was down to one last tool. Similar to the radio, I'd ask a question, and it would talk back.

“Do you know what happened in this house?” I asked.

 “Friday," said the machine. 

"What happened Friday?" I asked

 "Help," the machine replied.

Again, it seemed like we might be making progress, sending me the signal that something was important.

“What's important?” I asked

At the very same time, the REM pod we left in the crib beeped off.  

Just when we thought we were going to get an answer related to the murders

I stopped receiving answers from the devices 

While we may not have actually seen any ghosts during our stay at the house, we felt their presence in every room. 

A place where eight innocent souls continue to rest to this day.
