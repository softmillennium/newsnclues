We previously identified an embryonic shift in the corticospinal motor neuronal transcriptome after spinal cord injury associated with successful axonal regeneration1. Exploiting this transcriptional regenerative ‘signature', here we used in silico screens to identify small molecules that generate similar shifts in the transcriptome, and identified thiorphan—a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor—as a lead candidate. We then infused thiorphan into the central nervous system beginning 2 weeks after severe C5 spinal cord contusions and, when combined with a neural stem cell graft, thiorphan elicited significant improvements in forelimb function (P < 0.005) and corticospinal regeneration (P < 0.05). Extending clinical relevance, thiorphan significantly increased neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neuronal cultures from a 56-year-old human. These findings represent a new path for drug discovery, starting from in silico screens to proof-of-concept in adult human brain cultures. There are no effective therapies for promoting neural repair after spinal cord injury (SCI), which represents a disorder of great unmet medical need. We reported recently that the corticospinal projection—the most important motor system for voluntary movement in humans—undergoes regression to an embryonic transcriptional state after adult SCI in mice1; in this state, the corticospinal axon regenerates into a neural stem cell graft placed in the site of the injury. Taking advantage of established bioinformatics approaches, in silico screens and medium-throughput model systems of adult motor cortex neuronal cultures2, we sought to identify drugs and small molecules that replicated the regenerative transcriptional state of the corticospinal neuron. First, we compared the injured and regenerating corticospinal transcriptome with a publicly available database of several thousand drugs and small molecules already tested in humans—the Connectivity Map3 (CMap). This in silico screen identified several compounds that mimicked, to varying degrees, the corticospinal regenerating transcriptome. A lead small molecule candidate, thiorphan (253 Da), known primarily as a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, exhibited the greatest efficacy in supporting total neurite outgrowth and longest neurite length in this medium-throughput screen. We then tested the ability of thiorphan to support axonal regeneration and functional recovery after severe, bilateral mid-cervical SCI in adult rats when delivered 2 weeks after SCI—a clinically relevant time point for intervention. Notably, thiorphan treatment combined with a neural progenitor cell (NPC) graft significantly improved functional recovery after SCI. Moreover, thiorphan administration significantly augmented corticospinal axon regeneration into stem cell grafts. Finally, pursuing the true translational potential of thiorphan, we tested its effects on primary cultures of adult cynomolgous monkey motor cortex and 56-year-old human cortex neurons: once again, thiorphan significantly increased neurite growth. Thus, a bioinformatics-driven approach combined with an in vitro screen, in vivo testing and primate in vitro confirmation represent a new pathway for drug discovery. We adopted a five-step pipeline to identify candidates for enhancing neural repair with a streamlined path that could lead to human testing (Fig. Step 1 involves characterizing the transcriptomic state or ‘signature' of a cell type that exhibits a beneficial biological effect. In this case, we used the transcriptome of corticospinal motor neurons that are capable of regeneration after SCI. We reported previously that, within 2 weeks of SCI, the corticospinal neuron undergoes transient transcriptional reversion to an embryonic state—a state in which it is capable of regenerating1. Drugs and small molecules in CMap have been exposed to various cell lines in vitro, and effects of these compounds on the transcriptome of the cultured cells have been characterized3. Thus, we searched CMap for compounds that generated transcriptomic shifts that parallel the state of regenerating corticospinal neurons. In Step 3, we took the lead candidates from the in silico screen and applied them to a medium-throughput in vitro assay consisting of cultures of adult motor cortex neurons; this screen became available only recently2 and provides what could be the most useful in vitro system for predicting potential in vivo effects in the mature nervous system, because the screen consists of adult rather than embryonic or postnatal neurons. To date, in vitro cellular screens of the nervous system consisted of either embryonic or early postnatal neuronal cultures, which may not accurately reflect responses of adult central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Immortalized neural cell lines4 suffer from similar limitations. Although adult dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons can be cultured routinely, these cells exhibit fundamentally different transcriptomes before and after injury1,5,6 and, again, might not be accurate tools for predicting therapeutic benefits of candidate therapies for injured brain and spinal cord motor neurons. Induced pluripotent stem cells or neurons induced from other cell types also often exhibit early cellular markers7. Cultures of adult neurons therefore may represent the most optimal in vitro screen developed for clinical translation2. Finally, Step 5 consists of validating candidate compounds in cultures of adult primate cortical neurons, including human adult cortex. This step follows rather than precedes in vivo testing because of the scarcity of the primate and human neuronal resource: normal human neurons in particular are available only occasionally from surgical specimens and in our case were obtained from an individual undergoing tumour resection through a cortical window, where pathology confirmed the cortical biopsy was normal tissue. a, Drug discovery pipeline consisting of five steps: (1) creation of a transcriptomic dataset; (2) in silico analysis using CMap; (3) medium-throughput in vitro screen; (4) in vivo testing of lead candidate(s); and (5) in vitro monkey and human validation. b, In silico analysis shows ranking of compounds in CMap on the basis of connectivity score (left y axis), specificity score (blue, right y axis) and reliability score (green, right y axis) (see text for further detail). c, Neurite extension in composite image of cortical neurons treated with DMSO control and thiorphan (250 μM), Tuj1 labelling. d,e, In vitro screen of top three ‘hits' from in silico screen, together with predicted negative modulator, adiphenine. Tested in cultures of adult mouse primary cortical neurons for 5 days in vitro, three independent biological replicates were performed on separate days, each using neurons from four adult mice. For each condition, data from all neurons measured across replicates were combined to yield n = 200 neurons per condition. Each neuron was spatially separated and analysed as an independent observation. Total neurite outgrowth per cell (Tuj1 labelling) is shown for each condition. Median values: DMSO (82.9); thiorphan (90.7, 99.8, 132.4, 166.1); triflusal (74.3, 61.7, 94.5, 124.5); milrinone (78.9, 77.4, 68.5, 75.5); adiphenine (74.4, 44.5, 31.7, 3) (d). Maximum neurite length per cell is shown for each condition. Median values: DMSO (93.3); thiorphan (111.1, 105.4, 122.1, 128); triflusal (84.4, 85, 104.9, 114.3); milrinone (100.6, 81.7, 79, 78.6); adiphenine (87.4, 60, 30.6, 6.23) (e). Step 1 was accomplished in this study by using our previous data describing the transcriptome of the regenerating corticospinal neuron1, as referenced above. In silico analysis directly followed the original methodology of Lamb et al.3, identifying several compounds that most closely matched the expression profile of the regenerating corticospinal system (Fig. A ‘connectivity score' with a value between +1 and −1 described the similarity between the corticospinal transcriptomic profile and an individual compound's transcriptomic profile, where +1 was most similar and −1 was least similar to the corticospinal dataset (Fig. We further calculated a ‘reliability score' for each compound that takes into account the connectivity score, P value, false detection rate (FDR), ‘instance count' (number of experiments that include the compound), non-null score (the ratio of experiments that have a consistent score based on most experiments) and ‘specificity score' derived from the distribution of enrichment scores for gene lists from MSigDB; see Methods for a more detailed description of the reliability score. The top compounds that met the criteria of highest enrichment, reliability and specificity scores were considered ‘hits' in this assay and included: quinostatin (highest enrichment score +0.91 ± 0.07), thiorphan (+0.86 ± 0.11), triflusal (+0.79 ± 0.13) and milrinone (+0.78 ± 0.18), whereas adiphenine was the most negatively correlated (−0.78 ± 0.18; Fig. Biological annotation (Methods) indicated that quinostatin inhibits PI3 kinase; thiorphan is a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor; triflusal inhibits nuclear factor κB, phosphodiesterase and COX1, and milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. Quinostatin was not available for purchase and attempts at synthesis did not yield adequate quality compound. Thiorphan has been characterized primarily as a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor targeting neprilysin8. It has also been linked to neuroprotective properties in models of perinatal excitotoxic brain lesions9 and diabetic retinopathy10, and has β-amyloid degrading properties11. Thiorphan, milrinone and triflusal were taken forward as positive candidates, and adiphenine was used as a negative control. We assessed the lead candidate compounds in dissociated cultures of the adult (postnatal day 60) mouse motor cortex2. An average of 10,000 neurons per single motor cortex were obtained, and we quantified total neurite outgrowth and maximal neurite length per cell 5 days after exposure to the candidate compounds. 1d,e), including the predicted negative modifier of corticospinal growth, adiphenine. Significant overall differences in neurite outgrowth were present using various compounds (drug type × dose interaction generalized estimating equation for total neurite outgrowth, Wald chi-square = 60.67, P < 0.0001; drug type × dose interaction generalized estimating equation for total maximum neurite length, Wald chi-square = 227.78, P < 0.0001). Thiorphan stood out as most effective both in measures of total neurite outgrowth and neurite length: at a dose of 250 μM it increased total neurite outgrowth by 80% compared with controls (post hoc generalized estimating equation, Wald chi-square = 29.69, P < 0.001; Fig. 1d,e) and longest neurite length by 30% (post hoc generalized estimating equation, Wald chi-square = 12.62, P < 0.001; Fig. The effect of thiorphan was dose dependent, with peak effects occurring at doses between 100 μM and 250 μM. The effect of the next candidate drug for enhancing corticospinal regeneration, triflusal, was more modest, with an increase in neurite outgrowth of 30% at its peak dose of 250 μM with no significant change in longest neurite length; none of these changes reached statistical significance (Fig. The third candidate in rank order, milrinone, did not significantly influence either total neurite outgrowth or longest neurite length at any dose (Fig. Validating the in silico screening process, the predicted negative regulator of corticospinal growth, adiphenine, strongly and significantly reduced total neurite outgrowth and longest neurite length in a dose-dependent manner (post hoc generalized estimating equation, P < 0.001; Fig. Adult Fischer 344 rats underwent severe contusive bilateral cervical SCI at the C5 spinal cord segment; mid-cervical lesions are the most common levels of human injury12 (Supplementary Fig. We then waited 2 weeks—a clinically relevant time to delay intervention to allow subject recovery from the acute effects of injury (Fig. We tested diluent + NPC grafts as a positive control in this lesion model because these cells support axonal regeneration into the lesion site, the formation of new neural relays across the injury site and partial functional recovery13,14. We also compared thiorphan alone with NPCs. The combination of thiorphan + NPCs aimed to determine whether effects of both treatments were additive, thereby representing a method of further augmenting recovery after severe cervical SCI. Thiorphan was infused continuously into the left motor cortex because it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. Infusions continued for 4 weeks starting 2 weeks after injury at a dose of 100 mM (0.25 μl h−1), based on extrapolation of in vitro dosing to in vivo dosing15. An in vivo neprilysin cleavage assay confirmed the bioactivity of intraparenchymal motor cortex infusions of thiorphan over 1, 2 and 4 weeks (Supplementary Fig. Spinal cord NPC grafts were obtained from Fischer 344 embryonic-day-14 (E14) spinal cords as reported previously16 and injected through the dura into the lesion cavity 2 weeks post SCI (Fig. Two weeks before euthanasia, the corticospinal projection was traced anterogradely using an AAV9-CAG–Ruby2sm_Flag. b, Nissl stain of a severe C5 bilateral contusion model. Top, large contusion cavity in an ungrafted animal after 3 months. Bottom, NPC graft filling the lesion cavity and providing substrate for potential corticospinal axon regeneration. c, Skilled forelimb successful pellet retrieval with right paw on Montoya staircase23 ± s.e.m. Animals that received thiorphan and a substrate for axonal regeneration into the lesion site—an NPC graft—exhibit significant functional recovery over time compared with lesioned controls (P = 0.005, group × time interaction, Poisson generalized linear model). Treatment with thiorphan alone also trended towards significance (P = 0.14). The lesion model applied in this experiment is the most severe that we have tested, and NPC grafts also exhibited a trend towards better outcomes than lesioned controls but this did not reach statistical significance. Grey shading, period of thiorphan infusion into cortex. d, Thiorphan + NPC graft group also exhibits significant recovery of pellet retrieval accuracy in this severe lesion model (P = 0.001). Other treated groups trend towards improved outcomes compared with lesioned controls. Twelve weeks after SCI, animals treated with thiorphan + NPC grafts exhibited a significant, twofold improvement in forelimb grasping success (number of pellets grasped and eaten) after severe mid-cervical SCI compared with lesioned controls (Poisson generalized linear model, Wald chi-square = 7.92, P = 0.005; Fig. Recipients of thiorphan alone or NPC grafts alone exhibited lesser degrees of forelimb recovery compared with lesioned controls that did not reach statistical significance (Poisson generalized linear model, Wald chi-square = 2.16, P = 0.14 comparing thiorphan with lesion alone, and Wald chi-square = 2.07, P = 0.15 comparing grafts-only with lesion alone; Fig. The accuracy of pellet retrieval (percentage of pellets grasped that are eaten) also improved significantly in animals that received thiorphan + NPC grafts (Gamma generalized linear model, Wald chi-square = 10.13, P = 0.001) compared with lesioned controls (60% accuracy versus 30% accuracy; Fig. Thus, as suggested by in silico and subsequent in vitro screens, thiorphan significantly improves functional outcomes when combined with neural stem cell grafts to sites of SCI by enhancing the potency of NPC grafting. To examine anatomical mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of thiorphan infusion on functional outcomes, we assessed corticospinal axon regeneration into stem cell grafts occupying the lesion site. Previously, we have shown that corticospinal axons regenerate into NPC grafts placed into sites of SCI and form synapses. Further, grafted NPC neurons extend axons from the lesion site to host neurons below the lesion and form synapses; consequently, new neural relays are formed across the lesion that support functional improvement13,16,17,18,19. In the present experiment, thiorphan significantly increased corticospinal regeneration into grafts by 60% (P < 0.05; Fig. 3a,c,e) compared with individuals that received NPC grafts alone (Fig. Thiorphan administration in the absence of NPC grafts could not promote corticospinal regeneration into the lesion cavity because there was no cellular substrate onto which injured corticospinal axons could extend. Thin plane confocal microscopy showed colocalization of corticospinal axon terminals with synaptophysin apposed onto grafted neurons, indicating putative synapse formation from regenerating host axons to grafted neurons (Fig. Nearly all grafted animals in this experiment exhibited complete graft filling of the lesion cavity (Supplementary Fig. Cortical infusion of thiorphan over 4 weeks caused no damage or neuronal loss in the motor cortex (Supplementary Fig. a, CST axons labelled anterogradely with Flag (red) show greater regeneration into E14 neural progenitor stem cell grafts (green (green fluorescent protein (GFP))) in animals with thiorphan cortical infusions. The white dotted line indicates the host–graft interface; the boxed region is shown at higher magnification in c. b, Fewer corticospinal axons regenerate into animals that did not receive thiorphan cortical infusions. The white dotted line indicates the host–graft interface; the boxed region is shown at higher magnification in d. c,d, Higher magnification views of the boxed regions in a (c) and b (d) showing regenerating corticospinal axons. e, Corticospinal regeneration into graft occupying lesion site is increased 1.6-fold in the presence of thiorphan infusion into the motor cortex (*P < 0.05, two-tailed t-test). In the absence of a graft, no host axons are present in the lesion site; non-grafted animals could not be quantified. f, Regenerating host corticospinal axons form putative synapses with grafted neurons, based on colocalization of regenerating CST (red) with synaptophysin (SYN, white) apposed to grafted neuron (GFP, green). Arrows indicate the exact orthogonal view intersection point, single plane. We also examined whether thiorphan treatment influenced corticospinal axonal sprouting above the lesion site: there were no significant differences in corticospinal axon density among the four animal groups (Supplementary Fig. Although thiorphan was administered into the motor cortex, we also examined whether there was a difference in the growth of serotonergic or sensory (calcitonin gene-related-peptide-labelled) axons into the graft; as expected, there was no difference between thiorphan + NPC graft and the diluent + NPC grafted groups (Supplementary Fig. We further examined whether thiorphan administration into the cortex influenced the host–graft glial border (glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity); it did not (Supplementary Fig. Finally, we examined whether thiorphan administration into the cortex affected graft differentiation: it did not (Supplementary Fig. 7d–k); as expected, neither did it affect graft-derived axon extension into the host (Supplementary Fig. Thus, beneficial effects of thiorphan administration were detectable on the corticospinal system to which it was targeted. The final step in this process, Step 5, extended the clinical relevance of this work by determining whether thiorphan can also promote growth from adult primate motor cortex and human cortical neurons (Fig. This step is performed last because these samples—particularly normal human cortex samples—are highly valuable. Human participant approval was obtained for these procedures. 2, and treated with 100 μM thiorphan for 5 days in vitro (two replicates). These cultures are free of NPCs when assessed by markers such as Nestin and Sox2. Thiorphan treatment significantly increased total neurite outgrowth by 36% (P < 0.001) and maximum neurite length by 61% (P < 0.0001) compared with control conditions (Fig. We then proceeded to culture the human cortex: normal cortex from the middle temporal gyrus of a 56-year-old man was obtained from biopsy, the tissue was dissociated and neuronal cultures established (adapted from ref. Treatment with 100 μM thiorphan for 5 days in vitro (Fig. 4d–f) resulted in a significant increase in total neurite outgrowth by 30.3% ± 7.3% (P < 0.0001) compared with control conditions. Thiorphan also exhibited a significant increase in longest neurite length by 23.0% ± 9.4% (P = 0.016) compared with controls. a, Thiorphan significantly increased total neurite outgrowth from primary cultures of adult cynomolgus macaque motor cortex labelled for Tuj (***P < 0.001, two-tailed t-test). Each point represents the total neurite length of individual neurons. Samples were run as technical duplicates, with neurons cultured for 5 days. b, Thiorphan treatment also significantly increased the maximum neurite length per cell by 1.8-fold (****P < 0.0001, two-tailed t-test). c, Representative images of cultures of adult primate motor cortex treated with diluent or thiorphan. d, Thiorphan significantly increased total neurite outgrowth from primary cultures of normal 56-year-old human cortex neurons labelled for Tuj (****P < 0.0001, two-tailed t-test). Each point represents the total neurite length of one neuron. e, Thiorphan treatment of human cortical neurons also significantly increased the maximum neurite length per cell (**P < 0.01, two-tailed t-test). f, Representative images of 56-year-old human cortical neurons in culture labelled for Tuj1. g, RNA sequencing was performed on cultures of adult primary motor cortex from rhesus monkeys treated for 5 days with thiorphan or vehicle (DMSO). h, Gene ontology of these 177 genes demonstrates clear enrichment for developmental processes (Gene Ontology database24, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10536401). i, To identify in vivo mechanisms recruited by thiorphan treatment, rat brains were removed after 2 weeks of thiorphan infusion and compared with diluent-infused controls. Thiorphan treatment increased immunolabelling for both BDNF and phospho-AKT in the infused motor cortex, reflecting a shift to a state that is developmental and pro-regenerative. Thiorphan was identified as a potential candidate for improving axonal growth after CNS injury by virtue of its ability to shift the cellular transcriptome to an embryonic, pro-growth state. To assess whether this mechanism was actually recruited in neuronal target cells, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of macaque M1 motor cortex cells exposed to thiorphan for 5 days in vitro compared with control cultures lacking thiorphan exposure (Fig. Because we had one sample of thiorphan-treated and one sample of vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO))-treated cells, we compared mRNA species changing ± 1.5 log2 units between the two samples: 177 genes reached this cut-off threshold (Supplementary Fig. Gene ontology of these 177 genes identified 29 biological processes and remarkably, 16 of these 29 were related to development, including neuron development, nervous system development, and synapse assembly (Fig. To further examine mechanisms associated with thiorphan delivery, we infused it intracortically for two weeks in rats and performed immunolabelling of the infused region compared with animals that received vehicle infusions: thiorphan administration resulted in increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Fig. 4i) in the infused region, paralleling higher levels of these molecules observed both in neural development and successful regeneration. These findings support a mechanistic framework in which thiorphan modifies the developmental, metabolic and signalling state of cells to impact neuronal regeneration, consistent with its initial identification on the basis of its ability to replicate the effects of SCI in driving neurons developmentally backward towards a state of embryonic development. We report the identification of a new and effective drug treatment for SCI arising from an analytical pipeline that targets the regenerative transcriptome of the adult corticospinal motor system. Notably, thiorphan was selected from a database of compounds that have already been tested in human clinical trials, facilitating potential clinical translation. Direct thiorphan infusion into the motor cortex was safe and effective in this experiment, and effects on neurite outgrowth were confirmed in adult rhesus monkey and human cortical cultures. Future studies will determine whether thiorphan exhibits efficacy after intrathecal administration, or after systemic administration because there is transient breakdown of the blood–brain barrier after SCI20. In addition, newly synthesized derivatives of thiorphan with improved blood–brain barrier permeability can be developed to simplify administration for clinical trials. A previous study used in silico screens to identify compounds improving neural repair after peripheral nerve injury, based on dissection of whole DRG including neurons and support cells. The compound ambroxol was identified, which exhibited relatively modest effects in improving peripheral and optic nerve regeneration and cortical sprouting in a model of stroke, without evidence of functional efficacy6,21. By contrast, the present study started with a transcriptional dataset obtained from a specific neuronal population that is critical for human voluntary movement after SCI—layer V corticospinal neurons—rather than a general neuronal and glial RNA-seq dataset. We then used a CMap enrichment method3 to more deeply probe the CMap dataset that led to the identification of thiorphan, triflusal and milrinone as the most likely potential mimics of the specific corticospinal regeneration transcriptome. We then used a new medium-throughput assay to test candidate drugs in the most faithful potential assay of adult brain neural injury examined to date: cultures of adult motor cortex neurons. Other lead candidates (for example, triflusal, milrinone) did not increase neurite outgrowth, suggesting that a rigorous in vitro assay is essential to validate in silico targets, as in silico models may not fully capture the complexity of cellular responses. Moreover, thiorphan exhibited significant effects on neurite outgrowth of adult human neurons, supporting clinical translation. This platform can be applied broadly to other CNS disorders, potentially yielding several new candidate drugs to treat CNS injury and neurodegenerative disorders using compounds that have already been tested in humans for other indications and have yielded evidence of safety. A lack of safety results in the failure of up to one-half of human clinical trials22, and the current pipeline can de-risk new drug development considerably. Thiorphan induced recovery of motor function when combined with a neural stem cell graft to a site of severe cervical SCI. This improvement occurred within 2 weeks—a timeframe in which host corticospinal axons have already regenerated into stem cell grafts1 and stem cell grafts have extended axons into the host cord below the lesion; indeed, stem cell implants extend axons rapidly into the host beginning 3 days after implantation16. Without a stem cell graft in the lesion site, there would be no cellular substrate onto which axons could regenerate into the lesion site with or without thiorphan administration. This presumably supported the formation of greater numbers of neural relays across the lesion site13,16,17,18,19 that, in turn, facilitated functional recovery. The lack of statistically significant recovery in our graft-alone group (P = 0.15) highlights the challenge of achieving forelimb functional restoration in this severe model. In previous studies, we used less severe lesion models and found that stem cells alone induced significant functional recovery. Yet in the present more severe lesion, the addition of thiorphan yielded significant and meaningful functional recovery. Administration of thiorphan in vivo to rats with SCI resulted in elevated levels of BDNF and phospho-AKT in neurons, paralleling higher levels of these molecules observed during neural development. Confirmation that thiorphan actually induces complete reversion of corticospinal neurons to an embryonic transcriptional state1 would require RNA-seq studies after in vivo infusions, and these were not performed. RNA sequencing of adult motor cortex cultures from macaque monkeys following thiorphan exposure did indicate a development shift in transcriptional state. Nonetheless, the link between thiorphan treatment and transcriptional change is indirect. A pipeline of advanced in silico analysis coupled with improved in vitro screens identify the drug thiorphan as a candidate for the treatment of SCI. This platform can be adopted across nervous system disease states to accelerate the development of new therapies for human neurological disorders.

(2025)Cite this article Ion-channel activity reflects a combination of open probability and unitary conductance1. Many channels display subconductance states that modulate signalling strength2,3, yet the structural mechanisms governing conductance levels remain incompletely understood. Here we report that conductance levels are controlled by the bending patterns of pore-forming transmembrane helices in the heterotetrameric neuronal channel GluN1a-2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Our single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analyses demonstrate that an endogenous neurosteroid and synthetic positive allosteric modulator (PAM), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), binds to a juxtamembrane pocket in the GluN2B subunit and stabilizes the fully open-gate conformation, where GluN1a M3 and GluN2B M3′ pore-forming helices are bent to dilate the channel pore. By contrast, EU1622-240 binds to the same GluN2B juxtamembrane pocket and a distinct juxtamembrane pocket in GluN1a to stabilize a sub-open state whereby only the GluN2B M3′ helix is bent. Consistent with the varying extents of gate opening, the single-channel recordings predominantly show full-conductance and subconductance states in the presence of 24S-HC and EU1622-240, respectively. Another class of neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate, engages a similar GluN2B pocket, but two molecules bind simultaneously, revealing a diverse neurosteroid recognition pattern. Our study identifies that the juxtamembrane pockets are critical structural hubs for modulating conductance levels in NMDAR.

At Site-1, the hydroxyl group at the tip of 24S-HC and the sulfate group of PS reside in a similar area surrounded by GluN2B pre-M1' and M1'. 24S-HC binds parallel to GluN2B M1' helix, while PS wedges into the GluN2B M2' and M3' helices. At Site-2, the ketone group of PS overlaps with the phospholipid acyl group (grey). b, Concentration-responses of 24S-HC in the presence of various concentrations of PS. For each PS concentration, EC50 values with 95% CI were 531 nM (([411 nM, 941 nM], 2 µM PS), 568 nM (([383 nM, 2.2 µM], 10 µM PS), 714 nM (([444 nM, 2.25 µM], 50 µM PS). The Hillslope was 1.19 for 2 µM, 1.14 for 10 µM, and 0.768 for 50 µM. Experiments were done with six or seven individual oocytes per PS concentration. Data for 0 μM PS condition were previously shown in Fig. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM. a, Superposition of the 24S-HC stabilized open (deep teal) and closed (grey) structures. Binding of 24S-HC at the GluN2B juxtamembrane pocket favours movement of GluN2B pre-M1' (dotted arrow). This pre-M1' movement is essential to accommodate the bending of the pore-forming GluN2B M3' helices. b, Conformational coupling of LBDs and TMDs in GluN1 (upper panel) and GluN2B (lower panel). Shown here are the superpositions of the closed (grey) and open (magenta and deep teal) states. The Cα atoms of the gating ring residues, right above the channel gate, for GluN1a (Ile664) and GluN2B (Gln662), are shown as spheres. Note the substantial positional shift of GluN2B Gln662 residues between open and closed states, contrasted with the minimal displacement of GluN1a Ile664 residues (dotted lines). a, In the closed state, the channel is highly constricted at both VIVI-gate and the Asn-ring. b, In the sub-open state, the channel is dilated at the VIVI-gate, with partial dilation at the Asn-ring. Arrows on the model represent the kinked region of the GluN2B M3' helices. c, All-atom potential of mean force (PMF) calculation of the free energy for Na+ ions around the TMD region of the 24S-HC-bound fully open state. The wider pore radius at the Thr-ring in the fully open state (2.2 Å in the sub-open state, 3.0 Å in the fully open state) corresponds to a modest energy barrier (~ 1.7 kcal mol−1) that permits Na+ permeation without stable binding, whereas the Asn-ring displays favourable free energy consistent with its role as a secondary gate. PMF calculation of EU1622-240-bound GluN1a-2B was adapted from ref. a, Cross-section of the channel pore of the closed (left), sub-open (middle), and fully open (right) states of GluN1a-2B NMDAR.

The structure of the PS-bound structures in the non-active and pre-active states viewed from the side (upper panels) and top (lower panels) of the TMDs. The pre-active state shows a greater distance between the GluN2B Gln662 residues compared to the non-active state due to the GluN1a-2B LBD dimer rotations (curved arrows). In both cases, the channel gate remains closed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It won't catch any fish, but the discovery of as many as 20,000 silver coins and pieces of jewelry dates back to the early Middle Ages. A Swedish fisherman searching for gooey, juicy worms to use as bait near his summer home near Stockholm instead struck something far more solid (and much less interesting to fish): a copper cauldron brimming with coins and jewelry. In total, the find comprised 13 pounds of early Middle Ages silver. “This is probably one of the largest silver treasures from the early Middle Ages that has been found in Sweden,” Sofia Andersson, antiquarian at the Stockholm County Administrative Board, said in a translated statement. “We do not yet know exactly how many coins there are, but I believe it could be upward of 20,000.” These coins were minted during Knut Eriksson's reign as Sweden's king near the end of the 12th century, from around 1173 to 1195. This period of the region's history was marked by conflict, and as a result—as Lin Annerbäck, director of Stockholm's Medieval Museum, told the Swedish-languageDagens Nyheter—the buried treasure may have been an attempt by a wealthy family to hide their valuables during a time of uncertainty. Andersson said that the new treasure features several such coins, where a bishop is depicted holding a shepherd's crook in his right hand. Many of the coins feature uneven cut edges and raised designs on their faces—one particularly eye-catching example features a building, which is likely a church—and some are adorned with decorative dotted borders. Under Swedish law, anyone that discovers ancient silver (or gold, bronze, or another copper alloy, for that matter) must report it to the state. He walks away with far more than worms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Powered by entangled qubits in superposition, these high-tech machines can perform many calculations at once, drastically improving computing time when compared to classic supercomputers. Just last week, for instance, Google announced that the company's quantum computer could run algorithms some 13,000 times faster than its classical counterpart. But even Superman has his kryptonite—and the same can be said for quantum computers. Usually, these weaknesses play out on the engineering side of things. This is the chief reason why today's quantum computers can barely inch past the 1,000-qubit mark, and current estimates suggest that a 20 million-qubit quantum computer would be needed to break classical cryptography. In other words, there are some problems that even quantum computers can't solve, and it could be that these questions are fundamentally unsolvable. “They're like a nightmare scenario that would be very bad if it appears,” Schuster tells New Scientist. This work is a follow-up to Schuster's recent study, published earlier this year in the journal Science, which focused on improving randomness in quantum computers. Simulating randomness helps scientists understand real-world phenomena and design algorithms. The team was able to generate randomness with fewer operations than were previously necessary, which could indicate that it's possible to create quantum computers focused on cryptography much more easily that was expected. However, within this research, Schuster and his team probed a deeper question behind the work: What are the possible computational limits of these machines? “Our results show that several fundamental physical properties—evolution time, phases of matter, and causal structure— are probably hard to learn through conventional quantum experiments,” the authors noted in a press statement at the time. “This raises profound questions about the nature of physical observation itself.” We May Have Been Wrong About the Origin of Life</p>

MRI is among the breakthrough technologies that emerged from fundamental, curiosity-driven science.Credit: Wladimir Bulgar/SPL Around the world, budgets for fundamental research — studies that seek primarily to advance knowledge for its own sake, without an expectation of a return on investment — are coming under pressure to an extent not seen for at least a generation. And US President Donald Trump has proposed slashing its budget by 55%. Meanwhile, in the European Union, competition for funding will only worsen if the bloc implements a misguided plan to include defence and security research in its Horizon Europe programme, which has previously funded only civil research projects. But elsewhere, as global conflict and pressure on public spending grows, we are hearing funders from Australia to the United Kingdom argue that research with a direct real-world impact — ideally economic — is preferable to fundamental research. It describes world-changing ‘blue skies' research that was mostly or entirely about acquiring knowledge, and only later found to have wider applications. In some cases, such discoveries have improved or saved millions of lives. Flat-screen televisions have their roots in studies of chemicals that were isolated from carrots. The News Feature covers seven prominent examples, but there are numerous others. In the twentieth century, many scientists performed research work alongside their teaching and administrative duties without needing to apply for the large grants that are now a staple of research systems, particularly in high-income countries. That is right and proper: no one wants to see taxpayers' monies being misspent. But world-changing discoveries often occur unexpectedly and are built on years — or decades — of fundamental research that expanded our knowledge of the world and how it works. But before those decisions are made, two myths should be dispelled: that fundamental science is less important than other types of research, and that it has no long-term impact. The discoveries described in our News Feature are a timely and necessary reminder that funding decisions should not neglect the painstaking, long-term studies that have proved, time and time again, to be foundational to knowledge, progress and, ultimately, the betterment of society.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Climate change and human-made shelters have created survivable habitat for the cold-adapted mosquito species Culiseta annulata. Out of all creatures on Earth, mosquitoes are arguably the least lovable. Every year, roughly 700,000 people die from mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue, yellow fewer, and malaria (which claims the lion's share of fatalities). But as the world gradually warms due to climate change, these pesky parasites have finally been able to infiltrate one of the last places that remained mosquito-free. Earlier this month, experts confirmed that Iceland has finally fallen prey to the blood-sucking menace of mosquitoes. With mosquitoes finally found in Iceland, Antarctica is now the only mosquito-free landmass on Earth. “At dusk on the evening of October 16th, I caught sight of a strange fly on a red wine ribbon,” said Hjaltason. Wine roping is a popular method of attracting insects (particularly moths). “I immediately suspected what was going on and quickly collected the fly. Iceland's arctic conditions are one reason why mosquitoes have failed to secure a foothold on the island, but it isn't the only reason. The mosquito Aedes nigripes, for example, hibernates beneath ice as a pupa to survive winters in Greenland. But Icelandic winters are more variable, which can cause sudden rises in temperature that kickstart the mosquito life cycle without providing sufficient time to complete it. Culiseta annulata, however, opts to camp out in human-made structures (like outbuildings and basements) until warmer temperatures return. And for Iceland, those warming temperatures are only increasing. In other words, more mosquitoes are coming—whether we like them or not.

Sleep deprivation rapidly disrupts cognitive function and in the long term contributes to neurological disease. Why sleep deprivation has such profound effects on cognition is not well understood. Here we use simultaneous fast fMRI–EEG to test how sleep deprivation modulates cognitive, neural and fluid dynamics in the human brain. We demonstrate that attentional failures during wakefulness after sleep deprivation are tightly orchestrated in a series of brain–body changes, including neuronal shifts, pupil constriction and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow pulsations, pointing to a coupled system of fluid dynamics and neuromodulatory state. CSF flow and hemodynamics are coupled to attentional function within the awake state, with CSF pulsations following attentional impairment. The timing of these dynamics is consistent with a vascular mechanism regulated by neuromodulatory state. The attentional costs of sleep deprivation may thus reflect an irrepressible need for rest periods driven by a central neuromodulatory system that regulates both neuronal and fluid physiology. Sleep plays a fundamental role in maintaining brain health and preserving cognitive performance. Despite the intense biological need for sleep, sleep deprivation is a major facet of modern life. A single night of lost sleep can cause noticeable cognitive impairment, including attentional failures, in which individuals fail to properly react to an easily detected external stimulus1,2,3. The behavioral deficits caused by sleep deprivation carry a major cost for organismal survival; for example, a momentary lapse in attention while driving a car can have life-threatening outcomes4. Sleep deprivation reliably induces attentional failures despite this cost, suggesting that these deficits reflect an unavoidable need of the brain for sleep. However, the neural basis of sleep deprivation-induced attentional failures is not yet well understood. Acute sleep deprivation has widespread effects on both local and global aspects of neurophysiology. Large fluctuations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals appear across various networks following sleep deprivation5,6, and large-scale fMRI signals are linked to altered electrophysiology, eyelid closures7,8,9 and arousal state, suggesting global changes in brain activity and vigilance. Attentional lapses after sleep deprivation are linked to reduced activity within the thalamus and cognitive control areas, suggesting a failure to engage large-scale network activity10,11. At the scale of local cortical areas, attentional failures are linked to sleep-like low-frequency waves in isolated cortical patches in rats12. Intriguingly, transient occurrences of sleep-like slow wave activity also predict attentional lapses in humans13,14. Together, these findings have shown that attentional deficits following sleep deprivation are linked to brain-wide hemodynamic changes and low-frequency neural oscillations. The neural basis of these attentional failures is not well understood. One possibility is that attentional lapses correspond to a brief state in which the brain transiently carries out a sleep-dependent function that is incompatible with waking behavior. Sleep serves many functional purposes, and sleep neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that sleep is linked to not only neuronal but also vascular and fluid changes in the brain. Global low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) hemodynamic waves appear in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and these vascular fluctuations in turn drive pulsatile waves of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow15,16. Sleep deprivation increases the amplitude of the global BOLD signal6, and sleep deprivation modulates CSF pulsatility17, suggesting that the effects of sleep deprivation could be accompanied by altered CSF dynamics. However, precisely how attentional deficits are linked to hemodynamics and CSF flow is not yet clear. We conducted a within-subject total sleep deprivation study in healthy human participants to investigate whether sleep deprivation and its associated attentional deficits are linked to altered brain fluid dynamics. We used multimodal fast fMRI, electroencephalography (EEG), behavioral assessments and pupillometry to track multiple aspects of neurophysiological dynamics simultaneously. We discovered that CSF flow is coupled to behavioral deficits during wakefulness after sleep deprivation. Notably, we found that attentional failures during wakefulness are marked by a brain- and body-wide state change that underlies both behavioral deficits and pulsatile fluid flow. Specifically, the moments where attention fails occur just before the initiation of a global hemodynamic event and a large-scale outward pulse of CSF flow, followed by subsequent reversal of these dynamics. To investigate how sleep deprivation modulates neural activity and vascular and CSF dynamics, we performed a simultaneous EEG and fast fMRI experiment in 26 human participants. To enable within-subject comparisons, each participant was scanned twice: once after a night of regular sleep (well-rested) and once after one night of total sleep deprivation, which was continuously supervised in the laboratory (Fig. We performed simultaneous EEG–fMRI scans with pupillometry in the morning. During the scans, participants performed up to four runs of a sustained attention task, the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT; Fig. 1b), followed by an eyes-closed resting-state run. This fast fMRI protocol enabled us to simultaneously measure cortical hemodynamic BOLD signals and CSF inflow in the fourth ventricle (Fig. For both visits, scans were performed around 10:00 a.m. in the morning. Scans included up to four PVT runs followed by a 25-min resting-state run. b, For the PVT attention task, each run used either the auditory PVT (aPVT; detecting a beep) or the visual PVT (vPVT; detecting a luminance-matched visual stimulus) with 5 to 10 s interstimulus interval (ISI). c, Left, example fMRI acquisition volume position (green box) for simultaneous measurement of BOLD and CSF flow. Yellow marks the cortical segmentation, and purple indicates the flow measurement region of interest (ROI). The image was masked to delete identifiers. Right, example placement of a CSF ROI (magenta) in the fourth ventricle in one representative participant. d, CSF time series from the same participant during wakefulness showing that sleep deprivation causes large CSF waves during wakefulness, whereas the well-rested condition shows smaller CSF flow. e, Sleep deprivation increased low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) CSF power during wakefulness (wake segments: n = 486 in well-rested, n = 205 in sleep-deprived; N1 segments: n = 179 in well-rested, n = 59 in sleep-deprived; N2 segments: n = 57 in well-rested, n = 40 in sleep-deprived; the black bar indicates P = 0.0004; two-tailed segment-level permutation test with a Bonferroni correction) to a magnitude similar to N1 and N2 sleep. Power spectral density (PSD) was calculated on CSF signal in resting-state runs. Data are presented as mean values ± s.e. f, Paired analysis of EEG low-frequency power (slow wave activity: 0.5–4 Hz) in resting-state wakefulness showing increased power after sleep deprivation (n = 18 participants with artifact-free wakefulness at both sessions; two-tailed paired t-test: t17 = –2.37, P = 0.029). g, Paired analysis of gray matter BOLD low-frequency power in resting-state wakefulness showing increased power after sleep deprivation (n = 18 participants with artifact-free wakefulness at both sessions; two-tailed paired t-test: t17 = –3.23, P = 0.048). h, Paired analysis of CSF low-frequency power in resting-state wakefulness showing increased power after sleep deprivation (n = 18 participants with artifact-free wakefulness at both sessions; two-tailed paired t-test: t17 = –3.25, P = 0.005). We first investigated whether sleep deprivation altered the dynamics of CSF flow in resting-state scans that included awake and sleeping periods (Extended Data Fig. Consistent with previous studies, the CSF inflow signal during well-rested wakefulness exhibited a small-amplitude rhythm synchronized to respiration18,19, in contrast to NREM sleep where CSF exhibits large ~0.05 Hz waves16. However, visual inspection clearly showed that the CSF signal during wakefulness after sleep deprivation also exhibited large-amplitude low-frequency waves, resembling NREM sleep (Fig. We analyzed this CSF signal across sleep stages in participants who had at least 60 s of continuous wakefulness during the resting-state run (N = 22, excluding segments with high motion; framewise displacement > 0.55 mm) and found a 4.7 dB increase in the CSF signal peaking at 0.04 Hz in sleep-deprived wakefulness (Fig. Remarkably, the CSF power in sleep-deprived wakefulness reached levels similar to the CSF power during typical N2 sleep (0.01–0.1 Hz power in sleep-deprived wake: 24.50 dB, 95% confidence interval = [24.46, 24.55]; rested N2: 24.80 dB, 95% confidence interval = [23.95, 25.59]). These session-dependent increases in CSF flow were not driven by motion artifacts (Extended Data Fig. Prior work has shown that total overnight sleep deprivation increases BOLD fluctuations6 and low-frequency EEG signals20,21, both of which could modulate CSF flow, so we next examined these two factors in this cohort. To assess the effect of sleep deprivation on neural signals, we compared the levels of EEG slow wave activity (0.5–4 Hz), a well-recognized indicator of sleep pressure22,23,24, and found that sleep deprivation induced an increase in EEG slow wave activity (P = 0.029, paired t-test; Fig. Hemodynamics are the primary driver of CSF flow, as changes in blood vessels can mechanically drive CSF flow16,25,26,27, and we found that sleep deprivation also induced a significant increase in low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) cortical gray matter BOLD power (P = 0.0048, paired t-test; Fig. 1g), and these effects were not driven by motion artifacts (Extended Data Fig. These results demonstrate that sleep deprivation causes low-frequency CSF flow pulsations, increased EEG slow wave activity and hemodynamic waves that appear during wakefulness, with changes in the same direction as the dynamics typically seen during N1 or N2 sleep. Because large-scale CSF waves typically occur during NREM sleep, a state in which attention is suppressed, we investigated whether the CSF waves during well-rested and sleep-deprived wakefulness were associated with any attentional deficits. As expected2,10,28,29,30, sleep deprivation caused an increase in the mean reaction time (Fig. 2a) and the omission (missed response) rate (Fig. Despite participants being awake with eyes open, we observed that attentional lapses (reaction time > 500 ms) and omissions tended to coincide with high-amplitude CSF flow (Fig. To quantify this behavior–CSF relationship, we tested whether lapses (reaction time > 500 ms) and omissions were linked to CSF power, analyzing data in 60-s segments during confirmed wakefulness (EEG and no eyelid closures >1 s). We found that worse attentional performance was linked to increased low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) CSF power: segments with attentional lapses and segments with omissions exhibited significantly higher CSF flow power than segments without lapses (Fig. This effect remained significant when controlling for motion (repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA): F2,50 = 2.46, P > 0.05 for motion). These results demonstrated that larger low-frequency CSF flow pulsations are associated with attentional failures during wakefulness. We hypothesized that this CSF dynamic would be associated with BOLD signal amplitude and indeed found that worse attentional performance was also linked to increased low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) gray matter BOLD power (Fig. a, Reaction times after sleep deprivation showed a higher mean and a longer tail, indicating more behavioral lapses (N = 26 participants; shading represents standard error across participants; z = –25.08, P < 0.0001; data were analyzed by two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test). b, Omission rate increased after sleep deprivation (N = 26 participants, t25 = –7.00, P = 2.43 × 10−6; data were analyzed by paired two-tailed t-test). c, CSF flow and reaction time fluctuations during one example run, showing higher flow when reaction time slows down. d, Low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) CSF power within nonoverlapping 60 s segments, categorized into three different states: high attention (all reaction times below 500 ms), low attention (at least one reaction time > 500 ms) and omissions (at least one omission). Higher CSF power appears in lower attentional states (two-tailed repeated measures ANOVA and a Tukey post hoc test; F2,50 = 62.04, P = 5.49 × 10−5 for main effect, N = 26 participants). e, Low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) gray matter BOLD power within nonoverlapping 60-s segments, following the same analysis as in d. Higher gray matter BOLD power appears in lower attentional states (two-tailed repeated measures ANOVA and a Tukey post hoc test; F2,50 = 24.82, P < 0.0001 for main effect, N = 26 participants). What process could result in joint changes in CSF flow, hemodynamics and attentional function? Ascending neuromodulation, such as noradrenergic input from the locus coeruleus, modulates attentional function31,32 and also acts directly on the vasculature33, making this a candidate mechanism for modulating both attention and CSF flow. Neuromodulatory tone and locus coeruleus firing is correlated with pupil diameter34, and sleep deprivation is well known to modulate pupil diameter, with smaller diameter indicating a low arousal state and decreased attentional function31,35,36. We investigated whether pupil diameter was linked to hemodynamics and CSF flow on faster timescales. We found that pupil diameter was significantly correlated with CSF flow: pupil constriction was linked to outward CSF signals, and pupil dilation was linked to subsequent inward CSF signals, with CSF flow following the pupil by 4.75 s (Fig. This correlation was also significant when we tested drowsy segments from rested wakefulness, demonstrating that this pupil–CSF coupling is present across states (Extended Data Fig. However, the pupil–CSF correlation was significantly higher after sleep deprivation (Extended Data Fig. 2), suggesting that sleep deprivation drives a pupil-locked fluctuation in CSF flow. Consistent with this, we also observed that CSF flow peaks were locked to drops in attentional performance: both reaction time and the rate of omissions increased before CSF peaks (Fig. These patterns were also evident at the individual participant level (Extended Data Fig. a, Spontaneous pupil constriction and dilation is time locked to peaks of CSF flow. Black bars indicate significant changes in z-scored pupil diameter compared to baseline (P < 0.05; two-tailed t-test, baseline = [–30, –28] s, Bonferroni corrected). Data are presented as mean values ± s.e. b, Cross-correlation between pupil diameter and CSF showing a strong correlation (maximal r = 0.25 at lag –4.75 s; n = 400 segments, 23 participants). c, During periods with pupil constriction, reaction times also showed significant increases compared to baseline (stars mark segments with P < 0.05; data were analyzed by two-tailed t-test, Bonferroni corrected). d, Omission rate during task showing a significant increase during pupil constriction and significant decrease during pupil dilation (stars mark segments with P < 0.05; two-tailed t-test relative to baseline, Bonferroni corrected). e, Significant biphasic changes in cortical BOLD activity are locked to CSF peaks (P < 0.05; two-tailed t-test relative to baseline, Bonferroni corrected). g, To estimate the impulse response function (IRF) linking pupil size changes to BOLD and CSF activity, we convolved pupil diameter traces from each segment with a series of IRFs. Estimated IRF of the cortical BOLD signal to the pupil diameter shows a time to peak at 8 s. Cross-correlation between pupil diameter and BOLD showed a strong correlation (maximal r = 0.34 at lag –1.25 s; n = 400 segments, 23 participants). h, Predicting CSF flow with no additional parameter fitting, assuming that the derivative of the pupil-locked BOLD fluctuations drives CSF flow, shows significant prediction of the true CSF signals (zero lag r = 0.26; n = 400 segments). Data are presented as mean values ± s.e. Participant-level means are provided in Extended Data Fig. The exact P values are in Supplementary Table 1. In each case, although CSF flow was locked to behavior and the pupil, it lagged these measures in time, which could reflect a vascular mechanism that introduces a time delay. Furthermore, although pupil diameter is consistently correlated with noradrenergic tone, it is also correlated with several other modulators37,38. To test whether pupil–CSF coupling reflected a pupil-locked modulation of cerebrovascular fluctuations, which could be expected from noradrenergic-driven vasoconstriction and would drive a delayed CSF response39, we examined the global cortical BOLD signal and found an anticorrelation with the pupil (Fig. We calculated the best-fit impulse response linking the pupil to the global BOLD signal and found a negative impulse response with a peak delay of 8 s (Fig. To test whether this mechanism in turn predicted CSF flow, we convolved the pupil signal with its impulse response and calculated the expected CSF flow driven by this vascular effect, with no additional parameter fitting16. We found that the convolved pupil signal yielded a significant prediction of CSF activity (Fig. 3h; zero lag R = 0.26, maximal R = 0.3 at lag –1.25 s), indicating that the timing of the pupil–CSF coupling could be explained by a vascular intermediary. Having found that hemodynamic waves and CSF flow pulsations were highest in epochs with omissions, we next examined the precise dynamics occurring at the moment of omissions. Because CSF flow pulsations increase during NREM sleep, we carefully excluded omissions due to NREM sleep to confirm whether these flow changes appeared during wakefulness (EEG verified and excluding segments with eye closures >1 s). We found a strong coupling between behavior and CSF flow during sleep-deprived wakefulness: omissions were locked to an outward wave and then an inward wave of CSF flow in the fourth ventricle (Fig. Although few omissions occurred in the well-rested state, when they did appear, they showed similar CSF flow coupling, demonstrating that a complete attentional failure even when rested can engage a similar mechanism (Extended Data Fig. The cortical gray matter BOLD signal exhibited a matched biphasic pattern, consistent with vascular drive of outward and then inward CSF flow (Extended Data Figs. However, our imaging protocol was only able to directly measure CSF inflow (inward to the brain) due to the placement of the acquisition volume (Fig. 1c), whereas drops in CSF signal could in theory represent either outflow or simply no flow. We therefore conducted a second study in an additional ten sleep-restricted participants with a new imaging protocol that measured bidirectional flow (Extended Data Fig. 6a) to test whether this pattern specifically signaled CSF outflow before inflow. This acquisition method allowed simultaneous measurement of inflow and outflow but did not allow measurement of gray matter BOLD signals. We confirmed that omissions were locked to a pulse of CSF flowing outward out of the brain, beginning at the time of the missed stimulus, followed by a pulse flowing inward into the brain (Extended Data Fig. These results replicated the finding of coupled attentional function and CSF flow pulsations in an independent cohort, with a biphasic profile of outward flow at omissions, followed by inward flow. a, Awake omission trials are locked to a biphasic change in CSF flow, with an outward trough followed by an inward peak. Time zero marks stimulus onset; omission occurs within the following seconds. Data are presented as mean values ± s.e. b, Omission trials are locked to a broadband drop in EEG power, including decreased alpha–beta (10–25 Hz) EEG power, and then an increase in slow wave activity (SWA; 0.5–4 Hz) and alpha–beta power. The biphasic alpha–beta power change is widespread with centro-occipital predominance, whereas the slow wave activity increase has occipital and frontal predominance. The spectrogram is normalized within frequency; black bars indicate a significant change in broadband power (0.5–30 Hz) compared to baseline. c, The aperiodic component of the EEG was subtracted to display oscillation-specific changes. The alpha–beta and slow wave activity effects were still present (statistics are provided in Extended Data Fig. d, Pupil diameter showed a biphasic change at omissions, with a significant constriction during the omission trial followed by dilation after trial onset (9–12 s). e, Heart rate dropped during omissions and subsequently increased. f, Respiratory rate drop at omissions and subsequent increase. Black bars with stars indicate significant changes from baseline (n = 364 trials, 26 participants). Data are presented as mean values ± s.e. Stars indicate P < 0.05; two-tailed t-test with a Bonferroni correction over time, baseline = [–20, –10] s. Exact P values are provided in Supplementary Table 1. During NREM sleep, CSF flow is coupled to neural slow wave activity16,40, and local slow waves can also increase after sleep deprivation12. We therefore analyzed the EEG spectrogram to investigate which neural dynamics might be linked to these omission-locked CSF waves (example spectrogram in Extended Data Fig. We found that omissions (n = 364 trials, 26 participants) were accompanied by EEG alterations across multiple frequency bands and across different electrodes, with a drop in broadband EEG power, particularly pronounced in the alpha–beta (10–25 Hz) range, followed shortly by a subsequent increase in power (Fig. In addition to this broadband change, the oscillation-only component of the spectrogram (calculated by subtracting the aperiodic component41,42,43,44) also demonstrated significant clusters at slow and alpha–beta frequencies, with a broad spatial distribution (Fig. The global distribution of the EEG power change suggested an altered global arousal state. Overall, this broadband power reduction and steepening spectral slope pointed to a spatially distributed change in electrophysiological dynamics. What type of neuronal event might these EEG spectral shifts reflect? The relatively broadband and spatially global (Fig. 5b and 8) nature of these EEG changes suggested that they might reflect a transient change in cortical excitability45, perhaps mediated by central neuromodulatory state, as suggested by the pupil coupling (Fig. In addition, autonomic state changes and systemic oscillations can drive CSF flow46,47,48, consistent with the idea that large-scale neuromodulatory changes could contribute to both the attentional failures and CSF dynamics. We therefore tested whether a sequence of events could be locked to the CSF flow: a drop in attentional state followed by recovery of attention. Consistent with this, pupil dilation was biphasically coupled to CSF flow: the pupil was constricted during the omission, corresponding to a low arousal state and outward CSF flow, and then subsequently dilated (Fig. 3c,d), with CSF subsequently flowing inward (Fig. Because neuromodulatory state also has systemic effects49, we further examined systemic physiological recordings, including changes in respiratory rate and volume, heart rate and peripheral vascular volume, reflecting activity of the autonomic nervous system. We found that all systemic measures were significantly locked to the omission (Fig. 3d–f, 4c,d and 5e,f,k,l). These results demonstrate that attentional failures during wakefulness were coupled to a brain- and body-wide integrated state shift, manifesting as a transient behavioral deficit, electrophysiological markers of distinct neuronal state, pupil constriction and hemodynamic and CSF flow waves. These results clearly identified widespread behavioral, neuronal and arousal dynamics that were locked to CSF pulsatile flow during sleep-deprived wakefulness. However, attentional failures are typically brief during wakefulness, with a spike in arousal rapidly following an omission. Furthermore, the neurovascular, pupil and CSF dynamics showed biphasic patterns, with both signal drops and increases around attentional failures. Due to this biphasic pattern, each physiological change could potentially be explained by two different possibilities: either it was specifically linked to drops in arousal (at the onset of attentional failures) or it was locked to increases in arousal (at the recovery of behavior). We therefore designed an analysis of behavioral responses to separate the neurophysiological dynamics linked to the drop, versus recovery, of attention. We categorized behavioral omissions into three types: ‘Type A', where the omission trial was preceded and followed by a valid response, ‘Type B', the first of at least three consecutive omissions, and ‘Type C', the last omission of a consecutive series (Fig. As described above, wakefulness during all omissions was verified both through EEG scoring and eye tracking. a, Omissions during wakefulness were categorized as isolated (Type A), onset of sustained low attention (Type B) and end of sustained low attention (Type C). b, Type A, isolated omission trials (n = 127 trials, 26 participants), were locked to a decrease in broadband EEG power and then increased power at attention recovery in the next trial. Respiratory rate and heart rate both showed significant changes from baseline after trial onset. c, Type B, first omission of the series, signifies the onset of a sustained low attentional state (n = 61 trials, 20 participants). CSF signal, respiratory rate and heart rate all decrease significantly (P < 0.05, paired t-test across segments and time bins, Bonferroni corrected). The black arrow marks the onset time of CSF signal drop, at 0.5 s. d, Type C, last omission of the series, followed by increased attentional state (n = 57 trials, 20 participants). The EEG shows heightened slow wave activity during the omission and subsequent increase in alpha–beta power at the recovery of attention. CSF signal, respiratory rate and heart rate all increase significantly (P < 0.05; paired t-test relative to baseline, Bonferroni corrected). The black arrow marks the onset time of the CSF signal increase, at 9.5 s (that is, on average 1 s after behavior recovery). For data in b–d, black bars indicate significant (P < 0.05, paired two-tailed t-test, Bonferroni corrected) changes from baseline ([–10, –5] s). Gray regions indicate the average timing of trials where no behavioral responses were recorded for each omission type. Blue circles indicate average timing of valid responses before or after each omission type. Red crosses indicate average timing of the omission trial onset. Data are presented as mean values ± s.e. Participant-level averages are provided in Extended Data Fig. The exact P values are in Supplementary Table 1. This analysis identified two separable patterns: neural, CSF and systemic signals showed opposing changes locked to Type B and C omissions (Fig. The loss of attentional focus in Type B omissions was linked to a decrease in EEG alpha–beta power and expulsion of CSF, whereas regaining of attentional focus in Type C omissions co-occurred with an increase in EEG broadband power and inward flow of CSF, and the systemic arousal indicators followed the same pattern (Fig. 9b), indicating that the behavioral events were associated with a subsequent reversal of flow direction. These results demonstrated that CSF flow occurs in a specific sequence of events: during an attentional failure, EEG power drops in concert with body-wide signatures of low arousal and subsequently a outward pulse of CSF flow. This pattern inverts at recovery of arousal, with CSF returning inward after attention improves, again with a time delay consistent with vascular-mediated CSF flow. To calculate the relative timing of these effects, we estimated the onset times for the changes in behavior, EEG, BOLD and CSF flow. We identified the onset time of CSF decrease for Type A and B omissions and the onset time of CSF increase for Type C omissions (the time when CSF signal reached 10% of the minimum or maximum amplitude compared to pretrial baseline ([–3, 0] s)). This analysis showed that CSF signals began to decrease 0.5–2.5 s after trial onset that would subsequently result in attentional failure (Type A and Type B), peaking at 6.7–8.2 s. When attention recovered (after Type C), the CSF signal increase began at 1 s after behavioral recovery onset, peaking at 6.2 s. This timing pattern was consistent with the pupil-locked function in Fig. 3, aligning with an attention-locked modulation of the cerebrovasculature unfolding over several seconds. The timing of these relationships was therefore consistent with an integrated neuromodulatory mechanism that regulates attentional state, vascular physiology and CSF dynamics. Here, we found that attentional failures after sleep deprivation are locked to a brain- and body-wide state change, including a characteristic neurovascular event and pulsatile waves of CSF flow. During sleep-deprived wakefulness, hemodynamic and CSF flow pulsations increased within the awake state, causing a flow pattern that resembled N2 NREM sleep. CSF waves were strongly coupled to behavioral failures, a shift in neuronal spectra and pupil constriction (during awake, eyes-open state). Specifically, attention dropped ~2 s before CSF flowed outward (Fig. 5b), and attention recovered ~1 s before CSF flow reversed and was drawn back inward (Fig. The attentional failures that occur after sleep deprivation thus are locked to the initiation of a process in which the pupil constricts, brain-wide hemodynamics increase and the CSF is transiently flushed outward. Our data showed a consistent pattern of broadband EEG shifts linked to attentional failures. What type of neural event might these represent? The process of falling asleep is linked to suppression of EEG alpha power and drops in respiratory rate50, which could suggest that the events we observe here represent an accelerated transition toward sleep onset. In addition, elegant prior work has shown that autonomic and arousal state fluctuations are characterized by a sequential modulation of beta power and slow wave activity46,51,52. The EEG pattern we observe here shares similar broadband features, and we find that it represents a behaviorally relevant modulation of neural vigilance state during wakefulness, with attentional consequences. This pattern may thus reflect that sleep deprivation causes sleep-initiating cortical events to occur during wakefulness, but with an interruption of the initiation process before sleep is attained. Given that we found a shift in spectral slope, this pattern could also be consistent with increasing cortical inhibition53. Although we could not directly identify local sleep slow waves here due to the macroscopic nature of these measurements, this effect appeared to be relatively spatially widespread, as it was detected across many EEG electrodes. Our results suggest that sleep deprivation destabilizes global brain state regulation and leads to large-scale, biphasic dynamics. Smaller CSF events could also be infrequently detected in attention failures in the well-rested state with a weaker coupling to pupil diameter, suggesting that typical drowsiness may engage a similar circuit but with reduced switching and instability in the well-rested context. The neural and attentional drops were also linked to pupil constriction, a classic signature of arousal state that is actively controlled by noradrenergic neuromodulatory projections54,55. Pupil diameter is correlated with attention, heart rate and galvanic skin reflex, reflecting a tight coupling between the state of the central and peripheral arousal systems38,56,57,58. Furthermore, the autonomic system can strongly modulate CSF flow, with particularly strong effects during light sleep47, and autonomic measures were correlated with the attentional dynamics observed here. Although we cannot determine the causal relationship between the pupil and CSF, the high correlation between pupil diameter and CSF pulsatile flow suggests the involvement of the ascending neuromodulatory system in regulating CSF flow during wakefulness59,60. A possible mechanistic explanation for the joint changes in EEG, CSF and autonomic indicators is the well-established parallel projections from key neuromodulatory nuclei such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, which projects throughout the cortex and thalamus to modulate neural state, while also directly acting on the sympathetic nervous system61,62,63. Intriguingly, locus coeruleus activity oscillates during NREM sleep and drives infraslow neuronal spectral changes64,65,66, and pupil diameter also covaries with these neural signatures67. Our results suggest that a similar dynamic of temporally structured noradrenergic fluctuations could appear during sleep-deprived wakefulness. In addition, these events could also occur infrequently during rested wakefulness, when attention fails. Other neuromodulators are also correlated with pupil diameter and could contribute37,68, although our hemodynamic data suggest a substantial role for the vasoconstrictive effects of the noradrenergic system69. The dynamics we report were observed during eyes-open wakefulness, demonstrating that brief shifts in attentional state are sufficient to elicit these coordinated changes. Our results could thus be consistent with sleep deprivation causing a destabilization of the ascending arousal system, with brief failures of its wakefulness-promoting actions leading to attentional dysfunction, neuronal arousal suppression and CSF flow. Our finding that attentional shifts and pupil diameter are linked to large-scale CSF flow, detectable even in the ventricle, suggests a neuromodulatory mechanism that could potentially explain these dual effects. A primary driver of CSF flow is changes in the vasculature, as dilation and constriction of blood vessels in turn propels CSF flow16,25,26,70,71,72,73. Because noradrenaline is a vasoconstrictor33, drops in locus coeruleus activity could decrease neuronal arousal state while dilating cortical blood vessels and constricting the pupil. This would result in an outward flow in the fourth ventricle detected several seconds later, which then would invert as attention recovers and noradrenergic activity increases, reflected in the subsequent pupil dilation. An exciting implication of these dynamics is that pupil diameter could potentially provide a noninvasive, accessible readout of signals related to CSF flow. Another major driver of CSF flow in awake humans is the cardiac and respiratory cycles, which were tightly associated with the dynamics reported here and could reflect several parallel pathways. Cardiac and respiratory cycles are directly locked to CSF pulsations, as arterial pulsations across the cardiac cycle and reductions in thoracic pressure during inspiration can mechanically propel CSF flow18,74,75. Thus, the coupled respiration–CSF–pupil activity we observed may reflect the joint modulation of breathing and arousal77,78. The locus coeruleus has not only ascending but also descending projections, synapsing onto preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the spinal cord, which can contribute to coupled dynamics in neural and systemic physiology79. Finally, respiratory fluctuations also influence blood oxygenation and hemodynamics, potentially modulating vasoconstriction that further contributes to CSF dynamics. An important question for future work is to investigate whether and how these dynamics are linked to solute transport in the brain. Prolonged wakefulness leads to a buildup of toxic metabolic waste products80,81,82, suggesting that more fluid flow would be needed after sleep deprivation. However, the specific consequences of large pulsatile CSF waves for solute transport are not yet established. The CSF waves measured here are relatively high velocity (>1 cm s−1), lasting ~10 s for both the inward and outward phases, indicating that CSF travels many centimeters during each wave, which may be expected to drive solute transport and mixing. In addition, the global hemodynamic waves suggest that this process is coupled to vascular oscillations throughout the brain tissue, which could alter solute transport in the perivascular space. However, the noninvasive methods used in this study could not measure waste clearance, so these possibilities need to be tested in future studies. The observed CSF waves are bidirectional, with sleep deprivation increasing waves in both inward and outward directions, rather than net flow. Intriguingly, a recent study measuring clearance in animal models found that noradrenergic oscillations are linked to waste clearance within NREM sleep83. Our results suggest that an analogous circuit may modulate large-scale CSF flow in humans and furthermore that it can operate within the awake state during attentional failures. Finally, although several studies have shown that sleep clears the neurotoxic waste products that accumulate during wakefulness40,80,81,84,85, a recent study reported the opposite pattern, with reduced clearance during sleep86. In addition to other methodological differences, the conflicting studies used different sleep protocols for the awake measurements (rested wakefulness versus sleep deprived), suggesting that sleep deprivation protocols might be one factor to explore across experiments. An open question is why both attentional state and CSF flow would be controlled by the same system. One possibility is that the large-scale changes in blood volume that emerge during sleep may be nonoptimal for the waking state, because prolonged drops could reduce oxygen availability. Alternatively, a speculative possibility is that prolonged CSF flow might be incompatible with stable attentional states, for example, because high flow rates alter the concentration of signaling molecules or ionic concentrations that are required for typical waking function. However, we found that although CSF flow was tightly coupled to behavior, it did not exclusively occur during omissions (CSF flow pulses continuously with lower amplitude during wakefulness18,48,87, and flow increased to a lesser degree during successful performance with slow reaction times; Figs. 2 and 3), meaning that individual large events of CSF flow do not prevent behavior. Alternatively, it could be possible that sustained high-amplitude flow over longer timescales interferes with behavioral performance, in which case it would be beneficial to have a circuit that can provide a structured alternation between high-attention and high-CSF pulsation states. Future studies would be needed to test this theory. Overall, our results demonstrate that the attentional failures caused by sleep deprivation are coupled to a global neurovascular event and large-scale brain fluid transport. When the brain lacks the opportunity to sleep, it enters a suboptimal attentional state that manifests with both sleep-like fluid dynamics and behavioral errors. This coupling points to a central neuromodulatory circuit that controls both attentional state and brain fluid dynamics and shows that the moments of attentional dysfunction we experience after sleep loss are followed by the initiation of widespread fluid flow in the brain. The main experiment enrolled 32 healthy participants, of whom 26 successfully completed both study visits (7 men and 19 women; mean age = 25.6 years ± 4.41 years, range = 19 to 40 years). No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size, but our samples are similar to those reported in previous publications12,13,56,88. The study included more women than men due to the space limitations and restriction on head circumference when wearing an EEG cap inside the MRI head coil. All 26 participants completed two experimental sessions spaced 8 to 10 days apart: a well-rested session and a sleep-deprived session. For the well-rested condition, participants completed a full night of sleep at home, and they arrived at the lab no later than 9:00 a.m. for a 10:00 a.m. scan start time. Participants were screened to ensure they had no history of sleep, medical or psychiatric disorders and good typical sleep quality (sleep schedule of 6.5–9 h per night), as assessed by self-rating questionnaires. Exclusion criteria included shift workers, participants that had traveled across time zones in the 3 months before the study and any magnetic resonance contraindication. All participants were required to maintain a regular sleep schedule for 1 week before the visit, with sleep before scans monitored by wrist actigraphy, to consume less than 100 mg of caffeine daily before the study and to refrain from alcohol, caffeine and sleep-aid medications for 24 h before the day of the scan. All participants provided written informed consent, and study procedures were completed as approved by the Boston University Charles River Campus Institutional Review Board (IRB 5059E). All participants received monetary compensation as specified in the IRB protocol. During the sleep-deprived visit, participants were sleep deprived overnight under constant monitoring by two staff members. At least two researchers remained in the adjacent control room to verify continuous wakefulness during the sleep deprivation period. After arrival, participants were fitted with an EEG cap for overnight monitoring. Participants wore eye-tracking glasses (Tobii Pro 3 Glasses) throughout the night except when performing testing sessions, for continuous eye monitoring while the staff members logged any spontaneous long eyelid closures throughout the night. If the participant closed their eyes for more than 2 s, a staff member requested that they open their eyes and then engaged them in conversation to ensure wakefulness. If the eye closure repeated frequently, staff members took participants on a gentle walk. Between 6:00 a.m. and the morning scan, participants took a shower, during which verbal confirmation of wakefulness was obtained, and they were then provided with breakfast. Each block consisted of three eyes-open resting-state runs (2 min) and two vigilance task runs (12 min each). The vigilance task consisted of 12-min runs of a computerized aPVT and vPVT (details are provided in the next section). Auditory and visual runs were counterbalanced in order. When not involved in testing sessions, participants were allowed to carry out their own preferred activities, such as reading, writing, listening to music, watching TV or playing games. Lying down, sleeping and vigorous physical activity were not permitted. Nonscheduled light snacks were permitted, whereas caffeinated beverages, alcohol and medications that can influence sleepiness were not allowed during the deprivation protocol. During the aPVT (adapted from refs. 87,89), participants were instructed to respond as fast as possible (by pressing a button) to a 0.5 s, 375 Hz tone. Tones were presented binaurally at a comfortable volume through magnetic resonance-compatible earbuds (Etymotic Research, ER3 transducers). Cushions were placed beside the ears to restrict movement and to further reduce scanner noise. During the vPVT, participants were instructed to respond as fast as possible (by pressing a button) when the fixation crosshair changed into a square. The two visual stimuli were designed to have identical luminance to avoid light-induced pupillary responses. For both task modalities, each stimulus lasted 0.5 s, and intertrial intervals ranged from 5 to 10 s. A fixation crosshair was presented throughout. The total duration of each task run was 12 min. Visual stimuli inside the scanner were presented on a VPixx Technologies PROPixx Lite Projector (VPixx Technologies) with a refresh rate of 120 Hz. Participants underwent five fMRI runs: two runs of aPVT (12 min each), two runs of vPVT (12 min each) and one run of eyes-closed resting state (25 min). Auditory and visual run order were counterbalanced. Sixteen participants successfully completed all four task runs for both visits; ten participants completed a subset of these runs (for example, due to an inability to stay awake in the later runs). If participants did not successfully complete all task runs, the successfully completed runs were still included in the analysis. Runs were excluded if participants failed to respond to more than 20 trials, indicating that they could not stay awake. During the eyes-closed resting-state session, participants were instructed to press a button on every breath in and breath out as long as they were awake and were told that it was permitted to fall asleep during the scan. Sleep–wake behavior data in the week before the sleep-deprived visit were collected by actigraphy and stored as the sum (activity) of 30-s intervals. These data were analyzed with Actilife (v.6.7, Actigraph), using a sleep–wake detection-validated algorithm. Participants were also instructed to keep notes of bed and rise times to help frame the time in bed during which actigraphy data were analyzed. Participants were scanned on a 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma MRI scanner with a 64-channel head/neck coil. MRI sessions began with a 1-mm isotropic multiecho MPRAGE anatomical scan. Functional scans consisted of single-shot gradient echo multiband EPI sequences with 40 interleaved slices (2.5-mm isotropic resolution, TR = 378 ms, MultiBand factor = 8, TE = 31 ms, flip angle = 37°, field of view (FOV) = 230 × 230, blipped CAIPI shift = FOV / 4 and no in-plane acceleration). Additional sensors were used to record systemic physiology during the MRI scan. Respiration was measured simultaneously using an MRI-safe pneumatic respiration transducer belt around the abdomen, and pulse was measured with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) transducer (BIOPAC Systems). Physiological signals were acquired at 2,000 Hz using Acqknowledge software and were aligned with MRI data using triggers sent by the MRI scanner. EEG data were collected using a 64-channel magnetic resonance-compatible EEG cap and BrainAmp magnetic resonance amplifiers (Brain Products). Two reusable reference layers were custom made to record ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, as in Levitt et al.90. As described in Levitt et al.90, with the use of a reference layer, a subset of EEG electrodes can directly record the BCG noise, enabling effective modeling and removal of this noise. This artifact signal can then be used to regress out the BCG artifact from the EEG signals. The first reference layer, used for participants 1–6, was made from an ethylene vinyl acetate shower cap (the inner, insulating layer) and a layer of modal-lycra fabric (the outer layer), which were fastened together by round, plastic grommets to create openings large enough to accommodate the EEG electrodes, as in Luo et al.91. These grommets were placed over electrodes Fpz, Fz, AFz, FCz, Cz, Pz, POz, Oz, F3, F4, F7, F8, T7, T8, C3, C4, P3, P4, PO3 and PO4 and held in place with cyanoacrylate glue. Holes were cut in the reference layer to site each grommet, and larger holes were also made to allow the participants' ears to pass through. The outer layer of the reference layer was moistened with a solution of baby shampoo, water and potassium chloride to make it conductive before each recording. Finally, the inner face of the EEG cap was lined with Nexcare surgical tape (3M) to avoid wetting the EEG cap. The second reference layer, used for participants 7–26, was designed as reported in Levitt et al.90. It was made from a layer of stretch vinyl (Spandex World) coated in PEDOT ESD500 and P1900 ink (PEDOTinks.com), with grommets placed over Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8, Fpz, AFz, Fz, FCz, Cz, Pz, POz and Oz and large holes for the participants' ears. For this reference layer, no conductive solution or tape was needed. Before each recording, electrode impedances were measured. To ensure safety, participants were not allowed to proceed to EEG–fMRI recordings unless the impedance of all channels was below 100 KΩ; however, a lower impedance of less than 50 KΩ was targeted for signal quality. EEG data were collected at a sampling rate of 5,000 Hz, synchronized to the scanner clock and referenced to channel FCz. Gradient artifacts were removed through average artifact subtraction92 using a moving average of the previous 30 TRs. BCG artifacts were removed using regression of reference electrode signals91. Because the position of electrodes and physiological noise dynamics can vary over the recording sessions, we implemented a dynamic time-varying regression of the reference signals in sliding windows93,94. Denoised EEG spectrograms enabled clear visual detection of arousal-locked EEG dynamics (Extended Data Fig. We used EEGLAB95 and MATLAB (R2022a, MathWorks) to analyze EEG data. Continuous EEG data were downsampled to 500 Hz and then bandpass filtered with an EEGLAB antialiasing filter to 0.2–40 Hz. Independent component analysis was used to remove components reflecting eye movements and muscle activity. EEG PSD was calculated using multitaper spectral estimation (Chronux93), using 5-s windows and five tapers. Further analysis was performed on EEG channel POz because this channel consistently had good quality data across participants. The EEG POz channel was used to calculate PSD with 5 s windows and five tapers. For normalized EEG power spectrogram analysis, power values for each trial and each frequency were z scored. The PSD from 0.5 to 35 Hz was estimated using the multitaper method in 10-s epochs with 0.1 s overlap, which were subsequently used to extract the slope of a fitted model using the FOOOF algorithm in the 1- to 35-Hz range32. A Gaussian function was then fitted to the largest peak of the flattened PSD exceeding two times the standard deviation. This procedure was iterated for the next largest peak after subtracting the previous peak until no peaks were exceeding the minimum peak threshold. FOOOF settings were kept default with the exception of minimum peak height limits set to be over 0.3 dB. The oscillatory components were finally obtained by fitting a multivariate Gaussian to all extracted peaks simultaneously. Afterward, this aperiodic component was fitted again, leading to the final fit with aperiodic intercept and exponent as parameters. The fitted Gaussian functions were referred to as an oscillation-only spectrogram. The aperiodic features were estimated using a sliding window approach with 5-s window length and stepping every 0.3 s. One participant in the well-rested session and one participant in the sleep-deprived session did not have valid EEG recordings during the resting-state scan and were thus excluded from the sleep analysis. The remaining 24 participants' sleep EEG data were used in sleep scoring and segmenting the BOLD fMRI data into sleep stages (Fig. Sleep scoring was performed on preprocessed EEG data using the Visbrain toolbox by two scorers following the standard AASM scoring guidelines94,95. Consistent with standard sleep scoring, we observed increased low-frequency power during sleep both after normal sleep and after sleep deprivation and increased alpha frequency power during the awake state (Extended Data Fig. Disagreements in sleep scores were further discussed and resolved with a third experienced scorer. Eye tracking over the sleep-deprived night (8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next day) was performed with eyeglasses (Tobii Pro Glasses 3) with rear-facing infrared cameras. Pupil size was recorded in the morning during EEG–fMRI scans using a magnetic resonance-compatible eye tracker (EyeLink 1000, SR Research) at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz. Before each task run, we began with a calibration of the eye tracker using the standard five-point EyeLink calibration procedure. Moments when the eye tracker received no pupil signal (that is, during eye blinks) were marked automatically during acquisition by the manufacturer's blink detection algorithm. Pupil data were preprocessed offline. Missing and invalid data due to blinks were replaced using linear interpolation for the period from 100 ms before blink onset to 400 ms after blink offset. Missing data due to long eyelid closures (>1 s) were marked but not interpolated because these segments were later used to detect microsleeps. Following the automated interpolation procedure, the data were manually checked and corrected if any artifacts had not been successfully removed. Twenty-one runs were excluded from the pupil diameter analysis due to technical issues with the eye tracker, and 6 were excluded due to failed video recording, yielding 171 valid runs from 26 participants. Figure 3 analyses used data from these 171 runs. We normalized the pupil diameter time series to z scores. For analyses of pupil responses aligned to either CSF peaks or omission trial onsets, we epoched the pupil time series around each event of interest relative to event onset. We rejected pupil epochs if they contained >1-s consecutive long eyelid closures within the raw data. The cortical surface was reconstructed from the MPRAGE volume using recon-all from Freesurfer version 6 (refs. All functional runs were slice-time corrected using FSL version 6 (slicetimer; https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) and motion corrected to the middle frame using AFNI (3dvolreg; https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/). Each motion-corrected run was then registered to the anatomical data using boundary-based registration (bbregister). We defined the left and right hemisphere cortical gray matter ROIs using the automatically generated Freesurfer-derived segmentations of cortical gray matter. Cortical time series were converted to percent signal change by dividing by the mean value of the time series after discarding the first 20 volumes to allow the signal to reach steady state. CSF inflow analysis used the raw acquired fMRI data with slice-timing correction but without motion correction, as motion correction corrupts the voxel slice position information needed for inflow analysis, and motion correction cannot be accurately performed on edge slices where tissue moves in and out of the imaging volume. All analyses therefore were performed on segments with framewise displacement of <0.5 mm, and segments with high motion were marked and rejected from any further analysis. To identify the CSF ROI, we registered the single-band anatomical reference scan (SBRef), acquired right before each functional scan, to the participant's anatomical T1 image. The SBRef scan matched the functional scan in sequence parameters but was acquired without multiband, allowing us to obtain an anatomically defined ROI on an image that was distortion matched to the functional scans. The ROI did not include edge voxels to minimize partial volume effects, resulting in an ROI that was smaller than the full ventricle width. The researcher was blinded to condition (rested versus sleep deprived) while selecting the CSF ROIs. We extracted the mean signal in this region as the CSF inflow signal. All CSF inflow time series were highpass filtered above 0.01 Hz and converted to percent signal change by dividing the value of the time series by the 15th percentile value (because the CSF signal has a floor due to only measuring inward flow with the acquisition scheme used in the main experiment). CSF time series were upsampled to a new sampling frequency of 4 Hz using spline interpolation before stimulus-locked averages were calculated. Average CSF inflow signals (for example, Fig. 3f) typically show positive baseline values because CSF pulses continuously. Peaks in the bandpass-filtered CSF signal (0.01–0.1 Hz) during tasks were identified by identifying local maxima that surpassed an amplitude threshold of 30%. These peaks (n = 400) were then used to extract a peak-locked signal (–30 to 30 s relative to the CSF peaks) in pupil diameter (bandpass filtered at 0.01–0.1 Hz). To test for statistical significance of the peak in the pupil signal, we used a time-binned, two-sided t-test, averaging the signal in 2-s bins, testing whether the signal was significantly different from baseline ([–30, –28] s in Fig. The P value was Bonferroni corrected for the number of time bins (number of bins = 30), and time bins with corrected P values less than α = 0.05 were considered significant. We generated 1,000 candidate IRFs using the gamma distribution with varying shape and rate parameter. Spectral power of BOLD and CSF signals was calculated using Chronux multitaper spectral estimation (five tapers). Power was estimated in the 60-s segments classified as awake, N1, N2 and N3, and the mean power in each participant was calculated from all low-motion (framewise displacement of <0.5) segments. N3 was not analyzed because only five participants entered N3. Statistical testing across spectra was performed with a permutation test that shuffled segments and then compared in frequency bins corresponding to the bandwidth (0.05 Hz), with Bonferroni correction for the number of frequency bins. Pairwise comparisons of mean low-frequency power (0.01–0.1 Hz) in Fig. 1f–h were computed within the participants who had awake data in both well-rested and sleep-deprived visits (n = 18) using a paired t-test. The distributions of spectral power of BOLD and CSF were assumed to be normal when performing t-tests, but this assumption was not formally tested. 3) included data from both the aPVT and vPVT. Because mean performance varies across visual and auditory tasks, the omission rate comparison was performed separately for vPVT and aPVT (Fig. 4, awake omissions (n = 364) were identified in 26 participants, after excluding any omissions with simultaneous eyelid closures longer than 1 s, excluding any segments scored as sleep based on the EEG and excluding high-motion segments. All omissions during confirmed wakefulness periods were marked and their stimulus onset times were used to extract omission-locked signals in the EEG, pupil diameter, heart rate, respiratory flow rate, respiratory volume per time, peripheral vascular tone and CSF signal. To test for statistical significance of clusters in the EEG spectrogram and EEG oscillation-only spectrogram, the spectrograms were averaged and compared to a baseline window spectral power (–20 to –10 s relative to omission onset) using a paired two-tailed t-test. The P values corresponding to each pixel of the spectrogram were corrected with a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. To test for statistical significance of the peak in CSF, EEG broadband power, pupil and systemic physiology signals, we considered the window [–20, –10] s before the omission trial onset as baseline. Statistical significance was then calculated for the remaining window in 1-s bins: the signal in each bin was averaged and then compared to baseline using a paired (within-trial) two-sided t-test (P < 0.05). The P value was Bonferroni corrected for the number of time bins tested. Additionally, three types of omissions (A, B and C) were separately analyzed by finding omissions that were preceded and followed by valid responses (Type A), the first of three or more consecutive omissions (Type B) and the last of three or more consecutive omissions (Type C). Eye-tracking videos were used to identify and exclude trials with long eyelid closures (>1 s). In total, 62 series of continuous omissions without long eyelid closures were identified. One Type B event and five Type C events were rejected due to high motion. The remaining omissions (Type A n = 127, Type B n = 61, Type C n = 57) were marked, and their stimulus onset times were used to extract omission-locked signals. Because this analysis focused on post-trial effects at recovery versus drops of attention, the analysis window was set to [–10, 30] s and the baseline was set to [–10, –5] s. The transducer recording the PPG signal was placed on the left index finger, making sure heartbeats were visible in its signal. MRI scanner triggers were co-recorded with the physiological signals to allow data synchronization. We first removed artifactual spikes from the data by replacing time points exceeding 4 s.d. Low-pass filtering was then performed on the PPG and respiration belt signals at 30- and 10-Hz cutoffs, respectively. The variation in heart rate was computed by averaging the differences between pairs of adjacent heartbeats contained in the 6-s window around each trigger and dividing the result by 60 (beats per minute). The filtered chest belt signal was used to derive a measure of respiratory flow rate, which previously was found to strongly affect the fMRI signal throughout the brain99,100. This was done by taking the derivative of the low-pass-filtered belt signal, rectifying it and applying a secondary low-pass filter at a cutoff of 0.13 Hz. The respiratory volume per time was calculated using the standard deviation of the respiratory waveform on a sliding window of 6 s centered at each trigger. The bidirectional flow measurement in Extended Data Fig. 6 used an independent cohort and new acquisition protocol designed to simultaneously measure inward and outward CSF flow. Ten healthy adults (four women and six men; age range 22 to 29 years, mean 24.1) were included. The same health and MRI exclusion criteria as for Experiment 1 were used. All individuals participated in a single scan session scheduled for 10:00 a.m. To induce attentional failures, participants underwent self-monitored sleep restriction in their homes, sleeping only 4 h the night before the scan. Scans were performed on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head and neck coil. Anatomical scans used a 1-mm isotropic multiecho MPRAGE. Functional runs were acquired using TR = 593 ms, 2.5-mm isotropic resolution, eight slices, FOV = 230 × 230, TE = 31 ms, no multiband, flip angle = 51° and no in-plane acceleration. Analyses were performed locked to all isolated omissions, with an omission immediately preceded and followed by a hit. All CSF outflow and inflow time series were converted to percent signal change by dividing the value of the time series by the 15th percentile value. The percent signal change in CSF outflow signal was inverted for display (Extended Data Fig. 6b) so that down represented outward flow in both time series.

(A) 24 subjects had valid EEG recordings during the resting-state scan at both well-rested and sleep deprived visits. Their sleep stages were scored according to the current AASM standard. (B) Mean framewise displacement (FD) values from the analyzed 60 s segments (after excluding frames with >0.5 mm FD) used in pairwise comparison in Fig. With our motion exclusion criteria there was no significant difference in motion in the analyzed segments across conditions (p = 0.43). Cross-correlation was computed between pupil and CSF during two different conditions: 1) 60 s segments in rested wakefulness, 2) 60 s segments in sleep deprivation. All segments had at least one response time that was longer than 500 ms. Maximal cross-correlation r was observed during sleep-deprived condition with at least one CSF peak. Segment length was 60 s. Black bars indicate significant (rested segments: n = 571; sleep deprived segments: n = 412; p < 0.05, paired t-test, Bonferroni corrected.) Data are presented as mean values ± standard error. Shading is standard error across segments. Same analysis as in Fig. 3, with measures reported at the subject-level instead of segment-level. Left column (panel A, C, E, G): Data are presented as mean values ± standard error. Shading is standard error across subjects (stars mark significant changes from baseline = [-30 -28]s, p < 0.05, t-test across subjects and time bins, Bonferroni corrected). Right column (panel B, D, F, H): Each gray line represents one subject's average across all CSF peaks detected in all runs. (A) CSF flow at both well-rested and sleep deprived session showed a biphasic change locked to the omission trial onset. (B) Cortical BOLD signals in both well-rested (n = 87 segments) and sleep-deprived (n = 277 segments) sessions showed a similar biphasic pattern as the ventricular CSF, although with a dip in signal amplitude seconds before the omission trial onset. (C) Respiratory volume per time showed biphasic changes locked to omission trials onset. (D) Peripheral vascular volume also showed biphasic changes locked to omission trials onset. Black bars indicate significant difference from baseline (paired t-test, Bonferroni corrected, p < 0.05); same segments as in Fig. Data are presented as mean values ± standard error across segments. For all panels: Analysis excluded subjects with less than 4 omission trials in all visits. For panel A to F: Black bars with stars indicate significant changes from baseline = [-20 -18]s (N = 19 subjects, p < 0.05, paired t-test, Bonferroni corrected). Data are presented as mean values ± standard error across subjects. For panel G to L: Black bars with stars indicate significant changes from baseline = [-20 -18]s (N = 19 subjects, linear mixed-effects model (signal value at every time point: value ~ 1 + (1|subject). Data are presented as mean values ± standard error across trials. (A) Positioning of acquisition protocol for the second experiment, designed to measure bidirectional flow. Acquisition volume enabled simultaneous measures of outward flow (measured in the top slice) and inward flow (measured in the bottom slice). (B) This bidirectional imaging experiment replicated the coupling between omissions and CSF flow. CSF flow moves outward at the omission, and moves inward at the recovery of attention. CSF flow is averaged relative to isolated omissions during wakefulness. Black bars indicate significant (p < 0.05, paired t-test, Bonferroni corrected) changes from baseline ([-10 -5] s). Data are presented as mean values ± standard error. Shading is standard error across segments. (A) Example of a single subject resting-state EEG signal after sleep deprivation, recorded from channel POz, collected inside the fMRI scanner. As the subject slowly drifted from wakefulness to sleep, alpha activity (8-12 Hz) began to disappear (around 100 s) and low-frequency activity emerged. (B) NREM sleep in both well-rested and sleep-deprived conditions exhibited higher EEG low-frequency power (slow wave activity: 0.5-4 Hz) compared with the awake state. Data are presented as mean values ± standard error across segments. (A) Contour indicates the period of significant power increase with FDR correction p < 0.05. (B) Contour indicates the period of significant oscillatory activity in SWA and alpha-beta (10-25 Hz) range with FDR correction p < 0.05. (C) Pz spectrogram locked to omission trial onset. (D) Fz spectrogram locked to omission trial onset. Same trials are analyzed as in Fig. (A) Data are presented as mean values ± standard error across subjects. We excluded subjects with less than 4 omission trials that survived motion exclusion in all visits for each omission type, yielding N = 19 subjects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok's U.S. spin-off could reshape its algorithm and the way culture is curated online. TikTok's algorithm, which shapes what more than a billion users see, has developed an almost mystical reputation for figuring out what people want to watch. Those powers aren't actually magical, but they do matter. An algorithm as widely used as TikTok's can have a huge impact on our culture by determining what information people receive and how. As TikTok prepares to spin off a U.S.-only version of the app with majority-American ownership, plenty of questions loom about how the platform—and its all-mighty algorithm—might change. Will new investors reshape what kinds of content is promoted or suppressed? If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Here to break down what we know about the highly anticipated TikTok sale and what it might mean for the platform's future is Kelley Cotter, an assistant professor in the Department of Human-Centered Computing and Social Informatics at Pennsylvania State University. Thank you so much for coming on to chat today. Kelley Cotter: Of course, I'm glad to be here, and thanks for inviting me. Feltman: So would you start by telling us a little bit about your background—you know, what kind of research you do? Cotter: So I investigate all kinds of things to do with the social and ethical implications of digital technologies, and I particularly focus, usually, on algorithms and AI—and perhaps more specifically on social media algorithms—and some of my core interests are in how people learn about and make sense of these technologies, how they imagine them and what they think they might make possible. And then I have a book that's under contract right now with Oxford University Press on critical algorithmic literacy, so one of the things I'm interested in is understanding how what we know about algorithms can help us govern them in a more bottom-up fashion. And also thinking about our understanding of platforms and the practices we have around them as kind of contextual insights that we have. Feltman: What do you think is lacking in most people's understanding of the algorithms that power the social media they use? Cotter: So when I started researching this maybe almost 10 years ago there was still a large portion of the population who weren't even really aware that these processes existed to sort of sort and filter content online. Now I think that has changed quite a bit, where there's—probably most people have some awareness of these processes happening. I think anything higher level than that, maybe the more complex technical understanding, is more out of reach, but also, the ways that people are aware of the impacts or consequences of algorithms is also limited. So people are often aware of the ways—of their own encounters with algorithms because we learn a lot about them through our own experiences. To start us off, what do we know about the TikTok sale? So we know that the deal is going to create a new U.S.-only app, spun off from the original app; that it's going to be a majority ownership by American companies, about 80 percent, and then less than 20 percent among Chinese investors, ByteDance—the parent company of TikTok. And the main driver of creating this deal originally had to do with concerns about the app being under Chinese control. So the algorithm, then, would be licensed to this new American company, and they would retrain it and rebuild it for the U.S.-only app. Feltman: Yeah, and why is the fate of TikTok's algorithm such a big part of this conversation, you know, even now that it wouldn't be in the hands of a foreign power? So every social media platform really revolves around the functions that their algorithms perform. But it also means that they play a central role in shaping sort of the culture by the ways that they make certain kinds of content visible or less visible. So they sort and filter content for folks and then also enforce some of the community guidelines that social media companies set to make sure that the content that people see in their feeds isn't excessively gory or doesn't promote violence or in—historically, there was concern about minimizing misinformation. Feltman: As someone who's studied social media algorithms for nearly a decade what's unique about the one that powers the TikTok “For You” page, both, actually, algorithmically and maybe in the ways people feel that it works, if that makes sense? Cotter: Yeah, the TikTok algorithm is perceived to be especially good at tailoring content for users. And some of my research with colleagues has investigated those kinds of beliefs and the ways that they converge in this really curious mixture of spiritual beliefs and conspiracy theorizing, where there's sometimes perception that what people see in their feeds is somehow sort of, like, cosmically destined for them; it's meant for them specifically. So there's this really—there's perceptions of the algorithm as being very powerful and good at its intended purpose. And it also, like other social media algorithms, relies on signals from people's behavior on the site—again, the things that they like, the things they comment on, things they share, these sort of signals of interest. One Wall Street Journal investigation suggested that watch time on TikTok is an especially strong signal of interest used by the algorithm to rank content. One reason why the TikTok algorithm might be potentially better at tailoring content is the nature of the short video format, where it's easier to get a read on what interests people based on the length of time that they spend watching any given piece of content versus any other thing. It also has other, like, unique features that promote more connections between creators and users. So we get, like, the Stitch function, where people will respond to different videos; they'll splice in a video from another creator and respond to it with their own video. There's sounds, where people can use similar sounds to kind of create kind of memes and, and different conversations or promote similar ideas about things. So there's ways that connections across users are facilitated by the platform features that could be helpful for understanding user preferences. Oracle, of course, is a big one, and they've maintained the data for TikTok in the U.S. for a [few] years now, so that one was—sort of followed from that established relationship. So maybe one important thing to note is: earlier on, when we were still in conversations about trying to bring legislation about to ban TikTok, concerns from lawmakers, particularly Republican lawmakers, was that there were greater visibility of Palestinian hashtags on TikTok over Israeli hashtags; supposedly there's some sort of lopsidedness in the content there. So this doesn't have to do with the ownership but with the new app because it's going to be American users only—so they say that there will be global content that will still be visible on the platform, but the users for this app will be American. So it could result in a situation where not only is it a—an app that is composed by only people based in the U.S. but only a subset of American users and particularly ones that perhaps might be right-leaning, which would also, again, have very big impact on the kinds of content that you see there. So ultimately, the new app might look drastically different than it does right now, depending on what happens with decisions made by the investors, decisions by users, by who stays and who goes, and all that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team led by Rice University physicist Frank Geurts has achieved a major milestone in particle physics by measuring the temperature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at different stages of its evolution. Measuring temperatures in environments where no instrument can physically survive has long challenged scientists. The team overcame this by studying thermal electron-positron pairs released during high-speed collisions of atomic nuclei at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. These emissions provided a way to reconstruct how hot the plasma became as it formed and cooled. "Our measurements unlock QGP's thermal fingerprint," said Geurts, a professor of physics and astronomy and co-spokesperson of the RHIC STAR collaboration. "Tracking dilepton emissions has allowed us to determine how hot the plasma was and when it started to cool, providing a direct view of conditions just microseconds after the universe's inception." The quark-gluon plasma is a unique state of matter where the basic building blocks of protons and neutrons, quarks and gluons, exist freely rather than being confined inside particles. "Thermal lepton pairs, or electron-positron emissions produced throughout the QGP's lifetime, emerged as ideal candidates," Geurts said. "Unlike quarks, which can interact with the plasma, these leptons pass through it largely unscathed, carrying undistorted information about their environment." Detecting these fleeting pairs among countless other particles required extremely sensitive equipment and meticulous calibration. Despite challenges in distinguishing genuine thermal signals from unrelated processes, the researchers obtained highly precise measurements. This contrast suggests that low-mass dielectrons are produced later in the plasma's evolution, while high-mass ones come from its initial, more energetic stage. "This work reports average QGP temperatures at two distinct stages of evolution and multiple baryonic chemical potentials, marking a significant advance in mapping the QGP's thermodynamic properties," Geurts said. By precisely measuring the temperature of the QGP at different points in its evolution, scientists gain crucial experimental data needed to complete the "QCD phase diagram," which is essential for mapping out how fundamental matter behaves under immense heat and density, akin to conditions that existed moments after the big bang and are present in cosmic phenomena like neutron stars. "Armed with this thermal map, researchers can now refine their understanding of QGP lifetimes and its transport properties, thus improving our understanding of the early universe," Geurts said.
