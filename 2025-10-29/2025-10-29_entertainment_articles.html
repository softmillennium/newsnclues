                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's Department of Justice has indicted Democratic congressional hopeful Kat Abughazaleh, along with five others, for conspiring to impede the work of a federal law enforcement officer. The indictment accuses Abughazaleh — whose name is repeatedly misspelled in the document — of bracing her hands on the hood of an ICE vehicle that was attempting to drive through a group of protesters outside of the Broadview Processing Center, ICE's Chicago command center. Since announcing her candidacy, Abughazaleh has made ICE's violent deployment in Chicago a focal point of her campaign, holding press conferences and participating in protests at Broadview. On social media, she's documented officers reacting violently to protesters presence: Abughazaleh was slammed to the ground in one incident, and hit in the face with a baton during a separate encounter. “Since I and others have exercised our first amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls and teargassed hundreds of protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors and terrorizing us cannot become our new normal,” she says in the video posted Wednesday. “And because Chicago doesn't back down from bullies in masks who tear gas our neighborhoods, this administration has resorted to weaponizing the federal justice system to scare us into silence. Abughazaleh announced her bid to primary Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who has represented Illinois' 9th District since 1999, in March. Abughazaleh was the first to announce in a crowded field that had grown to 18 candidates, including two state senators, a state representative, and Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss. According to a Public Policy Polling survey conducted in September, two thirds of Evanston residents oppose the aggressive tactics ICE has used in the city.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Fresh off her record-breaking rookie year in the WNBA, Paige Bueckers is looking to make her leap onto the big screen, as sources tell Deadline she is attached to star in the sports pic Jess & Pearl. Apple Original Films is developing the film, which is based on an original idea by Scandal alum Zahir McGhee. The White Lotus producer David Bernad will produce the movie through his Middle Child Pictures banner, alongside Wasserman's Lindsay Kagawa Colas and Tommy Alter. Set in the world of women's basketball, the film follows two phenoms who forge an extraordinary bond as teammates until fame, competition and the ruthless business of college athletics threaten to turn their friendship into an epic rivalry. One of college basketball's most decorated players, Bueckers helped lead the UConn Huskies to the 2025 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship. It is in in pre-production on the fourth season of The White Lotus, which has earned 66 Emmy nominations and 16 wins across three seasons. A co-executive producer on the Hulu series Reasonable Doubt, McGhee spent six seasons on Scandal, where he rose to co-executive producer. His writing credits also include Private Practice, Stumptown and For the People. Colas is repped by Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. McGhee is repped by UTA and Matt Johnson at JSS&K. Bernad is repped by CAA and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

Another round of 1,000 job cuts is expected in the coming months. “People are very on-edge,” said one staffer, describing the mood as “depressed and unhappy” and “a very tough day at the network.” The two hosts of CBS Saturday Morning, Michelle Miller and Dana Jacobson, will be departing, according to a source familiar with the cuts. Jeff Glor, the previous host and former anchor of CBS Evening News, was laid off in a previous round of cuts last year, as Paramount Global slimmed down in preparation for a sale.

NBC News announced layoffs of about 150 staffers as it prepared for the split from sister network MSNBC, which is being spun off along with other Comcast cable networks into a new company, Versant. There were significant layoffs to teams devoted to diversity verticals, such as NBC Out and NBC Blk, although those online sites will continue. “Today, we once again see the toll on media workers and the news industry caused by unfettered corporate consolidation.

One of the more chilling self-financed indies in recent memory now has an ideal distributor to get it in front of a real audience. Todd Wiseman Jr.‘s “The School Duel” tells the story of a near-future Florida where school shootings are so common, the AR-15 toting governor (Oscar Nuñez) has mandated that contests to the death be organized to pit troubled or at-risk students against each other.

This is a film designed to inspire obsession, and Altered Innocence, which has shepherded the releases of Vera Drew's “The People's Joker” (one of the IndieWire Critics Survey's Top 50 Movies of 2024), along with Chile's Oscar submission “The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo,” Alexis Langlois' “Queens of Drama,” and the 4K re-release of Frank Ripploh's “Taxi zum Klo” is well-positioned to fuel that obsession. It later played Fantasia, though you'd be better off going in thinking this is a Scorsese-like character study (powered by the extraordinary Lawrence, who plays Sam like a 14-year-old Travis Bickle) than a pure genre piece. It's far more emotional, and really deals with a grounded reality for a setup that invokes “The Hunger Games” or “Battle Royale” — what if those films explored the full emotional depth of their concept? “We're thrilled to bring ‘The School Duel' to North American audiences,” said Frank Jaffe, founder of Altered Innocence. Fans of films like ‘The Hunger Games' and ‘Battle Royale' finally now have something else to feast on!” Actor Tim Blake Nelson, who has now boarded the film as a presenting executive producer, said, “Todd's film has the best of what indie film can offer: a story of and for our moment with a strong and uncompromising point of view that's fully realized. I am proud to be associated with it.” The film was produced by Christa Boarini, Bryan Gaynor, Bobby Marinelli, and Wiseman. AMP will handle international sales at the upcoming American Film Market.

In the Halloween episode, co-host Alfonso Ribeiro announced that Derek had indeed won “Sexiest 40-Year-Old” in People's 2025 poll, while contestant Dylan Efron took home “Sexiest Tattoos.” A post shared by Daniella Karagach Pashkova (@daniellakaragach) As Ribeiro appeared behind him with clippers in hand, Derek mouthed, “No way.” After the reveal, Derek doubled down on his hesitation, later asking fans on Instagram Stories whether he should go through with the buzzcut. While chatting on Instagram Stories with his wife, Hayley Erbert, and friend Jill, Derek admitted he's never shaved his head before. Erbert, 31, tried convincing him with “inspo pics” of David Beckham's iconic buzzcut. “That could look really good,” she said, but Derek wasn't convinced.

When Burke returned to the ballroom as a special guest judge for Week 7 of Season 34, fans were excited. A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars) Burke appeared alongside judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough, and Bruno Tonioli. She has been where the competitors and their professional dancers have been before, and she has even won the Mirrorball Trophy early in her career: in Season 2 alongside Drew Lachey and in Season 3 with former NFL player Emmitt Smith.

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars) Fans were also upset with Burke's scoring of Robert Irwin and professional partner Witney Carson.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The superstar isn't ready to concede defeat after a judge dismissed his lawsuit against UMG over diss track lyrics that labeled him a "certified pedophile." It ain't over yet: Drake has formally launched his appeal of a court ruling that dismissed his defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's diss track “Not Like Us.” If the appeals court sides with Drake, it could mean years more litigation after that. In his new court filing, Drake formally stated his intention to appeal, but did not include any detailed arguments on how he will do so. Such arguments are made in later briefs at the appeals court, where lawyers for both sides will eventually make their case. A rep for Drake told Billboard on Wednesday: “This confirms our intent to appeal, and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing that filing in the coming weeks.” A spokesman for UMG did not immediately return a request for comment. Lamar released “Not Like Us” in May 2024 amid a war of words with Drake that saw the two UMG stars release a series of bruising diss tracks. In January, Drake took UMG to court over the song, claiming his own label had defamed him by boosting its popularity. Just 10 months after Drake filed it, Judge Jeannette Vargas dismissed the case. She said Kendrick's insulting lyrics were the kind of hyperbolic opinions that cannot be defamatory because listeners would not think they were statements of fact. She said fans didn't expect to hear “accurate factual reporting” from a diss track “replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language.” “The artists' seven-track rap battle was a ‘war of words' that was the subject of substantial media scrutiny and online discourse,” Judge Vargas wrote. “Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff.” On appeal, Drake's lawyers will likely revive their core argument: That many fans did, in fact, take those lyrics seriously. They'll likely say that the case was legally plausible enough to survive into longer term litigation, and that by dismissing it at the outset, she unfairly deprived them of a chance to prove those allegations with hard evidence. If the appeals court sides with those arguments, it will revive the case and send it back to Judge Vargas for more discovery into Drake's allegations and potentially toward a jury trial.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Other honorees include Jennifer Hudson, Damson Idris and Salli Richardson-Whitfield. The American Black Film Festival (ABFF) on Tuesday announced this year's honorees for its annual ABFF Honors awards ceremony, “recognizing excellence in the motion picture and television industry.” This year, the organization will celebrate the creative team behind Sinners, including writer-director-producer Ryan Coogler, producer Zinzi Coogler and producer Sev Ohanian. Noah Wyle Reveals How USC's Norman Lear Center Helped Make 'The Pitt' "the Most Medically Accurate Show on TV" “This year's honorees each represent the spirit of what ABFF stands for — creativity, excellence, and purpose,” said CEO and president of Nice Crowd, which presents the ABFF Honors, Jeff Friday and Nicole Friday. “Ryan Coogler, Zinzi Coogler and Sev Ohanian have redefined the power of collaboration and vision with Sinners, creating something that speaks to our shared humanity while pushing the boundaries of cinematic storytelling. The 2026 ABFF Honors will take place on Feb. 16 at the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, and will be hosted by author and comedian KevOnStage. ABFF Honors are part of the American Black Film Festival, which was founded by Jeff Friday in 1997, and is the “leading festival of its kind showcasing Black storytelling,” according to the organization. “Since its inception, the ABFF has been dedicated to supporting Friday's conviction that Black artists deserve the same opportunities as their mainstream counterparts. ABFF Honors is executive produced by Jeff Friday, Nicole Friday (NICE CROWD) and Rikki Hughes (Magic Lemonade) in association with dePasse Jones Entertainment.

None of these movies, even the good ones, came close to equaling the entertainment value or literary qualities of Tarantino‘s masterpiece, but their proliferation had a weird side effect: keeping critics and audiences from recognizing and appreciating the handful of post-“Pulp Fiction” crime films that actually were great. Related Stories ‘Wayumi,' DOC NYC World Premiere About Indigenous Amazon Rainforest Family, Gets Digital Release from Grasshopper Film Slamdance Announces Screenplay Competition Winners for 2025 — Read the Full List In the years following “Pulp Fiction,” a kind of cinematic Gresham's Law set in, where there were so many movies featuring guys with guns on their posters that they became indistinguishable from one another. A late entry in several traditions that audiences, and especially critics, had by this point had their fill of, “Gang Related” debuted to minimal business and mixed reviews. “Gang Related” is a case in point, and 28 years after its release, the virtues we took for granted then seem both obvious and vital. When they inadvertently kill an undercover DEA agent, all hell breaks loose, as a massive federal investigation begins and the corrupt buddies — who have been placed in charge of the investigation, thus ironically assigned to hunt themselves — have to find somebody to pin the murder on before it can get traced back to them. That's because, as was so often the case with film noir movies of the 1940s — another tradition to which “Gang Related” owes a considerable debt — “Gang Related” doesn't just establish a concept but tells a story that keeps unfolding from beginning to end. Without revealing any of those developments, since Kouf's ability to keep the audience guessing is one of the film's greatest pleasures, I'll just say that each of them builds on what came before to create a textured, complex, and chilling portrait of institutional corruption — Belushi and Shakur may be the bad guys, but their behavior is seen less as an aberration than an organic outgrowth of both the lingering culture of a post-Daryl Gates, post-Rodney King LAPD and a society that values the pursuit of money above nearly everything else. Like Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry Callahan, Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs is appealing not in spite of his unrestrained violence but because of it — since most of us constantly find ourselves powerless in daily life, it's fun to relate to a character who has nothing but power and exercises it without restriction and without reflection. While the “Dirty Harry” movies (particularly the one Eastwood directed himself, “Sudden Impact”) traffic in a certain amount of moral complexity and ambiguity, the “Lethal Weapon” films strip the formula down to its primal essence, to the point that they became not just apologies for but celebrations of police violence and civil rights violations — as Jonathan Rosenbaum pointed out in his review of “Lethal Weapon 3,” a movie that, astonishingly, rode to box office supremacy only a year after the Rodney King beating, the movie could just as accurately have been titled “How to Have Fun in a Police State.” “Gang Related” uses aspects of the “Lethal Weapon” formula as a template, but veers closer to “Dirty Harry” territory — and then goes beyond it — by depicting its buddies as morally vacant sharks, in constant motion with no other purpose than self-protection and the accumulation of some extra cash. Kouf gets extra mileage out of his actors by casting against type; seeing comic everyman Belushi as a nihilistic fascist and anti-cop rapper Tupac Shakur as a policeman (albeit one who's more of a criminal than the criminals he's supposed to be arresting) gives the whole movie an added sense of electric energy. Much as “Gang Related” is an aberration in the buddy cop genre, it's also a bit of an aberration in Kouf's career — not that he was the kind of writer or director who was ever limited to one type of film. The main thing his best movies have in common isn't genre but that they're transcendent examples of their genre — as is the case with “Gang Related,” Kouf is rarely the first filmmaker to do whatever he's doing, but he's often one of the best. In the early 1980s, Kouf wrote a series of teen-oriented comedies that contained far more wit and energy than most of their brethren — the now nearly forgotten “Up the Creek,” about a college river raft race, consists of pretty much wall-to-wall laughs, and the 1985 “Secret Admirer” plays like an Ernst Lubitsch roundelay for high schoolers. Among his other credits, ironically, are a pair of John Badham buddy cop movies — “Stakeout” and “Another Stakeout” — that deliver the more traditional satisfactions of the genre. Kouf is as solid a Hollywood craftsman as anyone in the business (he was one of the writers on “National Treasure,” one of the more satisfying and clever entertainments of Jerry Bruckheimer's 2000s output), but there's something extra fun about seeing him apply his talents to a piece of work as dark, nasty, and trenchant as “Gang Related.” While the virtues of “Gang Related” may have been less apparent when it got lost in the shuffle of 1990s genre films, now that those kinds of movies are theatrically released with far less frequency, it's hard to see how its greatness could ever have been ignored. A new Blu-ray from boutique label Cinématographe is finally giving “Gang Related” a worthy physical media release, with a pristine new 4K restoration from the original camera negative and hours of extra features; there's also a beautiful accompanying booklet with terrific essays by Quatoyiah Murry, Brandon Streussnig, and modern noir expert Travis Woods. It's not only one of the best Blu-rays of 2025, but a reminder that time is the ultimate critic — and that “Gang Related” has not only passed and stood the test of time but gets better with every passing year. “Gang Related” is currently available on Blu-ray from Cinématographe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company has announced upwards of 2,000 imminent layoffs, veteran newscasters are leaving amid Bari Weiss' takeover of CBS News, and the P+ golden boy Taylor Sheridan has jumped ship for NBCUniversal. According to the outlet, while sources on both sides may disagree about the particulars, “all agree Paramount never actually made an offer to lock down Sheridan.” But Sheridan was reportedly already having problems with his home base studio before the Skydance merger brought Ellison's regime in. at Warner Bros. (WB Discovery CEO David Zaslav reportedly also tried to woo Sheridan away from Paramount by visiting him in Texas and gifting him a pair of cowboy boots worn by James Dean, a hilarious detail in light of the fact that Sheridan went with NBCU instead. After the merger, Paramount got rid of most of Sheridan's closest contacts, including former president and CEO for Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks Chris McCarthy. While Ellison and a number of other execs did meet with Sheridan after the merger, it sounds like the Yellowstone mastermind requires a more personal touch. Then Paramount rejected Sheridan's new series The Correspondent (about a war correspondent on the front lines of Afghanistan), and making television somewhere else started to look pretty attractive, too. This all culminates in a major loss for Paramount, as Taylor Sheridan's empire seemed to be singlehandedly keeping Paramount+ afloat. But the new regime is being pretty ruthless about cutting costs, and Sheridan's productions are notoriously expensive. It's said he doesn't like to have his budgets questioned, nor to get any notes back on his scripts, and the new overlords were doing both. On the other side, David Ellison has been working to launch a new era at the studio with big, buzzy talent deals, and didn't want to give Sheridan carte blanche for his.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, Aesop Rock quietly shared a new album called I Heard It's a Mess There Too. The quick follow-up to May's Black Hole Superette is now widely available across digital streaming platforms, via Rhymesayers. Listen to the 12-song album below, and watch a video for “Full House Pinball,” directed by  Justin “Coro” Kaufman. Aesop Rock says in a press release, “The phrase ‘I Heard It's a Mess There Too' started as a lyric, but it got its hooks in me soon after. It felt familiar, like something I'd said a thousand times while checking in with friends across different cities. It's about observation and communication. Sonically, I wanted a reset—cleaner beats, more space, fewer layers. Just enough to get a wave rolling and not much more.” Pitchfork may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

That kind of turned everything upstairs into fight or flight. A post shared by Rolling Stone Nashville Now (@rollingstonecountry) “Everything in me was fight or flight… It felt like a lot of anger. Johnson says he didn't stop writing songs completely, but that his output was diminished. According to Johnson, who's now sober from alcohol, he was also drinking heavily after the fall. “That's right about the time I started [to get] blackout drunk. In hindsight, Johnson says the fall was more severe than he first believed. “That thing did a lot more damage than I thought it had done at the time,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift is reportedly keeping a low profile at her fiancé Travis Kelce's NFL games because of security concerns. With all this in mind, Swift has reportedly made “a little more natural progression” toward being “less out there and attracting attention,” the insider claimed. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. In fact, she was caught on camera swooning when Kelce, 36, made a major play at Monday's Kansas City Chiefs versus Washington Commanders game. The athlete went on to score his 100th career touchdown, marking a milestone only reached by four tight ends in history. He busted out Swift's dance moves from the “Fate of Ophelia” music video to celebrate. Swift cheered with Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany Mahomes, and the season will continue to play out “on case-by-case situation depending how” her partner does, the Daily Mail claimed. Swift's rep did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. The songwriter, notably, has not been photographed walking into an Arrowhead Stadium game all season — and even snuck in from behind a screen on one occasion. Swift has been dating Kelce and attending his games since 2023, with the three-time Super Bowl winner proposing to her in August.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not if Alex Warren, sombr & Leon Thomas have anything to say about it. For months, it looked like the Grammy race for best new artist was likely to come down to Alex Warren and sombr. And the Recording Academy ruled Leon Thomas eligible, even though he won a Grammy three years ago for co-writing SZA's “Snooze.” Now, we have a real race. With the nominations set to be announced next Friday (Nov. 7), all four of these artists certain to be nominated for best new artist, along with Lola Young. After that, it gets harder to choose, but the field will be rounded out with three other nominees, culled from a list of 337 eligible names. So Dean has about six weeks for her profile to continue building before the first votes are cast. If Dean (or Young) winds up winning, this will be the ninth year in a row that a solo woman has been named best new artist. The streak started in 2018 with Alessia Cara and has continued with Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Megan Thee Stallion, Olivia Rodrigo, Samara Joy, Victoria Monét and Chappell Roan. The Marías, which span multiple genres and languages, also have a good chance of being nominated. If they were to win, they'd be the first group (defined as an act with three or more members) to take the prize since fun. Three other groups are seen as having a reasonably good shot at a nod: Sleep Token, KATSEYE and The Red Clay Strays. Some of the top contenders have already won new artist prizes at other shows. Warren won best new artist at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sept. 7. Thomas won best new artist at the BET Awards on June 9. Even some acts that won new artist awards in 2024 are eligible. (The Grammys in recent years have erred on the side of being inclusive in this category. In previous eras, they almost seemed to be looking for nitpicky reasons to kick artists out – just ask the people around Whitney Houston and Richard Marx who are probably still smarting over their exclusions.) BigXthaPlug and Bailey Zimmerman, who collaborated on the top five Hot 100 hit “All the Way,” are competing against each other here. Sleep Token and Ken Carson, who both landed No. So is Role Model, who made a vivid impression late in the eligibility year with his irresistible breakthrough hit “Sally, When the Wine Runs Out.” Other strong contenders, not already mentioned, include Ravyn Lenae, Mariah the Scientist, Addison Rae, Jessie Murph, Gigi Perez, Riley Green, October London, Sam Fender, Reneé Rapp, PinkPantheress, Tucker Wetmore, ATEEZ, Central Cee, Lil Tecca, Parker McCollum and Keke Palmer. While the Grammys set a minimum number of releases an artist must have to qualify in this category (five singles/tracks or one album), there is no maximum. Instead, the Grammys' rules and guidelines booklet says nominations for the honor hinge on when “the artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence” — and it delegates that determination to a screening committee. Artists are allowed to appear on the entry list for best new artist three times, after which they are ruled ineligible for future consideration. Here are the eight leading nominees for best new artist. The artists are shown in alphabetical order, which is how they'll be listed on the Grammy nominees list. Her breakout hit, “Man I Need,” has reached No. If she wins: She'll be the first artist from England to win since Dua Lipa in 2019. Her breakout single, “Love Me Not,” reached No. “Love Me Not” was released in May 2024, but it's eligible for record of the year this year. If she wins: Lenae, rather than Dean, will keep the winning streak alive for women artists in this category. Both album and single were released in the previous eligibility year, so they're not eligible this year. (There's more flexibility in this category for acts that needed a little more time to break through.) The Marías consists of lead vocalist María Zardoya, drummer/producer Josh Conway, guitarist Jesse Perlman, and keyboardist Edward James. The Marías were nominated for album of the year three years ago as featured artists on Bad Bunny's Un Verano Sin Ti. They owe their eligibility in this category to a rule change this year that allows artists with previous album of the year nominations to compete for best new artist if they appeared on 20 percent or less of the album's playing time. He has had a pair of top 20 hits on the Hot 100, “Back to Friends” and “Undressed.” The hits were concurrent, so sombr neatly sidestepped the one-hit-wonder worry that has bedeviled newcomers since the dawn of record-making. sombr's impressive songwriting earned a shout-out from Taylor Swift, who was nominated for best new artist 18 years ago. Sombr's camp entered “Back to Friends” and not “Undressed” for record and song of the year. Sombr may be new to the game, but he knows enough not to risk splitting your votes at awards shows. If he wins: At 20, he would be the youngest winner since Olivia Rodrigo, who was just 18 when she won in 2023. He'd be the youngest male artist ever to win. (Just by being nominated, he would be the youngest male nominee since Khalid, who was 19 when he was nominated at the 2018 ceremony.) The title track, an old-school soul ballad in all its 1970s-evoking glory, has climbed as high as No. “Mutt” was released in the previous eligibility year, so it isn't eligible for record of the year, but an alternate take, “Mutt (Live From NPR's Tiny Desk),” is entered. At 32, Thomas is the oldest of this year's top contenders for best new artist, though several other artists with a reasonably good chance of a nod have passed The Big 3-0. They include Sam Fender, 31; Riley Green, 37; and October London, 39. If he wins: He'll be the first person who has already won a Grammy to win best new artist since Lauryn Hill in 1999. As noted above, Thomas won best R&B song three years ago for co-writing SZA's “Snooze.” He was allowed to compete here this year because this was his breakthrough as an artist. Hill was allowed to compete for best new artist even though she had won two Grammys two years earlier as a member of Fugees. His stats: His second studio album, Ain't in It for My Health, debuted and peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard 200, 20 notches higher than the peak position of his debut album, Cold Beer and Country Music. “I Never Lie,” from the first album, reached No. If he wins: He'll be the first country artist to win since Zac Brown Band in 2010; the first male solo country artist ever to win. If he wins: He'd be the second best new artist winner whose breakout year included a 10-week No. Debby Boone was the first with her 1977 megahit “You Light Up My Life.” (Interestingly, both are quasi-religious power ballads.) “Ordinary” was Billboard's Song of the Summer, even though most agreed it wasn't very summery. Warren is vying to become the fourth Song of the Summer champ to go on to win the Grammy for best new artist, following Carpenters, Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera. (Their song of the summer winners, as you surely know, were “(They Long to Be) Close to You,” “Vision of Love” and “Genie in a Bottle,” respectively.) Tyler, The Creator's “Like Him,” on which she was featured, reached No. “Messy” was released in the previous eligibility year, but it's entered for record of the year nonetheless. If she wins: She, rather than Dean, will become the first artist from England to win since Dua Lipa in 2019.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Considering Slow Horses is Apple TV's most consistently entertaining (and released) series to date, Down Cemetery Road, another adaptation of novelist Mick Herron's work, begs a reductive but not unfair question: So who plays the Gary Oldman part in this thing? In this new show, Thompson's Zoë Boehm isn't even remotely as gross as Lamb (or as accomplished of an investigator), but she is indeed the cynical “crusty but benign” one, to quote Network, that Herron has a soft spot for, the kind of snoop who plows past receptionists shouting out “excuse me, you can't just come in here!” and always seems armed with a quick retort or a “fuck off.” If there is a rebel in this particularly sunny stretch of Oxford, it's her—which essentially means she has a cool haircut, wears a leather jacket and boots, and likes The Clash. That distinction goes to Sarah Tucker, played by The Affair‘s Ruth Wilson, a meek art conservationist with a fondness for fall sweaters and riding her vintage bike throughout some rom-com-worthy streetscapes to the tune of “Every Time The Sun Comes Up” by Sharon Van Etten. When Sarah tries to deliver a card from a kid neighbor to the little girl who survived that explosion, she's looked at suspiciously by hospital staff and becomes obsessed with finding out what's going on and where she might be. But what starts as a missing-child case soon balloons into a bigger government coverup concerning experiments on British troops, bringing Zoë and Ruth to different corners of the U.K., including a ghost island off the Scottish coast that's littered with landmines and, in a nifty and well-executed bit of suspense building, an overnight train barreling through the north of England stalked by an Anton Chigurh-like assassin. Like Slow Horses, Down Cemetery Road keeps viewers on their toes, unafraid of killing off a character any other show would keep around. And there are some episode-ending big twists early on that are genuinely surprising, even in this age of twisty-thriller oversaturation, and make you quickly skip to the next one. This all could come off like an overused formula if these duos weren't so often enjoyable to watch, especially when Boyd's character delivers threatening-with-a-posh-grin lines like “Everything is tickety-boo as the old-fart flannels in this building would say?” as his direct report smiles both dummy and fearfully and then gives a “That's very good, sir.” This mixture of comedy and the occasionally gnarly killing (as if to highlight that very dynamic, there's a memorable bit when a crew is wiped out as a sitcom blasts, with blood splattering against against the TV screen) is also, at points, reminiscent of another recent British standout, Black Doves. And Down Cemetery Road, like that show, has some stylistic flourishes from director Natalie Bailey (who previously helmed episodes of Armando Iannucci's essential The Thick of It), including an overhead shot of a truly opulent space that's hiding some truly awful secrets. If there are more shows like this coming down the pike—thrillers with heavy doses of humor, generally fantastic casting (Wilson, it's worth noting, gives a very good and tricky star performance here), a sizable budget, and some smart narrative decisions (more refreshingly abrupt, life-goes-on endings like this one, please)—viewers should consider themselves pretty lucky.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Based on the novel by Mick Herron, the series features Thompson and Ruth Wilson as women unraveling a conspiracy and seeking a missing girl. For a series about misfit intelligence operatives doggedly refusing to live up to even the lowest level of their potential, Apple TV's Slow Horses is remarkably self-actualized. Each season thus far has been six episodes, with those episodes usually averaging 45 minutes, durations that have yet to feel too long or too short. Seasons have dealt with weighty, headline-ripping topics and they've killed off several beloved characters, but Will Smith and his creative team have always known the precise quantity of humor necessary to protect Slow Horses from ever being either ponderous or frivolous. Robin Wright Didn't Expect Such a Split Reaction to 'The Girlfriend' Ending Jon Stewart, Emma Thompson, Christopher Guest Talks Added to New Yorker Festival Lineup (Exclusive) Airdate: Wednesday, October 29 (Apple TV)Cast: Emma Thompson, Ruth Wilson, Fehinti Balogun, Adeel Akhtar, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, Darren BoydCreator: Morwenna Banks That's a high (and specific) bar, and if Apple TV's Down Cemetery Road wasn't based on a novel series from Slow Horses author Mick Herron, wasn't adapted for TV by Slow Horses veteran Morwenna Banks and didn't, in spots, feel an awful lot like Slow Horses, I wouldn't make the comparison at all. In its first season, Down Cemetery Road struggles with exactly the structural elements that seemed to come so naturally for Slow Horses. At eight episodes, most running over 50 minutes, Down Cemetery Road feels consistently padded and, especially in its first half, the momentum meanders in frustrating ways. But when you have a show built around the perfectly cast Emma Thompson, instantly whetting appetites for adaptations of the next three Herron-penned Zoë Boehm mysteries, and a top-notch supporting ensemble led by Ruth Wilson and breakout Fehinti Balogun, the flaws become minor irritants and not dealbreakers. (Actually, Wilson isn't really part of the “supporting” cast. Sarah is an Oxford-based art restorationist, living largely in the shadow of her dithering husband Mark (Tom Riley), a mid-level financier more interested in his professional mobility than paying attention to whether his wife is personally fulfilled. Self-conscious about her own childlessness, Sarah latches onto a single, earlier meeting with the girl and her now-deceased mother, and when she accidentally stumbles into a private investigator's office she sees the chance to get to the bottom of things. The explosion and the girl's disappearance are tied to an elaborate and confusing conspiracy that involves a shady, unnamed government agent (Darren Boyd); his bumbling underling (Adeel Akhtar's Hamza); a menacing assassin named Amos (Balogun); and a mysterious man (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, plagued by an underwritten role) who keeps popping up in Sarah's life with ambiguous intent. A lot of what is unwieldy about Down Cemetery Road stems from the source novel, which predates the Slough House series and showcases a writer with an exceptional gift for dialogue and characterization but a more nascent sense of rudimentary storytelling. She also has a confusingly explained and depicted past trauma. But the conspiracy they've plunged into is perfunctory, and the entire story is populated by red herrings, whole characters who exist to make you think they're important only to vanish very quickly, often never to be discussed again. It's two women trying to save a young woman and constantly being interfered with by mediocre men who are at best vestigial and at worst murderous. Unlike Slow Horses, in which everything is essential and nothing is filler, Down Cemetery Road spends four episodes introducing you to things that are entirely filler. One might easily reach the midpoint in the show unable to say what it's actually about, what anybody is trying to do and what difference it would make if Sarah and company fail in their mission. Then the last few episodes become a series of set pieces in which our characters are split into three or four groups heading for common destinations, and solid suspense develops from the intercutting, taking the place of any real urgency. Balogun, who stole scenes from Ewan McGregor in Paramount+'s A Gentleman in Moscow, has a smooth, searing confidence, mowing through extras and secondary characters with vicious efficiency. You can't take your eyes off of Balogun, and it will be interesting to see what casting directors do with him once the show puts him on more radars; he's a star, though what type of star remains to be seen. He also manages to steal the show out from under Thompson, but with a part this juicy, that's only an almost. Zoë suffers neither fools nor even the generally competent, and there are few actors, if any, whom you'd rather watch verbally eviscerate people for eight straight hours. Thompson is perfectly paired with Wilson, an actor who can go from disheveled wallflower to calculating plotter to deer-in-the-headlights comic fighter with a widening of the eye or twisting of the lips. It's no surprise that Down Cemetery Road is at its best when Thompson and Wilson share scenes, but it's odd that in expanding Zoë's profile for the series — the book is closer to 80 percent focused on Sarah — Banks and her writing team didn't give them more time together. It's the odd choices that keep Down Cemetery Road from living up to its full potential, from telling a story that feels like it's building to something instead of stumbling around finding itself, even if that's what its main characters are doing. Still, the teaming of Thompson and Wilson, together and separately, was a choice as well — one that pays off in planting the seeds for further adventures (maybe or maybe not involving Wilson's character) that might come closer to that Slow Horses level of self-actualization.
