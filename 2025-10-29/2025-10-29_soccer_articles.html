                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionesses had mixed fortunes in friendly double-header that highlighted some areas where they need to improve England's first camp of the year was one of new beginnings as Sarina Wiegman's side returned for the first time since winning a second successive European Championship. There was deep concern for Michelle Agyemang when she went down with a serious looking knee injury with 10 minutes to play against Australia in Derby on Tuesday. “We don't know yet but I'm not very positive about what I've seen.” Injury woes have been mounting for Wiegman since the summer with key players already missing. Grace Clinton was missing with a knock, Jess Park was out with concussion, and Lotte Wubben‑Moy had to leave camp early through illness. Everyone wants to win football matches but the Lionesses were presented with a huge opportunity for experimentation in this series of friendlies, with two more games to come against China (29 November) and Ghana (2 December) to close out 2025. With the pressure eased, Wiegman took used this opening, handing out three debuts and giving players crucial minutes. Aston Villa's Lucia Kendall took her chance against Australia and was arguably one of the best performers. This was the 21-year-old's first call‑up from the under-23s but she looked like she belonged instantly, comfortable in possession, creating opportunities and at ease amongst seasoned internationals. Depth at left-back has been a consistent issue but Taylor Hinds's adept performance against the Matildas will have given the coaching staff plenty of food for thought. Khiara Keating also made her long-awaited debut, starting against Brazil. There were also key minutes for players who have found themselves on the periphery, such as Esme Morgan, Maya Le Tissier, Missy Bo Kearns and Aggie Beever-Jones. The Lionesses tend to labour against pacy, direct attackers while also being guilty of making early errors. Jess Carter and Morgan were the centre-back partnership in a new defensive unit against Brazil. The lack of suitable cover for Lucy Bronze, however, remains a problem. Leah Williamson's absence was also felt, not only in the leadership she brings as captain but also how fundamental she is to the way England build going forward. No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women's football There has never been any doubt about Aggie Beever-Jones' qualities as a goalscorer. While certainly an out-an-out No 9, the key strength of Beever-Jones is her versatility which gives Wiegman added attacking dynamism. She started on the left against Australia and was the most dangerous player early on, while her goal was another illustration of her range of scoring ability. A strangely frustrating aspect from these two friendlies for England will have been the limited minutes they had to challenge themselves against a full-strength opposition. Brazil's Angelina and Australia's Alanna Kennedy both saw red around the 20th minute for denying goalscoring opportunities. But their lack of clinical finishing persisted despite the wealth of attackers they possess, and is an area where they can improve.</p>

A string of underwhelming performances and results, combined with the decision to skip the Gold Cup this summer, subjected the 26-year-old to a wave of criticism. New SI FC Newsletter Global Embed. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. Lalas, a vocal critic of the AC Milan forward, did not hold back when addressing Pulisic's captaincy on the State of the Union podcast. The 55-year-old went on to mention Chris Richards, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams, but admitted those players are “not quite there yet.” Pulisic has been the USMNT's standout player since he burst onto the scene, displaying a talent that kickstarted the Stars and Stripes' “golden generation.” Pulisic also stars for AC Milan and has a long list of both Serie A and Champions League accolades to his name. Yet, according to Lalas, his skill should not guarantee him the captaincy of the USMNT. “The notion that your best player is not necessarily equipped to be a captain is nothing new. It's not even necessarily somebody that's larger than life. And oftentimes you have to be able to take a step away and say, ‘This is what's good for the team,'” Lalas said. It might be some time before Pulisic can return and potentially prove Lalas wrong; the winger suffered a hamstring injury during the October international window and AC Milan have reportedly asked Mauricio Pochettino not to call up their superstar in November.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Check out our soccer expert's Swansea vs Man City predictions, prior to Wednesday's 3:45pm ET EFL Cup clash (10/29). Man City have often performed better after the interval this season. They've scored 59% of their Premier League goals in the second half. Swansea might treat this match somewhat like an away game. Only two goals have been scored in the first half of their Championship away fixtures this term. Erling Haaland is expected to be rested, so they'll fancy their chances of keeping it tight until the interval. It's evident that the visitors depend on Haaland for goals this term. He has scored 65% of his team's goals in the English top flight. Haaland didn't play in City's third-round tie away to Huddersfield. Guardiola's team won that game 2-0 against League One opposition, but they weren't convincing. Facing a Swansea side that is quite well organised at the back will be much more difficult. Alan Sheehan's team have only conceded 12 goals in 12 Championship games so far this season. The Egyptian suffered a knee injury earlier this term, but has been fit enough to feature off the bench in each of his team's last two games. Marmoush demonstrated his goal-scoring abilities in the second half of last season following a January move from Eintracht Frankfurt. Man City head into this game following a major setback in the Premier League on Sunday. They won all of their previous three matches to nil. The Swans have already won three home EFL Cup ties this season. However, they've only won two of their seven league games since then. Swansea expected lineup: Fisher, Key, Cabango, Burgess, Tymon, Stamenic, Widell, Fulton, Galbraith, Franco, Idah Man City expected lineup: Trafford, O'Reilly, Ake, Stones, Lewis, Gonzalez, Doku, Silva, Reijnders, Cherki, Marmoush</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With two matches of a three-match camp in the books, the USWNT now faces New Zealand in Kansas City, Mo. This fall camp came after a long hiatus with a 113-day gap separating the July 2 win vs. Canada from this week's first match against Portugal on Oct. 23. GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 3) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 4) DEFENDERS (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 3/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 69/1), Eva Gaetino (Paris St-Germain, FRA; 1) Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 9/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 8/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 3/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 112/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0) MIDFIELDERS (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 40/5), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 168/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current; 3/0), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 114/26), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 10/4), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 28/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 10/1) FORWARDS (6): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 9/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 25/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 14/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 10/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 13/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/3) In the last FIFA window, Emma Hayes gave five players their first caps – goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, defenders Jordyn Bugg, Lilly Reale and Izzy Rodriguez and midfielder Sam Meza. All but Rodriguez and Meza are back on this roster, which features just one first-time call-up in Kennedy Wesley. Rodriguez and Meza, who started on June 29 vs. Ireland, became the 23rd and 24th players to debut under Hayes in her 27 games at the helm, a remarkable ratio for the Olympic champion head coach. Hayes has given 28 total players their first USWNT call-ups, but she also gave a first cap to a player who did not get a first call-up under her, as Lily Yohannes earned her first call-up under former interim head coach Twila Kilgore but did not see action under Kilgore. The 24 players who have earned their first USWNT caps under Emma Hayes are: Sam Staab, Lily Yohannes, Croix Bethune, Yazmeen Ryan, Hal Hershfelt, Emily Sams, Emma Sears, Mandy McGlynn, Alyssa Malonson, Eva Gaetino, Ally Sentnor, Tara McKeown, Michelle Cooper, Gisele Thompson, Claire Hutton, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Avery Patterson, Lo'eau LaBonta, Kerry Abello, Claudia Dickey, Lilly Reale, Jordyn Bugg, Sam Meza and Izzy Rodriguez. Defender Eva Gaetino, who was participating in U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team Training Camp this week outside of Philadelphia, has been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team roster and joined the U.S. camp ahead of the final two matches of the FIFA window. After Trinity Rodman's withdrawal from the October camp roster due to injury, the USWNT entered camp with 25 players. With all this in mind, Hayes attended U-23 trainings to assess the players, and, with all of her U-23 teammates looking on, informed Gaetino after one of those trainings that she would be joining the senior team for the rest of camp. The 5-foot-11 central defender is in her second full season, with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Première Ligue after a banner college career at Notre Dame. Ater the 3-0 opening game win over Zambia at the Olympics, Hayes became the first USWNT head coach to win their first major tournament match by a margin of three or more goals and joined Anson Dorrance as the only head coaches in USWNT history to win their first six matches at a major tournament. Hayes joins three other USWNT head coaches of the last eight in USWNT history who won their first major competition (Anson Dorrance – 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, Pia Sundhage – 2008 Olympics, Jill Ellis – 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup). France Football, the top soccer magazine in France and one of the most reputable in Europe, has been awarding the Ballon d'Or to men's players since 1956 and to women's players since 2018, but 2024 was the first year it has given out awards to coaches of men's and women's soccer. Hayes then followed that up by winning The Best FIFA Women's Coach award. Of the players who scored those nine goals over those two games, only Rose Lavelle, who scored twice in Auckland (while wearing the captain's armband) is on this roster. The USA won 5-0 in a match that featured a highly unusual and painful to watch three own goals from one player – defender Meikayla Moore who currently plays for Calgary Wild FC in Canada – along with scores from Ashley Hatch and Mallory Pugh. In Brazil, the USA picked up a 2-0 win behind first-half goals from Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan. In England, the USA won 2-0 on goals from Abby Wambach and Sydney Leroux. In China, the USA won 4-0 on goals from Heather O'Reilly, Amy Rodriguez, Lindsey Tarpley and Angela Hucles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Herc Gomez discusses why he thinks Timothy Weah and Weston McKennie could be left out USMNT new system under Mauricio Pochettino. Years before coaching the U.S. men's national team in preparation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and before managing some of the biggest clubs in world soccer, Mauricio Pochettino was known as "El Sheriff." Marshaling his area of the pitch with an aggressive and vocal presence, the former central defender made a name for himself in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a physical and thundering enforcer. This bold personality and imposing style was seen most prominently in Spain with Espanyol, where Pochettino landed after being molded by the youth ranks of Newell's Old Boys. Through two separate stints that marked the beginning and end of his playing career abroad, the long-haired officer took command at Espanyol. Establishing himself as a captain for the team that would go on to win two Copa del Rey titles, Pochettino showcased traits that paved the early foundations of his eventual and successful pivot to coaching. Analysis of his leadership, and the former player in general, tends to zero in on just his coaching era. In order to better understand Pochettino's process and way of thinking as he prepares for the World Cup with the U.S., we must first also understand him as a player -- especially during his lengthy stay at Espanyol from 1994 to 2001 and 2004 to 2006. "Very typical South American guy from Argentina ... but he was really good." And not just yelling for the sake of yelling, but organizing, directing and advising throughout practice sessions or the 90-plus minutes of a match. "His voice is the way he controls, how he demands players, how we can move together, how we can support each other," said Armando Sá, another former member of the Espanyol backline. I felt like someone [was], every time in my ears, talking, coaching me," Sá said. "'Go left, left, close the space, close that, come down, go inside' ... all these communications on the field were very clean from him, you know? "This made it easy when you play [like] that and one of the reasons we won the Copa del Rey." Before playing alongside each other at Espanyol, former midfielder Óscar García remembered Pochettino standing out when he first faced him with Barcelona. Praised as someone who was also technically good on the ball, and respectful to players and staff at training, it makes sense as to why many of his teammates have fond memories of Pochettino. His desire to guide a roster, coupled with his own skill set, made him an obvious candidate to be captain. "In our first practice sessions, you can immediately notice that this kid has something special. I mean, he was immediately talking, organizing," said Velko Iotov, a former Bulgaria international, when reminiscing about Pochettino's early days. "Immediately, all the teammates saw him as a leader." Described by Sá as "a different beast, he's a different animal" on the field, what was Pochettino like when he didn't have his cleats on? "Honestly, a different guy," the former Mozambique international said. Iotov, who at one point was alone at Espanyol when his family was back home, remembers Pochettino inviting him to dinners with his own family. During those dinners and team meals, he didn't seem to mind that Iotov's Spanish was very limited, and used those moments to coach players outside of the confines of a training ground as well.

"Tenedor," began one informal Spanish lesson after Pochettino held up a fork when sitting next to Iotov. Another Spanish lesson also displayed Pochettino's sense of humor. During a bus ride, the defender was walking past Vignal and noticed that the French-born player on loan from Liverpool was practicing his Spanish. "He taught me one or two bad words to make sure I understand properly the language," Vignal joked. The current USMNT coach later played a prank that Vignal remembers to this day. "It was a beautiful restaurant, but he never told me it was really, really expensive," Vignal said with a big laugh. One review on TripAdvisor reads: "We knew it would be expensive, but didn't think it would be that expensive." Vignal had a nice meal, but when receiving the bill: "Wow!" At training the next day, Pochettino approached him with a smile and asked him if he enjoyed the experience. "Yeah, I also enjoyed the bill," Vignal said. Despite displaying the characteristics of a successful coach in his playing days, another theme that emerged from the conversations with his teammates was their surprise that Pochettino became a manager. If he had goals of being a coach one day, there was no indication that it was something he openly talked about. "You never know and he never said anything about it," said García when asked if he could tell that the Espanyol captain would one day lead on the sidelines. "But he is having a very good coaching career." "[He had] the characteristics [of a coach], of course, but sometimes you never expect this type of player or ex-player to become a coach or manager ... but he had the profile," the former France youth international said. With PSG, Pochettino lifted a Ligue 1 title and Coupe de France, while finishing as a semifinalist in the UEFA Champions League. With Tottenham, he helped the team qualify for a Champions League final for the first and only time in club history. "I'm very happy for his career and very happy for what he's achieved now," said Sá, who hopes to one day work with Pochettino again, but as a coach. What could be easy is fully moving on past his days as "El Sheriff." The attention and fame he has gained as a manager exceeds what he did on the field, despite the fact that Pochettino represented Argentina through 20 caps and a 2002 World Cup appearance. At Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where the Premier League club was training, a group of guests watched the practice session from afar. Unknown to Pochettino, Iotov was among that group. yelled the director of the local United Futbol Academy, thinking there was no way Pochettino was going to recognize him years after last seeing each other and among a random collection of people watching the training. "People looked at me and said, 'Who the heck are you?'" Later in the locker room, along with members of his coaching staff, they caught up for about an hour and a half. "Oh, they can wait," Pochettino said to Iotov, talkative as ever, as if nothing had changed for the former stalwart Espanyol figure who's now commanding a different role.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USWNT head coach Emma Hayes says her side were "unrecognizable" in the 2-1 defeat to Portugal. Hayes already knew that some NWSL executives were suggesting she was telling USWNT players that they needed to play in Europe. Thompson's move, driven by Chelsea's aggressive pursuit of the winger, was a tipping point that gave the longstanding rumors new life and set in motion a certain degree of panic inside NWSL circles. So, Hayes took her own advice that she shared with media last year on her first official day on the job. Hayes stood in front of the boardroom of owners and NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman last month and, multiple sources told ESPN, asked them a simple question: Women's soccer players have fought their entire lives for freedom of choice. As Hayes said: Players are free to sign contracts wherever they want. Ten years ago, that wouldn't have really been true for a player that aspired to be a USWNT regular. But it's truer than ever thanks to the adoption of full free agency in the NWSL's new collective bargaining agreement that was signed last year. In conjunction with the elimination of U.S. Soccer-backed contracts for national team players to play in the NWSL, USWNT players can now play wherever they want -- both domestically and abroad. Hayes touted this freedom of choice publicly last week, about a month after her private message to the NWSL's board, saying that she tries "to meet the players where they're at in their lives" when they approach her about their club futures. Emily Keogh talks about USWNT forward Alyssa Thompson's potential move to Chelsea from Angel City. Chelsea expressed a desire to sign Thompson, and the 20-year-old expressed that she wanted to challenge herself with what she called "her dream team" in her first interview with the club. Hayes simply wanted to make sure Thompson understood the realities and challenges, including moving away from her sister, Gisele, who had been her teammate for club and country. The biggest changes in recent years for Americans deciding where to play? First: The willingness of top clubs, European and NWSL alike, to spend more. Second: U.S. Soccer's decision to remove itself from the NWSL's business, literally. Until 2022, USWNT players signed contracts with U.S. Soccer even for their NWSL play. The previous setup was a way to keep USWNT players in the NWSL, a league founded and operated by U.S. Soccer until 2021. All 23 players on the 2015 and 2019 World Cup-winning sides were based domestically (Abby Wambach had no club team during the 2015 World Cup). Former USWNT forward Christen Press has spoken openly about how her initial stint abroad was cut short in 2014 because she was told by U.S. Soccer to come to the NWSL if she wanted to be on the national team. USWNT midfielder Lindsey Heaps said again last week what was already known for years: "My initial decision when I was at PSG to come back to the U.S. [in 2016] was made because of a conversation with Jill [Ellis, former USWNT coach] and I. A young Heaps had wanted to make the 2016 Olympic roster. But the USWNT's new CBA, ratified in 2022, now pays players based solely on their call-ups to and appearances with the USWNT. The effect has been a more competitive USWNT pool that is free of contractual obligations, and a shift in the balance of power between U.S. Soccer and NWSL teams. As one NWSL general manager, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told ESPN, NWSL teams used to be at the mercy of the federation when it came to USWNT players because U.S. Soccer paid their salaries. The migration of top USWNT players to Europe is not a new phenomenon. (The NWSL's minimum salary when it launched in 2013 was $6,000.) Throughout the NWSL's history, a select few have made jaunts to Europe. Some, like Press, were driven there in search of an opportunity to kick start their international career. Others, like Rapinoe and Morgan, had the chance to leave their comfort zone while also being paid unprecedented wages as stars in their primes. More recently, Rose Lavelle and Sam Mewis moved to Manchester City after their breakout 2019 World Cups. And then there was the rarest path, that of an American teenager bypassing college soccer altogether and moving to Europe to chase the dream. Heaps blazed that trail from Colorado to Paris Saint-Germain as an 18-year-old in 2012. Historically, a flood of USWNT players going to Europe has been cyclical in nature. Girma and Thompson have done the same, although they signed long-term contracts to stay at Chelsea. Longer contract terms are a global trend in the women's game, which has led to transfer fees quadrupling to over $12 million globally in just two years. Ideally, Hayes and Heaps said, players don't change clubs in a World Cup year so that they have a consistent environment, but even that is not a rule set in stone. "There's just so much that goes into it," Heaps told reporters last week. Fast forward to today, the high-paying, record-breaking transfer opportunities at major European clubs are still only for the top 1% of players. Multiple NWSL general managers told ESPN recently that the competition for top players in the world, including Americans, is still only with a handful of European teams. One GM framed the exclusive group of competitors willing to spend big as restricted to the UEFA Champions League quarterfinalists. That pool of European teams competing in this financial arms race hasn't changed drastically over the past decade: eight-time European champions OL Lyonnes and Chelsea lead the way, alongside a few others. Yohannes moved to OL Lyonnes in the summer after her breakout year at Dutch club Ajax. "Lyon is such a big club and a club that I've grown up watching and looked up to," Yohannes said last week ahead of the USWNT's game in Chester, Pennsylvania. It's such an amazing club with so many world-class players. That's sort of what went into it [the decision] among other aspects and factors." NWSL teams don't currently play in any competition that matches the stature of the UEFA Champions League -- Concacaf's equivalent competition is only in its second season. There are also myriad factors in players' personal decisions, including the desire to experience a different culture abroad. USWNT defender Emily Fox left the NWSL for Arsenal in early 2024 to experience the different culture and big stadiums in London. However, not every move abroad leads to glory. Jenna Nighswonger left NJ/NY Gotham FC for Arsenal after winning an Olympic gold medal last year and has struggled to earn first-team minutes. USWNT veteran Crystal Dunn hasn't been able to break into Paris Saint-Germain's preferred starting 11 either. Players' individual preferences and dreams can neither be changed nor controlled. Paris or London will always be, well, Paris or London (among other destinations): appealing lifestyles abroad on top of great professional opportunities. Heaps, while acknowledging the unique situation of each player, also concedes that she thinks every player should experience different cultures in their career.

One NWSL general manager, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told ESPN that they are "worried more dominoes will fall" in the upcoming transfer window. There is widespread worry among league executives that the salary cap will not proportionately increase with the global market to keep NWSL teams competitive. Allocation money, which previously allowed clubs to spend outside the cap, is being phased out. Berman, asked by ESPN in a media roundtable after September's board meeting concluded, said NWSL clubs can still be the best in the world within a salary-cap structure. The rapidly evolving global economy continues to challenge that notion. The world record for a transfer fee roughly doubled in about 18 months, and experts ranging from team executives to agents don't expect the pace of growth in spending to stop anytime soon. That, however, is the NWSL's problem to solve. What Hayes and her ever-deepening pool of players need are clubs that will push them to be their best individually -- wherever that might be. "The amazing thing about the women's game and where it is, is that there are opportunities for players," Hayes said. And yes, ideally that could be in the NWSL, but it's not my choice." Each player has her own choice to make, and there are more realistic options than ever.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid and Vinicius Junior have had a rocky relationship over the past year, but rather than calming after the arrival of Xabi Alonso, has only grown in significance. The Brazilian is no longer guaranteed to start every game he is fit for, and no longer used for 90 minutes, with just three of his appearances seeing him last the whole match. That tension generated between Vinicius and Alonso came to a head on Sunday as Vinicius reacted to coming off, the latest sign that the two are not getting on as Real Madrid might hope. Vinicius is reportedly considering leaving Real Madrid if Alonso stays, and was open to doing so in the last week of the transfer window. While it was no secret that Alonso was intending on dropping Vinicius before their semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain before Trent Alexander-Arnold got injured. Cadena SER add that the drama was significant after Vinicius went worked out that he was not starting, and reacted badly to Alonso. Since, Vinicius has shown signs of disrespect, questioned his authority, and public frustration during previous substitutions too. Since missing out on the Ballon d'Or, Vinicius has struggled to hit the same heights, and was just showing signs of doing so. However Sport explain that there has been some discontent from the Real Madrid hierarchy at Vinicius' decline in importance, and the amount of time he has spent on the bench. Vinicius' camp has communicated their own frustrations to the club, and both these concerns have been passed on to Alonso too. Real Madrid have left Alonso to deal with the matter, but fundamentally, the pair will need to put aside their disagreements in order to make the coming months more fruitful for both. One of the questions marks over Alonso before taking the job was how he would handle a dressing room of egos, and President Perez will be keeping a close eye on how he overcomes this challenge.</p>

If I told you there were 46 nations and four separate group stages to allocate slots at the finals — and that an additional round sends one more country to the last-chance saloon of the intercontinental play-offs — I'm assuming you'd lose the will to live. In the face of a qualifying path so complicated, it would be impressive if controversy didn't flare up somewhere down the line. The complaints surround Saudi Arabia and Qatar, both of whom have secured their spot at next summer's tournament. They will be in the United States, Canada and Mexico — stick with me here — by virtue of topping their groups in round four, and they're the latest of eight qualifiers from the AFC zone, following Japan, Iran, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan and Australia. In theory, the round-four fixtures should have been held at neutral venues. Iraq were pipped by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates lost out to Qatar. Footage of the trouble spread across social media. It's well known that Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as examples of football's changing geopolitical order, are close to the centre of World Cup affairs. Qatar hosted the tournament in 2022 amid criticism of its human rights record. Saudi Arabia will stage it in 2034 after succeeding with an unopposed bid to FIFA. It also faces scrutiny on human rights grounds. Unsurprisingly, Iraq and the UAE, believing the fourth qualification round was weighted against them, are questioning why home advantage existed. As UAE coach Cosmin Olaroiu pointed out, an easy solution would have been for the group involving the Saudis to be based in Al Alrayan, and the group containing Qatar to play their games in Jeddah. “All teams should have an equal chance,” he said. “This is not fair play,” Oman's Carlos Queiroz complained. That's fair to point out, but the opaque logistics have left a bad taste. Because truly, this road to 2026 never ends. A potentially significant scandal is brewing in Turkey, where conspiracy theories stalk referees. The distrust of them won't be helped by dramatic revelations about betting practices there. It revealed that of the 571 who are currently active, 371 have betting accounts. One of them, incredibly, has placed more than 18,000 bets in the five years since 2020. Those being investigated include seven referees and 15 assistants who work in Turkey's Super Lig, its top division. The competition is continuing, but there are calls for it to be suspended. Alongside TFF's investigation, prosecutors are probing the matter, too. No names have been given, and it isn't clear if any of the officials involved gambled on games they participated in, but we'll stay tuned to developments. The implications of this story could be seismic. They are five points clear of arch-rivals Barcelona at the top of La Liga and they're quietly chipping away in Europe. Coach Xabi Alonso has made a good fist of taming the beast. So it surprised me to read Mario Cortegana's report of a rift developing between Alonso and senior members of his dressing room. Sure, we saw Vinicius Junior's tantrum after he was substituted in Sunday's Clasico win against Barca, but I assumed the squad would be warming to a head coach who is making them tick. Ancelotti is a people person who accommodates the whims of his pros, sometimes altering tactics depending on their wishes. Life is more disciplined and he's said to be stricter. Player entourages are no longer as free to knock around Madrid's training ground. One source put it like this to Mario: “He thinks he's Pep Guardiola, but for now, he's just Xabi.” And of course, Alonso has plenty to prove, but under Ancelotti last season, Madrid limped behind Barca in La Liga. They were pulverised by Arsenal in the Champions League. It wasn't happening, and if I were a fan at the Bernabeu, Alonso's internal battle is one I'd want him to win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The historic, standard-setting venue at Berkley Riverfront Park opened its doors in 2024. While it may be a new location for the National Team, players Claire Hutton, Michelle Cooper, Lo'eau LaBonta and Ally Sentnor know very well the site of Wednesday's friendly against New Zealand is a special place. “It feels very much like home,” Sentnor said. These four players are part of a Kansas City Current roster that made history this season. These four players have brought a high standard to the international level and played important roles for the U.S. Women's National Team in this October FIFA window. “The development and grounding, both in playing youth national team tournaments... plus NWSL, starting for her team... is really giving her the foundation to be able to perform at our level, maybe at a slightly earlier age,” Hayes said. Sentnor, who recorded an assist in the 3-1 win over Portugal, arrived to the Kansas City Current via a blockbuster trade on Aug. 1. “When you come into a top environment, you might not get everything all at once, but if there's one player who I know that is determined, no matter the obstacle, no matter the realities of a situation, that will make things happen, it's absolutely Ally Sentnor,” Hayes said. Hayes called Cooper “a firecracker” with the kind of dynamic personality that every team needs. Cooper showed her grit in the opening match of this window on Oct. 23, earning a spot in the starting XI and battling against a tough, physical Portuguese side. LaBonta was a late addition to Hayes' October roster, replacing the spot initially filled by Seattle Reign midfielder Sam Meza. LaBonta is the oldest player in camp, someone who Hayes describes as “a constant” in terms of her performance and delivery. When the group arrived in Kansas City, Labonta welcomed her USWNT teammates to the city by introducing them to her dog, Amigo. “He's definitely brought some smiles to camp,” LaBonta said. “I think it's going to be loud,” Hutton said. “The stadium is going to be packed, loud and energized. These four aren't the only ones who know how loud Kansas City fans can get. “It's definitely a tough stadium to be an away team in because the crowd really shows up, and it's a great atmosphere. Kansas City is a massive sports town, and its soccer roots run deep. The city is also of course home to the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs, winners of back-to-back Super Bowls in 2023 and 2024. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes became the first active NFL player to have equity in an NWSL team when he became a new co-owner of the Current in 2013 along with his wife, Brittany. “What an incredible family,” Hayes said of the Longs. “What they are doing for women's sport and women's soccer in particular in this country, they're leading the way with some other clubs.” Hayes, her son Harry and four of her USWNT players had a chance to root for Mahomes during the Kansas City Chiefs' 28-7 win at Arrowhead Stadium against the Washington Commanders on Monday Night Football. Hayes had a rocking time and expects to have another one on Wednesday night when Kansas City officially welcomes the USWNT for the first time at CPKC Stadium.</p>
