                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Man given restraining order in Dubai on ticket waiting list Emma Raducanu's stalker has been blocked from buying tickets for this month's Wimbledon Championships in the public ballot, it has emerged. The 22-year-old had also been aware of his presence at tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha in preceding weeks. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. Raducanu, who shot to global fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021, said that her behaviour had changed since the incident in Dubai. “I try not to be careless about it because you only realise how much of a problem it is when you're in that situation and I don't necessarily want to be in that situation again.” Raducanu has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home. On Tuesday, Britain's No 2, Katie Boulter, said that she had received abuse and death threats on social media and had been followed around London by an unknown vehicle. Sally Bolton, chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, said that security measures would be tight at Wimbledon this year. Wimbledon will also have police and military personnel in the grounds, as well a team of fixated threat specialists</p>

In preparation for August's main event, the US Open has paired one man and one woman per team, promising thrilling mixed doubles action with a grand prize of $1 million for the victors. Alcaraz is set to partner with Emma Raducanu, a player eager to make a strong comeback in the upcoming tournaments. “She's going to be the boss,” Alcaraz said with a smile. Alcaraz expressed his excitement about competing in the tournament alongside Raducanu, even making a surprising request to the US Open organizers. During his discussion, he highlighted Raducanu's impressive form on the WTA circuit. Jannik Sinner makes big confession about his Roland Garros final loss to Carlos Alcaraz “I've known Emma for a long time; we have a really good relationship,” Alcaraz remarked after his first victory at the Queen's tournament. Alcaraz continued, “The organizers mentioned the mixed doubles, and I thought I couldn't have a better partner than Emma. So, I asked her if she wanted to play doubles with me. Of course, she had to think and ask around a bit, but it didn't take a minute,” he explained about Raducanu's response to his offer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British number one Raducanu was left in tears after seeing a man who had followed her to four successive tournaments in the stands during a match at the Dubai Tennis Championships in February. He gave her a letter and took her photo, which unnerved Raducanu, who had been aware of his presence at tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha in preceding weeks. "I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. Raducanu shot to worldwide fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021. She told BBC Sport soon after the incident in Dubai that it "could have been dealt with better" but that lessons have been learned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper began his pursuit of grass-court glory with a dominant victory over Jensen Brooksby, claiming 10 of the last 11 games in a performance that had the Queen's faithful gasping at his best shots. This is Draper's first summer as the undisputed main man of British tennis, following Andy Murray's retirement last year, but he showed little sign of feeling burdened by expectation. Well, actually, Draper might have been a little tight early on. In the opening game or three, he responded slowly to Brooksby's 110mph first serves – which are milk floats by the super-powered standards of the modern tour – and snatched at forehands too early in rallies. But as soon as Draper became used to Brooksby's conservative positional tennis, and realised that there were no big surprises here to ambush him, he relaxed and began to show his class. Winner after winner zipped off the baseline and slammed into the backboard as Draper dashed to a 6-3, 6-1 victory in only 77 minutes. Like anyone would do, I feel that a little bit. But I also take it in my stride. “Since I was a young guy, I have always wanted to be at the top of the game, and I knew eventually that [expectation] would come with it. If Draper remains a well-kept secret within British sport, despite his recent ascent to the heady heights of No 6 in the world rankings, that is probably because he has never made a deep run at Wimbledon. Drawn against defending champion Novak Djokovic on his SW19 debut in 2021, Draper lost to Alex de Minaur in the second round a year later, then missed 2023 entirely with a nasty shoulder injury. He should have done better than another second-round exit last summer, but then came up against a regular practice partner in Cameron Norrie – a fellow British left-hander who knew his game inside out. Despite this indifferent Wimbledon record of two wins from five outings to date, Draper has improved so much in the past year that the bookies are listing him as fourth favourite to lift this summer's title. Only the new Big Two of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, plus seven-time champion Novak Djokovic, stand ahead of him on the list. Tuesday delivered the ideal start to Draper's campaign. Beneath a burning sun and a full set of stands, the support may have been warm rather than vociferous. But then Queen's is an old-fashioned venue with a famously polite crowd. The well-heeled denizens of Baron's Court, west London, tend to murmur rather than scream. Jack Draper is through to the last 16 of Queen's with ease 💪 pic.twitter.com/Hv9OXnIkEr Brooksby – a 24-year-old from California – made for an unconventional opponent. Off the court, Brooksby has a fascinating story. Diagnosed with severe autism as a small child, he was non-verbal until the age of four. But an intensive programme of therapy helped him develop coping skills, and the woman who oversaw that programme – Michelle Wagner – recently said that he had shifted to the “mild end of the spectrum”, calling this an “unusual and unique outcome”. Draper will be back on the Andy Murray Arena on Wednesday, facing an opponent who could not be more different to the understated Brooksby. Alexei Popyrin, a rangy and raw-boned Australian, won last year's Canadian Open in Montreal with his dynamic, first-strike game. His serve has been clocked at over 150mph, which puts him in the outside lane of the tennis autobahn. Here is a high early hurdle for Draper, but he might as well get used to it, because this Queen's field is stacked with quality. He needs to reach at least the semi-finals to give himself a shot at a top-four seeding for Wimbledon, and thus protect himself from a possible quarter-final showdown with one of Alcaraz or Sinner. Asked whether he had consulted former British flag-bearers such as Murray or Tim Henman, Draper said that – to date – he had not felt the need. “They've done an incredible job over the years of being the leading British player [but] everyone deals with things a bit differently. Carlos Alcaraz ensured that, however, he spent the days after his Roland Garros epic against Jannik Sinner, there would be no upset at the start of the grass court season, with a straight sets win over lucky loser Adam Walton. Having reacted to winning in Paris with an annual tradition excursion to Ibiza, Alcaraz was not faultless against Australian Walton ranked 86th in the world, despite winning 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). Almost exactly a year ago, Alcaraz arrived at Queen's tired from his break in Ibiza, and his Queen's title defence did not go as planned when he was beaten in under 100 minutes by Jack Draper. Against Walton, understandably, the tennis was not as smooth as it might have been two weeks ago, and there were a number of baseline exchanges that could have been won earlier. After four exchanges of serve in the opener, Alcaraz broke. It might have been later than he should have; he had come to the net earlier in the game and missed what could have been a decisive drop shot. In the second set, Walton's serves might have lacked power but the 110-115mph efforts were well-placed and often wide which left Alcaraz reaching. 1 Alcaraz, saving both with an ace and another strong serve. For Alcaraz, it is very much: first hurdle of the grass court season down, many more to come as he targets a Wimbledon title defence. He has played a few matches already on grass so I think he's more experienced this year on grass. Walton second serve but Alcaraz nets a forehand return, 4-4. Cat and mouse rally, Walton doesn't do enough with his volley and Alcaraz punishes him with a volley down the line, 5-4. First serve into the body unreturned by Walton, 2-1. Facing those two set points seems to have sparked Alcaraz into life. On his next service game, he plays two exquisite drop shots including a feint, that Walton can only watch. Into a tie-break we go as Alcaraz holds with an exquisite half volley winner. Problems for Walton after his backhand sits up nicely for Alcaraz to drill a backhand winner down the line, 15-30. Much needed first serve for Walton is unreturned, 30-30. Frustration for Alcaraz as he makes a surprising error on his backhand, pushing the ball long, 40-30. Alcaraz goes to his tried and trusty wide first serve, which is unreturned. Second break point... First serve in from Alcaraz and Walton's return is long. Almost felt like Alcaraz wanted to feel a little danger. You would expect the pressure to hit Walton but not yet. Alcaraz will serve to stay in the set next. So reminiscent of Rafael Nadal when Alcaraz skips to his left to run around his backhand and whip a forehand down the line. And he finishes the love game with a deft drop volley winner. He's having fun out there in the sun. Another backhand into the net by Alcaraz and Walton holds. Alcaraz holds again as we enter the business end of the set and you can be sure he will want to get a break soon. Walton is clearly favouring his forehand side, which in turn is leaving him exposed by just how far he has run around the ball to take it on the forehand. Lovely hands by Walton in the forecourt to react to Alcaraz's backhand down the line with an angled half volley winner. Not an easy finish, but he finished that like prime Pat Cash. Serve continues to be king in this set as Alcaraz holds to love with a trademark forehand winner down the line. Both players using the serve out wide very effectively to earn cheap points. Can he make any inroads on Alcaraz's serve in this match? Very unlikely he will win this match but the level he is showing is far above his current ranking and his game looks well suited to grass. Alcaraz shakes off the rustiness to bring up two set points at 40-15. And he sees out the set with a second serve ace. In typical British fashion, there is a strong contingent of support for Walton, the Australian underdog in his first-ever match against Alcaraz. Alcaraz, on the other han,d has allowed him back into games that he should have wrapped up two or three points earlier. Three first serves in a row rescue the Australian and move him to 40-30. Gorgeous footwork by Alcaraz to run around a Walton slice and blast a forehand winner down the line, deuce. Gasps from the crowd as he hit that. Deep Alcaraz return and Walton's reply is into the net, set point. Wild forehand by Alcaraz after an extended rally, back to deuce. Blocked return down the line and into the net for a volley winner by Alcaraz, second set point. Alcaraz's class is beginning to tell but Walton shows him that he's not going away with a forehand return winner, 30-15. Efficient service hold for Alcaraz completed when a swinging first serve is unreturned. Refreshment break between the matches is well and truly over and the stands of the Andy Murray Arena are almost as full as they were for home favourite Jack Draper around 40 minutes previously. Alcaraz has been in decent touch so far in these almost Spanish-like conditions that earlier caused one spectator to faint, leading to a brief pause in Draper's match. Nice play by Walton to send Alcaraz the wrong way with a cross court flick, 30-15. He then whips a forehand into the corner that Alcaraz gives up running for, 40-15. Relief for Walton as Alcaraz's return drifts long. Not enough first serves for Walton to give him cheap points and the pressure finally tells when he nets a backhand. Alcaraz is looking equally comfortable on serve so far amd he holds to love with a vintage forehand winner down the line. The new doubles team – which can expect to be given a portmanteau nickname of either “Alcaranu” or “Raducaraz” – is one of several eye-catching partnerships that will make their debut in New York in August. Walton is doing everything right at the moment. He is keeping Alcaraz on the move, pushing him left and right and making enough first serves to avoid pressure. Walton won't have faced a player of his calibre before but she's standing his ground so far and making things awkward for Alcaraz. Impressive athleticism by Alcaraz to stretch and hit a backhand overhead smash. Walton gets to the ball and his flick into play drifts wide. It will be interesting to see how Alcaraz adapts, in what is his first match since that epic victory at the French Open, earlier this month. The Spaniard partied in Ibiza last week so hopefully he's recovered and can put on a show. ... is top seed and world No 2 Carlos Alcaraz where he meet Australia's Adam Walton. We travel the world playing tennis, never get to come home or spend much time with my family but to be on this court in front of you guys, my people, my family, thank you. It's tricky coming onto the grass after clay, to adapt, I'm hitting the ball a bit late not on time. So proud, obviously coming back here a year later is a testament to the hard work from me and my team and all the people who have supported me to be a better player and person. Sealed with an ACE ☄️@jackdraper0 storms through at the #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/AQF6LZhRrk Draper can just explode on his shots when Brooksby pushes him out wide as he does when he moves out to his forehand and powers a forehand cross court that is too hot for his opponent, 30-15. First serve unreturned brings up a match point. Ace down the T and it's GAME SET MATCH DRAPER!! Brooksby is caught out by a deep Draper return and flicks his backhand wide to give the Briton a break point. Draper's weight of shot proves too much for Brooksby again, who nets a forehand. Draper breaks and will serve for the match. Ever since Draper's opening service games, Brooksby has had little joy and his screams out in anger after another first serve from the Briton is too much for him. After an eight minute stoppage, play resumes with Brooksby leading 30-0 but Draper gets on the board with a crushing backhand winner down the line. Draper continues to be all over the Brooksby second serve and he fires a forehand return winner down the line. Gutsy play by Brooksby as he sneaks into the net and hits a cute a volley that Draper reaches but can't get over the net. Big first serve by Brooksby and Draper's return drifts wide, allowing him to hold. The players are advised to take a seat which they do while treatment is administered. Wide ace from Draper and he holds again. Brooksby sees his forehand clip the net cord and fly wide and that gives Draper a break point. Draper gets a look at a second serve and his return is deep and puts Brooksby in trouble. Six games in a row for Draper. Draper's maintain his momentum with another routine hold. With his serve clicking the way it is, Brooksby's hopes today look very slim. Fortunately, he was able to fall back on his lethal leftie serve. During that set, he won 14 out of 15 points behind his first delivery. He missed – but the very fact that he had the confidence to try it suggested a positive mental state. Draper is taking the ball early and putting pressure on Brooksby's serve which has gone AWOL. Brooksby forehand long and Draper earns his first set point. Brooksby serve and volleys, then hits an overhead which Draper chases out to reach but can't get the ball into play, deuce. Another chance for Draper to close out the set when Brooksby nets a forehand. Draper's first serve followed by his forehand is an unstoppable combo. There's an aura about him out on the court. Brooksby handles what looked like an awkward volley very well and the ball spins away from Draper's reach. Brooksby has missed three first serves in a row but Draper isn't doing enough to apply pressure on the second, the slowest being 69mph. Brooksby sees off the danger with a wide ace. Another chance to break comes Draper's way and this time he gets it when Brooksby dumps a backhand into the net. Draper's serve is starting to fire up and Brooksby's frustration builds after a couple of missed returns. A fifth ace of the match for Draper and he holds again. He's just pushing it at the moment when a little more patience is required. Brooksby comes through another service game untroubled. After two months grinding on the clay and needing to hit extra balls to finish points, Draper will be pleased to be on the grass again and see his shots fly away from opponents. His power is one of the big reasons why he is a major contender for Wimbledon and he holds here to 15 comfortably. First double fault for Draper takes the game to deuce. But he holds with another powerful forehand down the line. The American has the honour of serving first and we get a glimpse of his very unique service motion. But it is clearly working for him as he holds to 15. It's not Wimbledon so players can play in whatever colour they want and Draper comes out in a red and burgundy number. The warm up has started and play should start very soon. Hello and welcome to coverage from Queen's Club as Jack Draper gets his campaign under way. “I look back on my clay court season as a whole and as someone who hasn't done that well on the clay I thought I embraced the surface very well and I improved a lot on it,” Draper reflected in his press conference ahead of the HSBC Championships. “I take it in my stride and obviously feel good coming into these next few tournaments.” With Wimbledon less than two weeks away, Draper will want to have a strong week in west Kensington to boost his preparation. “I think there's no secret I'd love to do amazingly well this week but Wimbledon would be a priority for me. I think it's always an interesting one, that first match or tournament on the grass, there's a lot of players who maybe aren't amazingly prepared. “We've just come from a surface where we're grinding out points, having to win the point seven times on the trot to get one point. So, coming onto a fast surface, the margins are small but I'm feeling good and I'm ready to compete as hard as possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Fritz has made a fantastic start to his grass court season, having just won the Boss Open in Stuttgart. World number four Fritz has now won four grass court titles on the ATP Tour, with his current focus now turning to Queen's. Fritz says he thinks really well on court, with that skill having clearly helped him enjoy a successful run in Stuttgart. It is, however, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz who have dominated the ATP Tour in terms of Grand Slams once again this year. Speaking of the duo, Fritz told Tennis Channel: “They're showing time and time again that they're just a level above right now, and everyone else is going to have to catch up. READ MORE: John Isner now ranks where Carlos Alcaraz's win over Jannik Sinner sits in the best matches ever, ‘I'm changing my tune' “On a slow surface like Roland Garros with the slow ball, I think in those conditions, it really does look like a level up across the board. The Spaniard will also enter Wimbledon as a two-time defending champion, while Sinner will look to defend his US Open crown later this year. It was at Flushing Meadows in 2024 where Fritz enjoyed his best-ever Grand Slam finish, having lost the US Open final to Sinner. But hard court tennis will be at the very back of his mind right now, with a firm focus on grass needed for the coming weeks. And it is a surface which Fritz has thrived on throughout his career, having won four of his nine ATP titles on grass.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tennis calendar is so unforgiving that it almost forces players and fans to move on from what might have been the most exciting or crushing matches of their lives. This month's French Open final marks the perfect example. The tennis world and beyond stopped to watch in awe history unfolding before their very eyes. And yet, less than two weeks on, the grass-court season is in full swing, with clay a thing of the past. Some, like Darren Cahill and his team, might find it harder than others to move on. Speaking about these two superstars, destined to dominate for the next decade and beyond, the Aussie claimed: 'And with that, they have great self-awareness. ‘So what you see from the outside, you know, we were so damn proud of him, regardless of whether he won or lost that match. Obviously, we wanted him to win that match, we were heartbroken not to win it, but you send a player on the court, the one thing you ask for is for that player to give them everything you have. ‘So, when you look at a tennis match, the way it was played, how good it was, how well those two guys competed, no toilet breaks, no physios, no trainers, no complaining, just pure five and a half hours of brilliant tennis, business-like tennis, great respect between the two players. You can't ask for anything more as a coach. ‘So, regardless of the result, I take my hat off to Carlos. He's an amazing young man, we have an incredible respect for him, but believe it or not, I've been with Jannik for over three years now. I have more respect for him now watching after that match in the Roland Garros final than I had before that, and that's hard to say because I know him pretty damn well. Carlos Alcaraz revealed what so many people have told him about the French Open final, which should offer some solace to Sinner. Sinner has already proven his unflinching mentality throughout a sparkling short career thus far, and whilst this will surely be the most crushing defeat yet, there's no doubt that he'll bounce back from this too. The world will be watching Sinner's response with eagerness, first at Halle this week, and then at Wimbledon later this month.</p>

Sabalenka lost to Gauff in three sets at Roland-Garros, with the American coming back from a set down to win her first French Open title.

Speaking with reporters after the loss, the 27-year-old said the match was "the worst final I've ever played".

"I don't think she won the match because she played incredibly well, but because I made all those mistakes."

In an interview with Eurosport broadcast on Tuesday ahead of this week's WTA tournament in Berlin, the Belarusian said the comments were "simply completely unprofessional of me".

"I let my emotions guide me. I absolutely regret what I said back then," she added.

Sabalenka is the number one seed in the German capital and could face second seed Gauff again in the final.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka has apologised to Coco Gauff for her comments after losing the French Open final to the American. Sabalenka had suggested in her post-match comments that Gauff's victory was more due her own errors than the latter's performance. “That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka said. “I let my emotions get the better of me. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward — not immediately, but recently.” The Belarusian World No.1's comments at the time were rooted in some reality, she hit 37 winners but finished the final with a whopping 70 unforced errors — compared to Gauff's 30, her comments were largely seen as a way of putting down her opponent's achievement. This was 21-year-old Gauff's second Grand Slam win, having earlier beaten Sabalenka in the 2023 US Open final. “I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. Why did I lose so many finals?” Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff in the 2023 U.S. Open final, where she also won the first set. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.” This was World No.1 Sabalenka's first French Open final and she was gunning for a fourth Grand Slam singles title, having the won successive Australian Open titles in 2023 and 2024 and the 2024 US Open. Additionally, Sabalenka has also won the doubles title at the 2019 Australian Open and 2021 US Open partnering Elise Mertens.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patrick Mouratoglou has revealed the biggest factor in Carlos Alcaraz's win in their epic French Open final was their forehands, backhands or serves. Now Mouratoglou, who is the current coach of Naomi Osaka and former coach of Serena Williams, has given his verdict on the Paris epic, as he gave his views on a detailed LinkedIn post. “Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner played the highest level of tennis you can expect from two players today. Ranking points being defended by Alcaraz, Draper, Fritz, Rune at Queen's Chris Evert compares Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner rivalry to one of her own “It took me some time to reflect on this final. “Now, eight days later, one thing still stands out to me: the mental aspect of this final.” Mouratoglou recently released a book looking at the mental side of tennis and sport in general and he suggested the final set was a triumph for both players, even though Alacarz eventually came out on top. Sinner could have crumbled after he lost three match points at 5-3 in the fourth set, but he responded impressively and was close to victory again in the final game before the deciding tie-break. “Every time one of them was close to losing, they found another gear. “At two sets to one, Sinner was leading 5-3, 0-40. He didn't convert, got broken, and lost the set. “As for Alcaraz, he knew exactly when it mattered most. And how much of it is played in the mind.” The two top players in men's tennis are back in action this week as they start their grass court campaigns ahead of Wimbledon, with Alcaraz admitting he has looked back on clips of his Roland Garros win against Sinner after he took a break from the game following his Paris heroics. “To put it into words is really difficult honestly. To come from two sets down against the world No. 1, the level that he was playing, it is unbelievable. “It was the first time that I have come back from 2-0 down and honestly I just put my heart into it. I just tried to keep it going, not thinking about the result. I think that level of final is pretty high, I am just really happy to put my name in one of the best finals.” READ NEXT: Dan Evans hits out at top stars after Alcaraz, Swiatek & Zverev complaints on major talking point Alcaraz and Raducanu will pair up as the two look to a win Grand Slam title together at the US Open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World number one Aryna Sabalenka has again apologised for controversial remarks after losing the recent French Open final against Coco Gauff, naming her behaviour "completely unprofessional." Gauff won the June 7 final at Roland Garros in three sets, and Sabalenka told reporters post-match that Gauff didn't win because she had played well but rather because of her own mistakes. Sabalenka apologised for the statements the next day, and now told Eurosport Germany at this week's Berlin Open that she "absolutely regrets" them, and has written to Gauff to apologise. "That was just completely unprofessional of me. I let my emotions get the better of me," she said. You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. "I think we all have those days when we lose control. I get a lot more hate for what I did than other people." Sabalenka and Gauff are both playing in Berlin and could meet in the final of the tune-up event for Wimbledon which starts on June 30.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wimbledon has been renowned for its class, history and prestige in tennis ever since it was established in 1877. Traditions have been a mainstay at the All England Club in SW19, with strawberries and cream one of the delights amongst fans. Pimm's is also a popular beverage for spectators, some of whom are famous faces that take their seats in the prestigious Royal Box. But there's one piece of Wimbledon heritage that's strictly preserved by tournament officials - the official competitor dress code. Whilst dark green and purple are the official championship colours, players have long been required to wear all-white outfits. This was changed 32 years later to 'almost entirely white', and covers both practice and official matches throughout the tournament. Anna Kournikova became familiar with this in 2002 when she fell foul of the Wimbledon regulations. In order to comply with the dress code, she borrowed a pair from her coach, the late and legendary Nick Bollettieri. Kournikova wore an all-white outfit for her first round match against compatriot Tatiana Panova, who won 6-1 4-6 6-4. Andre Agassi, who won the men's singles title in 1992, wrote about his dislike of the rules in his autobiography Open. I don't want to wear white. "Why should it matter to these people what I wear? Agassi even decided not to play at Wimbledon from 1988 until 1990 due to the tradition, although he did return the year before his win. More recently, Ons Jabeur seemed to forget the rules in 2023 ahead of her women's singles final clash against Marketa Vondrousova. Once she had changed into the requested white, she made her way back onto the court and then fell to a 6-4 6-4 defeat. Although colourless clothes are mandatory, Wimbledon introduced a key change two years ago for the female players. They are now able to wear mid or dark-coloured undershorts as long as they are not longer than their skirts or shorts. Coco Gauff was one player who welcomed the change as she spoke on how she played at Wimbledon on her period in 2022. "I was on my period last year at Wimbledon and it was very stressful," she said to Sky News. "I think it's going to relieve a lot of stress for me and other girls in the locker room, for sure." *Exception provided for female players who are allowed to wear solid, mid/dark-coloured undershorts provided they are no longer than their shorts or skirt.
