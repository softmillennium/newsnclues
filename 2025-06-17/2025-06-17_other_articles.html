                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US military personnel captured an eerie flying saucer UFO in incredible new footage that has just been leaked to the public. Investigative journalists Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp say the video was recorded by government personnel over the Afghan-Pakistan border in November 2020. They released it to the public on Tuesday. It shows a massive disc weaving in and out of cloud cover. The Department of Defense labeled the disc a UAP - unidentified aerial phenomena - and it looks markedly different to other 'tic-tac'-shaped UFOs seen in recent military footage. The raw thermal imagery, along with two additional enhanced clips produced by the U.S. government, show the unidentified craft abruptly changing direction - all without any visible signs of propulsion. 'This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public,' Corbell exclusively told DailyMail.com. According to internal government slides Corbell and Knapp have seen, the UAP was described as 'navigating through clouds' and characterized as a 'disc'. The military's own internal enhancements - now made public - further underline the object's unusual heat signature, or lack thereof. 'You do not see plumes of heat coming off this disc-shaped object,' Corbell explained. 'This was captured on a thermal sensor - it should have detected heat if any traditional propulsion was present. In simple terms, that means it is unclear exactly how the disc is being powered. Terrestrial aircraft tend to use jet or propeller engines which can leave obvious trails across the sky. The footage was extensively studied within intelligence community investigations for years, known to those with high-level access but never intended for public release. Corbell and Knapp said they spent over two years validating the authenticity of the clips with multiple sources, including individuals who actively work in official U.S. government UFO programs. We know it's real,' Knapp confirmed during the latest episode of their podcast Weaponized. 'It was not supposed to be made public. The object is estimated to be between 200 and 400 meters in diameter, though Corbell admits its exact size is still being debated, with further analysis required to offer more accurate perspective on its size. The shape is undeniable,' Corbell said. You're seeing it dip into clouds, then emerge and reverse direction. Those coordinates point to the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan, an active conflict zone with strategic surveillance interest. 'This capture is worthy of serious discourse - not just in the UFO community, but in international and scientific conversations. Corbell and Knapp have not disclosed how they obtained the footage, only stating that it was 'leaked' and that they took extreme precautions to protect sources. Jeremy Corbell is an investigative filmmaker known for releasing some of the most compelling UAP footage ever made public, including the infamous 'Tic Tac' UFO videos and a series of military-captured encounters that have sparked global headlines. Corbell has also played a key role in amplifying whistleblower testimony - most notably from Matthew Brown, the former Pentagon insider who recently came forward with claims about secret UAP retrieval programs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sarah Jessica Parker, the Sex and the City star and Booker prize judge, has a nifty trick for getting out of taking selfies with her fans. “I did this for a really, really long time and it worked for ever,” Parker said in an interview with Howard Stern. It is not entirely clear why Parker – who has said she refuses to take selfies and would rather “have a conversation” instead because “it's much more meaningful” – stopped using this brilliant excuse. But one does have to wonder whether it is because the US has become a nation of conspiracy theorists. Rather than backing away from the weird “the government is watching” woman, perhaps fans started to excitedly engage her with theories about how Bill Gates has implanted us all with mind-controlling microchips. Or maybe she just got tired of the joke. But I'm sure someone out there (the government) does. Conspiracy theories have become so mainstream that they are even prompting nonsensical legislation. Some people believe that the government is spraying toxic metals to reduce populations; others believe they are evidence that dark forces are trying to control the weather or people's minds. Lawmakers in at least 11 other states are trying to advance similar “chemtrail” bans. “Every bill like this is kind of symbolic, or is introduced to appease a very vocal group, but it can still cause real harm by signalling that these conspiracies deserve this level of legal attention,” a member of the National Association for Media Literacy Education told the Associated Press. The vaccine sceptic recently fired every single member of a critical advisory committee on immunisation practices. He has replaced them with people who reportedly have very little vaccine expertise and are accused of spreading misinformation. RFK Jr is also fixated on conspiracy theories about fluoride, which he calls “a dangerous neurotoxin”. There are, to be clear, valid concerns about ingesting too much fluoride, including its effects on IQ as well as potential tooth discoloration. But experts are pretty unanimous that fluoride in drinking water is a great public health achievement that has done wonders for preventing tooth decay. Since acting like a conspiracy theorist no longer seems to ward off unwanted attention, why not try engaging selfie-seeking fans with a rational fact-based discussion? Increasingly large numbers of Americans seem allergic to that; some fans will immediately run a mile.</p>

By the time Supernatural wrapped its 15-season run, The CW series had amassed an impressive lineup of guest stars, leading to pretty great moments both life-changing and storyline-changing. Guest-starring on SPN often means having a scene or two with stars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, which was definintely a boon for the mother of guest actor Aimee Garcia, who recalled her mom fliring with Ackles with a hilarious story. Speaking with TV Insider, the actress recalled her parents visiting the set and nd her mom shamelessly flirting with Ackles. I had the best time with those guys. She's like, ‘Oh, Jensen, you are chewing gum before they start the scene. I [don't] see it while you shoot the scene.' I'm like, ‘Mom, you cannot flirt with Jensen!' I don't know which is better: The fact that Garcia's mother flirted with Ackles in the first place, or that she did it in full view of her husband and daughter. Not even moms are able to resist the Ackles charm, and it is pretty funny to learn how this went down. Luckily, the flirting didn't do any harm, and now Garcia has a funny story to tell for years to come. It just makes me wonder if Ackles remembers that, although there's a more-than-good chance that Garcia's mother was not the first or last parent to shamelessly flirt with him on set. Meanwhile, even after all these years, Jensen Ackles is still keeping people on their toes. With his upcoming Prime Video series Countdown coming out later this month, fans have been thirsting quite a lot over his new role. He will also be playing Soldier Boy in the new prequel series, Vought Rising. Since Season 3 of the CBS drama has been ordered, it's possible that Russell will return, assuming Ackles' busy schedule gives him time. Even though fans won't see Aimee Garcia's mom shamelessly flirting with Ackles, they can always watch her episode and all 15 seasons of Supernatural with a Netflix subscription.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Good Job is Slate's advice column on work. Send it to Laura Helmuth and Doree Shafrir here. The job itself is good and I enjoy my work, but I need some help dealing with a situation involving my co-worker and his “interesting” beliefs. “Carl” is a nice guy and a good colleague most of the time, but he has these very weird, honestly conspiracy-theory beliefs about soy products. He thinks they're some sort of subtle poison foisted on us by an international cabal whose members change daily. I've learned to redirect all conversations away from the stuff and never bring it up myself. But the problem is a second co-worker, “Rick.” He seems to enjoy riling Carl up, and will very conspicuously do things to set him off. And if they have breaks at the same time, Rick will go out of his way to ask Carl about soy. He even brought it up at a group chat once, and the boss had to mute Carl because he wouldn't stop ranting. And they're both guys (I'm a woman), so I feel a bit intimidated at trying to tell them to directly knock it off. But I don't think it's the sort of thing that HR or my boss would take seriously. What can I do here to keep my sanity? Carl and Rick both sound awful in their own ways. My advice is to keep your distance, ignore both of them to the extent that you can, and focus on you and your own work. If their interactions get to the point where you absolutely can't ignore them and they're interfering with your work, then I would ask your boss if they've noticed Rick and Carl's behavior, tell them that you're having a hard time ignoring it, and ask for their advice on how to deal with it. That way, you're not getting directly involved, but you're also letting your manager know that this behavior is bizarre and disruptive, and hopefully, they will be able to do something about it. Lastly, I'm not a mental health professional, but Carl's behavior does strike me as so far out of the norm as to be somewhat worrisome. If you notice that the conspiracy theories and ranting are spilling over into other areas, I think it's worth raising with your boss as well. And for the record, I think soy milk tastes gross. He is funny, smart, articulate, sensitive, talented, and seems to adore me.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A strange jellyfish-like phenomenon was spotted streaking across the California sky Monday night. While the unusual 'UFO' sighting baffled many locals from the Mojave desert to Los Angeles's South Bay, scientists say there were no extraterrestrials involved in creating the jellyfish - it was an Elon Musk rocket. SpaceX's latest Falcon 9 rocket mission lifted off at 11:36pm ET Monday night from Vandenberg Space Force Station in California. SpaceX's lead avionics systems engineer, Cameron Gable, captured the jellyfish phenomenon as the rocket traveled past Los Angeles County's South Bay. The Falcon 9 rocket's exhaust interacted with Earth's atmosphere, creating a visible cloud of condensed water vapor that became easier to see right after sunset SpaceX's lead avionics engineer posted on X, showing the jellyfish effect as it passed over Los Angeles's South Bay Monday's giant jellyfish display started just a few minutes into the flight and was visible to anyone in the Southern California area. In October 2022, sky watchers caught another Falcon 9 rocket creating the same vapor trail during a similar mission to deploy new satellites. Monday's Falcon 9 launch was the latest mission in SpaceX's ongoing efforts to expand its Starlink 'constellation,' aiming to enhance global internet coverage. SpaceX has already conducted 75 launches in 2025, mainly for Starlink missions. The mission also used a reusable first-stage engine, a hallmark of SpaceX's design philosophy aimed at reducing the cost of spaceflights. SpaceX captured the moment on their live broadcast when the reusable engine safely landed back on Earth to be used again in future missions. The SpaceX launch was part of the company's ongoing Starlink mission, which is deploying a network of new satellites that will boost global internet coverage The jellyfish effect is a common occurrence during space rocket launches and can normally be seen from states hundreds of miles from the actual launch site Social media users regularly capture rockets giving off the jellyfish trail from hundreds of miles away. That mission also involved a Falcon 9 launching from Vandenberg, which was over 500 miles away. These gases, primarily composed of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other rocket launch byproducts, expand rapidly as they exit the rocket's nozzle. As the exhaust plume expands, it encounters cooler, denser air in Earth's upper atmosphere. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, with their frequent launch schedule and reusable first stages, often trigger this effect due to their design and the typical launch times chosen for optimal visibility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Anderson County Jail served as the county's primary detention center for decades, holding prisoners accused of everything from petty theft to violent crimes. Its imposing brick structure and iron-barred windows were designed to keep criminals locked away, but many believe that some never truly left. Legends claim that inmates who met tragic ends, whether by execution, illness, or suicide—left behind restless spirits. In recent years, the old jailhouse has become a hotspot for ghost tours and overnight investigations. Brave participants have experienced chilling encounters, including shadowy figures moving through cells and sudden drops in temperature. Some have even captured mysterious voices on audio recordings, adding to the jail's haunted reputation. Whether skeptics or believers, most who enter the jailhouse leave with stories they can't quite explain. Today, the haunted Texas jailhouse is a must-visit for ghost hunters and history buffs. The property hosts scheduled tours, giving guests a chance to explore the building's dark past while keeping an eye, and ear, out for ghostly activity. Just be warned, some visitors say the spirits have a way of following you home.</p>

Mid-Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of West Africa A giant, comma-shaped cloud of Saharan dust being blown out to sea Satellites recently snapped a giant cloud of "Saharan dust" blowing out to sea from the world's largest hot desert. The hazy mass later traveled more than 4,000 miles (6,500 kilometers) to North America, where it polluted the skies of Florida and other states. A photo captured by the GOES-19 satellite, which is co-run by NASA and NOAA, revealed the cloud as it first began its transatlantic journey.

Saharan dust can have several other surprising effects. "It can even suppress thunderstorm development over locations where the dust is especially thick." Saharan dust gets whipped up by strong gusts of wind, which occur much more frequently in deserts than other environments, and can reach several miles above Earth's surface, according to the U.K. Met Office. This mainly happens between late spring and early fall. Every three to five days, the accumulated dust gets blown out to sea, and if there is enough of it, the particulates form large plumes that can travel across entire oceans, according to NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, which helps monitor the Saharan Air Layer. —Successive lightning strikes illuminate eye of tropical cyclone in rare photos —3 hurricanes form a perfect line before smashing into land —Near-lifeless 'Land of Terror' looks like an alien landscape in the Sahara Saharan dust plumes of various sizes reach the U.S. every year, usually peaking in intensity between June and August. During this two-week-long event, the amount of dust reached the highest levels since satellites began tracking plumes 18 years previously, according to a 2021 study.

A new artificial intelligence (AI) model can predict major weather events faster and more accurately than some of the world's most widely used forecasting systems. The model, called Aurora, is trained on more than 1 million hours of global atmospheric data, including weather station readings, satellite images and radar measurements. Scientists at Microsoft say it's likely the largest dataset ever used to train a weather AI model. It delivered more accurate five-day storm tracks and produced high-resolution forecasts up to 5,000 times faster than conventional weather models powered by supercomputers. They published their findings May 21 in the journal Nature. Researchers hope Aurora and models like it could support a new approach to predicting environmental conditions called Earth system forecasting, where a single AI model simulates weather, air quality and ocean conditions together. This could help produce faster and more consistent forecasts, especially in places that lack access to high-end computing or comprehensive monitoring infrastructure.

Aurora belongs to a class of large-scale AI systems known as foundation models — the same category of AI models that power tools like ChatGPT. Foundation models can be adapted to different tasks because they're designed to learn general patterns and relationships from large volumes of training data, rather than being built for a single, fixed task. In Aurora's case, the model learns to generate forecasts in a matter of seconds by analyzing weather patterns from sources like satellites, radar and weather stations, as well as simulated forecasts, the researchers said. The model can then be fine-tuned for a wide range of scenarios with relatively little extra data — unlike traditional forecasting models, which are typically built for narrow, task-specific purposes and often need retraining to adapt. The diverse dataset Aurora is trained on not only results in greater accuracy in general versus conventional methods, but also means the model is better at forecasting extreme events, researchers said. It also outperformed wave simulation models at forecasting ocean swell height and direction in 86% of tests, showing it could extract useful patterns from complex data even when specific inputs were missing or incomplete. "It's got the potential to have [a] huge impact because people can really fine tune it to whatever task is relevant to them … particularly in countries which are underserved by other weather forecasting capabilities," study co-author Megan Stanley, a senior researcher at Microsoft, said in a statement. The model has been integrated into services like MSN Weather, which itself is integrated into tools like the Windows Weather app and Microsoft's Bing search results.

The Exynos 2500 is expected to be Samsung's next flagship processor, but so far, all the information available has come from rumors and leaks, except for the one time the company acknowledged its name. Surprisingly, a big feature of the next big Samsung chip has now been confirmed, not by Samsung but by a company called Skylo. If the name sounds a bit familiar, that's because Skylo is the satellite connectivity provider for the Pixel 9 series and the Galaxy S25 series on Verizon. “Today, we are excited to announce the certification of the Exynos 2500 mobile processor, offering better energy efficiency and higher performance,” Skylo noted in a press release, hinting at the chip's imminent launch and confirming its extraterrestrial capabilities. The Exynos 2500 is expected to debut on the Galaxy Z Flip 7. This is also the first time Samsung will introduce a flagship Exynos chip on a foldable phone instead of its latest Galaxy S series flagship. “Samsung's partnership with Skylo is built upon 3GPP NTN standards to unlock connectivity everywhere,” Hui Won Je, VP of the Modem Development Team at Samsung Electronics, noted in Skylo's press release. “Through our collaboration on the Samsung Exynos Modem 5400 and the Exynos 2500 mobile processor, mainstream devices worldwide will now have the underlying technology to connect to satellites wherever cellular networks are unavailable, ushering in a new era of ubiquitous connectivity,” he added. In addition to its collaboration with Samsung, Skylo also announced partnerships with OPPO and TECNO to bring NTN-compliant satellite connectivity to future devices from the respective brands.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam and Dean Winchester hunted monsters across the country, saving people from things that go bump in the night. Five years after Supernatural ended, creator Eric Kripke talked about the story he never got to tell and the one he would never tell. Inspired by Roald Dahl's The Gremlins, Kripke wanted to do a story about mischievous creatures that messed with technology. But Kripke purposefully steered clear of one particular religious figure when writing Supernatural. Richard Speight Jr. asked Eric Kripke if there was any story he wanted to do but didn't get to. Kripke said, "The one story that I always really wanted to do under my watch that I never got a chance to do was Gremlins. ‘Cause Gremlins are a real mythology that long predated the movie." The furry creatures wreaked havoc on a small town, blowing up washing machines and movie theaters. While there are a few instances of gremlins affecting technology, those mischievous little creatures weren't based on the gremlins to which Kripke was referring. Gremlins are fictional creatures created to explain otherwise inexplicable malfunctions in aircrafts and other machinery. The idea of gremlins became popular among the Royal Air Force pilots and crew during World War II. Both sides experienced unexplained accidents, so the gremlins were thought to be unbiased tricksters, causing mischief and mayhem wherever they liked. Posters warning of the invisible mischief-makers depicting gremlins greasing floors and throwing things in people's eyes were made during the war. When describing his idea for the episode, Kripke said, "And so my notion was, okay, turns out gremlins are so small, you can't see them. So I don't have to make, like, a bunch of puppets. "And so now Dean's like, ‘I can't destroy it. How Dean saves Baby is still a mystery, but he discussed some of the visual gags he had in mind. Like it wasn't like an impossible story to pull off ... It—you know, the only monsters you ever saw would have been like the blender that someone's hand was in or the car." When thinking back to why Kripke never made an episode about gremlins, he couldn't quite pinpoint the reason, but he said, "You know, I don't know why we never ended up doing it. But I think at the time, the feeling was like we don't have enough days in the schedule to do, like, a real Impala-centric episode … It's basically all car gags all day." While Supernatural never had a gremlin episode, something similar did happen in "Mannequin 3: The Reckoning." While it wasn't about imperceptible creatures, Baby was possessed by a ghost, and the Winchesters had to fight their Impala. Kripke's gremlins episode would've probably fallen somewhere in between the two. When on Supernatural Then and Now, Richard Speight Jr. asked Eric Kripke if he'd ever considered including Jesus in the Supernatural mythology. “I wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole, man,” Kripke responded. “You know, the, the comic book sources that a lot of that stuff came from, like Preacher, you know, and Garth Ennis. And they were all—I mean—yes, there is sort of like a whacked-out Jesus character in that. You know, so that there're a lot of religions it could play under rather than, you know, being with any one particular religion.” I wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole, man. It turned out the hotel was magically renovated to welcome several gods and deities from other faiths. It ended in a slaughter at the hands of Lucifer. Supernatural's "Swan Song" is hailed as Eric Kripke's perfect finale to the series, but his ending is actually much darker and unsatisfying. The episode was well-received, but inserting deities from belief systems currently being practiced by millions of people didn't go over well with some viewers—namely the representation of Ganesh and Kali. In addition to poorly portraying the gods and what they represent, they made them appear weak, like the pagan gods that are no longer worshiped—although there are over a billion practicing Hindus worldwide. We wanted to be provocative without being, you know, firebombed. Kripke also joked about finding the line in their storytelling, saying, “And, you know, we wanted to be provocative without being, you know, firebombed, I think.” The decision not to portray the Christian messiah was probably a good call, as the mythology was already limited to Abrahamic religions. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Supernatural's "Destiel" fans got a treat when Jensen Ackles confirmed that one of his band's songs was inspired by the Dean and Castiel relationship. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an iconic masterpiece, but it failed in an obvious way with one of its most important characters. Sitcoms are the backbone of television, but some classic ones have not aged as well as many fans would like them to. The future of Doctor Who appears to be being hotly debated right now. These TV shows delivered unforgettable finales, ending their stories with grace, impact, and lasting emotional resonance that still holds up today.</p>
