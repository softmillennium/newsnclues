Juventus, once Serie A's most dominant club, has fallen back towards the pack. The Old Lady are no longer Italy's dominant force, their last Serie A win came in 2020, but they remain one of the world's biggest teams. As they prepare to kickstart their run at the Club World Cup, Juventus are fighting for more than just a trophy; they're fighting for legitimacy, not just on the field but off of it. Both missed out on this summer's Gold Cup to take part in this tournament, and considering the U.S. Men's National Team's ongoing controversy surrounding Christian Pulisic, it is safe to assume all players, even the team's biggest stars, have to constantly fight for their place. Meanwhile, at Juve, no one is ever safe, as McKennie knows particularly well, and both will be among the players fighting to earn new coach Igor Tudor's trust. Tudor was brought in late last season to guide Juventus towards the Champions League. He did that, and now this Club World Cup is his chance to really show his ideas as Juve boss. This summer is vital for McKennie and Weah on multiple levels, and as they head into this Club World Cup, they do so with a big picture in sight.</p>

Teams fail to find cutting edge in scoreless draw

MetLife Stadium half-full for noon kick-off

Borussia Dortmund and Fluminense played out a 0-0 draw in the Club World Cup on Tuesday in rainy conditions at MetLife Stadium.

The match kicked off at noon local time, so it was perhaps unsurprising that the stadium was only half full. New York/New Jersey has a significant Brazilian population, and the crowd of 34,763 was tilted toward Fluminense, with fans waving flags and singing for their team.

Fluminense's best scoring chance came in the 58th minute on a left-footed shot by Agustín Canobbio that was saved by Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel.

Dortmund's new signing Jobe Bellingham, the brother of Real Madrid star Jude, made his debut for Dortmund in the 59th minute as a substitute for Pascal Gross.

The German club qualified for the Club World Cup with a top-four finish in the Bundesliga, while Fluminense qualified as the 2023 Copa Libertadores champion.
 Fluminense played more aggressively, and had 14 shots to Dortmund's seven. The Germans held the possession advantage at 54.5%.

Fluminense next play on Saturday evening against South Korea's Ulsan Hyundai at MetLife. Dortmund face South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday afternoon in Cincinnati.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans were quick to react after watching Jobe Bellingham's Borussia Dortmund debut against Fluminense at the Club World Cup. Jobe, 19, joined Borussia Dortmund on a five-year contract until June 2030 last week. Sunderland are due to receive a fee of around £26.96m plus £4.2m in add-ons. Of course, by joining Dortmund, Jobe has drawn comparisons with his older brother Jude, who also played for the German side before joining Real Madrid in 2023. Jobe was introduced 59 minutes into Dortmund's 0-0 draw against Brazilian outfit Fluminense at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Fans were quick to give their thoughts on his performance. Jobe Bellingham looks sharp in that Dortmund kit, making his mark at the Club World Cup. Can't wait to see more from him!" Another added: "He's just swinging side passes like proper EFL midfielder - nothing special about him!" A third commented: "Uncanny resemblance with his brother." While a fourth explained: "There's nothing special except the media PR. This guy is bang average and is only carried by the hype that's also carrying his Real Madrid brother. Jobe explained how it was an "incredible feeling" to sign for the German side when he spoke to the club's website last week. He added: "The last three weeks have honestly been incredible for me. But if his brother's progression is anything to go by, Jobe should develop into a fine midfielder. Topics: Borussia Dortmund, Football, Jude Bellingham, Sunderland</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Freeman #16 of the United States battles Sheldon Bateau #4 of Trinidad and Tobago during the Gold Cup 2025 on Sunday in San Jose, Calif. The U.S. defeated Trinidad and Tobago to snap a four-game losing streak as it eyes next year's World Cup, which the U.S. is co-hosting. The world of American soccer has a rare, priceless opportunity arriving a year from now: the 2026 FIFA World Cup, to be hosted largely on U.S. soil. "It's a storm," veteran defender Tim Ream said last Friday of the negativity. Even players will admit that it's been a tough stretch for the national team. Last year's embarrassing group stage elimination in the Copa America tournament led to the firing of then-coach Gregg Berhalter. Two defeats came in March to Panama and Canada, followed by a one-goal loss to Türkiye and a 4-0 pounding by Switzerland last week. All four are the caliber of team the U.S. would likely need to beat in order to advance in next year's World Cup. "I don't think there's any denying that some of our performances have fallen short over the past year to 18 months," said defender Walker Zimmerman earlier this month. "It's something that, us as players, we obviously aren't satisfied with." It hasn't helped that some of the team's top players have been absent from the recent games due to injury, like Sergiño Dest. Others' club teams declined to make them available this summer due to participation in the FIFA Club World Cup, including Weston McKinnie and Tim Weah. But one conspicuous absence was neither: Christian Pulisic, the 26-year-old star and face of the USMNT — who reportedly chose to sit out in order to rest. His absence, coupled with the team's poor showings on the field, sparked criticism from some former national team players, including Landon Donovan. During a TV broadcast of the UEFA Nations League Final between Portugal and Spain, Donovan praised the participation of the 40-year-old Portuguese national team legend Cristiano Ronaldo to make a point about, it seemed, Pulisic. American star Christian Pulisic, shown here last month playing for AC Milan in Italy, reportedly decided to sit out the Gold Cup for the USMNT to rest. His decision has sparked criticism from former players. "And I can't help but think about some of our guys who are on vacation right now, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. Last week, Pulisic appeared on the CBS Sports Golazo America podcast to air his side. "I had to make the best decision for myself and in the long run for my team, even though some people haven't seen it that way," Pulisic said on the podcast. "I did want to be part of at least the two friendlies [against Turkiye and Switzerland]. I did speak with the coaches, and I did ask to be part of the team in whatever capacity they could. At a press conference Saturday, Pochettino responded bluntly. I am not a mannequin," Pochettino said. For the players on the team this month, it has been "a chaotic time," said John Tolkin, a 22-year-old defender who recently made his fifth appearance with the national team. "What you see online, all that media, all the opinions, it's impossible this day not to see it," Tolkin told reporters Friday. The absence of Pulisic and other key veterans has meant there are valuable game minutes up for grabs for younger players, like Tolkin, who are eager to prove themselves to Pochettino for a spot on the World Cup roster next summer. Their opportunity is this month's Gold Cup, a biannual tournament for national teams in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. This summer's edition also includes Saudi Arabia. Afterward, he told reporters that it felt "amazing" and like "a relief" to have a good game amid the external negativity. "After those two friendlies, it's been a tough, more disappointing period," he said. The U.S. has two more games in the Gold Cup group stage — a tilt against Saudi Arabia on Thursday, followed by Haiti on Sunday. A second win would assure the U.S. advances to a knockout round with as many as three more games. A title in the tournament, with a win or two over quality opponents like Mexico or Canada, could completely change the narrative. "For us, each day we take at a time."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're not even a week into the Club World Cup, and the prevailing theme has to be embarrassing for FIFA. But really, FIFA only has its own arrogance to blame with puzzling scheduling decisions. But the game times and venues have also been a major factor in this initial embarrassment. For Monday's game between the Premier League's Chelsea and MLS' LAFC, kickoff was set for 3 p.m. local time at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium — a time when people are largely at work. Mind you: Atlanta United leads MLS in average attendance. That led to a scene like this at kickoff. But the announced crowd was still 22,000, which actually isn't awful for a 3 p.m. Monday match. If you put that crowd in any soccer-specific MLS stadium, FIFA would have been looking at a sellout and a totally different conversation about the tournament. The same went for Tuesday's match between Bundesliga giant Borussia Dortmund and Brazilian side Fluminense. So, you had a crowd that looked like this: If FIFA had instead opted to hold the match at Sports Illustrated Stadium (formerly Red Bull Arena in New Jersey), that's a packed stadium. And sure, some matches have been able to draw impressive crowds at NFL or college football stadiums. Miami's Hard Rock Stadium has also seen some solid crowds. But those were either weekend matches or taking place at night. FIFA really should have considered the time and venue. That's not the recipe for a successful tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of fans packed into a narrow, shadeless corridor here waiting to enter Hard Rock Stadium. An elderly man, struggling in 92-degree heat, staggered toward a chair; a preteen boy later keeled over and doused himself with water. “We're gonna pass out,” one woman said, as she pleaded with security to open locked gates, to no avail. And they weren't the only ones melting; players are, too. After Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 win over Atlético Madrid the following day in Pasadena, California, PSG coach Luis Enrique said, “The teams are suffering.” His PSG counterpart Vitinha said: “I'm all red. All involved, including 80,000 fans at the Rose Bowl, got previews of an inescapable danger at the 2026 World Cup, which will also be staged at 11 stadiums across the U.S., plus two in Canada and three in Mexico. Five of those 16 stadiums have roofs; but the rest are open-air and susceptible to weather. Temperatures are projected to rise into the mid-90s as Juventus and Wydad kick off at noon in Philadelphia on Sunday; and as Benfica and Bayern Munich battle at 3 p.m. in Charlotte on Tuesday. Even in the low 90s, at noon and 1 p.m. in Southern California on Sunday, fans and players struggled to cope. "No European team is used to competing in such high temperatures," Llorente said. First time in my life I felt heat like this,” Benfica's Anatoliy Trubin said after Benfica's draw with Boca Juniors in 90-degree, humid Miami Gardens. … It's impossible to perform at a very high level for 90 minutes.” It schedules three or four games per day and spreads them out into exclusive windows. Some, therefore, must go in the afternoon, when there is often no reprieve from the summer sun — but when it's prime time in Europe and Africa. Players are afforded one water break per half — during which they've draped ice-cold towels over their heads and neck — but some experts worry that's not enough. At last summer's Copa América, Uruguay defender Ronald Araújo exited a game at halftime feeling “dizzy.” An assistant referee collapsed and was hospitalized, having “suffered from dehydration,” according to organizers. But its Club World Cup schedule placed afternoon games in Cincinnati, Pasadena, Miami, North Jersey, Philadelphia, Orlando, Charlotte, Nashville and Washington, D.C. FIFA did not immediately respond to an email seeking information on what extra precautions, if any, are being prepared for the heat wave expected to hit some of those cities later this week. “Because at this point in the season, it can be decisive."</p>

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. — There's a possibility Real Madrid will begin the FIFA Club World Cup without its biggest star.

French World Cup champion Kylian Mbappé did not practice with his teammates n Tuesday because of a fever, a Real Madrid spokesman told USA TODAY Sports.

New Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso will have a press conference Tuesday afternoon, and will likely address Mbappe's condition before the club's opener in the tournament.

Real Madrid will play against Saudi Arabian standouts Al Hilal at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Wednesday at 3 p.m. ET.

Mbappe is undoubtedly the biggest star in the Club World Cup field outside of Argentine World Cup champion and Inter Miami star Lionel Messi.

If Mbappe is unable to play, Real Madrid will rely on a slew of other stars like Brazilian standouts Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo, English star Jude Bellingham and Croatian Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modrić.

Real Madrid newcomers center back Dean Huijsen (Spain) and right back Trent Alexander-Arnold (England) practiced Tuesday, and could make their club debuts Wednesday.Real Madrid and Al Hilal are in Group H of the Club World Cup with Mexican standouts Pachuca and FC Red Bull Salzburg from Austria.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kylian Mbappé is now a doubt to play in Real Madrid‘s FIFA Club World Cup opener against Al Hilal, it has emerged. MARCA report Mbappé has come down with a fever and remained at the team hotel while Xabi Alonso worked with his new squad in the Miami heat. Real Madrid are carefully monitoring Mbappé‘s condition and do not want the forward “overexerted”, especially given the warm weather in Florida. The club will reassess his condition in the hours leading up to its match against Al Hilal and make a decision then. It goes without saying that losing Mbappé would be a huge blow for Real Madrid. He also took home the Pichichi Trophy and the European Golden Boot in his debut campaign in a white shirt. The good news for the new boss and Real Madrid is that Mbappé is not dealing with an injury, and therefore should not be out of the action for too long. Even if he is unable to feature in Los Blancos‘ opening match of the FIFA Club World Cup, he will likely be fully recovered from his sickness in time for the team's fixture against Pachuca on Sunday, June 22.

Every few years, ex-U.S. soccer star Alexi Lalas, 55 — who attended Rutgers from 1988-91 — scapegoats diversity for the team's recent struggles despite teams like France, that won the 2018 World Cup with a roster comprised of players of different ethnicities and backgrounds, proving him wrong.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has decided not to show any videos, signage or marketing assets in venues hosting the Club World Cup in the United States which explicitly mention challenging racism or discrimination. FIFA has also not performed any announcements within its stadiums explaining the anti-racism protocols or the organisation's “universal anti-racism gesture” which was rolled out in September last year and was supposed to be applied to all competitions. FIFA did not respond when asked if it consulted competing clubs in the Club World Cup over its strategy on these matters. The reasons for FIFA's apparent change of policy are not known. This was widely interpreted as a nod to the current climate in the U.S. where many corporations and institutions are abandoning their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. FIFA's President Gianni Infantino has developed a close bond with President Donald Trump's administration, even attending a Trump pre-inauguration rally, the inauguration itself and visiting the White House. FIFA did not respond when asked if the current political climate in the U.S. played any part in their decision. They did point to their statutes, which say “FIFA remain neutral in matters of politics.” These messages were visible on captain's armbands, as well as being shared on LED advertising boards around the stadium. In Qatar, FIFA blocked a small number of European nations from wearing a ‘OneLove' armband, which was perceived to be challenging homophobia in a country that criminalises same-sex relations, but FIFA's own campaigns during the tournament included the following slogans: No Discrimination, Save the Planet, Protect Children, End Hunger, Education for All and Be Active. FIFA have been asked whether the World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada in 2026, will include messaging about its anti-discrimination and anti-racism campaigns but they did not answer the question. Only last month, FIFA President Infantino urged policy makers and legislators globally to join FIFA in the fight against racism and discrimination by imposing criminal penalties on offenders, claiming FIFA cannot win the battle alone. In a statement to The Athletic, FIFA did not explain why they have reduced their in-tournament messaging for this competition in the United States. This commitment was recently reinforced through the unanimous approval by the FIFA Council of the revised FIFA Disciplinary Code, which introduces new measures to fight racist abuse — including increased minimum bans for racist incidents and enhanced financial penalties as duly informed to the 75th FIFA Congress in Asuncion in May 2025.” They also said their three-step anti-discrimination procedure is in effect should incidents occur, while also saying a social media protection service is available to players and match officials, which helps hide abuse from their social media channels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 opened on Saturday, Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest footballer, weaved his magic on the field as a cluster of former stars – David Beckham, Ronaldo, Kaka, Bebeto, Roberto Baggio and Javier Zanetti – watched on from their VIP seats at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. While Messi was unable to score any goals in Inter Miami's 0-0 draw against Egyptian club Al Ahly, football fans turned up in their thousands to watch the Argentinian lead his team in what could have been a goal-fest for the home side. Here's what's gone wrong with the Club World Cup thus far: Kickoffs scheduled at noon and 3pm local time on scorching hot summer days have led to players dealing with difficult conditions. Some of these teams have finished full league and cup competition seasons in their respective countries and confederations. Others – from the US, South America and Oceania – have hit pause on their regular seasons and will return to their respective leagues after the Club World Cup. “The decision today to schedule the FIFA Club World Cup between June 15 and July 13 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives,” players' union FIFPRO said in a statement when the tournament schedule was released in 2024. FIFPRO called for the consideration of player health and safety regulations as a “matter of urgency” but that failed to deter FIFA from tinkering with the schedule. Auckland City, a club made up of amateur players with full-time day jobs, opened their campaign against six-time European champions Bayern Munich and were handed a 10-0 thumping. While minnows and favourites are often pitted together in global tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, Oceania champions Auckland will also face Argentinian powerhouse Boca Juniors and Portuguese side Benfica in an incredibly tough draw for the team from New Zealand. It seems unfair for the team rated 4,957th in the world in the Opta Power Rankings to take on opponents ranked sixth (Bayern Munich), 24th (Benfica) and 131st (Boca Juniors). While Messi-mania brought the crowds in the tournament opener in Miami on June 14, and European champions PSG thrashed Atletico Madrid in front of 80,000 Los Angeles fans at the famous Rose Bowl a day later, the same cannot be said for some of the other fixtures. Monday's Chelsea vs LAFC encounter at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta was played out in front of less than one-third of the stadium's capacity. The US-based side are often able to draw close to full-capacity crowds at their home venue in Los Angeles, and Chelsea rarely play in front of so many empty seats, whether at home or away. The stark contrast from the fervent fan support at their Stamford Bridge home in London prompted Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca to say the atmosphere in Atlanta was “a bit strange.” Strict security measures, which include the presence of border patrol officials and presenting passports as proof of identity, may also deter fans from thronging the venues.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, on the Call it What You Want podcast, Pulisic elaborated on his decision saying that he had offered to participate in the team's two pre-tournament friendlies against Türkiye and Switzerland, a decision which U.S. Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino rejected. “In [Pochettino's] mind, he must think this is absolutely crazy,” Donovan said. Howard believes that this incident is indicative of a cultural shift within U.S. Soccer towards players holding more control, a shift that Pochettino could be trying to reverse. “And what he's trying to do now is regain some of that power. And I think he was doing that in a quiet way until he was called out in the Christian Pulisic interview. And now I think for the first time, you know, U.S. Soccer, has a bit of an issue. They have an issue because, you know, Pochettino, who's the manager and is getting paid $6 million a year and is a big manager and his star player now are seemingly at odds.” Following their 4-0 defeat on June 10th against Switzerland, the U.S. Men's National Team had lost four consecutive matches for the first time since 2007, a streak which they snapped on Sunday with their emphatic 5-0 Gold Cup opening win against Trinidad & Tobago. While the win may have helped to temporarily settle a tense situation, Howard says that current national team players should not expect blind support from former national team players. “I've heard from people on the inside, friends of ours on the inside of U.S. Soccer, and there's this feeling going around that they should be supporting us. You don't get a free pass for being average.” The Americans next Gold Cup match comes Thursday night against Saudi Arabia at the Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team will host its first-ever College Talent ID Camp, and a handful of local players received an invitation. Forty-two players have been called up to a first-of-its-kind Women's College Talent ID Camp taking place in June. Freeman is a sophomore defender from Atlanta, Georgia. Sine is a sophomore defender from Coppell, Texas. Coming out of high school, she was a four-star recruit and ranked as the No. 2 prospect in the state of Texas by PrepSoccer. Kesler is a sophomore midfielder from American Fork, Utah. As a three-time varsity starter at American Fork High School, she was named to to the Deseret News First Team All-State, the Deseret News offensive MVP, and was also a 2024 6A American Fork State Champion finalist. She finished the year with one goal, three assists, and 19 total shots. Those stats earned her a spot on the All-Big 12 All-Freshman Team. Hirai is a freshman forward from Boise, Idaho. Miller is a sophomore forward from Providence, Utah. In her freshman year with the Aggies, Miller played in all 24 games, recorded four goals and five assists, and was put on the Mountain West All-Newcomer team. Your hard work is being recognized — and we couldn't be prouder. The camp's purpose is to “increase programming opportunities for college-specific players and expand the U.S. Under-18, Under-19 and Under-20 Women's National Team player pools.” Nicole Lukic, U.S. Soccer's Director of Talent ID for women and girls, said that the idea of the camp originally came up in January meetings. “The project initially arose from the January WNT Way meetings, where we held interactive workshops and brainstorming with all departments, to look at everything we do through a female-specific lens,” Lukic said. “When looking at player scouting through a female-specific lens, our Women's Talent ID team recognized an opportunity to adapt our strategy to continue to expand our player pools in the older age groups.” Lukic went on to say that the program felt it was a good time to “further develop our female-specific scouting strategy, dive deeper into our data and analysis of scouting pathways, and create this unique camp opportunity.” You can stream live radio, video and stay up to date on all of your favorite teams. The USMNT regained its footing with a much-needed win over Trinidad and Tobago, led by Malik Tillman and Diego Luna. The Washington Commanders broke a 19-year playoff drought last season, led by rookie QB Jayden Daniels and defensive captain Bobby Wagner. It's no secret that the start to Zach Wilson's NFL career has been tumultuous — marked by struggles on the field, coaching changes, and intense media scrutiny. Utah native and PGA Tour golfer Tony Finau dropped eight spots on the U.S. Open leaderboard during Saturday's third round. Although he got the best of him last week, former Utah LB Cody Barton had nothing but good things to say about rookie quarterback Cam Ward. He explained it on the Games With Names podcast.</p>
