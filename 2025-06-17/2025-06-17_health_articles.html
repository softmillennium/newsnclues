                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 16 of Oncotarget on June 10, 2025, titled "Exceptional responders to immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer: A multi-institutional case series of a rare occurrence." The study, led by first author Kavin Sugumar and corresponding author Jordan M. Winter, from University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, reports on a rare group of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients who responded remarkably well to immunotherapy, a treatment typically considered ineffective for this cancer type. The analysis, which includes data from 14 patients across multiple U.S. institutions, identifies outcomes that could help refine treatment strategies for one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of cancer. "Between 2020–21, 471 oncologists from 91 major cancer centers in the United States were contacted." Pancreatic cancer has among the lowest survival rates and few effective therapies. While immunotherapy has transformed the treatment landscape for several other cancers, it generally offers little benefit for pancreatic cancer. However, this study highlights a small but important group of patients who experienced significant and sustained responses to immune-based treatment without chemotherapy. Among the 14 patients, 82% had partial tumor shrinkage, and nearly one-third had a notable decrease in tumor markers. These outcomes contrast sharply with standard therapies, which often provide only a few months of benefit for similar patients. Interestingly, while some patients had high microsatellite instability (MSI-high)-a known marker for immunotherapy success-more than half did not, suggesting other biological mechanisms may be involved. This result highlights the need for new biomarkers to be discovered to predict treatment response in future studies. This case series is the largest focused exclusively on exceptional immunotherapy responders in pancreatic cancer. By excluding patients who received chemotherapy, the study isolates the effects of immune-based drugs, including PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, CTLA-4 inhibitors like ipilimumab, and agents targeting macrophages. The study suggests that, under certain biological conditions, this treatment can be remarkably successful. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. This work supports the need to reconsider how clinical trials are designed for pancreatic cancer and who is eligible for immunotherapy. Broader criteria and more personalized molecular profiling could help uncover hidden opportunities for treatment in this highly lethal cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new McGill University-led study suggests that disrupting the body's internal clock during adolescence can alter how the brain responds to an in-utero risk factor linked to certain brain disorders. Previous research has shown that a mother's infection during pregnancy, such as the flu, can increase a child's risk of developing conditions like schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders later in life. Irregular sleep patterns – often a sign of circadian rhythm disruption – are also associated with these conditions. To investigate how these factors interact, researchers exposed mice to either a prenatal infection, circadian disruption during adolescence (via constant light exposure), both or neither. They found that each factor caused some changes on its own, but the combination altered memory, anxiety, social behaviour and gene activity in brain regions associated with the disorders. "While more research is needed, our findings suggest that people exposed to multiple risk factors may need to be especially mindful of their daily rhythms," said lead author Tara Delorme, who conducted the research as a PhD student at the Douglas Research Centre. Surprisingly, the combined effects didn't always make outcomes worse. That suggests these factors may interact in unexpected ways." Nicolas Cermakian, senior author, professor in McGill's Department of Psychiatry The researchers focused on adolescence because it's a sensitive period for brain development. "Their internal clocks tend to run later than the rest of the population, but school still starts early. On top of that, evening exposure to screens and artificial light can further delay their biological rhythms, leading to what we call social jet lag." This mismatch between the body's internal clock and daily schedules has been linked to a range of health issues, he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from the George Washington University have uncovered promising evidence in an animal study that shows setmelanotide, an FDA-approved medication for a rare genetic obesity disorder, may offer a pathway for treating a life-threatening form of sleep-disordered breathing called Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. People with this syndrome don't breathe deeply or frequently enough, especially during sleep, which leads to a buildup of carbon dioxide in their bodies even when they're awake. Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome which affects an estimated five to 10 million Americans commonly coexists with obstructive sleep apnea. While positive airway pressure machines like CPAP and BiPAP are standard treatments used to help keep airways open while sleeping they provide limited help to people with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. Our research addresses a critical gap in treatment options for Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. Polotsky and postdoctoral researcher Mateus Amorim used the FDA approved drug setmelanotide to see if it could help improve breathing in obese mice. Researchers targeted a protein found on certain neurons in the brain called MC4R pathway that helps the brain control how much mammals and humans eat, how much energy they burn and even how they breathe. Just one dose of setmelanotide improved breathing and helped the mice respond better to high levels of carbon dioxide - something that's often impaired in Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. Setmelanotide improved breathing more than would be expected just from boosting metabolism, meaning it likely acts directly on brain regions that control breathing. When using special tools to turn on MC4R neurons, they found breathing improved. They also discovered that MC4R neurons connect directly to other brain cells that control the diaphragm, the main muscle used for breathing. Setmelanotide may be able to treat Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome by bypassing the leptin (a hormone made by fat cells that helps regulate breathing) which is common in people with obesity. While more studies of setmelanotide for Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome are still needed, this research represents a major advance in understanding how the brain controls breathing in obesity. The study, "Targeting melanocortin 4 receptor to treat sleep disordered breathing in mice" was published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People who have metabolic and bariatric surgery are significantly less likely to develop psychiatric disorders compared to those who take weekly injections of GLP-1 anti-obesity medications, according to a new study presented today at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting. The study shows metabolic and bariatric surgery confers a strong protective effect against common mental health disorders in a head-to-head comparison with GLP-1 pharmacotherapy. The data supports embedding psychiatric screening and support within both surgical and medical obesity programs to help reduce the potential mental health burden after treatment. Shauna Levy, MD, MS, study co-author, Assistant Professor, Chief, Division of MIS/Bariatric Surgery, Tulane University School Medicine After propensity score matching to balance demographic and clinical characteristics, 33,600 surgical patients and 33,600 pharmacotherapy patients were compared for the incidence of new psychiatric disorders. The follow-up period lasted up to five years. "Maintaining mental health is important regardless of treatment choice. Even small differences can impact quality of life, so patients and their doctors should be proactive about monitoring mood, cognition, and substance use after starting any obesity therapy. Mental health is just as important as physical health and must be considered along with any treatment," said Ann M. Rogers, MD, MD, ACS FASMBS, President, ASMBS, who was not involved in the study.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Black patients are more likely to experience minor complications after metabolic and bariatric surgery than White patients, according to new study presented today at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting. Researchers from the Yale School of Medicine found Black patients had a higher overall incidence of minor complications such as dehydration, trips to the emergency department (ED) and infections in each of the seven years, growing from 10.2% in 2016 to 15% in 2023 versus 7.6% to 12.1% for White patients. Serious complication (0.4%) and mortality rates (0.1%) remained low throughout the seven years and were about the same for both patient groups. More work is needed to identify what's causing the uptick and how it can be reversed. A focus on enhanced discharge education and an action plan surrounding postoperative hydration may be beneficial." Safraz Hamid, MD, study co-author, Yale School of Medicine Researchers reviewed the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database to identify 1,106,419 patients (75% White patients, 25% Black patients) who had either primary laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) between 2016 and 2023. Surgical complications were ranked for severity using the Clavien-Dindo system and rates of complications were compared between the two patient groups. "The study underscores the safety of metabolic and bariatric surgery but also suggests a need to focus more attention on identifying patients at higher risk for minor complications so that we can take measures to prevent them," said ASMBS President Ann M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The higher a person's body mass index (BMI), the higher their risk for complications after bariatric surgery, especially those with BMI of 50 or more, according to a new study presented today at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting. Researchers found that the rate of complications increased by an average of 5.56% and serious occurrences rose 3.21% from the lowest BMI category to the highest, with people with a BMI 50 or more the most likely to experience complications of any kind. The study gives new insights into the risks associated with each BMI category and identifies the inflection point for increased risk of morbidity and mortality, which occurs when patients pass BMI 50," said study co-author John Scott, MD, FACS, FASMBS, Chief for the Division of Minimal Access and Bariatric Surgery for the Prisma Health Dept. "Obesity itself is a risk factor in surgeries of all kinds, but in bariatric surgery the risks remain relatively low." The retrospective study involved a review of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database for patients with obesity (BMI 30 or more) who had either sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between 2020 and 2023. "While complication rates are generally low, this study provides granular data not previously reported that can help with pre-operative counseling and to make surgery even safer and patient outcomes even better," said Richard M.

I'm back again in this Skills Lab Series on Medscape. Thank you for joining us in the past few lectures. Today is going to be the last lecture regarding surrogate endpoints. We will discuss how physicians and patients understand surrogate endpoints. Do they clearly understand, and do they make the right clinical decisions based on their understanding of surrogate endpoints? First, let's talk about patient understanding of progression-free survival (PFS), the most commonly used endpoint in advanced cancer drug trials. In fact, colleagues from the FDA conducted a fantastic study, in which they asked participants about their understanding of surrogate endpoints, and how they did this was very clever. They showed a direct-to-consumer television advertisement about a cancer drug, and the advertisement mentioned that the drug improved progression-free survival. It just said that the drug improved progression-free survival. There were almost 1000 participants in this study and, after watching that advertisement that mentioned improved progression-free survival, more than 90% of the participants thought that the drug improved survival. Even after that disclosure, 40% of the participants continued to believe that the drug improved survival, and I think this is because we call it progression-free survival. Even after disclosing that survival effects are unknown, 40% of the participants continued to believe that the drug improves survival. PFS and OS were explained to these patients, and they were given a hypothetical scenario about a drug that improved PFS and had some toxicities but did not improve OS. In this experiment, 17% of the patients said they would prefer to receive the drug even if there was no PFS benefit. Even if there is no PFS or OS benefit, they just do not want to give up. If the drug improved PFS between 3 and 9 months, even if it did not improve OS, patients would still want to get the drug. What this is telling us is that if the drug does not offer any OS advantage, more than half of our patients would decline a drug with toxicities, irrespective of how big the magnitude of the PFS benefit is. Therefore, we wrote a paper in The Lancet Oncology back in 2022, in which we called on the community to change the name of progression-free survival because it is confusing, and patients assume it is a survival advantage when it's actually not. If a drug does not improve survival, then they would probably not want a drug with PFS benefit alone. We said that it's time for a new name, and we proposed that instead of PFS, progression-free survival, we should call it PFI — progression-free interval — because it gets rid of the word "survival" and patients won't be confused. Now, let's talk about physicians' understanding of surrogate endpoints. This is a very recent paper that we published in ESMO Open. We conducted this study among oncologists in India, so there might be some limitations about how applicable it is elsewhere, but I don't think the results we found are very different from what we would find in any other country. Almost an equal percentage said that they would often use drugs that improved response rate but not survival. In regard to PFS, 20% of oncologists rarely used cancer drugs that did not improve survival and only improved PFS, but 48% of them often used such a drug. It does not help patients live longer or better, so what's the point? That was the reason why they did not want to use a drug with response alone. Among oncologists who said they would use the drug based on response rate alone, when we asked why, the most common answer was for symptom relief or improved quality of life. This is quite interesting because there are no data to say that response rate leads to improved quality of life or symptom relief. If it is in a tricky location, then it can, but there is no evidence that, in general, shrinking a tumor leads to improved quality of life. This indicates that oncologists' understanding of surrogate endpoints is also not optimal. The second most common reason was to downstage disease, which is understandable. That means they know that response rate does not lead to improved clinical outcomes, but they can't just do nothing for their patients. They talk about the impact of drug approval and having it included in guidelines. Even if they know that it's based on response rate alone and they don't want to use the drug, if it's approved and if it's in the guidelines, then they feel like they're forced to use it. Some of the oncologists also said that it's on a case-by-case basis. For rare cancers or where there is no other option, as we discussed, they would use such a drug. The most common reason for not using a drug based on PFS alone was the lack of effect on survival because it was not known whether the drug improved survival or not, which is very appropriate. Reasons in support of PFS were very interesting. Again, this is very interesting because that's not true, especially in the context of the United States, Canada, and other high-income countries where we have done these studies. A drug approved based on PFS can cost even more than a drug that is approved based on OS. If, in the editorials, commentaries, and CMEs, people are promoting a drug that is based on PFS alone, then that leads to their use. Then, on a case-by-case basis, people also talk about cost-effectiveness and for rare cancers or lack of alternatives. Overall, I'm trying to show that when oncologists understand that it's only response rate or PFS, they still use these drugs based on some misguided assumptions that delaying PFS or improving response rate leads to improved quality of life, which is objectively untrue, and that drugs approved based on surrogate endpoints cost less than drugs approved based on OS, which is also untrue. It's also interesting that we have this culture of always trying to do something rather than having that difficult discussion about end of life. Doing something is always easier than doing nothing, so we end up prescribing these drugs, although we know that it does not benefit patients. I think these findings are quite interesting, and I want our entire oncology community to be aware of these biases within ourselves. To close the loop, we also asked these oncologists about whether magnitude and price matter. They said that, for a drug that impacts only PFS, they would want to see at least a 4.5-month improvement in PFS, with the range of answers from 1.5 to 12 months, so quite a big range there. This is applicable only in the Indian context. They said that 120 USD per month was appropriate for such a drug. It's not about the exact number, but what they are telling us here is that a drug that improves OS can cost up to three times more than a drug that improves PFS alone. If you think about it the other way around, a drug that only improves PFS but not OS should be costing one third of the drugs that improve OS. To clarify, just because a trial's endpoint is overall survival does not necessarily mean that the benefits are meaningful. There can be several other issues, which we'll discuss in our subsequent lectures. The next few lectures will talk about statistical analysis, sample sizes, power calculations, and so on.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new ICES study has found that 1.74 million patients in Ontario are attached to family physicians aged 65 or older, and that many of those patients are elderly and have complex medical needs. The study, published in Canadian Family Physician, explored key trends in the characteristics of comprehensive family physicians (FPs)-those providing care for a broad range of ages and health needs-and the patients attached to them. Although we found family physicians are practicing longer than expected – into their 70s, in fact – as these physicians retire, the number of patients without a family doctor will increase, especially as fewer early career physicians are choosing family medicine." Dr. Kamila Premji, a family physician, ICES fellow, assistant professor in family medicine at the University of Ottawa, and PhD candidate in family medicine at Western University's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry The study included over 11 million Ontario patients as of March 2022, and 9,375 comprehensive FPs. This was an updated analysis of similar cohorts from 2008, 2013, and 2019. A recent study by some of the same researchers showed that many FPs are choosing to work in hospitals instead of practicing comprehensive family medicine. "The data helps us to better understand the shortages we are facing, and informs strategies like team-based care, which can better support family physicians who provide comprehensive care and can reduce burnout," says Premji. Compared to the overall FP workforce, the authors found that near-retirement FPs were caring for a higher proportion of patients aged 65 or older, and many with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and frailty. "Looking to the future, we are concerned that the primary care system may not be able to absorb these medically complex patients who are attached to retiring family physicians, which will only exacerbate the current crisis," says senior author Dr. Bridget Ryan, adjunct scientist at ICES and an associate professor at Western's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mursla Bio, a leader in Extracellular Vesicle (EV) science on a mission to advance precision diagnostics and significantly improve cancer outcomes for at-risk patients, today announced the commercial launch of its AI Precision Medicine Platform, alongside a pre-print reporting the first validated method for isolating hepatocyte EVs from plasma for organ-specific proteomic and miRNA profiling. The Platform addresses a major gap in liquid biopsy and precision medicine: enabling non-invasive access to organ-specific molecular information from blood with high spatial and biological resolution. Mursla Bio's Platform is built on its ability to isolate and analyze EVs which are secreted by specific organs into the bloodstream. The Platform reduces non-target background by up to five orders of magnitude compared to standard bulk EV isolation and significantly improves data structure, enhancing prediction model generalization. Key supporting proteomics data was generated in collaboration with Evotec International GmbH. Patient samples were provided by University College London, with Professor Brian Davidson, a global leader in liver disease surgery and clinical research, contributing as a co-author. The study shows that Mursla Bio's method yields robust, organ-specific multi-omics data using minimal blood volume, offering a novel scalable approach for biomarker and AI development. Mursla Bio's Platform incorporates optimized multi-omics workflows, embedded AI pipelines, and IVD translation processes to convert complex biological signals into practical, regulatory-grade assays. These assays are deployable on standard commercial instruments using patented, PCR and ELISA-like steps designed for clinical adoption. Built on multi-omics data from over 300 patients, EvoLiver achieved 86% sensitivity and 88% specificity on a locked, IVD-compatible assay for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma detection², and has received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA³. EVs are nature's native signal enrichment system for long-distance communication between cells and organs. Our platform harnesses this biology to non-invasively access organ-specific, multi-omics data from just a small blood sample. It produces structured, biologically labeled datasets that are optimized for AI and ready to support diagnostic translation. EvoLiver is our first proof point of real-world clinical impact, and we are now expanding access to the platform to advance our pipeline and enable partnerships across other disease areas." The Platform will support pharma development through dynamic patient stratification, therapeutic response monitoring, surrogate markers and molecular phenotyping across complex disease biology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World Wellbeing Week is a global awareness event recognized annually during the last week of June. Launched in 2019 by Wellbeing World, the event promotes physical, mental, emotional, social, and environmental wellbeing in workplaces, communities and homes. Bedfont® Scientific Limited, a medical breath analysis device manufacturing company with over 48 years of experience, actively promotes workplace wellbeing and welcomes this year's World Wellbeing Week. With an estimated 776,000 workers in Great Britain suffering from work-related stress, depression, or anxiety in 2023/24, companies must do better to ensure employee wellbeing. Bedfont® has a dedicated team of Wellbeing Warriors who work tirelessly to ensure a healthy work/life balance for all employees. Various activities and events are held throughout the year for staff, such as healthy breakfasts and lunches, stress-busting activities, active challenges, and weekly walks, all designed to encourage staff to step away from their desks and take a break. Prioritizing wellbeing in the workplace is not just a moral responsibility, it's a strategic driver of performance and culture. However, the true impact of any wellbeing initiative depends on leadership. When the senior management team actively supports and champions wellbeing, it sends a powerful message. That commitment filters through every company level, creating a culture where care, productivity, and purpose thrive together.” Bedfont's dedicated Wellbeing Garden, which opened in 2023, offers staff a tranquil space to take time out, relax, and reflect. The wellbeing room is another space for staff to take time out, play games, or use the red light therapy machine and CELLER8® Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) device. "At Bedfont®, wellbeing is more than a policy, it's a daily priority.” Said Jason Smith, CEO at Bedfont®. “We genuinely care about how our people feel, and that's why we've introduced things like red light and PEMF therapy, a Wellbeing Garden, and flexible work options. When our team feels supported and balanced, they can perform at their best, individually and collectively." Earlier this month, the most recent team-building event saw the Bedfont® office close for the afternoon, and staff were treated to various activities and relaxation at St Andrews Lake. This is just one of many initiatives arranged by the Wellbeing Warriors, which give staff a much-needed wellbeing boost. By embedding wellbeing into its culture and daily operations, Bedfont® has seen the positive impact, and other organizations can benefit from a similar approach.
