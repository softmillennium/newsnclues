                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Netflix is looking to remake another classic TV series. The streamer has closed a deal with Legendary Television for Land of the Lost, a reboot of Sid and Marty Krofft's 1974 sci-fi adventure show, Deadline has learned. Sid and Marty Krofft as well as Marty's daughter Deanna Krofft Pope, who is VP Development and Production at their company, will produce the project, which is in very early stages, sources said. Reps for Netflix and Legendary TV declined comment. Land of the Lost centers on a father, Rick, and his two children who accidentally go through a portal and find themselves trapped in a world inhabited by dinosaurs, including a Tyrannosaurus rex they nickname Grumpy; primate-like people named Pakuni, one of whom, Cha-Ka, they befriend; and reptilian humanoids called Sleestak. Land of the Lost originated as a children's series which aired on NBC Saturday mornings for three seasons from 1974 to 1976, with CBS giving it a summer run in 1985 and 1987. In it, Rick was played by Spencer Milligan, with Wesley Eure and Kathy Coleman as his kids, Will and Holly, respectively. Stop-motion animation was used for some of the creatures. That led to a 1991 series remake, which aired for two seasons on ABC, and a 2009 feature film starring Will Ferrell. While it does not have the extensive library traditional TV studios do, Netflix has taken on a few classic series titles. The streamer is currently filming a new Little House On the Prairie and previously rebooted Lost In Space and One Day At a Time. Legendary Television's current slate includes Dune: Prophecy at HBO, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters at Apple TV+ and the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft at Netflix as well as Tomb Raider and Pacific Rim live-action series and an adaptation of Girls and Their Horses with Nicole Kidman — all in development at Amazon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Tuesday that Tom Cruise, Debbie Allen and longtime Spike Lee collaborator and production designer Wynn Thomas will receive honorary Oscars at the 2025 Governors Awards. In addition, Dolly Parton will receive the Academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. “This year's Governors Awards will celebrate four legendary individuals whose extraordinary careers and commitment to our filmmaking community continue to leave a lasting impact,” Academy president Janet Yang said in a release announcing the news. “The Academy's Board of Governors is honored to recognize these brilliant artists. Beloved performer Dolly Parton exemplifies the spirit of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award through her unwavering dedication to charitable efforts. And production designer Wynn Thomas has brought some of the most enduring films to life through a visionary eye and mastery of his craft.” His credits in a long career also include Risky Business, A Few Good Men, Interview with the Vampire, Eyes Wide Shut, Vanilla Sky and the Mission: Impossible film series that is wrapping with this summer's The Final Reckoning. Allen's work over almost five decades as a choreographer, actor and producer includes choreographing the Academy Awards seven times. Thomas' credits with Lee spans from 1986's She's Gotta Have It to Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X and 2020's Da 5 Bloods with many in between. He was also production designer on Oscar Best Picture A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man with Ron Howard, and on Hidden Figures among others. Parton, the Steel Magnolias and Nine to Five star who has sold 100 million records, has two Oscar Original Song nominations (for “Nine to Five” and “Travelin' Thru”), is being recognized for her humanitarian work with the Hersholt honor. She has founded charitable and philanthropic organizations including the Dollywood Foundation and within that the literacy program Dolly Parton's Imagination Library. The Hersholt award, also an Oscar statuette, is given “to an individual in the motion picture arts and sciences whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry by promoting human welfare and contributing to rectifying inequities,” the Academy says. Last year, Governors Awards honors went to Quincy Jones and casting director Juliet Taylor, with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award given to British writer-director Richard Curtis and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to James Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The Hersholt and Thalberg awards are not always given out, and are dependent on the vote of AMPAS' Board of Governors. That would happen for this group at the 98th Oscars, set for March 16, 2026 at the Dolby Theater to be hosted again by Conan O'Brien. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, after a spree shooter killed former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, her husband, and severely injured state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, President Donald Trump hasn't bothered to pick up the phone to speak with Minnesota's head of state. Tim Walz's office if he had received a call from Trump yet. A spokesperson for the Democratic governor replied, “We haven't heard from him,” adding that former President Joe “Biden called yesterday midday shortly after all the news broke.” Asked if Trump had ever called Walz, who took office in 2019, in previous moments of crisis or emergency, to speak cordially or professionally, the governor's spokesperson said, flatly, “Yes.” On Monday, Walz told reporters that he had yet to hear from President Trump in the aftermath of Saturday's murders, which resulted in a state-wide, two day manhunt before the suspect — 56 year old Vance Boelter — was apprehended. “I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. “The guy doesn't have a clue, he's a mess… so, you know, I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?” This wasn't a one-off moment of being loose-lipped with reporters. When Trump asserted to reporters on the presidential plane that he had no interest in speaking to Walz, he justified himself by claiming that the governor had “appointed this guy to a position,” seeming to suggest that Walz himself may bear some responsibility for the tragedy. Boelter — who allegedly had a hit list of over 45 local and state lawmakers, including Walz — previously served as a political appointee on the Minnesota governor's Workforce Development Board. The Trump administration has made a show of pursuing hardline policies against politically motivated violence. Attorney General Pam Bondi has charged individuals who vandalized Tesla cars and dealerships with terrorism, she is seeking the death penalty for alleged United Healthcare CEO assassin Luigi Mangione, and her department charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) with assaulting a federal agent after a chaotic incident at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center.But this public fixation on combating political violence has always been incredibly self-serving. Trump Parade Turnout Swamped by Millions Who Protested at 'No Kings' Rallies Beyoncé Thanks Paul McCartney for ‘Writing One of the Best Songs Ever Made' Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) wrote on X that Boelter's actions are “what happens when Marxists don't get their way.” In another post, Lee joked that Bueter — who wore a halloween mask to commit the murders — was a “Nightmare on Waltz Street.” “I wanted him to know how much pain that caused me and the other people in my state, and I think around the country, who think that this was a brutal attack,” Smith told reporters of their conversation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The superstar famously doesn't celebrate birthdays, only anniversaries. Some people might be obsessed with time, but Mariah Carey thinks the concept is nothing more than a thing of fantasy. In a recent interview with Capital FM posted Monday (June 16), the superstar once again stated how she refuses to acknowledge the passage of time. Carey has long said she doesn't subscribe to the construct of days, weeks and years, and has also asserted that she doesn't have birthdays — only anniversaries. “I just don't believe in it,” she continued. Carey's belief system also means that coordinating a so-called “time” to meet up with someone is not a viable option for her. “Yeah, I would have somebody call you and figure it out,” she calmly replied when asked how she goes about making appointments. Mimi's commitment to being free from the constraints of time dates back years. In an old interview reshared by the singer in 2023, a younger Carey explains, “I don't have birthdays … I decided to do that. That said, the “anniversary” of Carey's ethereal existence is on March 27 each year. This year, she marked the occasion by sharing a photo of herself on a jet ski and writing on Instagram, “Thank you lambily for the anniversary wishes and for always making me so happy!! 95 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated June 21, 2025 — not that she would recognize such a time stamp — becoming her 50th career entry on the chart.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon MGM Studios has confirmed what was reported last night: Twisters star Glen Powell is starring in a Ron Howard directed untitled firefighter film. Imagine Entertainment and Powell's banner, Barnstorm, are producing. Howard knows something about firefighter movies: He directed the classic Backdraft. Hodson's script follows disparate childhood friends, now elite firefighters, who must rekindle their fractured relationship when a series of deadly fires sweep across Texas. Powell received a Golden Globe nom in Best Actor Musical/Comedy for the Netflix comedy Hit Man. He will next star in the highly anticipated series Chad Powers, which he also co-created and co-wrote, and will soon star in Edgar Wright's The Running Man for Paramount Pictures, which is slated to be released on Nov. 7. The Top Gun: Maverick star also recently wrapped production on the revenge thriller Huntington, and is currently in production in JJ Abrams' upcoming film for Warner Bros. Hodson first transitioned from development executive to screenwriter in 2012. In addition to writing, Hodson served as a co-producer on Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey, and is producing through her company, Hodson Exports, which she runs with executive Morgan Howell. InSneider first had the news last night about this project. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

Watching Elio, the title character of Pixar‘s latest film, it's difficult not to draw comparisons to another child hero underneath the Disney umbrella. Introduced as a shy child reeling from an unspecified accident that took his parents' life, the 11-year-old bursts out of his shell upon an encounter with an installation speculating of life beyond the stars and emerges as a hyperactive, alien-obsessed weirdo who runs around wearing a cape and metal colander helmet, speaks in a made-up language he calls “Elio-ese,” and drives his Air Force aunt Olga (Zoe Saldaña) crazy. Related Stories How Cinespia Turned a Cemetery Into L.A.'s Weekend Hot Spot Jon Hamm Says He Prefers to Play ‘Sinner' Characters: ‘Superman Can Be Kind of Boring, No Offense' She was rough around the edges, bratty and mean, and with eccentricities — a love of Elvis Presley, a belief that a fish on her nearby beach can control the weather — that were singular to her and her alone. Elio is a teddy bear in comparison: he's too instantly sympathetic to ever get properly annoyed at, and his obsession with aliens feels more banal and less personal, a way of acting out after the death of his parents rather than a real passion inside himself. He's easy to like, a sweet kid voiced winningly by spirited child actor Yonas Kibreab. But, like the movie that bears his name, he's a bit too forgettable to fall in love with. Any Pixar film that's been released since roughly the mid-2010s invites a perhaps unfair game of comparison, measuring how it stacks up to the studio's golden period of the 2000s, when every other film they produced was an instant classic. “Elio” certainly is a fair sight better than much of the company's latest output, which has geared more toward regurgitating old ideas or sputtering around in shallow storylines. And yet watching it feels a slight bit depressing at the same time, a reminder that where Pixar's films once led the animation industry, taking out there concepts like rats that want to cook and robots that want to find love and bringing exquisite heart to them, they now feel imitative instead of innovative. The directorial change-up feels readily apparent throughout “Elio's” 90-minute running time. That's not necessarily due to plot holes or pacing — the film clips along its standard beats at a steady pace, only lagging during one spaceship ride near the end that comes across as pure filler — but the overall feeling that it's only dipping its toes into the emotional and creative depths of this story. The message gets received not just by a spacecraft but by the Communiverse, a roaming planet-like spaceship holding an international committee of representatives from across several galaxies. Getting whisked away into this fantastically technicolor world is a dream come true for Elio, enough that he's willing to go along with it when the committee reveals their misread that he's the leader of Earth. To secure his place in their ranks, he bravely/insanely plunges himself into solving a diplomatic crisis between the alliance and Lord Grigon (a suitably hammy Brad Garrett), the “blood emperor” of a warlike race of alien worms from the planet Hylurg, who seeks revenge on the ambassadors for rejecting his bid to join them. All of this looks fantastic — while on Earth, Elio suffers a bit from that squishy, rounded animation style that's recently become more or less Pixar's house look. One can detect sci-fi inspirations from “E.T.” to “Star Wars” all over the film's DNA, and in its funniest and most memorable moments it takes cues from sci-fi horror of all things, including the introduction to Grigon's son Glordon (Remy Edgerly), which has a whiff of both H. R. Giger in the character design and Ridley Scott in the blocking. None of the ambassadors get enough individuality for us to actually care about them, and their actual goals as an organization are too vague to grasp. This wondrous world up in the stars too frequently feels more like an amusement park for Elio to run and geek around in than a living, breathing universe. “Elio” draws clear parallels between Grigun's issues relating to Gideon and Elio's disconnect from his aunt Olga, and his desire for alien approval comes from a deeply wounded sense of pain that he no longer belongs on Earth after the passing of his parents. There's some great raw material here, and yet onscreen it never gets to compelling territory. Elio and Olga are simply too generic, stock types that can be found in plenty of modern animated films, for their friction to ever build into something as compelling as, say, Marlin and Nemo's strained father-son relationship. It doesn't help that Saldaña, whose character is meant to be the story's heart, sounds like she's phoning it in a bit in the voiceover booth. There's no specificity to Elio's circumstances on Earth — his trauma from his parents' deaths gets mostly brushed over, the isolation he feels from his peers is represented via a stock bully, even the town he lives in is a generic suburbia — which makes his yearning to escape to the stars ring hollow. But by shying away from investing in where its main character is coming from, the movie makes his galactic adventures feel a bit weightless.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You also need a great piece of machinery, of course, and a professional crew making sure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. It takes a virtual village to dominate the circuit. But the difference between a competition-level team and a championship one often comes down to who is sitting in the cockpit. “WE HAVE THE DRIVER!” intones Javier Bardem, with a solemnity that would make Moses put down the 10 commandments and break into a slow clap. — this throwback to old-school blockbusters is indeed a well-oiled, finely tuned operation. Most importantly, however, is that it definitely has the driver. The fuel running this sleek, aerodynamic speedster of a movie is 100-percent pure star power. They call him Mr. Pitt — and even before you officially meet the man-above-the-title's character Sonny Hayes, a.k.a. Serene images of nature are interspersed with en media race footage, cars whizzing and whooshing around a first-person POV. He gets into car, runs his section his way, and thanks to Hayes' lead, the team walks away with the trophy. (Our hero won't touch the cup, however — he claims it's bad luck.) The fact that he manages all this in the time it takes to play Led Zeppelin's “Whole Lotta Love” only makes it, y'know, a 100 times cooler. Then Sonny walks away, “one and done,” ready to head whichever way the wind will blow him next. But who should walk into the Orlando laundromat that Hayes is killing time in than his old friend, Ruben (Bardem). Once upon a time, these two were fellow up-and-coming drivers, each pole-positioned to become Formula One's Next Big Thing. Then Hayes was involved in an accident during a big race against Ayrton Senna, and proceeded to spend the next 30 years drifting into obscurity. Ruben, meanwhile, has become the owner of APXGP, an F1 team languishing comfortably in perpetual last place. Until it isn't, and Hayes shows up at the team's practice track, sauntering in like he's already won. Because he already has — when you're a hot shot played by Brad Pitt, strolling through a film that has beautifully set you up to be the human equivalent of a racecar running on all cylinders yet blissfully defiant of anything resembling “the rules,” it's all over but the checkered-flag waving, right? Hayes still has to win over Joshua Pearce (Snowfall‘s Damson Idris, leveling up in a massive way), the rookie who's got the right stuff but has to learn the ropes, etc. ; he's wary of this dinosaur coming in and potentially stealing his thunder. We should note that, starting with a press conference announcing Hayes as the newest addition to APXGP, everyone from journalists to Pearce's mom (Sarah Niles) and manager (Samson Kayo) begin making cracks about Sonny's age. Shortly thereafter, F1 has the star dipping himself shirtless into an ice bath, as if to say: Yeah, the dude's old, but he's like Hot Sixtysomething Brad Pitt old. Straight From the Cockpit to Your Countertop, SharkNinja Releases 'F1' Movie-Themed Versions of Their Most Viral Products Lewis Hamilton Turns Another Corner In Lululemon's New Metal Vent Tech Gear — Shop His Collection Here Tiësto and Sexyy Red Link on the High-Octane ‘F1' Single ‘OMG' Hayes has also got to learn that Formula One is a team sport, not an individual one, even if you take into account that whole thing we said above about the MVP driver being the only one that matters. He will need to balance humility with experience and talent; understand that even his undeniably brilliant, eccentric tactical actions have IRL consequences; and battle not just professional setbacks but those pesky personal demons. No matter how “meetings” involving downing shots and impromptu poker games between Sonny and Joshua are co-ordinated by their peacemaking technical director, the trust between these two aces must be earned one lap at a time. If you believe that the flirty, flinty banter between Sonny and Kate earmarks the latter as Sassy Irish Romantic Interest — thankfully, Condon is way too graceful and instinctual an actor to let her character devolve into a stereotype — then you should trust your gut. (She comes off much better than the female crew member who keeps conspicuously fucking things up early on, and seemingly exists just to highlight Hayes' emotional largesse when she eventually becomes invaluable.) If you think that Tobias Menzies' corporate gladhander immediately gives off Big Judas Energy, congratulations: You know how movies work. Former engineer-turned-filmmaker Joseph Kosinski knows how to make all of this work — he was the director responsible for Top Gun: Maverick, another gigantic epic that revolved around a major star, a lot of spectacle, the star as a spectacle unto themselves, and a need for speed. And like that Tom Cruise sequel, F1 plays up the fact that authenticity, verisimilitude and a you-are-there-feeling can often make the difference between a fun afternoon at the moving pictures and an immersive adrenaline rush. Kosinski and Maverick cinematographer Claudio Miranda also pulls out the technical stops, utilizing bleeding-edge cameras and continually busting out a swerving pan that seamlessly swings from driver's viewpoint to side profile, which somehow manages to feel awe-inspiring after the 100th use. The gamble is that such first-rate second-hand thrills will make up for a 250mph ride through extremely familiar terrain. Trump Parade Turnout Swamped by Millions Who Protested at 'No Kings' Rallies Beyoncé Thanks Paul McCartney for ‘Writing One of the Best Songs Ever Made' It does, for the most part, and certainly helps distinguish F1 from becoming nothing but this generation's Days of Thunder. Both films are courtesy of super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer's ability to sell the public what they want, only louder, faster and soundtracked by NASCAR-dad–friendly jock jams. His touch is evident throughout, though that's not what makes this feel like such a giddy throwback. It's a turn that reminds you of Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster, William Holden, and, notably Steve McQueen, no stranger to movies about racing.

The clip delivers such well-calibrated vibrations that watching it on an iPhone makes it seem like you're microdosing 4DX right on the subway, or the toilet, or wherever it is you choose to enjoy the film industry's latest breakthrough in vertical integration. It's the closest thing to “pure cinema” I've ever enjoyed on a device that I primarily use for playing Marvel Snap and Googling answers to my five-year-old son's trivia questions (yes, a rhino could outrun Usain Bolt). Related Stories How Cinespia Turned a Cemetery Into L.A.'s Weekend Hot Spot Jon Hamm Says He Prefers to Play ‘Sinner' Characters: ‘Superman Can Be Kind of Boring, No Offense' That's certainly not for lack of trying. Determined to bring the same you are there verisimilitude to race cars that they did to fighter jets in “Top Gun: Maverick,” Kosinski, cinematographer Claudio Miranda, and superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer have gone to extraordinary lengths to capture the essence of F1 — lengths that include turning Brad Pitt and co-star Damson Idris into legit Grand Prix drivers, attaching hi-def micro-cameras to the frames of their vehicles as the actors whipped around the world's most famous tracks, and filming at the actual events that are depicted in the movie. “F1” is far too sincere in its crowd-pleasing ambitions to feel like a fully licensed piece of $200 million sponcon, but the movie's commitment to authenticity extends to every aspect of its titular sport, both on the track and off, as its mission to win over new converts is only outdone by its eagerness to satisfy diehard fans. Alas, Formula One has always been a testament to the difficulty of striking the right balance between power and precision, and “F1” embodies that aspect of the sport all too well. Always entertaining for how effectively it welds hyper-modern spectacle to the chassis of a classic underdog story (the latter part of that equation paving the way for Pitt's most Billy Bean-coded performance since “Moneyball”), Kosinski's film can be propulsive and exhilarating in spurts, but in working so hard to satisfy newbies and experts at the same time that it often struggles to seize on its simplest pleasures. All of these things are key parts of the mix, but for a movie so preoccupied with the difference between sound and noise (what's relevant to a racer at 200 M.P.H. vs. what they need to tune out), “F1” often fails to lock in on what really matters to its defining moments — a frustration that's reflected in everything from character arcs and backstories to shot selections and the incessant use of broadcast-like color commentaries. Your whole body will vibrate for the better part of this film's speedy 156-minute running time, and few other blockbusters this summer will be more fun to experience at a level of volume that you can't get at home, but loudness is a sad consolation prize for a movie whose own trailer didn't need any sound at all to better capture the flow state that its protagonist lives to chase. Sonny Hayes (Pitt) hasn't enjoyed the most storied of professional racing careers, but you can tell from his name alone — a perfect movie name — that he was born to be in the driver's seat, and that he doesn't belong anywhere else. The money never mattered to Sonny (he only needed enough to support his gambling addiction), and winning has always been little more than a means to an end — the shortest path to the self-actualization that he gets from being one with the road. Except, three decades of feeling like a loser seems to have taken its toll, and the first thing he tells his Daytona teammate in the film's opening scene is that he'll kill him if the guy blows their lead. This is as much insight as we'll ever get into the tao of Sonny, but it's enough to understand why he hesitates when his old racing buddy Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), now the desperate owner of the worst team on the F1 circuit, shows up with an unprecedented offer for a washed-up 60-year-old nobody: Become the not-so-new face of APXGP and save what's left of their season so that Ruben doesn't lose the company. And so, before we even get to the title card, Ehren Kruger's sleek and sturdy script has already put the story's foundation in place. All that's left is for Sonny to spar with APXGP's hotshot rookie driver (an instantly compelling Idris as cocky London native Joshua Pearce, all flash to Sonny's zen-like calm), make eyes at the sport's first female technical director (the ever-appealing Kerry Condon, squeezing worlds of personality out of a human plot device), and learn to get out of his own way as he comes to appreciate that F1 is a team sport. A few other bits take shape in the margins, including a garbled subplot involving Tobias Menzies as a techbro financier and some “Ted Lasso”-adjacent hijinks with APXGP's winsome pit crew (unrelated to “Lasso” alum Sarah Niles' performance as Joshua's mom), but “F1” is generally as straightforward and predictable as any of the nine different tracks that Sonny zooms around over the course of the film. In theory that should work to the benefit of this vintage Bruckheimer vehicle, and occasionally it does. But where “Maverick” was able to support that focus with decades of baked-in pathos, “F1” is forced to rely on the ample charms of its cast. While no one will ever get bored watching Pitt and Idris push each other's buttons, there isn't exactly a world of depth behind Sonny's leathered renegade schtick (it's a bit tiresome how many times he races outside the lines without alerting the rest of his team), just as the complexities of Joseph's arrogance are mostly hidden in the folds of Idris' performance. While the realism of the film's grand prix events is obviously second to none (silly as some of Sonny's rule-skirting gambits can be), and Kosinski has a proven track record of making speed look even cooler in the movies than it does in real life, “F1” makes the mistake of trying to reconcile the experience of driving Formula One with the experience of watching it on TV. In large part, that's a necessary evil of a film that has to explain how placing, safety cars, and tire grades work to an audience of neophytes in real-time. That's not going to make AXPGP happy.” On TV, that sort of color helps confer a narrative onto unconstructed reality. The driver's seat of an F1 car is pretty small to begin with, and Kosinski's film — which constantly defaults to a “Star Wars”-like cockpit shot in order to show us Sonny's face while proving that Pitt is actually behind the wheel — leaves viewers precious little space to engage with the film's characters on their own terms. The emotional impact is so blunted that our only choice is to surrender to the booming spectacle of it all (Hans Zimmer, take the wheel), but even that proves difficult in a film that never quite solves how to handle the sameness of a 44-lap race. Kosinski is limited to 15 camera positions on each car, few of which capture anything more than wheel-to-wheel intensity, and he compensates for that lack of choice by restlessly cutting between them. It's as if the film is trying to reflect Sonny's agitated pursuit of clarity amid the chaos (a suspicion that's strengthened by subtle changes in the editing towards the end), and every merciful retreat to a top-down angle feels like a concession to the fact that Kosinski hasn't found a more satisfying way to shoot F1 than they do on TV. Apple Original Films and Warner Bros. Studios will release “F1” in theaters on Friday, June 27.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An older boy turns his stick into a spear and plunges it into Musk's stomach, which splits open revealing a trove of fruit snacks. Moments before, the election results had been announced. The final tally was a lopsided 212 to six — not a surprise since the vast majority of voters were SpaceX employees, and their boss, who now rests on the beach as a battered piñata, had publicly pushed for incorporation. Protesters, mostly from the neighboring city of Brownsville, Texas, gathered on Boca Chica Beach to express frustration that they weren't allowed to vote in an election which will surely impact them. New housing developments with names like Lunar Estates and Starship Landing are cropping up along the highway between Brownsville and Starbase. Local businesses have taken on rocket-themed branding — you can grab hot dogs at Space Dog Station or seafood at SpaceFish Mariscos. Musk stans have erected maybe not entirely ironic shrines to their hero throughout the region — including a 10-foot-tall deformed, gold-spray-painted plaster statue that guards the highway to Boca Chica. Boca Chica, a popular local spot known as the “poor people's beach,” can now only be accessed via a highway controlled by SpaceX, and has begun frequently closing to the public to accommodate SpaceX launches. These changes have angered locals from Brownsville and the beach towns of Port Isabel and South Padre Island across the bay from the launch site, and brought opposition like this protest today. Let them go to Mars,” Rene Medrano, who owns a ranch along the highway from Brownsville to Starbase, tells the crowd. A Cameron County release claims that the site employs more than 3,400 full-time SpaceX workers — many employees live in neighboring towns, while a couple hundred live in Starbase itself — and that it has created 21,400 indirect jobs, while generating $3 billion of local infrastructure investment. It's one of the economic development debates that occur in so many local governments, only this one has been turbocharged by literal rockets shot off by the world's richest man, who doesn't seem concerned about making mistakes or enemies. Tesla Is Wrong for New York City's Retirement System What You've Suspected Is True: Billionaires Are Not Like Us Some Trump Officials Now Fear Elon's ‘Burn Book' With the incorporation vote, Musk's power and influence over the region will grow even less restrained, as he will control what is essentially a modern-day company town. The new municipality will be able to levy taxes on its residents, oversee permitting and zoning, initiate eminent domain, apply for municipal bonds, and charter a police department. It's a new development in company towns, according to Harvard researcher Brian Highsmith, who studies the impact of corporate power on local governments. “In fact the absence of those processes was in many ways the whole reason for their operation as a company town,” Highsmith says. As he steps away from his political project at the federal level, his power and influence over this rocket-fueled fiefdom on the Gulf continues to grow stronger, whether the locals like it or not. HOMER POMPA IS A 75-YEAR-OLD Vietnam Veteran, with a weathered face and wispy white goatee, who lives in an RV three miles from the SpaceX launch site with several rheumy-eyed dobermans and two wild goats. He's retired on VA benefits, and in his free time, he watches YouTube on his phone and sings raucous blues songs at local bars. But two decades later, a small city has formed around him. “You can't stop progress,” Pompa tells me as we chat in a plywood shack behind his RV, underneath three massive wooden crosses and a 20-foot-tall watchtower he's erected to view the launches. Why vote if you know who's going to win?” Not long after Pompa bought his land, Musk, then still a liberal darling who was getting glowing press for sharing his electric car patents, set his sights on the neighborhood as a test site for SpaceX rockets. While the company already had been launching rockets from government-owned facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida, this would be a test site entirely operated by SpaceX. The spot was chosen for its latitude and relative seclusion — Musk described it as “an empty sandbar” in a recent post on X —  though, as Pompa will point out, there were people living there. Importantly, state and local politicians were willing to play ball. As Musk mulled other potential testing sites, Cameron County courted him by offering the company a 10-year break on property taxes. The Texas State Legislature was even more obsequious, approving a $15 million incentive package in 2013. They also passed a law that exempted space-flight entities from liability for nuisance damages caused by launches, and granted the company an exception to a provision in the Texas constitution guaranteeing residents unrestricted beach access. With the goodies lined up, Musk announced that SpaceX had officially chosen Boca Chica as its launch site in August 2014, and Pompa watched as the neighborhood began to grow around him. By 2019, SpaceX had launched its first rocket from Boca Chica, the Starhopper —  a silo-shaped behemoth that was able to successfully lift off and land. The first launch so enthralled Pompa that it inspired him to write and perform a psychedelic blues song called “Half Moon Jam.” But after a while, the rockets became routine. Later tests have been less successful, though perhaps more exciting. The two most recent tests this year were also spectacular failures, with rockets exploding over the Caribbean, scattering debris, and forcing nearby aircraft to scramble. Work moved at a breakneck pace — buildings sprung up and were abruptly demolished when no longer needed. It's become a passion project for Musk, who keeps a house nearby, and often posts glowingly about the new city. “Starbase is so cool,” he tweeted last August. New neighbors — mostly SpaceX employees or fans — kept moving in near Pompa's land, which grew into a small subdivision. He doesn't know many of them, and they mostly keep to themselves. Pompa has never met the billionaire either, but he's developed a pretty negative opinion of him. “They can file it, and I'll wait,” Pompa tells me, his eyes darkening. There are a couple of small parks and a restaurant called the Astropub, all of which are SpaceX property closed to the general public. The neighborhood features the highest concentration of Cybertrucks I've encountered, though there are plenty of pickups that belong to local Brownsville day laborers, as well. Two-thirds of people living here are men, with an average age of about 27, according to a New York Times analysis. It's a place for transplants — most residents have no history of voting in Texas. When former SpaceX employee Joshuah Gardner applied for housing in Boca Chica Village in 2023, he noticed a strange stipulation on his lease agreement. If they were fired from SpaceX, he remembers the lease reading, the renter would be required to vacate their property in 10 days. Later that day, he says, dozens of workers were laid off. While the threat of job loss is always stressful, there's an added layer of stress here because, at Boca Chica Village, a firing also means an eviction. According to Gardner, nondisclosure agreements keep workers from discussing details of their jobs with non-SpaceX employees. “It's really hard to have a social life outside of SpaceX,” he says. “Because you can't talk to anybody about anything.” Still, before he was caught up in a 2023 purge, he loved the work. “That's something about it you can't buy,” he tells me. “You are constantly in fear of being fired, and if you have uprooted your family to come to Brownsville to take the job, you cannot afford to lose it because there is nowhere else for an engineer to work,” writes one reviewer who identifies himself as a senior mechanical engineer, in a post titled “Don't Be Fooled by YouTube.” While there aren't many residents outside, several private-security vehicles conduct a patrol along Memes Street, near Musk's house. I greet one guy wearing a black polo and a SpaceX employee badge, who is friendly, but tells me he isn't allowed to talk to me. The whole setup reminds me of what I've heard about historical company towns throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, where the threat of firing and eviction from company-owned housing kept people from speaking out about their bosses or organizing for better conditions. These towns were places where “workplace democracy and speech was almost always sharply regulated by the employer,” according to researcher Highsmith, who recently published a paper that discusses Musk's efforts to establish modern company towns in Texas. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on this article. New Mayor Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice president of Test and Launch, commissioner Jenna Petrzelka, a former SpaceX engineering manager and the wife of a SpaceX vice president, and Jordan Buss, the senior director of Environmental Health and Safety for SpaceX, have not spoken publicly about their plans for the city, and did not respond to our requests for comment. Campaign platforms weren't particularly necessary, since all three ran unopposed. ACROSS THE BAY IN THE TOWN OF PORT ISABEL, at a space-themed restaurant called the Hopper Haus, barflies discuss last night's rocket-engine test as if it had been a football game or a must-watch Sunday night TV show. Since SpaceX moved in, the community has become dramatically polarized. Retired surgical assistant and jazz singer Kim Zimmerman takes me through her house in the Long Island Village neighborhood of Port Isabel, a middle-class gated community along a canal that leads to the bay. They're about five miles from the main launch site. She and her partner Jim moved here in 2018, and have since seen their home more than double in value, as the neighborhood has become a target for SpaceX employees avoiding the company town environment in Boca Chica. She shows me the several cracks that recently appeared in her popcorn ceiling, which she believes are caused by the launches. Out here, they feel like an earthquake — “a 4.5 or more,” she says, which spooks her cats. “I just think it was built too close to civilization. What's going to happen when the big one blows up on the launchpad and rains shrapnel all over our houses?” Another neighbor shows me how he has glued down vases and photos so they aren't shaken off the wall during launches. He's not upset about SpaceX, though, in part because they allow him to make some extra cash AirBnB'ing a room to rocket fans. While Zimmerman is troubled by the launches, Doug Kinne, who lives down the street, sees them as a pretty unambiguous good. The 72-year-old retired ski instructor and restaurant owner's house is full of SpaceX-themed collectibles — a shovel from the Starbase groundbreaking, a model Cybertruck, and pieces of rocket that washed up in the bay. His place is the closest in Port Isabel to the launch site, and he gets a great view from his balcony, where he hosts watch parties for neighbors and traveling space enthusiasts. “I mean, you're at the future,” he says. “It's an amazing thing.” His late wife, who passed away in 2022, was an even bigger rocket fan than him, and her ashes rest in a three-foot-tall rocket-shaped urn. Kinne has noticed cracks in his ceiling as well, but he doesn't believe they could have come as a result of the launches. Hurricanes, he thinks, are the more likely culprit. There seems to be a correlation between how people feel about Musk's recent actions in the Trump administration and how they feel about the rocket launches. Before his abrupt fallout with the president, Musk pursued an aggressive cost-cutting regime as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, purging federal employees and terminating government contracts — while leaving his own contracts, including those funding much of the work at SpaceX, untouched. Some anti-SpaceX protesters on the beach cited examples of how they had been personally harmed by Elon's DOGE'ing, including one who had been put on leave from her job at a Palo Alto Battlefield National Park earlier this year. “Will the formation of Starbase be good for me? I don't know the answer to that yet,” Reynolds tells me. As SpaceX's expansion into the region has brought jobs and investment for some locals, it has also brought economic benefits to the pocketbooks of local politicians. A 2024 Reuters investigation found that in 2014, as he was accumulating his incentive package, Musk had showered state and local politicians from both parties with $150,000. One local politician bought and sold land around Starbase for a profit. More recently, as the SpaceX venture has spurred several environmental and public access lawsuits, Musk has set his sights on the Texas courts. Notably, the PAC backed campaigns of Republican judges in the 13th Circuit Appellate Court, which covers Cameron County, and which had ruled against SpaceX in a case about public access to the Boca Chica beach in early 2024. Musk made another $1 million donation last year to Texans for Lawsuit Reform PAC, which funds pro-business conservative candidates in legislative and judicial races. Two of Texans for Lawsuit Reform PAC's largest beneficiaries at the legislature were Rep. Janie Lopez and Sen. Adam Hinojosa, who received $854,849 and $700,000 from the PAC, respectively. (Lopez and Hinojosa did not respond to requests for comment.) The latter bill was a step too far even for generally pro-SpaceX Judge Eddie Treviño Jr., Cameron County's top executive, who spoke out against the move this March. “We think that has potential to create conflict going forward that we don't think is absolutely needed or necessary,” Treviño told local news. After briefly appearing dead amid public pressure, the beach-access measure was revived in an amendment to an unrelated bill, and was passed by the legislature on June 1. ON MAY 27, THE ROADS TO BOCA CHICA BEACH CLOSED for a launch. In Port Isabel, Doug Kinne gathered a group of rocket enthusiasts on his front porch, while others in the neighborhood braced for impact. On the live feed, SpaceX engineers began a countdown from 40. But, at the edge of space, things started to go wrong. The rocket spiraled wildly out of control, tumbling back toward Earth. Musk stepped down from his role at DOGE on May 28, and quickly began criticizing Trump's flagship “Big Beautiful Bill” in a series of tweets on X. Launches will be happening much more frequently after the FAA granted approval to increase the number of annual launches from 5 to 25 annually. Two days after the launch, Starbase held its first public meeting, where the town swore in city leaders, appointed a new city administrator and declared May 29th “Starbase Day.” The following day, they approved a request for a $1.5 million loan from SpaceX. That day, neighbors in Boca Chica Village received notices describing plans for a new Starbase zoning regime, which would establish what land in specific areas of Starbase can be used for, and which included a troubling line: Trump Parade Turnout Swamped by Millions Who Protested at 'No Kings' Rallies Trump's Military Birthday Parade Was a Gross Failure Beyoncé Thanks Paul McCartney for ‘Writing One of the Best Songs Ever Made' A meeting to discuss is set for June 23, though residents are yet to see the final proposal, which would define exactly which properties would be affected by the zoning changes. “These guys have deep pockets,” he says, “and can make your life pretty miserable.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to The New York Times, prosecutors arrested and charged club owner Antonio Espaillat on June 12 after a club employee provided authorities with evidence showing he'd warned the club's owners that they should cancel that night's show because of the poor condition of the club's roof. The deadly incident occurred during a show by merengue singer Rubby Pérez at the beloved music venue that was celebrating its 50th anniversary. In addition to killing many fans, the collapse also took the lives of Pérez's saxophone player, as well as former Major League Baseball players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera and Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northwestern province of Montecristi whose brother is seven-time MLB All-Star Nelson Cruz. The Times described Espaillat as a wealthy businessman whose family also owns a chain of radio stations; Espaillat's sister, who helped manage the club, was also charged with involuntary homicide. The attorney general's office said in a statement that the siblings “demonstrated immense irresponsibility and negligence by failing to do what was necessary to ensure that the Jet Set Club's roof was adequately and expertly repaired.” The club was owned by Espaillat and his mother and, the Times reported, its roof had undergone years of “repeated repairs.” The unnamed employee's lawyer said his client had turned their phone over to investigators, containing evidence of conversations in which “he gave an account of the situation at the nightclub in which he expressed his fears and apprehensions, and his suggestion that the event be suspended. The Times reported that a number of lawsuits have been filed over the incident and that an engineering report reviewing the collapse was completed last week, but that its contents have not yet been made public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Beatles legend was apparently not pleased that the group sacked his son not once, but twice. In a new Rolling Stone interview posted on Monday (June 16) the veteran session and touring drummer who was fired, rehired and then fired once more by The Who in a head-spinning span of several weeks earlier this year opened up about his current relationship with the band and how his dad feels about the tabloid tussle. Asked what his father, former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr, thought of the bizarre back-and-forth, Starkey said, “He [Ringo] said, ‘I've never liked the way that little man runs that band,'” in seeming reference to The Who singer Roger Daltrey. After The Who “made a collective decision” to part ways with Starkey in April after his nearly 30 years behind the kit, guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend relented a few days later and rescinded the firing, saying Starkey was “not being asked” to step down from his position. Then, a month later, Townshend took it all back and said after many years working together “the time has come for a change.” A week later, Starkey claimed that he hadn't been “fired” from the band, but had “‘retired' to work [on] my own projects.” It has all been a bit hard to keep up with, even for Starkey, who revealed to RS that even after all the firings and re-hirings he still has no idea where he stands. “I spoke to Roger last week,” Starkey told the magazine. “He said, ‘Don't take your drums out of the warehouse, we might be calling you.' I've been fired more times than [late Who drummer] Keith Moon in ten days.” It's all a bit unclear at this point, especially since The Who recently announced that Scott Devours, a veteran of Daltrey's solo band, will join them on their upcoming farewell tour. In the interview, Starkey once again noted that he had to sit out Oasis‘ eagerly anticipated reunion shows this summer because of his gig in The Who. And last time they asked me, I was in the Who, and it got a bit weird,” he said of whether he'd hoped Oasis' Liam and Noel Gallagher would invite him back into the fold of the Britpop band he kept time for from 2004-2008. “But this time, I talked to them both. I did tell them both on text, ‘Why the f–k aren't I in your band, man, helping make it the greatest rock band in the world again?” Frankly, Starkey said being in the Who sometimes kept him off-kilter. As an example, he described the rehearsals for the Royal Albert Hall gigs in March at which Daltrey apparently took issue with his playing, reportedly complaining from the stage that Starkey's loud drumming was throwing his vocals off. These are the most crazy… you've got an abstract, conceptualist artist who thinks the band is an art installation. And then you've got another guy who is a street fighter. It's all very weird,” he said, respectively, of Townshend and Daltrey. Pete has taken so much on himself. He'll lock himself away for two years, come away with Quadrophenia, and go, ‘You guys can just play on top.' Offstage it can be a little awkward after those 15 minutes. And, for the record, Starkey claimed that it was Daltrey who came in “four bars early” during the Royal Albert Hall shows, after which the drummer sent the singer an e-mail, writing, “I watched you on TV last night, you were off.” But he came in four bars early. And he just asked for the drums to be turned up, and he couldn't hear the piano,” Starkey said of Daltrey. They've not changed one key since the start of conceptual art as rock & roll. He blamed it on the drums being too loud, and then it got made into this huge social media thing. There was no argument in the dressing room.” Starkey said he was fired two weeks later for dropping “two beats,” though he noted, “I've watched that film three times. Weirder s–t than this has gone down,” he said. “I've heard them say weirder s–t than this. But would he come back if they re-re-rehired him? “The Who, you just don't know what's going to happen. If you think something is going to happen, the opposite happens. If you second guess Pete, he will play the opposite.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tamara Tunie, who plays Anita Dupree on “Beyond the Gates”, recently discussed her reaction to the dramatic reveal of her character's new storyline. A post shared by Beyond the Gates (@beyondthegatescbs) In a June 5 interview with TV Insider, Tunie revealed her reaction to Anita's secrets coming to light in the recent episodes of “Beyond The Gates”. We've been talking about this from the beginning,” Tunie said. On “Beyond The Gates”, viewers were shocked to discover that Anita's group, “The Articulettes”, once had another member: Barbara, who was also responsible for creating the group. In the June 3 episode, Anita read a letter she had kept from Barbara detailing the former member's feelings of hurt and betrayal after their falling out. And I can't take it no more. So, if you're reading this, sista, I've left this world for what I hope is a better place. “That was really emotional,” she said, “When I read the script, I cried, and then I didn't look at it until the night before we were shooting it, so that any emotion that might bubble up would be saved for the filming.” Fans were equally moved by the shocking revelation of Anita's past. Tunie went on to explain that she now feels as though a weight has been lifted off her character. While Tamara Tunie originated the character Anita Dupree, this is not her first time on a daytime drama. Tunie made her daytime debut as Jessica Griffin on “As the World Turns”, a role she played on and off for over 20 years. In addition to her work in soaps, the actress and director is known for her portrayal of Dr. Melinda Warner on “Law & Order: SVU” and “Law & Order: Organized Crime”. What did you think of Anita's shocking reveal? How do you think the rest of the Duprees will respond when they find out?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meghan Markle celebrated Father's Day with a rare glimpse into her private family life. On Sunday, June 15, the Duchess of Sussex shared a heartfelt Instagram video tribute to Prince Harry featuring never-before-seen footage of him with their two children, 6-year-old Prince Archie and 4-year-old Princess Lilibet. Set to Jason Mraz's song “Have It All,” the video captures moments of Harry laughing with his kids, following Archie on a bike ride, and holding both children during their younger years. The tribute marked one of Meghan's most personal posts since returning to social media earlier this year. The post quickly drew attention, offering a rare look at the family's life in Montecito, California, where Harry and Meghan have lived since stepping back from their royal roles in 2020. Both children share their father's red hair, which Harry has credited to his late mother's family. “The Spencer gene is very, very strong,” Harry said during a 2023 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” He added, “I actually really, genuinely thought at the beginning of my relationship [with Meghan] that should this go the distance and we have kids, that there's no way the ginger gene will stand up to my wife's genes, but I was wrong! “I would love reconciliation with my family,” he continued. “There's no point in continuing to fight anymore. I don't know how much longer my father has.” As Meghan continues to use her Instagram handle @meghan to spotlight personal moments and professional projects, the Father's Day tribute stood out for its emotional tone and family-first focus.</p>
