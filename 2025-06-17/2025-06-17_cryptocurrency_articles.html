Bitcoin was down by nearly 4% over the past 24 hours as President Donald Trump suggested in a social media post that the U.S. might assassinate Iran's supreme leader, escalating already inflamed tensions in the Middle East.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $103,630, its lowest level in five days, according to market data provider CoinGecko, though it has ticked back up above $104,000 as of this writing. BTC started edging down last Thursday as Iran and Israel began exchanging missile attacks.

Ethereum was recently changing hands at about $2,470, down nearly 6.5% over the past 24 hours. Smart contract platforms Solana and Cardano were both off about 7%, while the leading meme coin Dogecoin had dropped 6.7%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Traditional DevOps tools won't be able to meet the demands of Web3. Not too long ago, blockchain was a fringe technology, but now it is firmly in the mainstream, powering Web3 and actively reshaping industries like finance and logistics. For developers, blockchain's explosive growth brings both opportunities and challenges, as traditional tools simply can't keep up. It's an exciting frontier where blockchain, cryptocurrency and open-source collaboration converge to drive a new level of transformation. In the transition from Web2 to Web3, where decentralization rules, developers are no longer just building apps but crafting ecosystems. This responsibility comes with complex requirements that demand new solutions, however. Tools created specifically for blockchain enable developers to keep pace with the demands of these decentralized systems. Blockchain operates on fundamentally different principles from centralized systems because it is distributed, immutable and governed by consensus. These attributes introduce technical challenges that standard development tools weren't designed to handle. When bottlenecks arise, traditional tools like legacy databases or performance monitoring solutions often struggle to address them. These new tools must also be able to debug complex smart contracts. Unlike traditional apps, smart contract failures can have irreversible consequences, including locked funds or compromised functionality. Debugging tools for blockchain must be built to handle the unique complexities of decentralized protocols. Additionally, Web3 tools must be equipped to handle security risks across multiple chains. Developers need blockchain-native security tools that can handle everything from real-time threat detection to cryptographic auditing. Crypto-native DevOps is a new field that refers to developing operational practices and tools specifically for the challenges in blockchain ecosystems. Blockchain-specific tools are not just upgrades from traditional systems but represent entirely new approaches to development that help developers navigate the intricate nature of decentralized architectures and unlock the true potential of Web3. In other words, next-gen DevOps approaches tailored for blockchain make it easy to deploy, scale, and manage decentralized applications (dApps). Instead of spending weeks setting up servers, syncing blockchains, and dealing with complicated infrastructure, developers can plug into Moralis and instantly launch their decentralized applications. It provides developers with all the tools to build quickly and scale easily, so they can use it to manage users, wallets, and even NFTs without getting bogged down in technical setup. Distributed systems can experience fluctuations in transaction speeds, consensus mechanisms and node reliability. Blockchain-specific tools equipped with real-time analytics empower developers to maintain performance and anticipate issues before they escalate. Tenderly is an example of a tool for real-time analytics and performance monitoring. It helps them spot issues like failing transactions, high gas usage or unusual user behavior before they become expensive problems. For developers and founders, it's like having a 24/seven blockchain performance assistant — helping them sleep better at night. Blockchain-native tools simplify cross-chain API integrations, enabling developers to navigate the differences between platforms like Ethereum, Solana and Polkadot. As a result, users can interact with their dApp using assets and data from multiple blockchains without even realizing it. For businesses, this means more reach, less friction, and one unified experience across the fragmented blockchain world. They allow developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts without worrying about introducing catastrophic bugs. Many blockchain suites integrate testing environments that simulate real-world deployment scenarios to ensure smooth execution. Foundry is an example of a developer toolkit that helps developers write smart contracts in Ethereum's programming language, Solidity. Best of all, it makes the process remarkably safe and efficient. It's like a sandbox where developers can stress-test their code, simulate edge cases and catch bugs before anything goes live. In traditional DevOps environments, collaboration can sometimes be hindered by proprietary constraints or organizational silos. Cryptocurrency incentivizes many DevOps professionals for their contributions to open-source projects. Tokens and smart contracts can dynamically reassign rewards based on contribution metrics, enabling a self-regulating system that continuously drives open-source collaboration forward.

It remains tied to the broader vision of enabling decentralized systems that empower individuals and businesses. With tools purpose-built for these tasks, developers are no longer hindered by the constraints of traditional systems. Instead, they're free to innovate, experiment and ultimately redefine what's possible. In the near future, decentralization will reshape everything from our data sharing to trust mechanisms.</p>

But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Odds of U.S. military action against Iran before July have soared to 65% on Polymarket. “The sudden and severe escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict introduced a significant geopolitical risk premium, prompting an immediate flight from risk assets across the board, to which crypto has not proven immune,” said Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, Chief Investment Officer at XBTO. “The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard; any credible de-escalation in the Middle East could serve as a significant risk-on catalyst, while a further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets,” he added. “Should Israeli military actions impact Iran's oil production, a spike in oil prices could follow, fueling renewed inflationary pressures,” Greco said.

Ether's lackluster price movement has prompted some to proclaim Ethereum's end. “Ethereum died,” wrote Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin booster, on X. “Bitcoin has died many times… Ethereum has died several times,” Joseph Lubin, CEO of the blockchain technology firm Consensys and cofounder of Ethereum, told Fortune. “When there are challenges, we learn from them.” Those challenges have been present since 2013, when a wiry 19-year-old from Canada named Vitalik Buterin had an idea for a new type of computer. Fearing that Big Tech firms had an unhealthy monopoly over cloud computing that could stifle developers, Buterin looked to blockchains instead. He and others came up with Ethereum—a decentralized blockchain-based computing platform where programmers' code was immune to the whims of corporate behemoths. Developers soon flocked to Ethereum, but the increase in activity brought a rise in “gas fees.” Every time users send one another assets on Ethereum, they need to pay with cryptocurrency—in the same way Amazon requires users to pay dollars to use its cloud computing network. These L2s—including Arbitrum, Optmism, and Polygon—package user data into one bundle and post that onto Ethereum, rather than ask the blockchain to process each transaction individually. If gas fees are any indication, that strategy has worked. Since a peak in mid-2020, transaction costs have plummeted more than 99% on Ethereum, according to data from Glassnode. But Kyle Samani, managing partner at crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital, believes this approach has made the core network of Ethereum less valuable. “It's my fundamental view that a network is not sustainable or valuable without direct user activity,” he told Fortune. “Ethereum is the amazing world computer,” he told Fortune. “I don't think it can or should try to be all things, all people, and, especially, I don't think Ethereum should also try to be the best, most deflationary cryptocurrency.” Ethereum's upgrades, not any explicit work to buoy Ether's price, should prompt a rise in demand for the cryptocurrency, said Brody. And that's what developers are working on, said Danny Ryan and Vivek Raman, cofounders of the Ethereum advocacy group Ethrealize—one of many wings of a robust technical and cultural community based around the blockchain that convenes at large annual get-togethers like ETHDenver in Colorado. Programmers are now optimizing the speed of the layer 1 network, not just its ecosystem of layer 2 chains, say Ryan and Raman. “I don't think that we should pretend like the asset doesn't need to be valuable,” added Danny Ryan. His cofounder Raman even equated Ethereum to “digital oil.” “When you ask institutions, when we go have our meetings and say, ‘Which is a civilizational infrastructure, which is the global, neutral infrastructure that you can actually deploy real assets with real trust? “If we do our job, and we become the first place for everybody to do business,” said Brody, “then the asset price is just something that takes care of itself.” FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Throughout the last 10 years, Bitcoin's price has remained resilient to war and armed conflict. As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, Bitcoin's (BTC) price has remained stable. Analysts like André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise's ETP platform ETC Group, have argued that Bitcoin's price can suffer in the days following the outbreak of a conflict. Still, as Mithil Thakore, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin L2 liquidity protocol Velar, previously told Cointelegraph, “Over the longer term, geopolitical conflicts raise the prospects of higher inflation rates globally due to factors like increased fiscal spending, looser monetary policy, supply-chain disruptions and commodity price spikes, which should all benefit Bitcoin.” Here's a look at a few instances where Bitcoin's price has reacted, or not reacted, to large-scale armed conflict in the world: Crypto analyst Za said, “Bitcoin does not seem concerned about the Israel and Iran conflict (yet).” Related: Bitcoin dips amid reports Trump has called advisers to situation room Perhaps the most famous Bitcoin bull, Michael Saylor, is also unfazed. On June 16, his firm, Strategy, acquired 10,001 BTC for $1 billion. On April 1, 2024, Israel struck an Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, killing several senior officials. After both dates, the price of Bitcoin saw a brief downward movement, with BTC losing over 8% just after the April 13 retaliation. Still, as markets became accustomed to the new norm, so did Bitcoin, and it continued moving upward. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas forces from Gaza struck targets inside Israel, killing over 1,000 Israelis and triggering a war and humanitarian crisis that is still ongoing. Blockchain forensic firm Elliptic said there was “no evidence” to support claims of Hamas raising funds in crypto. Global financial markets were immediately affected, with economies closest to Ukraine suffering the worst. Countering this trend, Bitcoin's price spiked upward and was up 16% just five days after the invasion. Exchanges within Russia and Ukraine saw crypto trading at eye-watering premiums as people fleeing abroad sought to skirt currency controls with cryptocurrency. One week after the start of the war, Ukraine had received over $70 million in cryptocurrency donations, mostly in Ether (ETH). While crypto may serve as a risk-off asset during times of conflict in some parts of the world, its price movements appear to ignore internal conflicts outside of those affecting traditional markets in Europe, the Middle East and North America. In November 2020, war broke out in the Tigray region of Ethiopia after years of tension between the left-wing ethno-nationalist Tigray People's Liberation Front and the federal governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia. The war, which left hundreds of thousands dead and millions internally displaced, was characterized by the Catholic Near East Welfare Association as underreported. A month later, Bitcoin's price would reach its then-all-time high of $69,000. Financial markets in countries closer to a conflict zone will see more volatility and losses. Overall crypto adoption is highest in developing nations, with India, Nigeria and Indonesia leading the pack, according to Chainalysis' 2024 Global Adoption Index. Related: BlackRock drives $412M Bitcoin ETF inflows amid Israel-Iran conflict Bitcoin, by comparison, is finding increasingly concentrated ownership among Western institutions and world governments. The biggest holders are now ETF issuers like BlackRock, regulated crypto exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase and even the US government. In 2013, Bitcoin went on what some consider its first major bull run. During this time, crypto was still in a niche industry, and miners could use the graphics card on their gaming computers to mine Bitcoin. Institutional involvement was next to nonexistent, and many regarded crypto as “magic internet money” suited only for accommodating illicit activity online. While the onset of both conflicts affected stock markets, both regionally and farther afield, there was no discussion in crypto media, such as it existed at the time, of the wars' effect on Bitcoin's price. Now, with increasing institutional adoption, a crypto-friendly American government and international trade conferences drawing in thousands, Bitcoin's price may be more influenced by the negative forces armed conflict puts on markets. Almost all of the above conflicts, which saw Bitcoin prices quickly rebound, occurred before widespread institutional adoption. BTC has more correlation to traditional financial markets than it did previously. Still, analysts are cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin in the current climate. QCP stated in a June 16 note that escalation could see oil prices spike, particularly an “Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz,” with potential US involvement disrupting global risk assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Which altcoin delivers the right mix of utility, upside, and long-term scalability in today's crypto market? The first half of 2025 has exposed a clear separation between speculation-driven assets and those building real-world frameworks. Maker continues stabilizing decentralized finance through DAI, and Bitcoin Cash is re-emerging with renewed retail relevance. With renewed buying interest and functional narratives defining the altcoin market, buyers are no longer just chasing hype—they're focusing on real value. Across the board, these four tokens – Qubetics ($TICS), Quant ($QNT), Maker ($MKR), and Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) – have demonstrated a combination of resilience, technical progress, and growing adoption. Each protocol addresses a specific segment of the blockchain space: Qubetics, currently priced at $0.3370, is redefining interoperability and utility through its cross-chain infrastructure and enterprise-grade tools; Quant is enabling institutional-grade interoperability across private and public blockchains; Maker remains the backbone of DeFi stability with DAI; and Bitcoin Cash continues to offer peer-to-peer payment functionality with real-world traction. Central to its framework is QubeQode, a powerful no-code/low-code integrated development environment (IDE) designed for fast-track deployment of dApps. Whether onboarding business solutions, cross-chain smart contracts, or consumer-grade dApps, QubeQode makes it simpler for non-technical users to engage with decentralized architecture. The Qubetics IDE eliminates the traditional barriers of Web3 development—by letting applications tap into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other Layer-1 networks without needing to bridge or rewrite base-level code. This seamless interoperability, combined with intuitive tooling, positions Qubetics among the best altcoins to buy now. As the demand for accessible blockchain solutions grows, platforms like Qubetics—offering built-in scalability, multichain compatibility, and user-friendly development interfaces – are gaining significant traction. By removing friction from dApp creation and enabling deployment across major networks from a single interface, Qubetics empowers businesses, creators, and institutions to adopt blockchain faster. This practical utility, paired with its performance-first architecture, firmly anchors Qubetics as one of the best altcoins to buy now for long-term utility and ecosystem expansion. With the current $TICS token priced at $0.3370, Qubetics is currently in its final crypto presale phase, having raised over $18 million and sold more than 515 million tokens across 28,000 holders. That's what makes it the best altcoin to buy now for high-utility buyers. From banking to supply chain logistics, Quant is facilitating seamless integration between Web2 institutions and decentralized Web3 environments. With governments and financial institutions exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), Overledger has positioned Quant to become an infrastructure backbone in regulated crypto environments. Enterprise clients are now piloting cross-chain settlements, KYC-compliant identity validation systems, and asset transfers between blockchains using Quant. Unlike other projects, its ecosystem isn't just open-source hobbyism -it's targeted at real contracts and institutions with compliance mandates. It attracts backers looking for stability, backed by a clear business case and seasoned leadership. That alone makes it stand out among many speculative tokens. Maker is the decentralized autonomous organisation (DAO) behind DAI, a stablecoin widely used in DeFi lending, borrowing, and liquidity strategies. It's a critical building block of Ethereum-based DeFi and is known for its fully collateralized design. What makes Maker powerful in 2025 is its ability to manage DAI's peg during volatile market cycles while expanding integrations across chains. Its recent upgrade includes enhanced vault strategies, synthetic yield modules, and integration with liquid staking derivatives, allowing users to collateralize staked assets for minting DAI. That feature alone has driven protocol TVL upwards, with many buyers recognising $MKR as more than governance, it's a yield-generating engine. With centralized stablecoins facing rising scrutiny, DAI's decentralized mechanics could pull increased attention, adding tailwinds to $MKR's valuation. As the DeFi backbone stabilizing value flow, it remains the best altcoin to buy now for backers looking to participate in decentralized economies through a mature, functional protocol. Bitcoin Cash has seen a resurgence due to its renewed focus on peer-to-peer payments and point-of-sale integrations. What's changed is adoption: retail merchants, online platforms, and e-commerce processors are giving BCH a second look. Multiple point-of-sale networks in emerging markets are re-integrating Bitcoin Cash for instant micro-transactions. With rising fees on Ethereum and Bitcoin networks, BCH provides a cost-effective alternative, especially for daily payments under $50. This kind of real-world usage is what drives BCH's recent relevance. Its cyclical pattern has broken slightly with this recent surge, suggesting increasing demand and transaction volume on-chain. Bitcoin Cash makes peer-to-peer crypto work in the real world. With retail applications scaling, it stands out as a best altcoin to buy now based on adoption—not just price movement. As 2025 progresses, the market is shifting decisively toward functionality over flash. Qubetics stands out with its multi-layered development stack, real-time cross-chain capabilities, and developer-first toolkit—positioning it as a frontrunner among the best altcoin to buy now. Quant continues to serve as a trusted bridge between enterprise systems and blockchain architecture. Maker reinforces its role as DeFi's backbone through stablecoin stability and protocol-level yield generation. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash is making crypto payments viable again with growing retail traction. For backers seeking real returns in a maturing digital asset environment, these projects aren't just well-positioned—they're purpose-built. Whether it's onboarding global payments, powering institutional-grade infrastructure, or creating the rails for decentralized finance, each one represents a high-utility, long-term value play. Qubetics simplifies blockchain development with tools like QubeQode and a full IDE for no-code/low-code dApp creation. Quant operates at an institutional level, offering regulated, secure interoperability for banks, governments, and enterprises. Maker maintains DAI's stability and now supports yield-generating strategies with liquid staking assets. Bitcoin Cash is gaining traction in emerging markets due to low transaction fees and fast settlements for retail payments.

The United Kingdom's top data privacy regulator on Tuesday fined the embattled personal genomics company 23andMe more than $3 million over allegedly poor cybersecurity practices and a slow response to a devastating 2023 data breach.

A 23andMe spokesperson, who did not directly address the regulator's fine, said that “by the end of 2024, 23andMe had implemented multiple steps to increase security to protect individual accounts and information.” Later that month, the hacker again tried to trigger profile transfers in 400 separate accounts, they said. 23andMe probed the incident at that point but did not realize it was part of a much bigger and long-running hack, the regulator claimed. By September, the hacker intensified the credential stuffing scheme, the regulator said, but 23andMe did not launch a full investigation until October 2023, when one of its employees became aware that stolen company data was being peddled on Reddit. The hacker obtained personal data belonging to nearly 156,000 U.K. residents, and in some cases family trees and health conditions were exposed, the regulator said. “As one of those impacted told us: once this information is out there, it cannot be changed or reissued like a password or credit card number,” U.K. Information Commissioner John Edwards said in a statement. is a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American banking giant JPMorgan has just filed a mysterious trademark application named “JPMD” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This initiative fuels speculation about a potential new stablecoin. This file precisely describes “trading, exchange, transfer, and payment services of digital assets” issued on blockchains. This hypothesis makes even more sense since the bank already has solid expertise in this area with its JPM Coin, used for institutional settlements. This initiative fits perfectly with JP Morgan's blockchain strategy, embodied by its Kinexys platform (formerly Onyx). Launched in 2020, this blockchain unit has already processed more than $2 billion in daily transaction volumes, establishing JP Morgan as one of the pioneers of distributed ledger technology among major American financial institutions. The timing of this trademark filing is no coincidence. This shift can be explained by the tangible advantages these digital assets offer: reduced transaction costs, faster cross-border payments, and simplified cash flows on a global scale. The market continues to grow at an impressive rate. Faced with this massive adoption, even the most cautious institutions have no choice but to adjust. The potential emergence of JPMD therefore appears as a logical step: a strategic lever to support this new demand while consolidating its position in an increasingly competitive digital ecosystem. While companies like Amazon and Walmart are actively exploring their own stablecoin solutions, JP Morgan intends to maintain its lead in this profound transformation of monetary infrastructures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) briefly crossed above $2,600 on Monday following a switch to accumulation in the top altcoin's exchange reserve and $583 million in inflows into ETH investment products last week. Ethereum resumed bullish action on Monday after its exchange reserve flipped back to a downtrend, declining from 18.72 million ETH on Saturday to an all-time low of 18.57 million ETH over the past 24 hours. As the total value of exchange reserves drops, it indicates rising buying pressure. During the period, ETH's total value staked also grew by 80K ETH, signifying a stronger bullish sentiment among investors, according to data from Beaconcha.in. The shift toward accumulation in ETH follows a strong week of institutional buying pressure, which pushed net inflows in global Ethereum products to $583 million last week, according to CoinShares data. The buying pressure was spearheaded by $528.12 million inflows into US spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), their highest weekly performance since December 2024. "Ethereum's recovery is being supported by the 'digital oil' narrative and ecosystem fundamentals, like the Pectra upgrade and increased stablecoin activity, with almost 50% of all stablecoins on the Ethereum network," said Tracy Jin, COO of crypto exchange MEXC. "It's also good to see that the rules around staking and new stablecoin-related ETFs are coming into effect, which is helping to boost investor confidence," she added. ETH held support near $2,500 through the weekend and tested the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as dynamic resistance before experiencing a rejection. A successful crossover above in both indicators will strengthen the bullish momentum. Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
