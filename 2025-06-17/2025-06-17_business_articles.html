JPMorgan Chase & Co. will launch a pilot for a token called JPMD that represents dollar deposits at the world's biggest bank, as financial institutions deepen their push into the digital-asset sector.

In a transaction expected to take place within days, JPMorgan will move a fixed amount worth of JPMD from the bank's digital wallet to the biggest US crypto exchange, Coinbase Global Inc., Naveen Mallela, global co-head of the bank's blockchain division Kinexys by JPMorgan, said in an interview. </p>

Israel-Iran War:

A crater at the impact site of an Iranian missile at a bus depot in Herzliya, Israel, on June 17.

President Donald Trump was meeting with his national security team in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the escalating Middle East conflict, according to people familiar with the matter, fueling fresh speculation that the US is on the verge of joining Israel's attack on Iran. 

Before gathering his advisers in the White House Situation Room, Trump posted a demand for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” and warned of a possible strike against the country's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump posted on social media.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India's aviation safety watchdog said on Tuesday surveillance conducted on Air India's Boeing fleet did not reveal any major safety concerns, days after one of its jets crashed, killing at least 271 people. "The aircraft and associated maintenance systems were found to be compliant with existing safety standards," the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said in a statement. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner bound for London with 242 people on board crashed seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday hitting nearby buildings. All but one passenger on board was killed, along with about 30 people on the ground. The DGCA also said 24 of Air India's 33 Boeing 787 aircraft had completed an "enhanced safety inspection" it had ordered the airline to carry out. The regulator, in a meeting with senior officials of Air India, raised concerns about recent maintenance-related issues reported by the airline. It advised the carrier to "strictly adhere to regulations," strengthen coordination across its businesses and ensure availability of adequate spares to mitigate passenger delays, it added. The DGCA had met senior officials of Air India and Air India Express to review their operations amid increasing flight volumes. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new savings account for children with a one-time deposit of $1,000 from the federal government remained in the U.S. Senate's version of President Donald Trump's budget bill. Under the proposal, so-called "Trump accounts," a type of tax-advantaged saving accounts, would be available to all children under the age of eight years old who are U.S. citizens. If the bill passes as drafted, parents will be able to contribute up to $5,000 a year and the balance will be invested in a diversified fund that tracks a U.S.-stock index. This part of the Senate Republicans' version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was largely unchanged from the House plan advanced in May. More from Personal Finance:'SALT' deduction in limbo as Senate Republicans unveil tax planFed is likely to hold rates steady this week. What it means for youThe economic cost of Trump, Harvard battle over student visas Earnings grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are taxed as long-term capital gains. Under both the House and Senate versions of the bill, withdrawals could begin at age 18, at which point account holders can tap up to half of the funds for education expenses or credentials, the down payment on a first home or as capital to start a small business. At 25, account holders can use the full balance for expenses that fall under those same guidelines and at 30, they can use the money for any reason. Distributions taken for qualified purposes are taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate, while distributions for any other purpose are taxed as ordinary income. To be eligible to receive the initial seed money, a child must be a U.S. citizen at birth and both parents must have Social Security numbers. If a parent or guardian does not open an account, the Secretary of Treasury will establish an account on the child's behalf. The White House and Republican lawmakers have said these accounts will introduce more Americans to wealth-building opportunities and the benefits of compound growth. But some experts say the Trump accounts are also overly complicated, making it harder to reach lower-income families. Universal savings accounts, with fewer strings attached, would be a simpler alternative proposal at a lower price tag, according to Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a public policy think tank. "I'm disappointed the Senate did not take the opportunity to improve these accounts," Michel said. Still, "provisions that remain in both the House and Senate text, we should expect them to become law, and this provision fits that criteria." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One provision in Republicans' "big beautiful" bill would narrow the relief options for struggling student loan borrowers. Those deferments allow federal student loan borrowers to pause their monthly bills during periods of joblessness or other financial setbacks, often without interest accruing on their debt. Senate lawmakers are preparing to debate the massive tax and spending package. More from Personal Finance:Here's the inflation breakdown for May 2025What's happening with unemployed Americans — in five chartsThe economic cost of Trump, Harvard battle over student visas Nixing the deferments could have major consequences, said Abby Shafroth, director of the National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. "I'm concerned this is going to lead more people to default on their student loans when they encounter a job loss, surprise medical expense or other economic hardship," Shafroth said. Under the Senate Republicans' proposal, student loans received on or after July 1, 2026 would no longer qualify for the unemployment deferment or economic hardship deferment. The House plan does away with both deferments a year earlier, on July 1, 2025. The unemployment deferment is typically available to student loan borrowers who are seeking but unable to find full-time employment or are eligible for jobless benefits, among other requirements, according to the National Consumer Law Center. The absence of the relief "means that for someone who lost their job and is struggling to keep their head above water, the government will demand monthly payments on student loans," Shafroth said. The bill comes as the share of entry-level employees who report feeling positive about their employers' business prospects dropped to around 43% in May, a record low, according to a recent report by Glassdoor. The economic hardship deferment, meanwhile, is generally available to student loan borrowers who receive public assistance, earn below a certain income threshold or work in the Peace Corps. The total time a borrower can spend in an economic hardship deferment is also three years. Persis Yu, deputy executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, agreed. "The ability of borrowers to pause payments and interest on subsidized loans during financial shocks and hardship is a critical benefit of the federal loan program," Yu said. Around 150,000 federal student loan holders were enrolled in the unemployment deferment in the second quarter of 2025, while around 70,000 borrowers had qualified for an economic hardship deferment, according to data by the U.S. Department of Education. The absence of the deferments will push more federal student loan borrowers into a forbearance, experts say, during which interest continues to climb on their debt and borrowers often resume repayment with a larger bill. Republicans say doing away with the payment pauses will encourage borrowers to enroll in repayment plan they can afford. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said in a statement on June 10, that his party's proposals would stop requiring that taxpayers who didn't go to college foot the loan payments for those with degrees. Cassidy said the higher education legislation, which also stretches out student loan repayment timelines, would save taxpayers at least $300 billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The probability of a recession in the next year has fallen to 38%, down from 53% in May, but above the 23% level of January before President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy was unveiled. Similarly, gross domestic product is now expected to grow 1.13% on average, up from 0.8% in the prior survey, but less than half the January expectation. Respondents say there remains a considerable lack of clarity with 71% reporting they are very or somewhat uncertain over trade policy. "Recent geopolitical events in the Middle East add uncertainty into an already uncertain environment on trade, tax policy, and with potentially weakening hard macroeconomic data pending," said Doug Gordon, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments. The help, he said, comes from trade deals and tax policy, with 29% saying the current tax bill in Congress makes them more optimistic about growth and 29% say it makes them more pessimistic; 43% say it has no effect on their growth outlook. Yet 82% believe it will "somewhat" or "significantly increase" the federal budget deficit. On average, those looking for a trade deal believe it will be signed within about five months. "While it appears that the worst-case scenario when it comes to tariffs will not happen, the best-case scenario still implies significantly higher tariffs and therefore higher inflation for an extended period,'' said Joel Naroff, president, Naroff Economics. The 28 respondents, who include economists, fund managers and analysts, see two rate reductions this year, bringing the funds rate down to 3.9% by year-end, but only one 25 basis point cut next year. "There are multiple cross currents from geopolitical events that the Fed will have to weigh," said Constance Hunter, chief economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. "The see-saw between slower growth and adverse supply shocks are difficult to forecast, however we expect slower growth will ultimately be what causes the Fed to move closer to a neutral stance." That's a bit more hawkish than May when 65% saw the Fed cutting. By a slim margin, respondents don't believe the Fed will face that dilemma: 43% believe tariffs will result in just "one-time price increases" while 32% say they create a broader inflationary problem. However, 61% say tariff inflation in future months will show up "more significantly" than it has, while 36% see it as appearing "only modestly." "I expect (economic) moderation going forward as tariffs get incorporated into consumer prices and slower job growth due in part to a slower pace of immigration providing less fuel for aggregate disposable income," said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation. Amid all those concerns, Mark Vitner, chief economist at Piedmont Crescent Capital & CAVU Securities, notes that the economy has remained "Resilient, Not 'Tariffied.'" "There's no shortage of reasons to worry — elevated interest rates, huge budget deficits, geopolitical flare-ups, tariff threats — but the U.S. economy keeps proving its doubters wrong." He added, "Consumers continue to spend, and businesses are doubling down on future-facing infrastructure: AI, life sciences, DefenseTech, and other emerging technologies." Indeed, the outlook for stocks rose, with the S&P 500 now expected to hit 6,133 by year, for a modest 1.7% rise from current levels, but a more robust 10% increase to 6,625 by the end of 2026. "Equity markets are near all-time highs in anticipation of certainty replacing uncertainty on tariffs, the 2017 tax cuts getting extended, deregulation, AI productivity, and Fed easing," said Hank Smith, head of investment strategy, Haverford Trust Co. "If all of this occurs, the economy should reaccelerate in the second half into '26." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

A blistering rally in a tiny, money-losing traditional Chinese medicine company's stock has vaulted its founder's net worth to among the world's 100 largest fortunes.

The firm, Hong Kong-based Regencell Bioscience Holding Ltd., was for all intents and purposes trading as a microcap stock on the Nasdaq just eight weeks ago. But its shares have since exploded, gaining more than 46,000% this year as of Monday's close. The move has boosted the value of Chief Executive Officer Yat-Gai Au's 86% stake to $25.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making Au's paper wealth greater than rich-list stalwarts such as Jerry Jones and Masayoshi Son.</p>

The Trump administration is discussing policies that would make it harder and more expensive for pharmaceutical companies to advertise directly to patients, in a move that could disrupt more than $10 billion in annual ad spending.

Although the US is the only place, besides New Zealand, where pharma companies can directly advertise, banning pharma ads outright could make the administration vulnerable to lawsuits, so it's instead focusing on cutting down on the practice by adding legal and financial hurdles, according to people familiar with the plans who weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Higher mortgage rates and uncertainty in the broader economy continue to weigh on consumers — and consequently on the nation's homebuilders. Builder sentiment in June dropped 2 points from May to 32 on the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI). The index stood at 43 in June 2024. Analysts had been expecting a slight improvement, given recent tariff negotiations and pullbacks by the Trump administration. This index has only seen a lower reading than June's level twice since 2012 – in December 2022, after mortgage rates shot up from record lows during the first two years of the pandemic, and in April 2020 at the very start of the pandemic. Of the index's three components, current sales conditions fell 2 points to 35, sales expectations in the next six months dropped 2 points to 40, and buyer traffic fell 2 points to 21, the lowest reading on that metric since the end of 2023. "Buyers are increasingly moving to the sidelines due to elevated mortgage rates and tariff and economic uncertainty," said Buddy Hughes, NAHB chairman and a homebuilder from Lexington, North Carolina, in a release. "To help address affordability concerns and bring hesitant buyers off the fence, a growing number of builders are moving to cut prices." The average price reduction was 5%, which has been steady since late last year. "Rising inventory levels and prospective home buyers who are on hold waiting for affordability conditions to improve are resulting in weakening price growth in most markets and generating price declines for resales in a growing number of markets," said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the NAHB. "Given current market conditions, NAHB is forecasting a decline in single-family starts for 2025." Guidance on new orders and deliveries was also below analysts' expectations. "As mortgage interest rates remained higher and consumer confidence continued to weaken, we drove volume with starts while incentivizing sales to enable affordability and help consumers to purchase homes," said Lennar co-CEO Stuart Miller in an earnings release. Regionally, on a three-month moving average, the South and West showed the weakest builder sentiment. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter The PGA Tour on Tuesday named top NFL executive Brian Rolapp its next chief executive officer to succeed current Commissioner Jay Monahan. Monahan said he informed the board last year of his intention to step down in 2026 after a decade leading the organization. "We've found exactly the right leader in Brian Rolapp, and I'm excited to support him as he transitions from the NFL into his new role leading the PGA Tour," Monahan said in a statement. In an open letter published on Tuesday, Rolapp talked about the respect he has for golf's history and rich traditions but said there is still work to do and incredible opportunities ahead. Rolapp said after talking with players, board members and fans in recent months, he plans to focus on strengthening the Tour's commercial partnerships. "Professional golf is evolving, as are the ways fans consume sports. My goal as CEO is to honor golf's traditions but not be overly bound by them," he said. Over the course of Monahan's tenure as commissioner, he helped secure $1.5 billion in investment for the league, created equity opportunities for players and launched a Fan Forward initiative, according to a news release. Yet, those efforts were often overshadowed by a pending merger with Saudi-backed LIV Golf. Rolapp, who was considered a top successor candidate for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, brings decades of experience in forging high-profile media partnerships. The PGA Tour will be renewing its media rights agreements with key partners ahead of the current deal's expiration in 2030. "He has a clear respect for the game and our players and brings a fresh perspective from his experience in the NFL." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Think you know what bosses are looking for? But in today's world, those aren't enough. As a CEO, board member and MBA professor, my research shows that a sharper, more relevant set of criteria is rising to the top. At NYU's Stern School of Business, I teach a popular class called "Becoming You." Students start by identifying their values using a tool called The Values Bridge, then explore careers that match their aptitudes and emotional, intellectual and economic needs. Finally, and critically, they assess their leadership capacity. Today's professionals face nonstop change, geopolitical chaos and ambiguity about, well, everything. So I set out to identify the traits that actually matter now — and tested them through consulting projects with a dozen companies across industries. Focus groups and manager surveys refined the list. When I see all four in one person? I try to hire them on the spot. The business environment today is fast, unforgiving and always on. Nerve means making fast, high-stakes decisions with incomplete or conflicting information. It also means having the courage to deliver tough truths with empathy. People who combine candor with kindness are rare — but invaluable. Nerve is courage, clarity, speed, transparency and an unrelenting bias for action. That "skill churn" is expected to hit 65% in the years ahead. Elasticity isn't just tolerating change — it's actually enjoying reinvention. It's a mindset that says, "Bring on the new." They signal flexibility, openness and the social curiosity that underpins comfort with change. It's always been important to be steady at work. Managers tell me their best people are anxious, withdrawn or just worn out. That's why managers are putting a premium on soundness: a bundle of traits that includes positivity, accountability, resilience and self-awareness. You can ask colleagues for feedback on the first three. That's the only trait on this list you can — and should — test for. If you're job searching or feeling stalled in your career, start there. In other words, how "current" you are (on trends, technology, culture and ideas) directly affects how valuable you are to your organization. Gone are the days when you could stay informed just by talking to colleagues or skimming a few news platforms. The most successful people don't just absorb what's next — they share it in-house, sparking fresh thinking across teams. Wondering how you would rate on all of these traits? You can find out for free using The Career Traits Compass, which I designed to help both my MBA students — and professionals seeking career growth. Now, obviously, every role has its own must-haves. They're what every leader is quietly scanning for. And if you've got them all, trust me: Someone is already plotting how to hire you, even if they're not hiring.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crude oil futures rose more than 4% on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump demanded Iran's unconditional surrender and threatened its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The U.S. crude oil contract for July delivery gained $3.07, or 4.28%, to close at $74.84 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent for August rose $3.22, or 4.4%, to settle at $76.45. Prices continued to rise after Tuesday's settlement with U.S. crude and Brent both up nearly 5%. Trump threatened Khamenei as "an easy target," warning Iran's leader that U.S. "patience is wearing thin." "We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding," Trump said in a social media post Tuesday. "He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill! But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Trump met Tuesday afternoon with his national security team in the White House Situation Room. Oil prices had closed lower Monday on reports that Iran was seeking a ceasefire with Israel, but those hopes faded as the conflict went on for a fifth day with Trump taking a harder line against Iran. Trump left the Group of Seven summit in Canada early and demanded that everyone evacuate Iran's capital city. "Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON," the president said in a social media post late Monday. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was looking for "a real end" to the conflict, "not a ceasefire" agreement. Trump said there was no specific threat that led to his call for people in Tehran to evacuate. The impact of the conflict on the oil futures market has been modest so far, with prices rising about 10% since Israel launched its air campaign against Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs on Friday. OPEC+ is increasing supply to the market and U.S. production remains at record levels, Hochstein said. Oil traders initially feared that Israel might strike Iran's oil infrastructure in an effort to cripple the Islamic Republic's economy. Israel has hit domestic energy facilities in Iran but has spared installations that export to the global market. "What the market is seeing is this confidence that Israel is able to continue this escalation with Iran and the war against Iran without the Iranians being able to do very much in response," Hochstein told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Tuesday. Iran is the third-largest oil producer in OPEC and exports about 1.6 million barrels per day mostly to China, according to data from OPEC and the Energy Information Administration. The worst case-scenario for the oil market would be an attempt by Iran to block the Strait of Hormuz in response to such an Israeli strike. The strait is a narrow waterway between Iran and Oman through which about 20% of the world's oil passes. Goldman Sachs has warned that such an event could push oil prices above $100 per barrel. But Tehran would likely think twice before making such a move because it could draw the U.S. into the conflict, Hochstein said. — CNBC's Christina Wilkie contributed to this report.

“The moment is approaching very fast, the regime is on the verge of collapse,” says Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, as he discusses the prospect of regime change in Iran amid the Israel-Iran conflict. Pahlavi says there are plans in place not only for “liberation from this regime,” but also “the transition to what we hope will come in a democratic outcome.” (Source: Bloomberg)</p>
