                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US spies have assessed that Iran has not been pursuing a nuclear weapon for over 20 years. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he doesn't care that his own Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has said that according to the assessment of U.S. intelligence sources, Iran has not been pursuing the development of a nuclear weapon for over two decades — an assessment that undercuts the U.S. and Israel's stated reason for the current attack on Iran. However, in an eerie echo of the U.S. propaganda around the Iraq War, on Tuesday, Trump outright dismissed his own government's assessments of Iran's nuclear capabilities. The statement is seemingly made in service of his quest to continue fueling Israel's aggression and ramp up the campaign to pressure Iran to capitulate in talks for a nuclear deal, like the deal Trump himself withdrew from during his first term. I think they were very close to having one,” Trump said. Officials have found that not only is Iran not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it is also up to three years away from creating a functional one, per CNN. However, that has not stopped U.S. and Israeli officials, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, from warning that Iran is just months away from a nuclear weapon — which they have done for decades now to push for a war with Iran. Trump's dismissal of Gabbard's statements undercuts the idea that the core purpose of Israel's current aggression against Iran is to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, as Netanyahu has dubiously claimed. “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” he posted, shortly after sending another post where he outright threatened to assassinate Khomeini if Iran doesn't capitulate to the U.S.'s demands. “We don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Analysts like Iranian writer Trita Parsi have said that the Trump administration's demands in nuclear deal negotiations have always been about laying the groundwork for war. Last month, Parsi pointed out that the U.S.'s demand that Iran completely stop enriching uranium is “unrealistic” and a “fantasy” that, ironically, only allows Iran to take more steps toward obtaining a nuclear weapon in the absence of a deal. “Over the past two decades, the persistent demand for zero enrichment — an unachievable goal — has only resulted in a larger and more advanced Iranian nuclear program by postponing realistic, enforceable limits on enrichment,” Parsi wrote. Trump and Netanyahu's fear mongering over Iran's nuclear capabilities is heavily reminiscent of the Bush administration's now infamous lie about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction as a pretense for the U.S.'s disastrous invasion of Iraq.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 447,000 US kids under 3 were unhoused at last count. Trump's budget bill threatens to make that number skyrocket. Nearly 447,000 US kids under 3 were unhoused at last count. Trump's budget bill threatens to make that number skyrocket. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. But as horrendous as these numbers are, unhoused people and their advocates fear that if Donald Trump's big, brutal budget bill gets Senate approval, the situation for unhoused families and those teetering on the edge of economic precarity will soon get significantly worse. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. She told Truthout that several factors contributed to the 2022-23 spike in unhoused children. Moreover, when pregnancy and homelessness intersect, prenatal care can become inaccessible. According to the National League of Cities, a lack of transportation to see health care providers, coupled with overt and covert discrimination against the unhoused, can mean that treatable pregnancy complications go unnoticed. Unsurprisingly, this increases the odds of preterm deliveries, lower newborn birth weights, and more frequent hospitalizations in neonatal intensive care units. “Any period of homelessness can have negative health impacts on fetuses and children,” the Loma Linda University Institute for Health Policy and Leadership warns. In addition, being unhoused can exact an emotional toll. Carol L. Hornbeck is a Minnesota-based family therapist who frequently works with people experiencing homelessness. This disquiet, she explains, can become apparent when a child begins school or preschool. “It's hard for unhoused kids to pay attention, concentrate, and receive new information when they're anxious,” she said. What's more, Hornbeck says that children experiencing homelessness are often diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. “What they have is hypervigilance due to fear and worry.” “Kids who've been unhoused come into a new place and immediately look around to see if any food is available,” she said. “People I met in a shelter I worked in 30 or 40 years ago are now showing the aftereffects of the trauma they experienced decades ago as kids,” she told Truthout. “The trauma of instability, of having no place to stay, and of being raised by parents who were constantly worried about where they'd sleep and what they'd eat can cause fears that never go away. This can cause physical and mental health problems later in life.” Although Jeffrey's daughter, Harmony, was taken by child protective services when she was days old in May 2022, the pair are now reunited and are doing well. In fact, Jeffery has become something of a model for other unhoused women and recovering drug users. Now 38, Jeffrey was appointed to the Parent Partnership Board of the Oklahoma Commission on Children and Youth earlier this year and is attending Oklahoma State University to pursue a degree in substance abuse counseling. But despite these achievements, she's found the experience of homelessness hard to shake off and describes being homeless while pregnant and in recovery from meth use, as “dehumanizing.” “Not having a bathroom of your own when you're pregnant is awful,” she told Truthout. Jeffrey says that she got clean while pregnant, but the fact that she was living in a van with someone who was still using led to Harmony's removal. They sent me photos of her every single day. That said, she told Truthout that she is grateful to have an ongoing and loving relationship with Harmony's foster siblings and parents. “We go to church with them and have Sunday dinner together every week,” she said. I believe this is because the foster family and I bridged, but there is always a huge risk of trauma manifesting later.” But Jeffrey is not letting her fears stop her and says that she is stoked to speak about what she's been through. “If I can be brave, if I can be vulnerable and put a face to homelessness and addiction, I want to do it.” Jeffrey also wants to promote a “co-parenting model” like the one she and Harmony's foster family have developed. At the same time, she is paying close attention to the news and worrying that looming budget cuts will undermine the already tattered social safety net that has allowed her to return to school and receive public benefits. The resulting “savings” will provide a 10-year $3.8 trillion tax cut to those earning $800,000 or more annually. What's more, approximately 11 million people — about a quarter of those who rely on SNAP to eat, including 4 million kids, and 500,000 adults aged 65 or older or living with a disability — will lose some or all of their food assistance. Patricia Cole, a senior policy officer at Zero to Three, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group that focuses on the early childhood needs of infants, toddlers, and their families, told Truthout that the budgetary threat has put advocacy organizations into “defensive mode since the threats are coming from every direction.” Along with other advocates, Zero to Three is “raising up” impacted individuals and encouraging them to tell their elected officials about the importance of Medicaid, SNAP, the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, Head Start, and other safety net entitlements in their lives. Instead, Congress seems hellbent on cutting spending, advancing defense, and reducing immigration. It will, however, leave families with infants and toddlers who live at or under 200 percent of the federal poverty line, in dire straits.” “The reality of unhoused families bouncing between shitty hotels, cars, and couches is horrific,” Diane Nilan told Truthout. If Trump's budget is passed, it will destroy the shred of a safety net that now exists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 51 people were killed and more than 200 others injured by Israeli fire as they waited for aid trucks to arrive in Khan Younis in southern Gaza early Tuesday morning, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. In total, nearly 400 Palestinians have been killed near aid centers since Israel lifted an 11-week total blockade on Gaza and allowed a trickle of aid to enter, according to the health ministry. The IDF said it was “aware of reports regarding a number of injured individuals from IDF fire following the crowd's approach,” that “details of the incident are under review,” and that it “regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and operates to minimize harm as much as possible to them while maintaining the safety of our troops.” One eyewitness, Mohammed Abu Abed, said that a group of people was hit by an airstrike. He told CNN: “We were waiting for flour trucks. Suddenly, we were among the people and were hit by two missiles that tore apart people's bodies, remains, pieces of flesh everywhere. They killed us in cold blood,” Abu Abed said. The IDF told CNN it was “unaware” of an airstrike in that area on Tuesday. The latest scenes of death, violence and desperation underline a grim existence for over 2.1 million people living in Gaza – which the United Nations has warned is edging closer to famine. Humanitarian organizations say that aid currently entering the enclave is only a tiny fraction of what is needed, with the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – the main supplier of aid in Gaza – coming under global scrutiny since it opened its distribution points late last month. On Tuesday, eight people were also killed after coming under Israeli fire near an aid distribution site west of Rafah, the ministry said. The GHF, an Israeli-US backed private contractor, has been criticized by multiple international aid agencies for setting up its distribution centers amid active combat zones. The IDF has not yet responded to CNN's comment on Tuesday's incident in Rafah. I urge immediate, impartial investigations into deadly attacks on desperate civilians trying to reach food distribution centres.” One of those killed in Khan Younis on Tuesday was a 20-year-old man, who had traveled there in hope of returning with food for his family. Speaking through tears, his mother said: “He didn't go for a picnic. He went to bring food for his siblings and father.” Nearby, at Nasser Medical Complex, hospital staff said that the entire ward was crowded with casualties. One intensive care doctor told Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), an aid organization based in the United Kingdom, that the hospital had received on Tuesday “a large number of injured and killed from the Israeli army's targeting of aid distribution points in Khan Younis.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 14 people have been killed and 117 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17. Ukraine's National Police initially reported 15 dead and 124 injured in the attack, but Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later revised the death toll to 10. Klymenko said operational data may change, as body parts found during rescue efforts can sometimes be mistakenly counted as multiple victims. The almost nine-hour-long attack saw Moscow's forces launch large numbers of kamikaze attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine's capital. The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia launched 472 aerial weapons overnight, including nearly 280 Shahed-type attack drones and two Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Air defenses also intercepted one Kinzhal missile, while another was reportedly lost from radar tracking. President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault "one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv," saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. "Such attacks are pure terrorism," he said in a statement on social media. Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block. In a video posted on Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said cluster munitions had been found in one area of the city. He later added that June 18 would be an official day of mourning in Kyiv. Many of the deaths and injuries occurred when a Russian missile hit a nine-storey residential building in the Solomianskyi district, "completely destroying" one section, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. "I saw the missile because it was low," Olena Kushnirova, a 46-year-old  nurse who lives in a neighboring building to the one that was hit, told the Kyiv Independent. "I grabbed my daughter by the hand and shouted 'run!' We ran to the toilet, and then there was a very powerful explosion." Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a "massive and brutal strike" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit. He sends a signal of total disrespect to the United States and other partners who have called for an end to the killing," Sybiha said. "Only strong steps and real pressure on Moscow can prove him wrong." "People started running outside, shouting, some in panic, because the attack wasn't over yet. They said there were still rockets flying. No casualties were reported at the site. Drones struck the institute's 10th floor and broke windows on three other floors. At least one woman was injured and multiple homes were damaged, according to the regional administration. The company announced it was forced to cancel all current orders and suspend new ones indefinitely following the destruction of its Kyiv site. Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) freight train carrying grain. Several railcars overturned, temporarily halting operations and spilling grain from the damaged wagons. Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, reported the destruction of two of its branches in Kyiv during the attack, according to CEO Ihor Smiliansky. The company's team is working to "quickly restore services," he said. The attack followed a series of drone strikes overnight on June 16 targeting Kyiv Oblast, including both the capital and surrounding settlements. In the Obukhiv district, a 60-year-old man was injured, according to regional authorities. Russian attacks against Ukraine have intensified in May and June, with Moscow launching several record-breaking mass strikes against Kyiv and other cities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Convicted sex trafficker had been placed in solitary and given medication by prison staff, court filing alleges Lawyers for R Kelly say in new court documents that the convicted sex trafficker and singer was recently rushed to hospital after medically overdosing in prison. The 58-year-old reportedly collapsed on Friday at the federal correctional institute in Butner, North Carolina, which specializes in housing sex offenders, and was transported to Duke University hospital. In a new court filing on Monday reviewed by the Guardian, Kelly's lawyers allege that he had been placed in solitary confinement on 10 June and was given medication by prison staff – along with “instructions to take it”. According to the filing, Kelly awoke in the early morning hours of 13 June, feeling “faint” and “dizzy”, and “he started to see black spots in his vision”. The document alleges that Kelly was then placed on a gurney and taken by ambulance to Duke University hospital. At the hospital, Kelly's lawyers say he “learned that he had been administered an overdose quantity of his medications that threatened his life”. They also say that he “required hospitalization for two days”. Monday's filing came after an emergency motion by Kelly's lawyers in which they alleged that three Bureau of Prisons officials had orchestrated a plot to have him killed by another inmate. In Monday's filing, Kelly's lawyers requested again that the court order a temporary furlough to home detention. In 2022, he was also found guilty on three counts of producing child sexual abuse imagery and three counts of child enticement. He received a 20-year sentence to be served concurrently with his existing term.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pallavi Devulapalli says party is diverging from founding principles towards a more ‘leftwing authoritarian culture' Dr Pallavi Devulapalli said trans rights had become an obvious totem in the new climate, and accused the party of trying to purge anyone with gender-critical views. Devulapalli, a GP and member of King's Lynn and West Norfolk council, was expelled from the party for a rules breach that she has said was due to her beliefs on gender. Her expulsion this month, she said, has exposed a rift in the party's leadership on transgender issues that threatens to widen during this summer's leadership election. The party's current co-leader Adrian Ramsay, who has argued that members should not be thrown out for saying trans women are not women, is pressing internally for Devulapalli's expulsion to be reviewed. A Green party spokesperson said: “We don't comment on individual cases.” Devulapalli was suspended last September, three months after she failed to back the party's manifesto policy on the right of self-identification for trans people during a hustings event. Devulapalli said the move was a “pretext” to get rid of her. Devulapalli is now one of 25 “Greens in Exile” – former party members who have been suspended or expelled largely for their gender critical views. Following April's supreme court ruling that a “woman” in the Equality Act refers only to a biological woman, the Greens' policy has come under strain. In interviews since, Ramsay, who is standing again as co-leader with fellow MP Ellie Chowns, has refused to commit to an answer, but Carla Denyer, who is standing down as co-leader, has said that “trans women are women [and] trans men are men”. Devulapalli fears that if Polanski wins, the party will become more “authoritarian” and less tolerant of gender critical views as it tries to appeal to disillusioned Labour supporters. Since her expulsion Devulapalli says she has had dozens of messages of support, including from fellow GPs and prominent Greens such as the party's former candidate for London mayor Jenny Jones and another former Green party health spokesperson, Larry Sanders, who called for “debate not expulsion”. But speaking up calmly, rationally and with compassion is important.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Sûreté du Québec has appealed for the public's help as it searches for Claire Bell, 3, in several locations around Montreal.Supplied Quebec police continued their search on Tuesday west of Montreal for a missing three-year-old girl after her mother was charged with child abandonment. Claire Bell, 3, was last seen Sunday morning in Montreal's LaSalle borough, and was reported missing at around 3 p.m. that day in Coteau-du-Lac, Que., about 50 kilometres to the west. Ms. Todd didn't speak as a court-appointed attorney asked Quebec court Judge Bertrand St-Arnaud to scheduled the next court date on Wednesday. Ms. Todd will be taken to Leclerc detention centre for women in Laval, Que., Ms. Prévost-Gravel said. Provincial police spokesman Jean-Raphaël Drolet said in a social media video that searchers were going to focus on the Vaudreuil-Dorion area, located about 35 kilometres from the boundary with Ontario. Police have been looking for the girl since Sunday. “It's possible there are other areas that will be searched as well,” Mr. Drolet said. Police released a video of Ms. Todd's 2007 grey Ford Escape with Quebec licence plate K50 FVE and a 'Baby on Board' sticker on the right passenger side corner of the back window. They asked anyone who might have spotted the vehicle between 9:45 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Sunday to come forward. Provincial police say Claire Bell is three feet tall, has brown hair and brown eyes and was last seen wearing a white long-sleeve shirt with a pink collar, grey pants, and no shoes. Anyone who sees the girl or has information about her whereabouts is asked to contact police. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A U.S. government working group that formulated strategies for pressuring Russia into peace talks and ending the war in Ukraine has been disbanded by the White House, Reuters reported on June 17. Officials cited by the news outlet said it was established this spring but became increasingly irrelevant as it became clear U.S. President Donald Trump wasn't willing to apply any concrete pressure on Moscow during peace talks. Instead of doing more, maybe he wanted to do less," an anonymous official said. As Ukraine and the U.S. continue to push for an unconditional ceasefire, Russia has maintained maximalist demands and rejected all such proposals. At the same time it has escalated attacks on Ukrainian civilians, killing at least 15 people and injuring scores of others in the latest attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17. Trump has expressed frustration with Moscow's intransigence and growing violence but has yet to impose any new sanctions on Russia. On June 16 while speaking in Canada ahead of a G7 summit, Trump said barring Russia from the G8 for its invasion of Ukraine in 2017 had been a "mistake." According to Reuters, the working group, staffed by officials from the National Security Council, State Department, Treasury Department, the Pentagon and intelligence community, was decimated in a purge of personnel around three weeks ago. Trump pledged to "stop the wars" when he was elected U.S. president for the second time but after just five months in office, the world is a far more violent place. As well as Russia escalating attacks on Ukraine, Israel and Iran are now locked in a conflict that further threatens stability in the Middle East.</p>

TEHRAN, June 17. /TASS/. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran's elite military unit, claims to have struck the building of Israel's military intelligence directorate and Mossad headquarters.

"This morning, the IRGC's aerospace forces carried out a strike on the center of military intelligence of the Zionist regime's (Israel's - TASS) army, Aman, and the Zionist regime's center for planning terrorist operations, Mossad, in Tel Aviv, despite Israel's advanced defense systems, and this center is now on fire," the Tasnim news agency quoted an IRGC statement.

Tasnim reported earlier that Israel's Glilot military intel base near Tel Aviv was hit by IRGC's missile strike.

Overnight into June 13, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion targeting Iran's nuclear program. Iran responded in less than 24 hours. In the following days, Tel Aviv and Tehran continued to exchange strikes. Both parties reported casualties and damage, and admitted that a number of facilities had been hit, but said the damage was limited.</p>

Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. “It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,” said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world's most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own. Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols — a theatrical bid to “cool down” runaway tourism. The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called “untenable” working conditions. It's rare for the Louvre to close its doors. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant. “We can't wait six years for help,” said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa — a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des États, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her — works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored. “You don't see a painting,” said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the “Louvre New Renaissance,” promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. “Conditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,” Macron said in January. “We take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,” Sefian said, “but when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.” While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited “masterpiece route” for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year — more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect. In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are “no longer watertight,” that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs — food, restrooms, signage — fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as “a physical ordeal.” The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year. But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan. Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo — neither fully funded nor fully functional.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Group of Seven countries released a statement Monday supporting Israel and condemning Iran as both countries launched fresh attacks on each other. G7 Leaders are currently meeting a summit in Canada's Rocky Mountains. Members include the United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, France, Canada and Italy. “In this context, we affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself. Conversely, the group labelled Iran as the “principal source of regional instability and terror,” adding “we have been consistently clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon.” Iran is also an ally of Russian President Vladimir Puttin helping him wage war on Ukraine by supplying him with equipment and weapons. The latest Israel-Iran conflict began last week when Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities and killed senior members of its military.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. During George W. Bush's presidency, Washington agreed to a major deal with New Delhi that offered support for India's civilian nuclear program despite the country's controversial development of nuclear weapons. During President Donald Trump's first term, the United States started sharing sensitive intelligence with India and made it eligible to receive advanced technologies previously reserved only for American allies; under President Joe Biden, Washington gave New Delhi sophisticated fighter jet engine technology. Each of these recent administrations deepened diplomatic, technological, and military cooperation with India, making good on Bush's promise “to help India become a major world power in the twenty-first century.” Furthermore, they were increasingly tied by deep people-to-people connections, as Indian immigrants played a larger role in shaping the American economy and New Delhi's own post–Cold War economic reforms invited American firms and capital to Indian markets. Beneath these shifts lay a deeper geopolitical opportunity: Indian and U.S. officials recognized that they had many shared interests, including combating Islamist terrorism and, more important, addressing the dangers of a rising China while protecting the liberal international order. But India and the United States are not aligned on all issues. New Delhi does not want a world in which Washington is perpetually the sole superpower. India believes that multipolarity is the key to both global peace and its own rise. It obsessively guards its strategic autonomy, eschewing formal alliances and maintaining ties with Western adversaries such as Iran and Russia, even as it has grown closer to the United States. This behavior is intended to help advance a multipolar international order. But it may not be effective or even realistic. With China on one side and an adversarial Pakistan on the other, India must always fear the prospect of an unpalatable two-front war. This evolution could undermine India's rise by intensifying communal tensions and exacerbating problems with its neighbors, forcing it to redirect security resources inward to the detriment of outward power projection. And because of its perennial discomfort with alliances, or even with close partnerships, securing external support could be challenging, especially as the United States grows more transactional in its foreign policy—and also if Washington comes to fear New Delhi as a competitor. In the coming decades, India will grow undeniably stronger but less able to wield that strength in meaningful ways, with less global sway. But the pace of growth remained lackluster compared with other Asian states. In 1991, Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, took an axe to the country's controlled economy, dismantling the so-called License Raj, which had stifled India's economic growth through excessive regulations, production controls, and closed domestic markets. Since then, India's GDP has grown at about 6.5 percent annually—a remarkably long and unprecedented period of sustained growth. It is one of the main reasons why the United States sees India as an important partner and a potential counterweight to China. Since Beijing opened up its economy in the late 1970s, Chinese GDP has grown at close to nine percent annually, reaching double digits 15 times between 1979 and 2023, according to World Bank data. The same figures show that, by contrast, India has never chalked up double-digit GDP growth. As a result, China's economy went from being roughly the same size as India's in 1980 to almost five times its size today. Beijing has also used its wealth to become far more influential than New Delhi. It has more deeply integrated itself into the Indo-Pacific region in ways that enhance its economic heft and provide it with enormous—sometimes choking—political influence. This helps explain why New Delhi, despite its often confident rhetoric, is skittish about confronting Beijing unless pressed, even when it is backed by Washington. Indians, of course, are not happy about this disadvantage. The Chinese economy, after all, has slowed considerably over the last decade: China is now growing at between four and five percent annually on average—behind India's pace. The Chinese economy is buffeted by multiple challenges that could keep growth rates down, such as a real estate crisis, high local debt, and increasing constraints on its market access to the West. After years of slowing growth, China's population declined for the first time in 2022, and it continues to age rapidly. India, meanwhile, still has a growing population, despite declining fertility rates. It will possess a large cohort of working-age adults for some time to come. But China's slowdown does not guarantee that India will catch up. To become a genuine peer of China, India would need to grow consistently at eight percent per year over the next 25 years while China grows at a glacial two percent. It lags in overall technological proficiency, despite having many excellent technology companies. It has not yet invested sufficiently in improving its large human capital. India will therefore likely grow at an annual rate of six percent over the next two decades, its average annual rate during the last decade, based on World Bank data through 2023. If that happens, and China grows at just two percent per year, on average, New Delhi's standing vis-à-vis Beijing would certainly improve: by midcentury, India's GDP would be a little more than half that of China. But China could still achieve average annual GDP growth higher than two percent in the coming decades. For all its challenges, China still has enormous economic advantages relative to India, including a literate, skilled, and comparatively healthy population; greater technological proficiency; and larger capital stocks. It has made substantial investments in critical technologies—such as artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, and information and communications—which could improve growth despite its demographic constraints. If China grows even a little faster, say at three percent annually, it could end up with an economy that is closer to three times as large as India's, even if India grows at six percent. Long-range projections of economic growth are admittedly difficult to make. And it will certainly not be on par with the United States. If New Delhi wants to constrain Beijing, it will therefore need Washington. None of the other Indo-Pacific powers, not even Australia or Japan, will be strong enough by 2050 to compensate for the United States. New Delhi and Washington then will—indeed, must—continue cooperating in the years ahead. But those hoping for a boundless friendship will be disappointed. Despite its weaknesses, India will not settle for any alliance with the United States, and there will be limits on their partnership. That is because India does not want to be part of any collective defense arrangements. India's desire to avoid formal coalitions is partly the product of its colonial past. The country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, pledged that India would never become a “camp follower” of any great power, given that it had spent centuries suffering under British rule. With this assessment of the world in mind, New Delhi will keep trying to push the international order toward multipolarity even if that is not what Washington wants. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee articulated this ambition in 2004, when he declared, “India does not believe that unipolarity is a state of equilibrium in today's world.” India, he insisted, would work to build a “cooperative, multipolar world which accommodates the legitimate aspirations and interests of all its component poles.” Indian leaders across the political spectrum share this vision, believing that multipolarity is the natural state of the world, that the international system is entering a state of multipolarity, or that multipolarity is needed for global peace because it ensures that no single country can impose its will on others. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar argues in his 2020 book, The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World, that New Delhi should advance its “national interests by identifying and exploiting opportunities created by global contradictions” to reap the most benefits “from as many ties as possible.” A unipolar order undermines this strategy because it denies New Delhi the opportunity to play one pole against another. After all, a multipolar world would have many more cleavages and affinities that India could use to its advantage. In practice, this means that India pursues eclectic partnerships with individual countries and groupings of countries, even if some of those partners have strikingly anti-American agendas. But sometimes, even as India has deepened its ties with the United States bilaterally, it acts to constrain U.S. power in the larger global arena. India has, for instance, pushed back against the United States on issues such as climate policy, trade preferences, data sovereignty, e-commerce rules, and global governance. Even in the realm of high politics, India has opposed U.S. sanctions on friendly third countries, championed the so-called global South in its campaign against Western domination, and preserved its traditional ties with countries such as Iran and Russia, despite the latter's appalling war in Ukraine. India has even sought to maintain stable relations with China, cooperating whenever possible, to preserve a modicum of peace across their shared border. Unlike Washington, New Delhi cannot tolerate violent oscillations in its bilateral relationship with Beijing and, depending on the future trajectory of U.S. policy, may edge closer to China as circumstances demand. So far, however, these Indian efforts have done little to make the world any more multipolar than it was. And should that happen, India may find itself in an uncomfortable position. It will frustrate Washington by remaining ensconced in non-Western forums, such as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, only to find that Beijing has more influence in those groups and among many non-Western countries than does New Delhi. Thus far, India has escaped this dilemma because successive U.S. presidential administrations have deliberately overlooked these dalliances. But a more jaundiced government, like the one currently led by Trump, might be tempted to penalize India for this behavior. For example, New Delhi's effort to conduct some of its bilateral trades in local currencies rather than the U.S. dollar, although intended to immunize India against U.S. sanctions on third countries, could provoke a nationalist U.S. administration to limit cooperation with India. Even if India avoids such retaliation, the country should be wary of multipolarity for other reasons. As a result, India's current approach—seeking continued American support for itself while promoting a multipolar system that would limit Washington's power—is both counterproductive and unwise. India's qualities as a great power will not just be characterized by its approach to other states. They will also be defined by its internal politics. For decades, India has been a spectacular democratic success. Since winning independence in 1947, the country has had 18 national elections. More pertinently, Indian citizens have enjoyed universal adult franchise from the very beginning, irrespective of their gender, caste, or economic status. They have also enjoyed vital fundamental rights to freedom, equality, and religion, enforceable via judicial action. The government did suspend these rights from 1975 to 1977, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi infamously declared an “emergency” that let her rule as a dictator and imprison her opponents. Political science research has shown that democratic success is strongly correlated with a country's level of per capita income. Most Third World states, for example, that were born as democracies lapsed into dictatorships or became autocratic shortly after independence. Despite being poor, India's democracy thrived as its leaders managed the country's political fortunes through open competition. The country's success at staying democratic is attributable, in part, to its constitution. This document has multiple provisions guaranteeing respect for all people. The country also created a federal system in which multiple linguistic groups, for instance, were afforded their own states in order to protect the country's cultural diversity. This is what made India's political system not merely democratic but also fundamentally liberal. As Nehru put it, the country's founders sought “to create a just society by employing just means.” They believed, and proved, that a poor country could zealously protect individual rights and reject authoritarianism's promise of faster economic growth. But now, India is distancing itself from these origins. Unlike the India of the Cold War, which remained robustly liberal even when underperforming economically, India today, despite being more economically successful, has been markedly tainted by illiberalism and authoritarianism. Its long tradition of secular politics is now eclipsed by Hindu nationalism, whose proponents believe India to be the land of Hindus and that its religious minorities are, at best, second-class citizens. This ideology, called Hindutva, was repudiated and marginalized by the country's founders. But it never disappeared, and since the 1990s it has been resurrected in Indian politics, winning power for the first time late in that decade through its incarnation in the Bharatiya Janata Party and then more decisively from 2014 onward, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept into office. Along the way, the BJP has attempted to reabsorb previously alienated lower-caste Hindus in order to create a unified Hindu voting bloc that, collectively, numbers almost one billion people even as Hindu nationalists have sought to promote the idea that many of India's other minority faiths—notably Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism—are really Hinduism in disguise. All this is part of the larger belief that only adherents belonging to religious traditions that arose in the Indian subcontinent are authentically Indian. Harking back to the emergency, Modi's government has deputized the tax authorities and other instruments of law to intimidate India's opposition parties, civil society, regulatory institutions, and some opposition-ruled states. The country still has competitive elections, and there are faint signs that it could liberalize again. The BJP lost its outright majority in parliament during the last national elections, and it now has to govern in a coalition. The opposition still governs a third of India's states. Indian liberals are beleaguered, but they continue to resist the Hindutva tide. The question of whether India will be an illiberal great power thus remains open. India would cease to be an exemplar of liberal democracy at a time when the world desperately needs one. It would not enhance the liberal international order, which promises both peaceful politics and economic prosperity and which has come under growing assault. In a speech in New Delhi in 2015, President Barack Obama presciently declared, “If America shows itself as an example of its diversity and yet the capacity to live together and work together in common effort, in common purpose; if India, as massive as it is, with so much diversity, so many differences is able to continually affirm its democracy, that is an example for every other country on Earth.” Today, both the United States and India seem intent on failing this test. An illiberal India is also likely to be less powerful. This makes India look increasingly like the highly divided United States. Polarization has been bad enough for Americans, hobbling their institutions and fueling democratic decay. But it will be even worse for India, where the state and society are much weaker. Polarization, for example, could intensify the armed rebellions against New Delhi that have long been underway, creating opportunities for outside powers to sow chaos within India's borders. Those conflicts could also spill over into India's neighborhood, as the ideological animus against Muslims exacerbates tensions with both Bangladesh and Pakistan. Polarization would also increase India's internal security burdens, consuming resources that New Delhi needs to project influence abroad. And even if polarization does not create more internal troubles, it will undermine New Delhi's efforts to mobilize its population in accumulating national power. The combination of moderate economic growth, the persistent quest for partnerships with all states but privileged relationships with none, and growing illiberalism within the country make for an India whose global influence will fall short of its increasing material strength. Although India will become the third or fourth largest economy globally, its lagging development indicators imply that its relatively large population will neither enjoy the standard of living nor contribute proportionately to the production of national power that its counterparts do in China, the United States, and Europe. Even as its economy grows inarguably larger, India will still face tremendous challenges of deprivation and grievance that could threaten the country's social stability and national power. If India's continuing growth also remains tied largely to domestic market expansion but not international integration—as China's has been, in striking contrast—its ability to grow faster will inevitably be constrained. The imperatives of tying India's economic fortunes more closely to the transformations occurring in these regions are therefore incontestable, especially because India already faces strong impediments to translating its natural dominance within South Asia into lasting local hegemony. Because even if India grows at a rate of six percent over the next two decades or so, it will be eclipsed by China in Asia. New Delhi and Washington have made important strides together toward balancing Chinese power in recent years, but India's diffidence about a tight partnership with the United States frustrates this outcome. But the biggest constraint is India's preoccupation with promoting multipolarity through multialignment, which presumes that India will become a meaningful peer of China, the United States, and Europe sometime soon and, consequently, will be able to balance China on its own. Not only is this prospect nowhere in sight, but it also prevents the crafting of a genuine cooperative defense against China. This deficiency would be tolerable if India could expand its military capabilities sufficiently to neutralize the Chinese threat independently and to assist other Indo-Pacific states threatened by China. For the foreseeable future, India will find it hard to achieve either objective. Given the current, and likely future, gap in GDP with China, India will struggle to compete with its northern neighbor when it comes to defense modernization. India's reluctance to partner more closely with the United States in building cooperative defense, however understandable, thus makes balancing against China difficult. Even worse, the Indian ambition of promoting multipolarity puts it at odds with the United States on many issues of international order at a time when working with Washington should be the more pressing priority. India should not delude itself that it can contain China on its own, which it cannot, while calling for a multipolar world in which the United States has a reduced role. As both proceed down the path of illiberalism, however, they will no longer be tied by shared values. Transactional habits may come to dominate the relationship, and Washington could demand more of New Delhi as the price of partnership. Trump's approach to India in his second term has already signaled such an evolution. Indeed, India's inability to match China in the future, as well as its commitment to multipolarity, which is fundamentally at odds with American interests, will be deeply inconvenient for the United States. If New Delhi cannot effectively balance Beijing in Asia, Washington will invariably wonder how many resources and how much faith it should invest in India. A liberal United States might continue to support a liberal India because helping it would be inherently worthwhile (provided that the costs were not prohibitive and New Delhi's success still served some American interests).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The charges carry a statutory maximum sentence of up to 40 years in federal prison. Mr Plasencia is one of the five people charged after Perry died aged 54 from the acute effects of ketamine and other factors that caused him to lose consciousness and drown in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home. According to court documents, he said in a text message that he “wonder[ed] how much this moron will pay” for the drugs. Mr Plasencia “admits that his conduct fell below the proper standard of medical care and that transfers of ketamine vials to Defendant Iwamasa and [Perry] were not for a legitimate medical purpose,” it stated. Another doctor in the case, Mark Chavez, pleaded guilty last October to conspiring to distribute ketamine in the weeks before Perry's death. Mr Plasencia allegedly bought ketamine off Mr Chavez and sold it to the “Friends” actor at hugely inflated prices, according to court filings. Mr Iwamasa allegedly injected Perry more than 20 times with ketamine in the four days before he died, according to California prosecutors. Jasveen Sangha, the alleged “Ketamine Queen” who supplied drugs to high-end clients and celebrities, is charged with selling Perry the dose that killed him, and has pleaded not guilty. Perry had publicly acknowledged struggle with drug addictions for decades, including the years he starred as Chandler Bing on “Friends”. In 2018, he suffered a burst colon after overdosing on opioids and underwent multiple surgeries.</p>
