Officials say the suspect accused of shooting Democratic state lawmakers in Minnesota left behind an apparent hit list with dozens of names in his car after exchanging fire with police outside the home of one victim and fleeing the scene. CNN's John Berman speaks with Rep. Hillary Scholten (D) who was on the list.

    Editor's Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.



            A melting glacier draped in the tattered remains of a thermal blanket, a ghostly abandoned mining town in Chile, and an ancient tree marked by floodwaters are among the winning images of the Earth Photo 2025 competition.
    


            The award — created in 2018 by Forestry England, the UK's Royal Geographic Society and visual arts consultancy Parker Harris — aims to showcase the issues affecting the climate and life on our planet.

            More than 1,500 images and videos were submitted to this year's competition by photographers and filmmakers from all over the world. The winners were announced last night at a ceremony at London's Royal Geographical Society, ahead of an exhibition of the imagery at the same location.
    


            Photographer Lorenzo Poli took the top prize for his series of photos titled “Autophagy,” which document — in black and white — the Chuquicamata mine in Chile, one of the largest and deepest open-pit copper mines in the world, plunging nearly 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) into the Earth.
    


            Poli captures the vastness of the site, with moonlike landscapes of endless gray. One photo shows an abandoned miners' town and cemetery which is gradually being enveloped by the expanding mineral ore extraction. In a press release he said the photograph highlights the “unrelenting expansion of extractive endeavors” and he hopes that it serves to highlight unsustainable mining practices.
    


            Through the competition, Earth Photo wants to open people's eyes to the stories behind the pictures and encourage conversation and action.
    


            “These compelling images and storytelling bring us closer to landscapes, wildlife and communities, engaging us all with the conservation work underway and the new creative solutions needed ahead. Intensely thought-provoking photography and film like this deepens our understanding and can inspire all of us to action,” Hazel Stone, national curator of contemporary art at Forestry England and a member of the jury, told CNN.
    


            Other winning imagery included a photograph titled “Waterline,” by Mateo Borrero, that depicts declining flood waters in the Amazon rainforest of Peru. In one photo, a man from the Ticuna indigenous people stands beside a gigantic ancient Ceiba tree, the waterline from previous rainy seasons visible just below his shoulders.

            “This photograph, taken in May 2024, shows that the water level should be at its maximum; however, rainfall was scarce and, by the peak of the rainy season, non-existent,” explained Borrero in a press release.
    


            Drought is increasingly becoming a problem in the region, with some areas of the Amazon reportedly seeing river levels at their lowest in 120 years. This has disrupted ecosystems and affected millions of people who rely on the rivers for transport, food and income.  



            Louise Fedotov-Clements, prize chair and director of Photoworks UK, said in a press release that the images bring us “face to face” with the reality of the climate crisis.
    


            “Within each edition of Earth Photo we see a compelling diversity of international projects using these powerful visual tools to share the beauty and tragedy of life on our planet. Through the lens, film and photography transforms climate change from an abstract threat into a visceral reality, capturing not only the damage, but the resilience of communities and ecosystems in the face of environmental crisis,” she said.

US President Donald Trump has said he believes that Iran was “very close” to obtaining a nuclear weapon, contrary to the assessment of his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard.

In late March, Gabbard said that the US intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.”

When asked about the stance of his spy chief by journalists on Tuesday, Trump replied: “I do not care what she said.”

“I think they [Iran] were very close to having them,” the president stressed, referring to nuclear weapons.

Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who joined the Republican Party during last year's presidential campaign, was confirmed by the US Senate as the director of national intelligence in February, following heavy scrutiny and a heated debate.

During her political career, the former presidential candidate and Iraq War veteran has been a fierce critic of the US intelligence community that she currently leads, and was known for her support for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Trump, who was speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return from the G7 summit in Canada, stressed that his goals went beyond achieving a truce between Israel and Iran.

“I did not say I was looking for a ceasefire. I want a real end, with Iran giving up entirely on nuclear weapons,” he noted.

The president again warned Tehran against targeting US military facilities and personnel in the Middle East. “Iran knows not to touch our troops. We would come down so hard if they do anything to our people,” he said.

When asked about the possibility of the US military getting involved and assisting Israel with destroying Iran's nuclear program, Trump expressed hope that it would be “wiped out long before that.”

CNN reported earlier on Tuesday, citing four informed sources, that US intelligence assessments had concluded that not only was Iran not actively pursuing a nuclear bomb, but was also up to three years away from being able to produce one.

Israel explained its attack on Iran on Friday by claiming that Tehran was on the brink of obtaining a nuclear weapon. The Iranian authorities have repeatedly insisted that their nuclear program is peaceful in nature and that they are not pursuing atomic weapons development.

US President Donald Trump has left the G7 summit in Canada early, despite having a scheduled meeting with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, the White House has said, citing the recent escalation in the Middle East.

White House Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that the US leader is departing the gathering in Kananaskis, Alberta, “so he can attend to many important matters.” She also wrote on X that Trump “had a great day at the G7,” but “because of what's going on in the Middle East, [he] will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.”

Zelensky had been scheduled to meet Trump on the sidelines of the summit in what was widely perceived as an opportunity to urge the US to ramp up sanctions against Russia and approve more weapons shipments to Kiev.

Trump, however, has been reluctant to increase pressure on Moscow, with media reports suggesting that he is frustrated with both Ukraine and Russia, and is considering withdrawing from the peace process altogether.

French President Emmanuel Macron suggested that Trump's early departure was linked to ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Iran. “There is indeed an offer to meet and exchange,” Macron said. “The US assured they will find a ceasefire, and since they can pressure Israel, things may change.”

Trump, however, pushed back on the claim shortly afterward, rebuking “publicity seeking” Macron for what he saw as disseminating falsehoods. “He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that,” he wrote on the Truth Social network.

The recent Middle East escalation kicked off after US–Iran talks on a potential nuclear deal ended up at an impasse. Iran has dismissed a US demand to completely eliminate its uranium enrichment capabilities while not ruling out a potential agreement in itself. Tehran has also insisted it is not seeking to create a nuclear weapon, and that its atomic program is for peaceful purposes only.

As the diplomatic process stalled, Israel last week launched several waves of strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites, killing top commanders and nuclear scientists.

Iran retaliated with massive missile strikes on Israel, while the US has backed West Jerusalem's right to self-defense while reinforcing its assets in the region to protect its long-time ally. Washington, nevertheless, urged Tehran to return to talks.

 The world risks plunging into a “new dangerous arms race” as most nuclear powers seek to modernize and expand their arsenals, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has warned in its annual review.

The pace of disarmament is slowing as nuclear-armed states launch “intensive” arsenal modernization programs, the research center said in a paper published on Monday.

Russia and the US, which together possess around 90% of all nuclear weapons in the world, are set to see the last remaining bilateral nuclear arms control treaty – the New START – expire in February 2026, SIPRI noted. The agreement limits the number of simultaneously deployed strategic nuclear warheads.

Moscow suspended its participation in the treaty in 2023, citing the impracticality of the inspection regime due to deep Western involvement in the Ukraine conflict. However, it maintained that it remained open to dialogue on the issue if the arsenals of Washington's NATO allies were also considered.

Washington, meanwhile, insists on including China in any new agreement. According to SIPRI, China possesses the fastest-growing nuclear arsenal in the world and could rival “either Russia or the USA” in its number of intercontinental ballistic missiles by the end of the decade.

The UK and France are also modernizing their nuclear forces, focusing on nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, the report said. Paris additionally aims to develop a new ballistic missile warhead.

“The era of reductions in the number of nuclear weapons in the world, which had lasted since the end of the Cold War, is coming to an end,” said Hans M. Kristensen, Associate Senior Fellow with SIPRI's Weapons of Mass Destruction Program. “We see a clear trend of growing nuclear arsenals, sharpened nuclear rhetoric, and the abandonment of arms control agreements.”

The research institute also listed Israel among the nations “believed to be modernizing its nuclear arsenal.” While West Jerusalem does not officially acknowledge possessing nuclear weapons, SIPRI pointed to tests of new missile propulsion systems and alleged upgrades at the plutonium production reactor site in Dimona.

Israel could have up to 90 nuclear warheads at its disposal, the report stated. The findings come as West Jerusalem conducts air raids against Iranian nuclear and military facilities, claiming the Islamic Republic is nearing the creation of a nuclear bomb. Tehran, which maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, was not mentioned in the SIPRI report.

Convicted sex trafficker had been placed in solitary and given medication by prison staff, court filing alleges

Lawyers for R Kelly say in new court documents that the convicted sex trafficker and singer was recently rushed to hospital after medically overdosing in prison.

The 58-year-old reportedly collapsed on Friday at the federal correctional institute in Butner, North Carolina, which specializes in housing sex offenders, and was transported to Duke University hospital.

In a new court filing on Monday reviewed by the Guardian, Kelly's lawyers allege that he had been placed in solitary confinement on 10 June and was given medication by prison staff – along with “instructions to take it”.

According to the filing, Kelly awoke in the early morning hours of 13 June, feeling “faint” and “dizzy”, and “he started to see black spots in his vision”.

“Kelly tried to get up, but fell to the ground,” the filing alleges. “He crawled to the door of the cell and lost consciousness.”

The document alleges that Kelly was then placed on a gurney and taken by ambulance to Duke University hospital. During the ambulance ride, Kelly reportedly overheard a prison officer say: “This is going to open a whole new can of worms.”

At the hospital, Kelly's lawyers say he “learned that he had been administered an overdose quantity of his medications that threatened his life”. They also say that he “required hospitalization for two days”.

The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment to USA Today, which first reported the filing, citing “pending litigation”.

Monday's filing came after an emergency motion by Kelly's lawyers in which they alleged that three Bureau of Prisons officials had orchestrated a plot to have him killed by another inmate. That motion requested that Kelly be released to home detention.

Federal prosecutors have opposed that request.

“Kelly is a prolific child molester,” the prosecutors wrote. “He is unapologetic about it. Kelly has never taken responsibility for his years of sexually abusing children, and he probably never will.

“Kelly now asks this court to release him from incarceration indefinitely under the guise of a fanciful conspiracy,” the prosecutors added. “Kelly's motion makes a mockery of the harm suffered by Kelly's victims.”

In Monday's filing, Kelly's lawyers requested again that the court order a temporary furlough to home detention.

Kelly was convicted in 2021 on racketeering and sex-trafficking charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison. In 2022, he was also found guilty on three counts of producing child sexual abuse imagery and three counts of child enticement. He received a 20-year sentence to be served concurrently with his existing term.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Pallavi Devulapalli says party is diverging from founding principles towards a more ‘leftwing authoritarian culture'

The Green party is veering away from its founding culture towards a more leftwing authoritarianism, its former health spokesperson has claimed.

Dr Pallavi Devulapalli said trans rights had become an obvious totem in the new climate, and accused the party of trying to purge anyone with gender-critical views.

Devulapalli, a GP and member of King's Lynn and West Norfolk council, was expelled from the party for a rules breach that she has said was due to her beliefs on gender. Her expulsion this month, she said, has exposed a rift in the party's leadership on transgender issues that threatens to widen during this summer's leadership election.

The party's current co-leader Adrian Ramsay, who has argued that members should not be thrown out for saying trans women are not women, is pressing internally for Devulapalli's expulsion to be reviewed.

A Green party spokesperson said: “We don't comment on individual cases.”

Devulapalli was suspended last September, three months after she failed to back the party's manifesto policy on the right of self-identification for trans people during a hustings event. Last week she was informed she had been expelled from the party after attending what Devulapalli said she thought was a social gathering, but which a disciplinary panel deemed was an official party event from which she was banned because of her suspension.

Devulapalli said the move was a “pretext” to get rid of her. She said: “They don't like my stance on trans self ID and the trans women policy. They didn't come out and say that so they expelled me on a technicality.”

She added: “It feels like a purge. We've seen the Greens veer away from its original founding culture towards a much more leftwing authoritarian culture. If you say or think the wrong thing then you're out – that's really worrying.”

Devulapalli is now one of 25 “Greens in Exile” – former party members who have been suspended or expelled largely for their gender critical views. Last year a court found the party had removed Dr Shahrar Ali as a party spokesperson in a procedurally unfair way that discriminated against him because of his gender critical belief. In 2021, Ali's position as spokesperson is understood to have prompted Siân Berry, now an MP, to quit as co-leader.

Devulapalli said the party's belief that trans women are women was “peddling a falsehood”, adding: “It denies science and denies reality and alienates the Greens from the vast majority of voters who know the truth when they see it.”

Following April's supreme court ruling that a “woman” in the Equality Act refers only to a biological woman, the Greens' policy has come under strain. In interviews since, Ramsay, who is standing again as co-leader with fellow MP Ellie Chowns, has refused to commit to an answer, but Carla Denyer, who is standing down as co-leader, has said that “trans women are women [and] trans men are men”. Zack Polanski, a leadership challenger, is campaigning on the slogan “trans rights are human rights”.

Devulapalli fears that if Polanski wins, the party will become more “authoritarian” and less tolerant of gender critical views as it tries to appeal to disillusioned Labour supporters. She said: “A lot of members have said they will leave the party if he's elected. People are trying to reclaim the Greens back to being a party of democratic values and science.”

Since her expulsion Devulapalli says she has had dozens of messages of support, including from fellow GPs and prominent Greens such as the party's former candidate for London mayor Jenny Jones and another former Green party health spokesperson, Larry Sanders, who called for “debate not expulsion”.

Devulapalli said accusations of transphobia, which she denies, had contributed to a culture of fear within the party. “People are afraid of being bullied online and being cast out of the party. But speaking up calmly, rationally and with compassion is important.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Less than half of working age women are employed across the Pacific Islands due to outdated laws and other barriers, the World Bank said in a new report yesterday, adding that closing the gender gap could boost economic growth.

The World Bank economic update for the Pacific also forecast regional growth slowing to 2.6 percent this year, from 5.5 percent in 2023.

With 57 percent or about 500,000 women not working across the Pacific Islands, the report said that boosting female participation to the same level as men could lift the region's GDP by 22 percent by lifting household incomes and supporting private-sector growth.

In Fiji, the biggest Pacific Islands economy, the boost to GDP could be 30 percent, it said.

The gender gap in the labor market exists, despite women attaining similar education levels as men, and could be partly attributed to social norms, it said.

Six countries did not have paid parental leave, often forcing women to leave the workforce when they started families, it said.

In the energy sector, which is under pressure to expand its workforce, as islands upgrade infrastructure and transition to renewables, the World Bank found that women held less than 19 percent of jobs across 12 Pacific countries, and fewer than 5 percent of well-paid technical roles.

“Ignoring women as part of that pool is just not good business sense,” World Bank senior social development specialist Helle Buchhave said in an interview.

“We are working with them to increase women's employment in the sector,” she added.

The World Bank has recommended gender targets and said governments should remove outdated restrictions that prevent women working in some countries, including safety restrictions in some industries, and bans on women working at night in countries including the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.

“It's not part of today's world — that kind of protection of women in the labor force ignores the fact that safety is for both men and women,” Buchhave said.

Five countries — Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu — lack legal protections against gender-based discrimination in employment, the report said.

The remote atoll nation of Kiribati had the best legal workplace protections for women, it said.

“Closing the workforce gender gap is one of the highest-impact reforms Pacific governments can pursue,” World Bank senior economist Ekaterine Vashakmadze said.



                                                                                Former Nicaraguan president Violeta Chamorro, who brought peace to Nicaragua after years of war and was the first woman elected president in the Americas, died on Saturday at the age of 95, her family said. 
Chamorro, who ruled the poor Central American country from 1990 to 1997, “died in peace, surrounded by the affection and love of her children,” said a statement issued by her four children. 
As president, Chamorro ended a civil war that had raged for much of the 1980s as US-backed rebels known as the “Contras” fought the leftist Sandinista government. That conflict made Nicaragua one of                                    


COMPETITION: 
                                        The US and Russia make up about 90 percent of the world stockpile and are adding new versions, while China's nuclear force is steadily rising, SIPRI said                                        Most of the world's nuclear-armed states continued to modernize their arsenals last year, setting the stage for a new nuclear arms race, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said yesterday.
Nuclear powers including the US and Russia — which account for about 90 percent of the world's stockpile — had spent time last year “upgrading existing weapons and adding newer versions,” researchers said.
Since the end of the Cold War, old warheads have generally been dismantled quicker than new ones have been deployed, resulting in a decrease in the overall number of warheads. However, SIPRI said that the trend was likely                                    


NUCLEAR WARNING:
                                        Elites are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers, perhaps because they have access to shelters, Tulsi Gabbard said                                        After a trip to Hiroshima, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday warned that “warmongers” were pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war.
Gabbard did not specify her concerns.
Gabbard posted on social media a video of grisly footage from the world's first nuclear attack and of her staring reflectively at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial.
On Aug. 6, 1945, the US obliterated Hiroshima, killing 140,000 people in the explosion and by the end of the year from the uranium bomb's effects.

Taiwan has risen two spots to sixth place out of 69 major economies in the latest World Competitiveness Ranking report published by the Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD).

Taiwan also retained its position as the world's most competitive economy among economies with populations of more than 20 million for the fifth consecutive year, the annual report released yesterday showed.

The index is based on four factors: economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure — each of which include five subfactors based on different criteria.

Taiwan's overall improvement in the rankings was attributed to a significant rise in the economic performance category, in which it advanced 16 places to 10th.

It remained strong in the other three categories, moving up two spots to fourth in business efficiency, and remaining eighth in government efficiency and 10th in infrastructure.

Taiwan's rise in the economic performance category was largely the result of its advancement in the “domestic economy” subfactor, in which it surged from 13th to fourth. 

That in turn was driven by indicators such as real GDP growth per capita, in which it rose 28 positions to fourth, reaching 4.68 percent.

In the international trade subfactor, Taiwan climbed from 48th to 30th, bolstered by growth in goods exports (ranked eighth, up 9.72 percent) and services exports (28th, up 8.95 percent).

The report also cited challenges Taiwan would face this year, which IMD said were provided by the National Development Council. 

These include the need to “deepen international cooperation to enhance strategic positioning in the global value chain,” “diversify export markets ... to strengthen economic resilience” and “integrate AI [artificial intelligence] with industries to enhance productivity and competitiveness.”

The council said the government would continue using the IMD rankings as a reference for policy reform, particularly in the face of global uncertainties such as Washington's new tariff policies.


BUILDUP: 
                                        US General Dan Caine said Chinese military maneuvers are not routine exercises, but instead are ‘rehearsals for a forced unification' with Taiwan                                        China poses an increasingly aggressive threat to the US and deterring Beijing is the Pentagon's top regional priority amid its rapid military buildup and invasion drills near Taiwan, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday.
“Our pacing threat is communist China,” Hegseth told the US House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense during an oversight hearing with US General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
“Beijing is preparing for war in the Indo-Pacific as part of its broader strategy to dominate that region and then the world,” Hegseth said, adding that if it succeeds, it could derail

The Ministry of Economic Affairs' International Trade Administration has included Huawei, SMIC and several of their subsidiaries in an update of its so-called strategic high-tech commodities entity list, the latest version on its Web site showed on Saturday. 
It did not publicly announce the change.

CRITICISM: 
                                        It is generally accepted that the Straits Forum is a CCP ‘united front' platform, and anyone attending should maintain Taiwan's dignity, the council said                                        The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) yesterday said it deeply regrets that former president Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) echoed the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) “one China” principle and “united front” tactics by telling the Straits Forum that Taiwanese yearn for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to move toward “peace” and “integration.” 
The 17th annual Straits Forum yesterday opened in Xiamen, China, and while the Chinese Nationalist Party's (KMT) local government heads were absent for the first time in 17 years, Ma attended the forum as “former KMT chairperson” and met with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chairman Wang Huning (王滬寧).

Shoigu to meet Kim again

Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu yesterday met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the second time in less than two weeks during a visit to North Korea, Interfax reported. Negotiations between Kim and Shoigu have begun, Interfax quoted the council as saying, but did not specify the subject of their talks. Shoigu previously visited Pyongyang and met Kim on March 21 and June 4. Kim and President Vladimir Putin signed a strategic partnership treaty last year, including a mutual defense pact. North Korea sent thousands of soldiers late last year to help Russia expel Ukrainian troops from its western Kursk region.

‘Chair smasher' wanted

A museum in Verona has launched a manhunt for the most unlikely of outlaws — two clumsy middle-aged tourists who managed to almost wreck a work of art while posing for photos. Video footage released by Palazzo Maffei showed the hapless pair photographing each other pretending to sit on a crystal-covered chair made by the artist Nicola Bolla — described by the museum as an “extremely fragile” work. While the woman squats, but does not seem to touch the work — known as Van Gogh's Chair and covered in Swarovski crystals — the man is not so careful, sitting and then stumbling backward as the seat buckles under his weight. The pair can then be seen fleeing the room, in a post that went viral over the weekend. Describing it as “every museum's nightmare,” the museum on Monday said it had file a complaint with the police. The incident happened fewer than four weeks ago and the chair has since been repaired, it said on social media on Thursday. “It was an idiotic thing to do,” Bolla told Italian magazine Fanpage. However, the artist added that he could also see a “positive side” to the incident. “It's like a kind of performance. Ordinary people can do it, too, not just artists.”

Murder suspects arrested

Two suspects allegedly involved in the murder of an Australian man at a villa in Bali were caught after a days-long manhunt, police said yesterday. Zivan Radmanovic, 32, was shot on Saturday. He was killed when two people burst into his villa in the tourist area of Canggu and at least one opened fire. A second man, 34-year-old Sanar Ghanim, was seriously wounded in the attack. One of the suspects was apprehended in the capital, Jakarta, while a second was on his way from abroad, National Police Chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo told reporters, without identifying the country or giving details about the suspects. The arrests were made following cooperation between Indonesian police, immigration authorities and the Australian Federal Police, he said. Witnesses, including Radmanovic's wife, said the perpetrators who fled the scene after the attack were speaking in English with a thick Australian accent, a local police statement said.

Perry's doctor to admit guilt

The main doctor charged in connection with the drug overdose of Friends star Matthew Perry is expected to enter a guilty plea in the coming weeks, the Department of Justice said on Monday.  Salvador Plasencia “has agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, which carries a statutory maximum sentence of 40 years in federal prison,” it said in a statement. The second doctor in the case, Mark Chavez, pleaded guilty in October last year to conspiring to distribute ketamine in the weeks before the actor was found dead in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home in 2023. Plasencia allegedly bought ketamine from Chavez and sold it to the actor at hugely inflated prices. “I wonder how much this moron will pay,” Plasencia wrote in one text message presented by prosecutors. He went to Perry's home to administer ketamine by injection, a plea deal published on Monday by the department showed. In total, Plasencia distributed 20 vials of ketamine over a roughly two-week period in autumn 2023, the document said. Perry had been taking ketamine as part of supervised therapy for depression.



                                                                                Former Nicaraguan president Violeta Chamorro, who brought peace to Nicaragua after years of war and was the first woman elected president in the Americas, died on Saturday at the age of 95, her family said. 
Chamorro, who ruled the poor Central American country from 1990 to 1997, “died in peace, surrounded by the affection and love of her children,” said a statement issued by her four children. 
As president, Chamorro ended a civil war that had raged for much of the 1980s as US-backed rebels known as the “Contras” fought the leftist Sandinista government. That conflict made Nicaragua one of                                    


COMPETITION: 
                                        The US and Russia make up about 90 percent of the world stockpile and are adding new versions, while China's nuclear force is steadily rising, SIPRI said                                        Most of the world's nuclear-armed states continued to modernize their arsenals last year, setting the stage for a new nuclear arms race, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said yesterday.
Nuclear powers including the US and Russia — which account for about 90 percent of the world's stockpile — had spent time last year “upgrading existing weapons and adding newer versions,” researchers said.
Since the end of the Cold War, old warheads have generally been dismantled quicker than new ones have been deployed, resulting in a decrease in the overall number of warheads. However, SIPRI said that the trend was likely                                    


NUCLEAR WARNING:

Gabbard did not specify her concerns.
Gabbard posted on social media a video of grisly footage from the world's first nuclear attack and of her staring reflectively at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial.
On Aug. 6, 1945, the US obliterated Hiroshima, killing 140,000 people in the explosion and by the end of the year from the uranium bomb's effects.
Three days later, a US plane dropped a plutonium bomb on Nagasaki, leaving abut 74,000 people dead by the

The Associated Press

14:38 JST, June 17, 2025

PARIS (AP) — The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic — but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.

It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures — paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.

Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.

“It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,” said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. “Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.”

The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world's most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.

Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols — a theatrical bid to “cool down” runaway tourism.

The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called “untenable” working conditions.

It's rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes — including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.

What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over — water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.

But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.

“We can't wait six years for help,” said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. “Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art — it's about the people protecting it.”

At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa — a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.

Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des États, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her — works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.

“You don't see a painting,” said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. “You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.”

Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the “Louvre New Renaissance,” promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.

“Conditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,” Macron said in January.

But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre's annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade — even as visitor numbers soared.

“We take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,” Sefian said, “but when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.”

While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited “masterpiece route” for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.

The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year — more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.

In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are “no longer watertight,” that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs — food, restrooms, signage — fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as “a physical ordeal.”

“What began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,” Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.

The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.

But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.

Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo — neither fully funded nor fully functional.

President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.

Until then, France's greatest cultural treasure — and the millions who flock to see it — remain caught between the cracks.

The Tohoku Shinkansen line, which had suspended operation between Tokyo and Sendai stations, resumed at around 5 p.m on Tuesday.

The suspension came after a train, out of service at the time, malfunctioned while running between Utsunomiya and Nasu-Shiobara stations on the Shinkansen line.

Another Shinkansen train with about 680 passengers on board was affected, left stranded between the stations. Another Shinkansen train stopped adjacent to the affected train and the passengers transferred over using a crossing board.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated as new details emerge.

At least 10 people have been killed and 124 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17.

Ukraine's National Police initially reported 15 fatalities, but Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later revised the figure to 10.

He noted that operational data may change, as body parts found during rescue efforts can be mistakenly recorded as multiple victims.

The almost nine-hour-long attack saw Moscow's forces launch large numbers of kamikaze attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine's capital.

Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported the sounds of drones, missiles, and multiple rounds of explosions throughout the night.

The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia launched 472 aerial weapons overnight, including nearly 280 Shahed-type attack drones and two Kinzhal ballistic missiles. The strike primarily targeted Kyiv.

Ukraine's air defense forces reportedly destroyed 428 air targets, including 239 Shahed drones and 15 Kh-101 cruise missiles. Air defenses also intercepted one Kinzhal missile, while another was reportedly lost from radar tracking.

15 people have been killed and at least 124 people have been injured, according to the latest reports.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault ""one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv,"" saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. 

""Such attacks are pure terrorism,"" he said in a statement on social media. ""And the whole world, the U.S., and Europe must finally respond as civilized societies respond to terrorists.""

Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block.

In a video posted on Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said cluster munitions had been found in one area of the city. He later added that June 18 would be an official day of mourning in Kyiv.

Many of the deaths and injuries occured when a Russian missile hit a nine-storey residential building in the Solomianskyi district, ""completely destroying"" one section, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said.

""I saw the missile because it was low,"" Olena Kushnirova, a 46-year-old  nurse who lives in a neighboring building to the one that was hit, told the Kyiv Independent.

""I grabbed my daughter by the hand and shouted 'run!' It was literally 15 seconds. We ran to the toilet and it then there was a very powerful explosion.""

During the attack on the capital, a 62-year-old U.S. citizen died in the Solomianskyi district in a building across from where medics were assisting the injured, Klitschko reported. Medical personnel confirmed biological death.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a ""massive and brutal strike"" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit.

""Putin does this on purpose... He sends a signal of total disrespect to the United States and other partners who have called for an end to the killing,"" Sybiha said. ""Only strong steps and real pressure on Moscow can prove him wrong.""

A Russian drone also hit a multi-storey building Darnytskyi District.

""At first there was shock,"" Tatiana Bratus, a 50-year-old resident of the building told the Kyiv Independent.

""People started running outside, shouting, some in panic, because the attack wasn't over yet. They said there were still rockets flying. People ran to the bomb shelter.

A kindergarten in the Darnytskyi district was also damaged, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration said. No casualties were reported at the site. 

The upper floors of residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts were also damaged.  

A dormitory at the Kyiv Aviation Institute was hit by drones during the attack, the news outlet Suspilne reported. Drones struck the institute's 10th floor and broke windows on three others.

Outside the capital, the attacks also caused damage and injured civilians in Kyiv Oblast towns. At least one woman was injured and multiple homes damaged, according to the regional administration. 

The Russian strike damaged the production facility of Fahrenheit, a Ukrainian clothing manufacturer that supplies apparel and undergarments for both civilians and the military. The company announced it was forced to cancel all current orders and suspend new ones indefinitely following the destruction of its Kyiv site.

Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) freight train carrying grain. Several railcars overturned, temporarily halting operations and spilling grain from the damaged wagons. Ukrzaliznytsia said the damage would be ""promptly repaired"" and train traffic would not be affected.

Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, reported the destruction of two of its branches in Kyiv during the attack, according to CEO Ihor Smiliansky. The company's team is working to ""quickly restore services,"" he said. 

The attack followed a series of drone strikes overnight on June 16 targeting Kyiv Oblast, including both the capital and surrounding settlements. In the Obukhiv district, a 60-year-old man was injured, according to regional authorities.  

Russian attacks against Ukraine have intensified in May and June, with Moscow launching several record-breaking mass strikes against Kyiv and other cities. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

A U.S. government working group that formulated strategies for pressuring Russia into peace talks and ending the war in Ukraine has been disbanded by the White House, Reuters reported on June 17.

Officials cited by the news outlet said it was established this spring but became increasingly irrelevant as it became clear U.S. President Donald Trump wasn't willing to apply any concrete pressure on Moscow during peace talks.

""It lost steam toward the end because the president wasn't there. Instead of doing more, maybe he wanted to do less,"" an anonymous official said.

As Ukraine and the U.S. continue to push for an unconditional ceasefire, Russia has maintained maximalist demands and rejected all such proposals.

At the same time it has escalated attacks on Ukrainian civilians, killing at least 15 people and injuring scores of others in the latest attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17.

Trump has expressed frustration with Moscow's intransigence and growing violence but has yet to impose any new sanctions on Russia.

On June 16 while speaking in Canada ahead of a G7 summit, Trump said barring Russia from the G8 for its invasion of Ukraine in 2017 had been a ""mistake.""

According to Reuters, the working group, staffed by officials from the National Security Council, State Department, Treasury Department, the Pentagon and intelligence community, was decimated in a purge of personnel around three weeks ago.

Trump pledged to ""stop the wars"" when he was elected U.S. president for the second time but after just five months in office, the world is a far more violent place.

As well as Russia escalating attacks on Ukraine, Israel and Iran are now locked in a conflict that further threatens stability in the Middle East.

Emergency services in Kyiv have recovered fragments of cluster munitions following the overnight Russian missile and drone attack on June 17, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported, calling it further evidence of Russia's ""genocide"" against Ukrainians.

""In the capital's Nyvky neighborhood, emergency workers are now finding these kinds of cluster munition parts,"" Klitschko said in a statement shared on social media. ""Another clear sign of the genocide Russia is committing against Ukrainians.""

Cluster munitions are banned under international law by more than 100 countries due to their indiscriminate nature and the long-term threat they pose to civilians, especially when unexploded submunitions remain hidden in residential areas.

While Russia and Ukraine are not signatories to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, international humanitarian organizations have repeatedly condemned the use of such weapons in populated areas. Ukraine uses cluster munitions on the battlefield against Russian forces. 

The mayor's comments came hours after one of the largest and deadliest attacks on the Ukrainian capital in months, in which at least 15 people were killed and nearly 100 injured. The Russian strike, which lasted nearly nine hours, included waves of kamikaze drones, ballistic missiles, and what authorities now confirm were banned explosive parts.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault ""one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv,"" saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. 

""Such attacks are pure terrorism,"" he said in a statement on social media. ""And the whole world, the U.S., and Europe must finally respond as civilized societies respond to terrorists.""

Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block. 

He added that strikes also hit Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, and Kyiv regions. ""Fifteen people are confirmed dead. My condolences to their families and loved ones,"" Zelensky said. 

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a ""massive and brutal strike"" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit, which is taking place in Canada on June 16-17. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The leaders of the Group of Seven countries have provisionally agreed to work together to rapidly develop global supply chains for critical minerals in an effort to reduce their reliance on China for key industrial inputs. 

The G7 countries will establish an “action plan,” with the aim of setting standards for critical minerals markets and providing funding for new mines and downstream processing facilities, according to a draft document seen by The Globe and Mail.

Critical minerals are high on the agenda for the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta., and the importance of securing supply is something all the attendees agree on – even as they quarrel over trade and tariffs. The document has not been formally signed by the leaders.

Critical minerals, which include lithium, cobalt, nickel and rare earth elements, are used in a wide range of advanced technologies, ranging from electric vehicles to smartphones to military hardware. Most of the supply for these metals, however, is controlled by Chinese companies and state entities, which own mines around the world and do the lion's share of processing for many critical minerals in China.

This concentrated supply chain has been a concern for Western countries for years, and Canada and other G7 countries already have policies aimed at bolstering domestic supply chains. 

However, it has become a pressing issue in recent months, after Beijing's decision to temporarily restrict the export of rare earth elements as part of its trade war with Washington. This caused a panic among car makers and other manufacturers who use industrial magnets made of rare earths. 

While China agreed last week to resume rare-earth shipments, the episode has concentrated minds in Washington and other Western capitals. 

“We recognize non-market policies and practices in the critical minerals sector threaten our ability to acquire many critical minerals, including the rare earth elements needed for magnets, that are vital for industrial production,” the draft document says, without explicitly naming China. 

“We will work together and with partners beyond the G7 to swiftly protect our economic and national security. This will include anticipating critical minerals shortages, coordinating responses to deliberate market disruption, and diversifying and onshoring, where possible, mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling,” it says. 

As part of the action plan the countries will work on setting standards for the critical minerals market, with a focus on labour and environmental standards and anti-corruption measures. These standards can be wielded to limit market access for certain countries and companies. 

The plan also involves boosting financing for mines, processing facilities and infrastructure in friendly developing countries, with capital from export credit agencies and multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank. 

Canada is a meaningful producer of some critical minerals – it's the sixth biggest producer of nickel, supplying around 4.5 per cent of global production, for instance. But many of its abundant critical minerals remain untapped in the ground, and the country has little refining capacity. 

“We have a lot of the raw resources here in Canada and elsewhere in parts of the G7, but we have really lost momentum and lost the race to develop the processing capacity and the supply chain to guarantee those for our member countries,” said Matthew Holmes, head of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. 

Canada stands to benefit from an international effort to develop non-Chinese supplies, he said. And a focus on critical minerals could provide a point for collaboration with the United States as both countries look to establish a new framework for trade and security. 

“They recognize Canada has the raw resources but needs to develop the processing so that both economies can benefit from that. The U.S. is already putting millions, if not billions, into our critical mineral space. I think there is the foundation for us to do more there,” Mr. Holmes said. 

Alongside critical minerals, the G7 leaders are discussing other industries, including artificial intelligence and quantum computing. 

The group will not be releasing a joint communiqué at the end of the summit, to avoid highlighting disagreements over trade and antagonizing U.S. President Donald Trump. Instead, they plan to release several shorter documents focused on specific issues.

Volvo, Sweden's last big car company, is in trouble and that's bad news for loyal fans of its station wagons. They've already started disappearing from the company's showrooms and soon only one model will be left.

Blame Americans – and not just for falling in love with SUVs and kicking station wagons to the curb. Volvo's current problems have much to do with the chaotic U.S.-led trade war and the slowing rate of EV adoption. 

Volvo planned to be an electric-only automaker by 2030 but abandoned that target last year. Making matters worse is that Volvo is among the most tariff-exposed European automakers. All but one of its cars (the U.S.-built EX90) are made in Europe and therefore subject to hefty U.S. tariffs. While Volvo can import cars to Canada without additional fees, the much bigger prize is obviously the U.S. market.

The company's meticulously boxy designs always had a whiff of tweed-jacket-with-elbow-patches.Matt Bubbers/The Globe and Mail

The company announced some major changes in recent months to cope with the growing geopolitical complexity. In late March, Volvo ousted its chief executive officer Jim Rowan, who lasted roughly three years, and brought back former CEO Hakan Samuelsson. The board said in a release that it believes the company is “best served by leadership with deep industrial experience, deep knowledge of our group, and a proven ability to execute in challenging environments.” 

Weeks later, Volvo withdrew its earnings forecast, announced a plan to cut costs, restructure its U.S. operations and cozy up to Chinese parent company Geely to find efficiencies.

All the belt tightening at Volvo doesn't bode well for the future of its niche station wagons in the U.S. and, by extension, in Canada. And that's a shame because, for decades, Volvo has been a consistent, reliable source of station wagons – even as their popularity waned.

Volvo's boxy designs always had a tweed-jacket-with-elbow-patches look about them, but that became part of the appeal for nostalgic millennials. There was something fashionable in the resolutely unfashionable design of Volvo's older wagons.

Jan Wilsgaard, a designer at Volvo from 1950 to 1990, presided over most of the company's now-classic wagons. He never chased trends. His frequently cited quote, “There is often beauty in functionality. Natural, uncomplicated solutions based on sound common sense are often the most attractive ones as well,” should be enshrined at company headquarters.

His words apply to Volvo's modern wagons as well. But sadly, they're already dying off. Volvo quietly cut two wagons from its lineup recently – the regular V90 and V60. The full-size V90 wagon was among the best-looking new cars on the market. 

Unlike most other new car designs, the V90 wasn't trying to be aggressive or sporty. The cabin was clean and elegant, not to mention downright palatial. Sure, the infotainment system could be laggy and there was a steep learning curve. The V90's steering felt lifeless and, no matter what engine was under the hood, it wasn't a fun car to drive quickly. 

Despite all that, the V90 was, for me at least, always among the most desirable new cars on the market. 

The smaller V60 never reached the same heights. I could never get over why Volvo's engineers chose to make this distinctly un-sporty station wagon ride like a sports car. It was just too stiff. But being at least $10,000 cheaper than the V90, it was always appealing.

That leaves two wagons: the jacked-up SUV-adjacent versions of the V60 and V90 that carry the overly aspirational Cross Country moniker.

But wait, there's more bad news. A spokesperson from Volvo Car Canada confirmed V90 Cross Country production will end this year. Since its arrival in 2016, the V90 CC has had a spot on my personal running list of the best new cars on the market. 

At $70,550, it's definitely a luxury car, but the high price is its only serious fault. The Cross Country's added ride height made it easier to drive over ice-encrusted streets in winter and gave the ride some extra cushion. 

The Volvo didn't try to do too much; it was content being a nice, practical family car, distinguished by the fact the people who made it clearly put thought into every minor detail.

The same can be said of Volvo's last remaining wagon, the V60 Cross Country. If you go to Volvo's website, you have to dig to find it. It's practically hidden, but it's still there, for now.

The V60 CC starts at $54,800, roughly on par with the legions of compact and midsize luxury SUVs, which are its only real competition. (For reference, the BMW's X3 starts at just under $63,000 while the smaller Lexus NX comes in at $54,155.)

Compared to its big brother, the V90, the V60 CC's cabin feels slightly claustrophobic. The centre console and dashboard loom large. Despite that, the V60 still lacks useful centre console storage; two cup-holders and Volvo's large crystalline gear shifter take up most of the space. 

Apart from those minor gripes, the luxurious cabin is a lovely place to be. The hatchback trunk is, as you'd expect, more than capable of swallowing giant strollers and suitcases with ease.

What's it like to drive? The Cross Country is much better suited to broken city pavement than the standard V60 was. It's not a plush ride, but comfortable enough at low speeds and a real kilometre-crusher on the highway. 

The steering is lifeless (as expected) and the only remaining engine option is a modest four-cylinder hybrid with 247 horsepower and 288 lb-ft of torque that gets the job done – but only just. (The engine is arguably a downgrade from the brilliant turbocharged and supercharged four-cylinder originally available on the V60.)

Issues of steering feel and extra power tend to bother car critics, but for daily commutes and those shuttling a family around, the V60 CC is (still) an excellent all-around choice. 

Aesthetically, make up your own mind, but for my money it's cooler looking than any SUV anywhere near the price. But, I admit, station wagons are an acquired taste.

It's not clear how much longer Volvo's last wagon will survive. The V60 arrived in 2018, and given the typical seven-year product lifecycle, it's due for retirement. 

With Volvo's current troubles – cost-cutting, EV uncertainty and tariff woes – creating an all-new wagon is likely not the priority. 

That would be a mistake. Without a station wagon, Volvo will not only alienate many of its loyal customers but also risk losing its brand identity and becoming lost in the overcrowded luxury car market. Amid the chaos he inherited, hopefully Volvo's reinstated CEO understands that.

Prime Minister Mark Carney delivers opening remarks at the first session of the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Alta., on Monday.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

The Group of Seven countries released a statement Monday supporting Israel and condemning Iran as both countries launched fresh attacks on each other.

G7 Leaders are currently meeting a summit in Canada's Rocky Mountains.

The United States signed on to the statement even though U.S. President Donald Trump quit the G7 Leaders summit early Monday night, citing the tensions in the Mideast.

“We, the leaders of the G7, reiterate our commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East,” the G7 countries said. 

Members include the United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, France, Canada and Italy.

“In this context, we affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself. We reiterate our support for the security of Israel,” the G7 said.

Conversely, the group labelled Iran as the “principal source of regional instability and terror,” adding “we have been consistently clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon.”

Iran is also an ally of Russian President Vladimir Puttin helping him wage war on Ukraine by supplying him with equipment and weapons.

The G7 said it wants the resolution of the Iranian crisis to lead to a “broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza.”

The latest Israel-Iran conflict began last week when Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities and killed senior members of its military. 

Oil prices have so far not spiked but the Group of Seven said they are ready to respond if necessary.

“We will remain vigilant to the implications for international energy markets and stand ready to coordinate, including with like-minded partners, to safeguard market stability,” the group said.

Russia and Iran have long been economic and strategic partners. But despite a new defense pact, the Kremlin is unlikely to offer military aid to Iran in the conflict with Israel.

Since Israel began its recent attacks on Iran's nuclear infrastructure, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been in touch with world leaders about the conflict.

Right after the start of Israel's attacks last Friday, Putin spoke with both the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Kremlin said.

In a statement on the Kremlin's website, the Russian leader ""expressed his condolences to the leadership and people of Iran over the numerous human casualties"" and ""emphasized that Russia condemns Israel's actions, which were carried out in violation of the UN Charter and international law.""

The next day, Putin once again condemned Israel's operation during a phone call with US President Donald Trump, a staunch supporter of Netanyahu.

Yet despite Russia's deepening alliance with Iran, the Kremlin is unlikely to provide military aid to its strategic partner.

Given the economic ties between Russia and Iran, Putin's rebuke of Israel for attacking the Islamic Republic does not come as a surprise.

Iran has long been a close partner of Russia, not least because Western democracies heavily sanction both countries. Iran also recently joined BRICS, a group of non-Western nations with emerging economies that Russia helped to found.

Their relationship grew even closer after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Western allies accused Iran of supplying Russia with military drones, which were eventually used to attack Ukraine's civilian infrastructure as well. According to media reports, Moscow may have paid for the drones with at least 1.8 tons of gold bars, worth around $104 million, transferred to the Iranian company Sahara Thunder. Iran may also have asked Russia to help it realize its nuclear program.

Analysts believe Moscow wouldn't want to lose such a reliable partner.

""The Kremlin is acting according to an old Quranic principle: 'Fight and wage war, but do not transgress,'"" Ruslan Suleymanov, a Middle East analyst based in Cairo, Egypt, tells DW. ""In other words, Moscow, which has its interests and presence in the Middle East, would prefer to avoid any kind of uncontrollable chaos in the region.""

Following the launch of Israel's attacks in Iran, the Iranian parliament ratified the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Russia. The deal was signed initially by the presidents of both countries in January and approved by the Russian parliament two months ago.

Despite its ambitious name, the treaty falls short of establishing a mutual defense pact. It does not oblige either side to provide military assistance in the event of an attack. Instead, it simply commits both parties to refrain from aiding their adversaries.

Middle East analyst Marianna Belenkaya, who left Russia after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and now resides in Israel, believes Moscow is highly unlikely to offer Iran any direct military support, at least not in any official or public capacity.

""It has no need to, especially as it is trying to restore or improve relations with Washington, although some behind-the-scenes involvement can't be ruled out entirely."" Belenkaya reckons.

Belenkaya says Putin is sincere in his recent public offers to act as a mediator between Iran and its opponents. According to her, Putin reportedly advised Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to return to the negotiating table last year.

Trump said in a recent interview with the US news network ABC News that he was open to Russia mediating the Israel-Iran conflict.

Belenkaya believes that Russia, ""probably can't put pressure on Iran the way the US did,"" as a mediator, ""but it can serve as a channel of communication.""

During the indirect talks between the US and Iran in April, Russia was indeed expected to play a significant role in the event of a nuclear deal with Iran. The Guardian newspaper reported that Moscow was being considered as a potential destination for Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium and could also serve as an impartial arbiter in case of any breaches in the agreement. This arrangement suggested that Russia would bring Iran's highly enriched uranium back to the country if the US breached the deal.

If such a deal were struck, Germany, France, and the UK, would lose their roles as guarantors under the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that Trump pulled the US out of in 2018.

At the same time, experts believe the Kremlin must be enjoying the West's distraction from its ongoing war against Ukraine. On Tuesday, Russia launched one of its deadliest attacks on Kyiv in recent months, killing 14 and injuring dozens.

At the same time, G7 leaders seek to tackle the Middle East escalation at the group's current summit in Canada. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had said beforehand that the issue would be ""very high on the agenda.""

Meanwhile, a June 17 meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appears to have been called off after Trump's early departure from the G7 summit.

Suleimanov, the Cairo-based Middle East analyst, underscored that it's in the Kremlin's best interest that American and European leaders are distracted from what's happening in Ukraine.

""Against this backdrop, Putin may seize the opportunity to launch an offensive or cause some other kind of trouble,"" Suleimanov said.

The Israeli Defense Ministry posted pictures of defense industry stands covered by black partition walls. The ministry slammed the move as ""outrageous and unprecedented."" 

Israeli defense industry exhibitions have been covered in black partition walls at the prestigious Paris Air Show, after reportedly failing to comply with a directive to remove offensive weapons from being displayed.

Israel's Defense Ministry posted up a statement on social media along with pictures, showing Israeli defense company stands sealed off with black walls, preventing anyone from seeing what lay behind the walls.

Rafael, Elbit and IAI produce guided bombs and missiles, while Uvision and Aeronautics produce drones.

Pictures posted up along with a statement by the Defense Ministry showed various weapons systems on display.

The incident comes as Israel trades deadly airstrikes with Iran and almost two years into its campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.

""The French are hiding behind supposedly political considerations to exclude Israeli offensive weapons from an international exhibition  — weapons that compete with French industries,"" the ministry said in a statement Monday, calling the action ""ugly and improper.""

The Reuters news agency cited a source familiar with the matter as saying the instruction to seal off the exhibits came from French authorities after Israeli firms failed to comply with a directive from a French security agency to remove offensive or kinetic weapons from the stands.

Israel's Defense Ministry said its director general, Amir Baram, had rejected the request.

In a statement, the ministry called the move an ""unprecedented decision, that gives off the scent of political and commercial considerations.""

Sylvain Pavillet, a lawyer working with the air show organizers, said the final decision on who is allowed to exhibit lies with the French government, not the show itself.

""The fair is not the one who decides which countries are allowed to go to the show or not,"" he told the Associated Press.

""That decision belongs to the government. We are not a state. We are a commercial company.""

While there has been no immediate comment from the French government regarding any move to block Israeli exhibitions, the air show's organiser said in a statement that it was in talks to try to help ""the various parties find a favourable outcome to the situation.""

Friday saw a French appeals court rule against activists who had been seeking to block Israeli companies from participation at the show due to the ongoing war in Gaza.

In recent weeks, French President Emmanuel Macron warned that a tougher position against Israel may be needed in light of the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Macron at the time warned that France would even consider sanctioning Israeli settlers.

Chinese authorities are carrying out rescue operations but the efforts have been complicated by a risk of additional explosions and the lack fo a large water source nearby.

An explosion at a fireworks factory in a village in central China's Hunan province has left at least nine people dead and 26 others injured, state-run National Radio said.

The blast occurred at 8:23 am local time (0:23 GMT) in the Hunan province on Monday. The reported death toll was as of 9 am (0:53 GMT) Tuesday, with rescue operation still ongoing.

The radio channel reported a ""complicated"" rescue effort as there was a risk of additional explosions. The factory was in a ""mountainous area with no large water source.""

""During more than 20 hours of uninterrupted and continuous rescue, the rescue team used remote-controlled water cannons to extinguish the fire,"" the report said.

China's Ministry of Emergency Management had sent a team to the Hunan province to oversee the rescue, state news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday.

""Efforts must be made to ascertain the cause of the explosion as soon as possible and to hold those responsible accountable,"" the ministry reportedly said.

Industrial accidents are a regular occurrence in China due to lax safety standards.

Just last month, at least five people died in an explosion in a chemical plant blast in the eastern Shandong province.

In 2019, at least 44 people died in a chemical plant fire in Jiangsu. In November of 2018, at least 22 died in a similar accident Zhangjiakou while 19 died in a chemical plant blast months before in the southwestern Sichuan province.

In 2015, blasts at warehouses containing flammable chemicals in the port city of Tianjin killed more than 170 people.

A doctor charged over Matthew Perry's drug overdose death has agreed to plead guilty, according to a court filing.

Salvador Plasencia will admit four counts of ketamine distribution following the death of the “Friends” actor in Oct 2023, the US justice department said on Monday.

The charges carry a statutory maximum sentence of up to 40 years in federal prison.

Mr Plasencia is one of the five people charged after Perry died aged 54 from the acute effects of ketamine and other factors that caused him to lose consciousness and drown in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home.

According to court documents, he said in a text message that he “wonder[ed] how much this moron will pay” for the drugs.

Mr Plasencia's plea agreement stated that he distributed 20 vials of ketamine, ketamine lozenges and syringes to Perry and the actor's assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, between Sept 30 and Oct 12 2023.

Mr Plasencia “admits that his conduct fell below the proper standard of medical care and that transfers of ketamine vials to Defendant Iwamasa and [Perry] were not for a legitimate medical purpose,” it stated.

Another doctor in the case, Mark Chavez, pleaded guilty last October to conspiring to distribute ketamine in the weeks before Perry's death.

Mr Plasencia allegedly bought ketamine off Mr Chavez and sold it to the “Friends” actor at hugely inflated prices, according to court filings.

Mr Iwamasa allegedly injected Perry more than 20 times with ketamine in the four days before he died, according to California prosecutors.

He pleaded guilty in August 2024 to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine causing death, the justice department said. He is scheduled to be sentenced in November.

Jasveen Sangha, the alleged “Ketamine Queen” who supplied drugs to high-end clients and celebrities, is charged with selling Perry the dose that killed him, and has pleaded not guilty.

Perry had publicly acknowledged struggle with drug addictions for decades, including the years he starred as Chandler Bing on “Friends”.

In 2018, he suffered a burst colon after overdosing on opioids and underwent multiple surgeries.

“I have mostly been sober since 2001, save for about sixty or seventy little mishaps,” he wrote in a memoir published in 2022.

For a long time, the only attacks you were likely to face as an American politician would come at the hands of the press or political rivals.

But with a rising tide of political violence across the country, lawmakers now have to confront the increasing likelihood they could be targeted by a gunman or have their homes burned down. By comparison, a stinging opinion column does not look so bad.

Attacks on politicians have become a regular occurrence – much like school shootings, which in other countries would have prompted a national reckoning, but in the US now struggle to make the news.

Experts say the US is becoming an increasingly fractious, polarised country where violence has become part of the political discourse.

Not so long ago, deadly attacks might at least have meant “thoughts and prayers” before the news cycle moved on. But now, politicians themselves are being accused of fanning the flames of the violence.

Critics say the deadly attacks are being used as pawns to one-up the other side.

In a country where four of its 47 presidents have been killed in office, the spectre of assassination is never that far away – but there are now fears the US is spiralling into a cycle of violence it will find impossible to escape.

Early on Saturday morning, Melissa Hortman, the Democrat speaker of Minnesota's House of Representatives, and her husband were gunned down by a man dressed as a police officer. John Hoffman, a Democrat state senator, and his wife were also shot, but are expected to survive.

Authorities located what appeared to be a hit list in the suspect's car which reportedly named 70 other Democrats and state abortion providers.

Vance Luther Boelter, who was arrested and charged on Monday, allegedly wrote a text to his family that read: “Dad went to war last night.”

The incident has ignited a flurry of conspiracy theories that threaten to overtake the outpouring of grief.

Laura Loomer, the Right-wing activist with the ear of Donald Trump, the president, suggested Boelter was a “goon” being used by Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, to assassinate politicians who disagreed with him.

Mr Walz, a pro-choice Democrat, was one of the names on the hit list.

One of the most memorable incidents was the attempt on Mr Trump's life when he was grazed by a bullet as he addressed a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year.

Just weeks after a second attempt on his life, Kamala Harris, Mr Trump's rival for the presidency last year, was roundly criticised for labelling him a “fascist” in a CNN town hall event.

A few months later, Secret Service agents intercepted a gunman lying in wait for the then-Republican candidate in the undergrowth at one of his golf courses.

Newly revealed court documents show that a further person has been detained for allegedly threatening to assassinate the president.

Peter Stinson, a former US Coast Guard lieutenant, was recently arrested following an investigation into multiple threats made against Mr Trump on social media involving guns, poisoning and knives, according to an affidavit filed by the FBI on Friday.

Colin Clarke, the research director at the Soufan Group, a security consultancy, attributes the recent surge in political attacks to “the highly divisive and partisan politics that has really taken over our country”.

“Many Americans view those that don't agree with them politically as enemies and adversaries, where they used to just be neighbours with different politics,” he said. “Everything is existential and everything is zero sum.”

Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator and a friend of Hortman, was one of the few voices urging all sides of the political divide to lower the temperature after Saturday's killings.

“At some point, you've got to look in the mirror when you look at what's going on here – every single elected official does,” she said.

John Horgan, a terrorism expert at Georgia State University, said that although the US had experienced waves of political violence in the past, he was anxious that politicians had started whipping up unrest themselves.

“A major cause for concern this time around is that we see our own politicians fanning the flames,” he said. “For me, the question isn't why are we seeing this – it's why aren't we seeing a lot more of it. I suspect we're going to see much more to come.”

Mike Lee, the Republican senator for Utah, has been roundly criticised after seemingly making fun of the Minnesota shooting while playing into conspiracy theories.

“Nightmare on Walz street,” he wrote as a caption to an image of the gunman, with a latex mask stretched over his head, standing on a doorstep in the moments before he opened fire.

Dr Clarke compared the surge in attacks on politicians to school shootings, which had become “part of the social fabric of our country”.

“It barely even makes the news unless the body count is high,” he said. “We've accepted it as part of our society, which I think is shameful… political violence, criminal violence, homicidal violence has become banal.”

In particular, he said, the media struggled to cover Left-wing violence, including demonstrators brandishing pro-Hamas and pro-Hezbollah on college campuses.

“I've tried to pitch articles and had them rejected, because I don't think it fits the narrative,” he said. “But if I want to write about jihadis, if I want to write about neo-Nazis – and I've published extensively on this – that's all fair game.”

Violence in the Middle East since the Oct 7 massacre has led to a series of aftershocks across the US.

Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, was forced to flee his home in April, during the festival of Passover, when it was firebombed while his family slept inside.

Mr Shapiro, one of the most high-profile Jewish politicians in the country, later condemned it as a “heinous act of anti-Semitism”.

In May, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, two Israeli embassy staffers, were killed in Washington, DC, allegedly by a man who afterwards chanted “free, free Palestine”.

In June, a man was charged with attempted murder when he hurled molotov cocktails at a pro-Israel demonstration, setting several people on fire. The oldest victim was 88 years old.

Many have drawn comparisons between the 2020s and the 1960s, a decade of political violence and campus unrest, although most of those demonstrations were fuelled by the Vietnam War rather than tensions in the Middle East.

Both John F Kennedy and Robert F Kennedy were killed – “Bobby” Kennedy, the younger brother, was shot by a Palestinian-Jordanian man over his pro-Israel stance – along with civil rights leaders Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.

The US, at least, isn't quite there yet – although Dr Clarke believes a “violent summer” is in store for the country.

Perhaps the US will be able to purge itself of the violent rhetoric and attacks that has come to infect its politics. Or perhaps, like school shootings, it will just become old news.

“Congress must make it clear that the United States will not be dragged into Netanyahu's war of choice,” Sanders said.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders late Monday led the introduction of a bill that would prevent the Trump administration from using federal funds for a military attack on Iran without explicit authorization from Congress, as Israel's unlawful assault on the country continued for the fifth consecutive day.

“Netanyahu's reckless and illegal attacks violate international law and risk igniting a regional war,” Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a statement. “Congress must make it clear that the United States will not be dragged into Netanyahu's war of choice.”

“Our Founding Fathers entrusted the power of war and peace exclusively to the people's elected representatives in Congress,” the senator added, “and it is imperative that we make clear that the president has no authority to embark on another costly war without explicit authorization by Congress.”

Seven Democratic senators — Peter Welch (Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), and Tina Smith (Minn.) — joined Sanders in introducing the legislation, which is titled the No War Against Iran Act.

The legislation states that “no federal funds may be obligated or expended for any use of military force in or against Iran” unless Congress declares war or enacts “specific statutory authorization for such use of military force.”

“Another war in the Middle East could cost countless lives, waste trillions more dollars, and lead to even more deaths, more conflict, and more displacement,” Sanders said Monday. “I will do everything that I can as a senator to defend the Constitution and prevent the U.S. from being drawn into another war.”

The bill came hours after Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) introduced a war powers resolution similarly aimed at preventing the Trump administration from launching an unauthorized attack on Iran. Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) announced plans to introduce a companion resolution in the House, a sign of burgeoning congressional opposition to a U.S. war with Iran.

“This is not our war,” Massie wrote on social media. “But if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution. I'm introducing a bipartisan war powers resolution tomorrow to prohibit our involvement.”

The legislative efforts kicked off as Israel expanded its aerial attacks on Iran and as Trump — who has suggested U.S. forces could get more deeply involved in the conflict — urged residents of the Iranian capital to “immediately evacuate,” heightening chaos and panic in the densely populated city and fueling concerns of American intervention.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) condemned Trump's evacuation call as “both reckless and disturbing,” noting that “Tehran is one of the most populous cities in the world, home to ten million people and many millions more in the surrounding suburbs.”

“While many have tried to flee Israel's campaign of terror, the fact is that many cannot flee — the elderly, or those who can't get gas amid war shortages, and those who have nowhere to go,” said NIAC. “We hope that this does not mean an unauthorized U.S. entry into the war, or that he has knowledge of further depraved attacks from Israel.”

“There is a choice before Trump: take the pathway of peace by telling Bibi to stop the war, or join with a war criminal and wreak further havoc and endanger U.S. troops in a fight that isn't ours,” the group added.

Across the country, immigrant workers are being met with surveillance, police repression, and political scapegoating.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

This story was originally published at Prism.

David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU)–United Service Workers West (USWW), was detained earlier this month for doing what every labor leader should be doing right now: showing up.

Huerta was arrested this month in Los Angeles while protesting citywide raids carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), exercising his right to speak out — something the labor movement has done for centuries. But because this was an immigration protest, and because Huerta is a bold, unapologetic advocate for immigrant workers, he was targeted and thrown to the ground in broad daylight.

As the executive director of the Committee of Interns and Residents (CIR), the nation's largest physicians' union and an affiliate of SEIU, I was shaken by Huerta's arrest, but I wasn't surprised. Many of our members are also immigrant workers. They are young doctors serving in public hospitals across the country, often with tenuous visa statuses, working long hours in chronically understaffed conditions. Like the janitors Huerta has spent his life organizing, these physicians hold up institutions that would collapse without their labor. And like so many others across industries, they're expected to stay silent, grateful, and invisible.

Huerta has always refused that expectation. He's not just the president of USWW; he's the heart of SEIU's Latino caucus and a respected member in our union. We call him our anchor because he's mentored generations of immigrant worker leaders. He's carried the legacy of the Justice for Janitors campaign with purpose and humility. He's challenged every administration — Republican or Democrat — on immigration and labor protections. And he's never let us forget that immigrant justice is worker justice.

That's why this arrest wasn't just an overreach; it's part of a broader pattern. Across the country, immigrant workers are being met with surveillance, police repression, and political scapegoating. In Georgia, ICE arrested poultry workers during workplace raids, raising fears and chilling future organizing. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis' anti-immigrant law SB 1718 pushes workers into the shadows, making their jobs more dangerous by deterring them from reporting wage theft and unsafe conditions. In New York, law enforcement has targeted delivery workers organizing for fair pay with questionable traffic enforcement and thousands of citations.

We see the same suppression across the U.S. Noncitizen resident physicians, many of them union members, are told by employers not to demand better staffing or speak out. When they do, they face retaliation and intimidation. Whether in scrubs or hard hats, immigrant workers are sent the same message: Stay quiet, don't organize, don't resist.

Huerta's detainment is an effort by ICE to send the same message. Because when someone like Huerta dares to bear public witness, it doesn't just threaten one protest — it threatens the entire system built on fear and exploitation.

Huerta is home now. But the fact that ICE would publicly detain someone with his visibility and institutional support simply for protesting should serve as the ultimate warning for anyone who believes in worker power.

Because if they can come for David Huerta, they will come for us.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s actions at the CDC “put U.S. families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,” they say.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

On Monday, the 17 former members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who were dismissed earlier this month by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published an op-ed decrying that decision, noting that action and his questionable replacements for the board would leave the country “critically weakened.”

The op-ed by the former ACIP members, the first time that they have collectively spoken out since being ousted, was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). 

ACIP is a panel of independent scientists and health experts that provides guidance to the CDC on the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Those recommendations are then reviewed by the director of the CDC, who has the final say on whether to adopt them. Currently, there is no director for the agency, which means Kennedy himself has the final say, for the time being.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Kennedy announced the dismissal of the previous board in a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier in June, claiming that a “clean sweep” of the board was needed “to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science.” He named eight new members to the board two days later, which prompted health experts to express concern about their expertise, many noting that several of the new ACIP members are vaccine skeptics and conspiracy theorists. 

The new members of ACIP are set to meet later this month to vote on vaccine recommendations relating to COVID, HPV, the flu, RSV, and more.

The 17 former members, comprising of health and science experts across various fields, stated that the ACIP has traditionally provided “a unified and trusted approach to vaccinations for the diverse array of immunization providers across the U.S.”

“For more than 60 years, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — codified in the federal regulations (42 USC 217a: advisory councils or committees) — has served as a panel of experts that reviews the most up-to-date evidence on vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (eg, against respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]), providing sound recommendations to the [CDC] regarding how vaccines should be used,” the former ACIP members said.

Kennedy's decision to abruptly dismiss them from the board and appoint eight new members two days later has “left the U.S. vaccine program critically weakened,” the group wrote, adding, “These actions have stripped the program of the institutional knowledge and continuity that have been essential to its success over decades.”

ACIP has provided an incredible service to the American people, the former board members said, writing that their work and the work of their predecessors over the past 30 years “likely prevented around 508 million lifetime cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1,129,000 deaths.”

The op-ed authors concluded by stating:

We are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of U.S. immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put U.S. families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses.

In addition to the letter from the former ACIP board members, a highly respected senior scientist at the CDC also announced her resignation from the agency, in protest over the recent actions taken by Kennedy.

“I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,” Fiona Havers, an expert on respiratory viruses who oversaw surveillance of nationwide outbreaks at the CDC, wrote in a letter to her colleagues.

While Kennedy has stated that his actions are necessary to restore confidence, polling shows that most Americans are unlikely to view him as trustworthy when it comes to health matters, especially vaccines. According to a Quinnipiac University poll published last week, only 38 percent of voters say they approve of Kennedy's work so far as HHS secretary, with 53 percent disapproving of his job performance. Additionally, only 5 percent of voters said they could trust him for guidance on vaccinations for themselves or their family members.

Israel's all-out attack on the nuclear weapons infrastructure and leadership of Iran has created a historic choice: Will Israel be allowed to defeat decisively the existential threat long posed by the tyrannical Iranian regime both to her people, and ours—and thereby usher in an era of potential strategic stability aligned with Western civilization that the Middle East and the free world have rarely known?

Or will the United States interfere, as it has done consistently in the past, to prevent such a clear-cut victory—and thereby ensure that Israel's enemies, and ours, live to ﬁght another day?

The answer is essentially up to President Donald Trump. How he comes down may depend on whether he is being properly informed of the options and opportunities versus their associated risks. Or is he being disserved by those who profess to speak for the America First movement, but actually seem to be putting Iran First and Qatar First?

“Well, considering that I'm the one that developed ‘America First,' and considering that the term wasn't used until I came along, I think I'm the one that decides that. For those people who say they want peace—you can't have peace if Iran has a nuclear weapon.

“So, for all of those wonderful people who don't want to do anything about Iran having a nuclear weapon—that's not peace.”

Presumably, that clarity will translate into further support for Israel's comprehensive take-down of the Iranian nuclear weapons program and its destruction of Iran's capacity to ﬁght on thanks to surviving second- and third-tier regime leadership—many of whom are reputed to be even more psychopathic and apocalyptic than those more senior clerics and officers thankfully neutralized to date.

Whether that is true may depend on the quality of the advice President Trump is receiving. In addition to non-official inﬂuencers and political commentators, he may be getting bad advice from an intelligence community that wrongly contends Iran does not have a nuclear weapons program and others who portray themselves as “nationalists,” “realists” and champions of “restraint.”

In fact, they are advocating a formula for a truly endless war in the Middle East. Stopping Israel from ﬁnishing the job—whether by cutting off the supply of weapons it requires to prosecute the war or by otherwise interfering with its pursuit—will mean that some residual nuclear program remains in the hands of Sharia supremacists who remain and are determined to destroy both Israel and the United States. The U.S. military will inevitably be required to contend with the calamity that will follow.

In other words, instead of an exemplary application of the Trump Doctrine, whereby our allies are strong and able decisively to defend their interests, and ours, in their dangerous neighborhoods with U.S. support (e.g., defensive support, intelligence, access to munitions, and political cover) but not direct, offensive engagement—we would have a true and costly quagmire.

This is a time when Trump must have access to his best military advice from Joint Chiefs Chairman General Daniel “Razin” Caine and Central Command's General Michael “Erik” Kurilla about both the opportunities, as well as the risks, associated with Israel having the time, wherewithal, and diplomatic leeway to pursue successfully a decisive victory.

Not least, the president is entitled to hear that the utter destruction of the Chinese communists' most important regional ally by ours is arguably the single most important step we can take at the moment to deter their aggression elsewhere. It may even translate into a decision on the part of members of the BRICS—especially South Africa—that it is not in their interest to advance the group's agenda of taking down the dollar as the world's reserve currency.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

As a Senior Adviser to the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs during the George W. Bush administration, he was involved in negotiating the U.S.-Indian civil nuclear agreement.

 Ashley J. Tellis

Since the turn of the century, the United States has sought to help India rise as a great power. During George W. Bush's presidency, Washington agreed to a major deal with New Delhi that offered support for India's civilian nuclear program despite the country's controversial development of nuclear weapons. Under the Obama administration, the United States and India began defense industrial cooperation that aimed to boost the latter's military capabilities and help it project power. During President Donald Trump's first term, the United States started sharing sensitive intelligence with India and made it eligible to receive advanced technologies previously reserved only for American allies; under President Joe Biden, Washington gave New Delhi sophisticated fighter jet engine technology. Each of these recent administrations deepened diplomatic, technological, and military cooperation with India, making good on Bush's promise “to help India become a major world power in the twenty-first century.”

The rationale for this pledge was simple. Washington wanted to transcend the rancor of the Cold War era that had divided the two great democracies. With the demise of the Soviet Union, India and the United States no longer had reason to be on opposite sides. Furthermore, they were increasingly tied by deep people-to-people connections, as Indian immigrants played a larger role in shaping the American economy and New Delhi's own post–Cold War economic reforms invited American firms and capital to Indian markets. Beneath these shifts lay a deeper geopolitical opportunity: Indian and U.S. officials recognized that they had many shared interests, including combating Islamist terrorism and, more important, addressing the dangers of a rising China while protecting the liberal international order. Washington correctly concluded that a stronger India would make for a stronger United States.

But India and the United States are not aligned on all issues. New Delhi does not want a world in which Washington is perpetually the sole superpower. Instead, it seeks a multipolar international system, in which India would rank as a genuine great power. It aims to restrain not just China—the near-term challenge—but also any country that would aspire to singular, hegemonic dominance, including the United States.

India believes that multipolarity is the key to both global peace and its own rise. It obsessively guards its strategic autonomy, eschewing formal alliances and maintaining ties with Western adversaries such as Iran and Russia, even as it has grown closer to the United States. This behavior is intended to help advance a multipolar international order. But it may not be effective or even realistic. Although India has grown in economic strength over the last two decades, it is not growing fast enough to balance China, let alone the United States, even in the long term. It will become a great power, in terms of relative GDP, by midcentury, but not a superpower. In military terms, it is the most significant conventional power in South Asia, but here, too, its advantages over its local rival are not enormous: in fighting in May, Pakistan used Chinese-supplied defense systems to shoot down Indian aircraft. With China on one side and an adversarial Pakistan on the other, India must always fear the prospect of an unpalatable two-front war. Meanwhile, at home, the country is shedding one of its main sources of strength—its liberal democracy—by embracing Hindu nationalism. This evolution could undermine India's rise by intensifying communal tensions and exacerbating problems with its neighbors, forcing it to redirect security resources inward to the detriment of outward power projection. The country's illiberal pivot further undermines the rules-based international order that has served it so well.

India's relative weakness, its yearning for multipolarity, and its illiberal trajectory mean that it will have less global influence than it desires even when it can justifiably consider itself a great power. Becoming the fourth (or possibly the third) largest economy in the world should herald a dramatic expansion of a country's clout, but that will not be the case for India. Even by 2047—the centenary of its independence—it may still have to rely on foreign partners to ward off Chinese power. And because of its perennial discomfort with alliances, or even with close partnerships, securing external support could be challenging, especially as the United States grows more transactional in its foreign policy—and also if Washington comes to fear New Delhi as a competitor. In the coming decades, India will grow undeniably stronger but less able to wield that strength in meaningful ways, with less global sway.

For most of the Cold War, India's economic performance fell short of its inherent potential. Although the country overcame the stagnation that marked the century before its independence, it grew at just around 3.5 percent per year from 1950 to 1980—far less than many other developing countries. India's average growth rates improved to about 5.5 percent during the 1980s, after the government began modest economic reforms. But the pace of growth remained lackluster compared with other Asian states.

In 1991, Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, took an axe to the country's controlled economy, dismantling the so-called License Raj, which had stifled India's economic growth through excessive regulations, production controls, and closed domestic markets. As a result, the economy finally began to pick up in the mid-1990s. Since then, India's GDP has grown at about 6.5 percent annually—a remarkably long and unprecedented period of sustained growth. India has consequently been able to lift millions of people out of poverty and rejoin the international economy as an important engine of global growth. It is one of the main reasons why the United States sees India as an important partner and a potential counterweight to China.

But no matter how impressive India's more recent performance has been, the country has fallen short of China's reform-era achievements. Since Beijing opened up its economy in the late 1970s, Chinese GDP has grown at close to nine percent annually, reaching double digits 15 times between 1979 and 2023, according to World Bank data. The same figures show that, by contrast, India has never chalked up double-digit GDP growth. As a result, China's economy went from being roughly the same size as India's in 1980 to almost five times its size today.

Beijing has also used its wealth to become far more influential than New Delhi. It has built a larger, more sophisticated military. It has more deeply integrated itself into the Indo-Pacific region in ways that enhance its economic heft and provide it with enormous—sometimes choking—political influence. This helps explain why New Delhi, despite its often confident rhetoric, is skittish about confronting Beijing unless pressed, even when it is backed by Washington.

Indians, of course, are not happy about this disadvantage. Many of the country's officials hope that, in the years ahead, they will match their northern neighbor. The Chinese economy, after all, has slowed considerably over the last decade: China is now growing at between four and five percent annually on average—behind India's pace. The Chinese economy is buffeted by multiple challenges that could keep growth rates down, such as a real estate crisis, high local debt, and increasing constraints on its market access to the West. Most important, it faces significant demographic headwinds. After years of slowing growth, China's population declined for the first time in 2022, and it continues to age rapidly. The country's diminishing workforce further imperils its longer-term economic prospects and, by extension, its power. India, meanwhile, still has a growing population, despite declining fertility rates. It will possess a large cohort of working-age adults for some time to come.



But China's slowdown does not guarantee that India will catch up. In fact, based on current trends, the Indian economy is unlikely to match its Chinese counterpart before the middle of the century, if at all. To become a genuine peer of China, India would need to grow consistently at eight percent per year over the next 25 years while China grows at a glacial two percent. This is unlikely to happen. India has not developed a significant manufacturing sector (and probably will not because it lacks the requisite comparative advantage), clings to excessive protectionism that impedes exports, and invests too little in research and development. It lags in overall technological proficiency, despite having many excellent technology companies. It has not yet invested sufficiently in improving its large human capital.

India will therefore likely grow at an annual rate of six percent over the next two decades, its average annual rate during the last decade, based on World Bank data through 2023. If that happens, and China grows at just two percent per year, on average, New Delhi's standing vis-à-vis Beijing would certainly improve: by midcentury, India's GDP would be a little more than half that of China. But China could still achieve average annual GDP growth higher than two percent in the coming decades. For all its challenges, China still has enormous economic advantages relative to India, including a literate, skilled, and comparatively healthy population; greater technological proficiency; and larger capital stocks. It has made substantial investments in critical technologies—such as artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, and information and communications—which could improve growth despite its demographic constraints. If China grows even a little faster, say at three percent annually, it could end up with an economy that is closer to three times as large as India's, even if India grows at six percent.

Long-range projections of economic growth are admittedly difficult to make. Yet if past is prelude, India will become a great power by the middle of this century, but it will be the weakest of a quartet that includes China, the United States, and the European Union. It will not be on par with China. And it will certainly not be on par with the United States.

If New Delhi wants to constrain Beijing, it will therefore need Washington. None of the other Indo-Pacific powers, not even Australia or Japan, will be strong enough by 2050 to compensate for the United States. The EU might have the collective economic and military capacity to do so, but its members are not threatened by China in the same way that the Indo-Pacific states are. New Delhi and Washington then will—indeed, must—continue cooperating in the years ahead.

But those hoping for a boundless friendship will be disappointed. Despite its weaknesses, India will not settle for any alliance with the United States, and there will be limits on their partnership. That is because India does not want to be part of any collective defense arrangements. Instead, it will zealously guard its nonallied status.

India's desire to avoid formal coalitions is partly the product of its colonial past. The country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, pledged that India would never become a “camp follower” of any great power, given that it had spent centuries suffering under British rule. But the country's attitude is equally motivated by the conviction that a rising power must never do anything in the interim to compromise the freedom of action it will enjoy once it has ascended. Indian policymakers fear that accepting the constraints that come with alliances, particularly in coalitions that include more powerful states, would not only lead to the country's subordination but also limit its ability to maneuver between the various geopolitical divisions in the international system. At heart, New Delhi has realist inclinations: it does not trust other states to act out of anything other than self-interest. It assumes that it will receive external support only if the donor benefits appropriately. To the degree that the United States and others have an interest in balancing Chinese power, India expects their support without having to make any onerous compromises to secure such assistance.

With this assessment of the world in mind, New Delhi will keep trying to push the international order toward multipolarity even if that is not what Washington wants. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee articulated this ambition in 2004, when he declared, “India does not believe that unipolarity is a state of equilibrium in today's world.” India, he insisted, would work to build a “cooperative, multipolar world which accommodates the legitimate aspirations and interests of all its component poles.” Indian leaders across the political spectrum share this vision, believing that multipolarity is the natural state of the world, that the international system is entering a state of multipolarity, or that multipolarity is needed for global peace because it ensures that no single country can impose its will on others.



Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar argues in his 2020 book, The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World, that New Delhi should advance its “national interests by identifying and exploiting opportunities created by global contradictions” to reap the most benefits “from as many ties as possible.” A unipolar order undermines this strategy because it denies New Delhi the opportunity to play one pole against another. A bipolar order is more favorable; throughout the Cold War, for example, India played the Soviet Union against the United States to benefit itself. But multipolarity is best. After all, a multipolar world would have many more cleavages and affinities that India could use to its advantage.

In practice, this means that India pursues eclectic partnerships with individual countries and groupings of countries, even if some of those partners have strikingly anti-American agendas. New Delhi often serves as a moderating force in these forums, to the benefit of the United States. But sometimes, even as India has deepened its ties with the United States bilaterally, it acts to constrain U.S. power in the larger global arena. India has, for instance, pushed back against the United States on issues such as climate policy, trade preferences, data sovereignty, e-commerce rules, and global governance. Even in the realm of high politics, India has opposed U.S. sanctions on friendly third countries, championed the so-called global South in its campaign against Western domination, and preserved its traditional ties with countries such as Iran and Russia, despite the latter's appalling war in Ukraine. India has even sought to maintain stable relations with China, cooperating whenever possible, to preserve a modicum of peace across their shared border. Unlike Washington, New Delhi cannot tolerate violent oscillations in its bilateral relationship with Beijing and, depending on the future trajectory of U.S. policy, may edge closer to China as circumstances demand.

So far, however, these Indian efforts have done little to make the world any more multipolar than it was. In fact, if economic trends continue, genuine multipolarity will remain elusive as China and the United States will be in a class by themselves by the middle of the century. The world, then, will be bipolar. And should that happen, India may find itself in an uncomfortable position. It will frustrate Washington by remaining ensconced in non-Western forums, such as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, only to find that Beijing has more influence in those groups and among many non-Western countries than does New Delhi. Thus far, India has escaped this dilemma because successive U.S. presidential administrations have deliberately overlooked these dalliances. But a more jaundiced government, like the one currently led by Trump, might be tempted to penalize India for this behavior. For example, New Delhi's effort to conduct some of its bilateral trades in local currencies rather than the U.S. dollar, although intended to immunize India against U.S. sanctions on third countries, could provoke a nationalist U.S. administration to limit cooperation with India.

Even if India avoids such retaliation, the country should be wary of multipolarity for other reasons. In a genuinely multipolar system, New Delhi would benefit less from the collective goods the United States supplies, such as protecting the sea-lanes in the Indian Ocean. To compensate, India would have to bear larger financial and security burdens than it has been willing to thus far. It might also fail to balance against Beijing, should the other two great powers (the United States and the EU) decide to leave India—the weakest in the mix—to fend for itself. Under multipolarity, India could end up worse off than it is under American unipolarity or than it might be under U.S.-Chinese bipolarity. As a result, India's current approach—seeking continued American support for itself while promoting a multipolar system that would limit Washington's power—is both counterproductive and unwise.

India's qualities as a great power will not just be characterized by its approach to other states. They will also be defined by its internal politics. And here, the country is experiencing a profound—and dangerous—shift.

For decades, India has been a spectacular democratic success. Since winning independence in 1947, the country has had 18 national elections. The average voter turnout across these contests has been 60 percent, and turnout has increased with time. More pertinently, Indian citizens have enjoyed universal adult franchise from the very beginning, irrespective of their gender, caste, or economic status. They have also enjoyed vital fundamental rights to freedom, equality, and religion, enforceable via judicial action. The government did suspend these rights from 1975 to 1977, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi infamously declared an “emergency” that let her rule as a dictator and imprison her opponents. But the Indian people resisted her authoritarianism and threw her out of office when she called an election in the hope of ratifying her dictatorship.

What made Indian democracy especially remarkable, however, is that it thrived in conditions in which democracy typically fails. Political science research has shown that democratic success is strongly correlated with a country's level of per capita income. Most Third World states, for example, that were born as democracies lapsed into dictatorships or became autocratic shortly after independence. But not India. Despite being poor, India's democracy thrived as its leaders managed the country's political fortunes through open competition.

The country's success at staying democratic is attributable, in part, to its constitution. This document has multiple provisions guaranteeing respect for all people. To guard against the tyranny of the majority, for example, India defined citizenship entirely by the principle of jus soli—place of birth—rather than by ascriptive markers such as religion, wealth, or race. It also offered minorities meaningful legal protections, including the right to manage their religious and charitable institutions, beyond the broader freedom offered to all citizens to freely profess, practice, and propagate their religion. The country also created a federal system in which multiple linguistic groups, for instance, were afforded their own states in order to protect the country's cultural diversity. India's constitution set deliberate limits on executive power both by empowering the legislature and the judiciary at the federal and provincial levels to serve as checks and balances and by creating space for civil society wherein citizens could tangibly express their freedoms of speech, assembly, and association, among others.



This is what made India's political system not merely democratic but also fundamentally liberal. As Nehru put it, the country's founders sought “to create a just society by employing just means.” They believed, and proved, that a poor country could zealously protect individual rights and reject authoritarianism's promise of faster economic growth.

But now, India is distancing itself from these origins. Unlike the India of the Cold War, which remained robustly liberal even when underperforming economically, India today, despite being more economically successful, has been markedly tainted by illiberalism and authoritarianism. Its long tradition of secular politics is now eclipsed by Hindu nationalism, whose proponents believe India to be the land of Hindus and that its religious minorities are, at best, second-class citizens. This ideology, called Hindutva, was repudiated and marginalized by the country's founders. But it never disappeared, and since the 1990s it has been resurrected in Indian politics, winning power for the first time late in that decade through its incarnation in the Bharatiya Janata Party and then more decisively from 2014 onward, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept into office. This ascendance has precipitated policies that have alienated India's almost 200 million Muslims and nearly 30 million Christians. Along the way, the BJP has attempted to reabsorb previously alienated lower-caste Hindus in order to create a unified Hindu voting bloc that, collectively, numbers almost one billion people even as Hindu nationalists have sought to promote the idea that many of India's other minority faiths—notably Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism—are really Hinduism in disguise. All this is part of the larger belief that only adherents belonging to religious traditions that arose in the Indian subcontinent are authentically Indian.

This attack on the secular ideals of the Indian constitution has also been accompanied by rising authoritarianism. This drift has not manifested through rewriting the constitution itself, although some have voiced the idea of replacing it entirely. Instead, the change has occurred through the deliberate erosion of fundamental norms related to belonging and through the weaponization of once neutral institutions. Harking back to the emergency, Modi's government has deputized the tax authorities and other instruments of law to intimidate India's opposition parties, civil society, regulatory institutions, and some opposition-ruled states.



Yet Indian democracy is not dead. The country still has competitive elections, and there are faint signs that it could liberalize again. The BJP lost its outright majority in parliament during the last national elections, and it now has to govern in a coalition. It has, in fact, never won a popular vote majority; it secured parliamentary majorities thanks to the country's first-past-the-post electoral system. Despite the party's best efforts, Hindutva does not appear to enjoy the allegiance of most Indian voters. The opposition still governs a third of India's states. Indian liberals are beleaguered, but they continue to resist the Hindutva tide. And occasionally, the judiciary and other adjudicating bodies still push back on the executive's overreach. The question of whether India will be an illiberal great power thus remains open.

But if the country's politics do not revert, it will have serious consequences for the world. India would cease to be an exemplar of liberal democracy at a time when the world desperately needs one. It would not enhance the liberal international order, which promises both peaceful politics and economic prosperity and which has come under growing assault. In fact, if both India and the United States end up being persistently illiberal democracies, the postwar order—which has served both countries well, despite their current complaints to the contrary—would be severely damaged. Persistent illiberalism in both erstwhile liberal democracies would strengthen similar political forces in other countries. In a speech in New Delhi in 2015, President Barack Obama presciently declared, “If America shows itself as an example of its diversity and yet the capacity to live together and work together in common effort, in common purpose; if India, as massive as it is, with so much diversity, so many differences is able to continually affirm its democracy, that is an example for every other country on Earth.” Today, both the United States and India seem intent on failing this test.

An illiberal India is also likely to be less powerful. The BJP's policies have polarized India along ideological and religious lines, and the unresolved issues about how India's changing demography is to be represented in parliament threaten to exacerbate regional and linguistic divisions. This makes India look increasingly like the highly divided United States. Polarization has been bad enough for Americans, hobbling their institutions and fueling democratic decay. But it will be even worse for India, where the state and society are much weaker. Polarization, for example, could intensify the armed rebellions against New Delhi that have long been underway, creating opportunities for outside powers to sow chaos within India's borders. Those conflicts could also spill over into India's neighborhood, as the ideological animus against Muslims exacerbates tensions with both Bangladesh and Pakistan. Polarization would also increase India's internal security burdens, consuming resources that New Delhi needs to project influence abroad. And even if polarization does not create more internal troubles, it will undermine New Delhi's efforts to mobilize its population in accumulating national power.

The combination of moderate economic growth, the persistent quest for partnerships with all states but privileged relationships with none, and growing illiberalism within the country make for an India whose global influence will fall short of its increasing material strength. Although India will become the third or fourth largest economy globally, its lagging development indicators imply that its relatively large population will neither enjoy the standard of living nor contribute proportionately to the production of national power that its counterparts do in China, the United States, and Europe. Even as its economy grows inarguably larger, India will still face tremendous challenges of deprivation and grievance that could threaten the country's social stability and national power.

If India's continuing growth also remains tied largely to domestic market expansion but not international integration—as China's has been, in striking contrast—its ability to grow faster will inevitably be constrained. Equally, India will lose the opportunity to influence the choices of countries in its wider neighborhood. Scholars have often argued that the minimum characteristic of a great power is the ability to decisively shape outcomes in the region beyond its immediate frontiers. India today, unfortunately, fails this test in both East Asia and the Middle East, and the situation will probably not change dramatically in the decades ahead, given the likely activities of China and the United States in these regions. The imperatives of tying India's economic fortunes more closely to the transformations occurring in these regions are therefore incontestable, especially because India already faces strong impediments to translating its natural dominance within South Asia into lasting local hegemony.

Because even if India grows at a rate of six percent over the next two decades or so, it will be eclipsed by China in Asia. India will need to rely on external balancing, that is, cooperating comprehensively with foreign powers to keep China at bay. The best candidate here remains the United States because it will probably still be the most powerful country in the international system in the coming decades, no matter its domestic dysfunction.



New Delhi and Washington have made important strides together toward balancing Chinese power in recent years, but India's diffidence about a tight partnership with the United States frustrates this outcome. The economic ties between the two are not as strong as they could be given the countries' natural complementarities. But the biggest constraint is India's preoccupation with promoting multipolarity through multialignment, which presumes that India will become a meaningful peer of China, the United States, and Europe sometime soon and, consequently, will be able to balance China on its own.

Not only is this prospect nowhere in sight, but it also prevents the crafting of a genuine cooperative defense against China. This deficiency would be tolerable if India could expand its military capabilities sufficiently to neutralize the Chinese threat independently and to assist other Indo-Pacific states threatened by China. For the foreseeable future, India will find it hard to achieve either objective. Given the current, and likely future, gap in GDP with China, India will struggle to compete with its northern neighbor when it comes to defense modernization. Beijing's military capabilities already surpass India's, and given its lower defense burden—the ratio of military expenditures to GDP—China could expand its defense spending with fewer penalties to its economic growth compared with India while further widening its military superiority.

India's reluctance to partner more closely with the United States in building cooperative defense, however understandable, thus makes balancing against China difficult. Even worse, the Indian ambition of promoting multipolarity puts it at odds with the United States on many issues of international order at a time when working with Washington should be the more pressing priority. India should not delude itself that it can contain China on its own, which it cannot, while calling for a multipolar world in which the United States has a reduced role.



The United States has tolerated these Indian behaviors in the past in part because both countries were largely liberal democracies. As both proceed down the path of illiberalism, however, they will no longer be tied by shared values. Transactional habits may come to dominate the relationship, and Washington could demand more of New Delhi as the price of partnership. Trump's approach to India in his second term has already signaled such an evolution. Indeed, India's inability to match China in the future, as well as its commitment to multipolarity, which is fundamentally at odds with American interests, will be deeply inconvenient for the United States. India, it seems, will partner with the United States on some things involving China, but it is unlikely to partner with Washington in every significant arena—even when it comes to Beijing.

If New Delhi cannot effectively balance Beijing in Asia, Washington will invariably wonder how many resources and how much faith it should invest in India. A liberal United States might continue to support a liberal India because helping it would be inherently worthwhile (provided that the costs were not prohibitive and New Delhi's success still served some American interests). But if either India or the United States remains illiberal, there will be no ideological reason for the latter to help the former.

To be sure, a narrower U.S.-Indian relationship centered on interests, not values, will not be a disaster for either country. But it would represent shrunken ambitions. The transformation of the bilateral ties between the two countries after the Cold War was once conceived as a way to help improve and uphold the liberal international order. Now, that relationship could be largely limited to trying to constrain a common competitor, China. And if so, neither India nor the United States nor the world at large will be the better for it.

President Donald Trump's second-term attempts at brokering peace in Gaza and Ukraine have gained little traction. But there is one place where the United States' involvement might yet help bring peace: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where for three and a half deadly years, the Rwandan-supported M23 rebel group has fought against the Congolese government and its allies. These clashes have killed thousands and displaced millions. Since November 2021, with troops, munitions, weapons, and diplomatic support from the Rwandan army, the M23—an armed group led by Congolese Tutsi that aims to overthrow the government—has expanded its control over rural areas and two major cities along the Rwandan border.

The Congolese government's reaction to the incursion has only exacerbated the violence: Kinshasa outsourced its counterinsurgency efforts to private international military contractors and threw its weight behind ramshackle, poorly disciplined armed groups known as the Wazalendo. After African Union–mandated peace talks with Rwanda led by Angolan President João Lourenço collapsed last December, the Rwandan government escalated, providing the main firepower that helped the M23 take the large border cities of Goma and Bukavu and roughly doubling the territory it held. But then, in late March, the rebellion's northwestern expansion was stopped in its tracks, due in part to overstretched supply lines—but also to U.S. and EU pressure.

After a slow start, the Trump administration brought Congo and Rwanda together and renewed efforts to hammer out a peace agreement. Alongside Qatar (which is mediating between Congo and the M23), the United States has led several rounds of negotiations between Congo and Rwanda. It has sought to leverage U.S. investments to get Rwanda to withdraw its troops and to allow Congo to regain control over its territory.

The Trump administration has a real chance to broker a historic deal, but not with economic incentives alone. It will need to use a hefty dose of diplomatic and material pressure, especially on Rwanda. It will have to muster more consistency and focus in its Africa policy. And the United States must become more inclusive in its process: the African Union, the EU, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations will all need invitations to the table in order to craft a durable end to Congo's 30 years of violence.

Since late 2021, this East African conflict has seen its fair share of peace initiatives. First, the East African Community attempted to organize peace talks between Kinshasa and the country's myriad armed groups. But those negotiations broke down in 2022, in part because Kinshasa refused to talk with the M23. Diplomatic momentum then shifted toward a regional approach that sought to bring Congo and Rwanda into direct negotiations. The U.S. government supported this Angolan-led effort; ahead of elections in Congo in December 2023, Washington also stepped in and negotiated a shaky cease-fire between Kigali and Kinshasa, after which it invested significant diplomatic and intelligence-gathering resources in the region to help monitor the deal.

The Angolan-led talks, however, collapsed in December 2024 when Rwandan President Paul Kagame refused to attend the signing ceremony for a peace deal. Instead of committing to a peace process, Kagame backed a new offensive. Although Rwanda continues to publicly deny its support to the M23, in private, Rwandan leaders argue that they must help the group protect the persecuted Congolese Tutsi population and suppress a Rwandan rebel militia, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). But Rwanda's motivations are certainly more complex. Its initial backing of the M23 was driven by competition with neighboring Burundi and Uganda, and because it derives huge material benefit from its neighbor's instability, which facilitates the smuggling of gold, coltan, and other minerals. Before this year, Kagame had suffered few major consequences for backing the M23. He is admired by international donors as well as by some Africans for his role in stabilizing and developing Rwanda after the 1994 genocide, and he has made allies by deploying Rwandan troops in other conflict zones on the continent. The EU, for instance, increased its support for Rwanda during the M23 rebellion's first three years, boosting its aid, offering grants to the Rwandan army for operations against jihadists in Mozambique, and signing a major public-private investment agreement. The United Kingdom was also a steadfast ally: its previous Conservative government gave Kigali over $300 million to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.



Kagame obviously hoped that the election of a more isolationist American president with little known interest in Africa would give him an even freer hand in Congo. Indeed, Trump has not yet nominated a new assistant secretary of state to lead Africa policy, and a rotating cast of Africa leaders at the National Security Council complicated Washington's diplomatic efforts. Many U.S. diplomats believe that the leadership transition in Washington that prompted Kagame to launch his January offensive, to change the facts on the ground before Rwanda had to return to the negotiating table.

But career U.S. diplomats and civil servants kept up the pressure, succeeding in imposing sanctions in February on a top Kagame ally. In March, the United States received an unexpected assist from the Qatari government. When the Angolan mediation failed, Doha stepped in, brokering a face-to-face meeting between Kagame and Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi for the first time since February 2024. Qatar has significant leverage over Rwanda, as it is investing billions of dollars in the Rwandan national airline and a new Kigali airport.

Over the past three months, in coordination with Washington, Doha has hosted numerous meetings between the M23 and Kinshasa. Washington also began to change its approach. In early April, the Trump administration finally tapped a senior adviser for Africa: Massad Boulos, the father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany and a businessman with experience in Nigeria. Boulos has focused much of his time on the conflict in eastern Congo, making the case to Trump that U.S. interests are at stake there. 

On April 25, these efforts bore fruit when Congolese and Rwandan foreign ministers signed a Declaration of Principles in Washington, creating a broad framework for a solution to the crisis. Each side pledged to refrain from supporting armed groups, to respect each other's sovereignty, and to work toward greater economic integration. The declaration also proposed an ambitious timetable. Both sides were supposed to submit draft peace proposals within a week, and administration officials said they aimed for a Rose Garden signing ceremony by early July.

Those draft proposals, however, were miles apart. Very quickly, it became clear that the United States needed to present, or even impose, its own plan. Under Boulos's direction, State Department diplomats have been working up a deal, and its contours have emerged: Rwanda would have to withdraw its troops from Congo completely while the M23 would withdraw to a small area north of Goma. Kinshasa, meanwhile, would have to facilitate the M23's transition to a legitimate political party and help its combatants integrate into the Congolese army or demobilize. Kinshasa would also be required to work with Kigali to defeat the FDLR for good.

What distinguishes the U.S. intervention from previous peace efforts is that it puts economic interests at its heart. Trump appears to have noticed that the region could contribute materially to American security and the U.S. economy, which may be why he has mentioned the conflict publicly several times since April. Congo is rich in critical minerals—it is the world's largest producer of cobalt and tantalum and Africa's largest producer of copper—but most of these resources are currently exploited and then processed by Chinese companies. The potential deal is meant to be in all sides' material interest. According to sources close to the process, it will include U.S. investments in a tantalum mine and a niobium mine in villages currently under the M23's control. The minerals would be shipped to Rwanda, and Rwanda has been told that it could benefit from refining and processing them.

Ending the conflict may well need such incentives. Since 2021, Rwanda has invested great blood and treasure into its Congo intervention. According to diplomats and UN reports, over the past year, it has deployed up to 20 percent of its 33,000 troops in Congo. Rwanda's gold exports climbed from $344 million in 2021 to $1.5 billion last year; Kigali denies that this increase relates to its efforts in Congo, but six successive reports by a United Nations sanctions monitoring group have shown that minerals are being smuggled from eastern Congo into Rwanda.

Previous U.S. administrations have often highlighted the humanitarian imperative to end the conflict in Congo. Trump's ethos is obviously different. His transactional foreign policy—which seeks to obtain economic benefits for the United States at little cost to U.S. taxpayers—may be foundering elsewhere, but it has an opportunity to succeed in Congo, where he also has an interest in countering Chinese influence. In this regard, the potential return on investing in peace—privileged access to Congolese minerals or mineral supply chains for U.S. companies—is immense and the costs to the United States would be minimal.

But crafting a durable peace will also require that Washington impose penalties. March offered a glimpse of what putting more pressure on the combatants could accomplish. That month, a large tin mine based in North Kivu (and majority owned, at the time, by the U.S.- and British-based energy investment firm Denham Capital) shuttered its operations as the M23 closed in on the area. Boulos's pressure on Rwanda led the M23 to withdraw. On April 9, the mine announced that it would resume operations. The American stick worked.

It is clear that Rwanda is the main instigator in the most recent chapter of the East African conflict, so pressure on its leaders will have to be at the core of any solution. The United States, along with other donors, still has far more leverage over Rwanda than it has used. In 2023, Rwanda received around $160 million from its troop contributions to UN peacekeeping operations, roughly the same amount as its entire defense budget. The UN has dawdled in holding Rwanda to account, even as the M23—and likely Rwandan troops themselves—killed UN peacekeepers in Goma this January. In February, the United States, speaking in the Security Council, once again asked the UN to review Rwanda's contributions to UN peacekeeping missions; other Security Council members could also make it clear that Rwanda can no longer contribute to peacekeeping operations unless it withdraws from Congo.

Rwanda also receives over a billion dollars in development aid each year. Its largest donor, the World Bank, spends over $4 billion on active, multiyear projects in the country, roughly equivalent to Rwanda's annual budget. Most of these projects are related to infrastructure, and it does not make sense to invest so much in development in a country that has helped displace millions in Congo and disrupted development projects there. In 2012, the World Bank suspended its programs in Rwanda for over a year because of its involvement in Congo, contributing to Kigali's decision to pull support from the M23. The United States could exercise its de facto veto power over the bank and demand it do so again.

There are other implements in the U.S. toolbox. The State Department could strengthen its travel advisories and publish a business advisory, which would pressure Rwanda by crimping tourism and foreign investment. Since the fall of Goma in January and Bukavu in February, both the EU and the United Kingdom have become much more critical of Rwanda: the EU imposed its most aggressive sanctions yet on Rwandan officials and Gasabo Gold, a refinery owned by the Rwandan Defense Ministry, while the United Kingdom has suspended some aid. If the U.S. Treasury Department followed the EU's lead and sanctioned Gasabo Gold, it would effectively kneecap Rwanda's main earner of foreign currency. And if both Republicans and Democrats spoke more often and more publicly about Rwanda's damaging role in the region, that might discourage celebrities such as Idris Elba and Ellen DeGeneres—who have visited Rwanda and participated in promotional activities for the Rwandan government—and sports ventures such as the NBA and Arsenal Football Club from associating with the country's brand.

The M23's three-year rebellion is just a part of a multilayered Congolese conflict that has lasted for more than three decades. There are around 100 other armed groups in eastern Congo, all fighting for complex reasons. International donors, the Congolese government, multinational corporations, and local elites share blame for the conflict's stubborn persistence. A deal between Congo and Rwanda will be only the first step in what must be a longer peace process.

Massive investments have been made in peace in Congo before. In 2002, concerted pressure from donors, as well as leadership from South Africa and the United Nations, led to a comprehensive peace deal that reunified the country, demobilized 130,000 soldiers, and ushered in a new, democratic constitution and elections. But the ambition of that process quickly shriveled. There were no serious transitional justice programs, no adequate land reform projects to address rural poverty and inequality, and the stigmatization of the Congolese Tutsi community—one driver of the current conflict––was never addressed. Perhaps most important, the chronic corruption and fragmentation bedeviling the Congolese security apparatus was never tackled, prompting its leaders to ally with abusive groups when confronted with threats.

But the M23 crisis is currently the region's largest by far. Rwandan troops must withdraw from eastern Congo to open up space for the larger necessary peace process. Ideally, such a process would be facilitated by the United Nations—given its experience in peacemaking—and the African Union, the regional body to which the UN wants to delegate peacekeeping operations. These institutions could monitor a cease-fire and facilitate disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration.



Truly bringing peace to his country will require courage from Tshisekedi: he will have to launch military operations against the FDLR, address Congolese Tutsi grievances, and bring hundreds of thousands of refugees home. Tens of thousands of combatants need to be demobilized. If the M23 withdraws north of Goma, the UN and regional bodies will probably have to deploy an interposition force to assuage Rwanda's security concerns and prevent another escalation.

Regional economic integration poses yet another challenge. To prevent yet another Rwandan invasion, a peace process will need to get each country in the region invested in their neighbors' stability. That aim can be pursued by encouraging joint economic projects, such as a hydroelectric dam on the Ruzizi river that the U.S. government has envisioned as part of its peace plan. This dam would become the third co-managed by Burundi, Congo, and Rwanda and a demonstration that cooperation is possible. Rejuvenating the Great Lakes States Development Bank—which was established in 1977 by Burundi, Congo, and Rwanda and which declined in the 1990s because of mismanagement and lack of funds—could provide tax incentives for cross-border trade and money for joint projects. There are many other areas where the two countries could collaborate. Congo is rich in timber, coffee, and cacao as well as minerals, while Rwanda can provide a safe and stable—if authoritarian—base for companies to operate.

As it stands, the structure of the peace process is a problem, too. Qatar's talks between Kinshasa and the M23 are ongoing, and the United States has stepped into the role of mediator between Congo and Rwanda. But neither country can go this alone. The United States will have to involve the European Union and the United Kingdom, as well as the African Union, to orchestrate pressure on both sides.

This conflict can be solved, and Washington is on the right track. But to consolidate any of its gains, it must now engage in the kind of multilateralism it has, to date, avoided. “America first” and international cooperation—self-interest and humanitarianism—need not be mutually exclusive.

            President Donald Trump's order to block incoming foreign students from attending Harvard University will remain on hold temporarily following a hearing Monday, when a lawyer for the Ivy League school said Trump was using its students as “pawns.”
    


            US District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston extended a temporary restraining order on Trump's proclamation until June 23 while she weighs Harvard's request for a preliminary injunction. Burroughs made the decision at a hearing over Harvard's request, which Trump's Republican administration opposed.
    


            Burroughs granted the initial restraining order June 5, and it had been set to expire Thursday.
    


Attacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months. A timeline of the dispute



            Trump moved to block foreign students from entering the US to attend Harvard earlier this month, citing concerns over national security. It followed a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard's ability to host foreign students on its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Burroughs has temporarily blocked that action, too, and is weighing whether it should remain on hold until the case is decided.
    


            Ian Gershengorn, a lawyer for Harvard, told Burroughs on Monday that Trump was “using Harvard's international students as pawns” while arguing the administration has exceeded its authority in an attempt to retaliate against the school for not agreeing to the president's demands.
    


            “I think there is no finding that Harvard is dangerous,” he said.
    


            Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after it rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status.
    


            Foreign students were brought into the battle in April, when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short, and on May 22 she revoked Harvard's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.
    


            The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world's top students and harmed Harvard's reputation as a global research hub, the school said in its lawsuit. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the suit said.
    


Judge halts Trump's proclamation to suspend new international student visas at Harvard hours after university filed amended lawsuit



            The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard's students, including two universities in Hong Kong.
    


            While Harvard's legal team on Monday said the federal government was unfairly and illegally singling the university out in Trump's proclamation, Department of Justice attorney Tiberius Davis countered that the administration has scrutinized dozens of universities over the past two months.
    


            “The power is within Harvard to fix this,” Davis said, adding that currently the federal government believes “other universities might be better” to host foreign students.
    


            Davis was the sole attorney to attend and defend the Trump administration during Monday's hearing compared with the six Harvard attorneys, a contrast that Burroughs commented on repeatedly.
    


            “Not only do you have this case but you have it alone,” she said.
    


            Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its “core, legally-protected principles,” even after receiving federal ultimatums.

Follow:


            President Donald Trump is under opposing pressure from inside Israel and his own MAGA base as he ponders the most fateful national security decision of either of his presidencies — whether to attempt a killer blow against Iran's nuclear program.
    


            Israel is sending clear signals, including through former senior officials, that it hopes the US will ultimately join the conflict and use its unique military edge to destroy the Iranian nuclear complex at Fordow, which is buried deep underground.
    


            “We believe that the United States of America and the president of the United States have an obligation to make sure that the region is going to a positive way and that the world is free from Iran that possesses (a) nuclear weapon,” former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told CNN's Bianna Golodryga in an interview.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, used an ABC News interview Monday to pour cold water on a diplomatic channel with Iran that Trump seems desperate to revive, saying it had been used to “string the US along.”
    


            A sense that an entwined political and national security crisis is building was exacerbated by Trump's decision to suddenly leave the G7 summit in western Canada on Monday night.
    


            “I have to be back early for obvious reasons,” Trump said. “They understand. This is big stuff.”
    


            He flies home to Washington as it reverberates with blunt warnings from some of the most influential opinion shapers in MAGA media. Personalities like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson say that a decision to strike Iran would represent a repudiation of his 10-year-old political movement and “America First” principles. ”I don't want the US enmeshed in another Middle East war that doesn't serve our interests,” Carlson said on Bannon's “War Room” show on Monday.
    


            Synergy between right and left populist movements in America is also on display. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran as a Democrat primary candidate in the 2016 and 2020 elections, said the US “must not get dragged into another of Netanyahu's wars.”
    


            Loud voices opposed to deeper US involvement underscore the painful legacy of the Iraq and Afghan wars, which created political forces that nurtured Trump's populist uprising. But the neoconservative interventionist wing of the GOP has not disappeared. Hawks like Sen. Lindsey Graham are trying to convince Trump that Israel's blitz against Iranian air defenses and a confluence of forces that have weakened the regime offer the US a chance to definitively end the nuclear aspirations of its 45-year foe and to transform the Middle East.
    


            European leaders who met Trump in Canada brought to bear their own pressure, seeking to see whether the US will rein in Netanyahu amid concern over Trump's suggestion that Russian President Vladimir Putin might join a peace effort.
    


            Even Iran joined the cacophony, accusing Israel of sabotaging US nuclear talks with the Islamic Republic, a centerpiece of the president's so far frustrated strategy of branding himself as a global peacemaker.
    


            Multiple voices bearing down on Trump reflect the gravity of a decision that will carry consequences that go beyond the always-heavy burden of whether to send American personnel to war.
    


            Whatever he decides, Trump will set off consequences that will be pivotal for Israel's security, the wider Middle East, and US power and influence. He can't know whether a US attack on subterranean chambers in Fordow could succeed or whether it will suck the US deeper into a prolonged conflict.
    


            Historically, Trump has balked at perceptions that his options are being narrowed — or that others are trying to make up his mind for him. So pressure from any direction risks being counterproductive.
    


            Ironically, Trump set up this dilemma himself. His decision to walk away from a previous US nuclear deal with Iran in his first term delighted Israel — but laid the groundwork for a future crisis.
    


            The raging debate in the MAGA movement that is splitting conservative media is a sign that Trump's own support base is on the line, and that a legacy he promised would not be marked by foreign interventionism is also at stake.
    


            Trump often creates shock and disorientates opponents by igniting confrontations that he later defuses or postpones. This is his preferred approach to trade wars. But there would be no going back from a US military strike with bunker-busting bombs at Fordow. Whatever the aftermath, the president would own it.
    


            This may explain why he avoided committing himself to any course of action on Monday. He said Iran has “to make a deal” and should talk immediately “before it is too late.” But pressed by reporters on what would cause a direct US intervention in the conflict, he replied, “I don't want to talk about that.”
    


            On Monday evening, the president wrote on Truth Social that “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON” and said everyone should “immediately evacuate Tehran,” although he did not explain why he would issue such a warning.
    


            Perhaps Trump is just playing for time or trying to scare Tehran back to the table. But maybe he really doesn't know what he's going to do.
    


            Iran has so far not directly targeted US bases or personnel, nor has it widened the conflict — for instance, by going after shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, which could trigger global economic shockwaves. That may be a sign that it wants to avoid pulling Trump in. But it is generally agreed that while Israel can delay Iran's nuclear program, only the US can destroy it.
    


            In an extraordinary interview with CNN's Golodryga, Gallant warned that Trump had the future of the world in his hands.
    


            “This could be a disaster for the world,” he said, referring to the possibility of an Iranian bomb. “And I believe that the determination of the American president that has been shown recently will pave the way to America to enter into this very important operation,” Gallant said. “The president of the United States (has) the option to change the Middle East and influence the world.”
    


            Another former Israeli defense minister, Benny Gantz, also noted unique US military assets. “I do remember that the United States is much stronger than us. It has capabilities that we don't possess. But I'm not in a position to recommend to the president of the United States what to do,” Gantz told CNN's Anderson Cooper. “I am sure that the United States, if it decides to act, will do it for its own interests and not our interests only.”
    


            Israel's President Isaac Herzog implied that Trump had been taken for a ride in his pursuit of a diplomatic solution. “You can speak (of a) peaceful diplomatic (solution), and on the other hand, underneath you move forward to the bomb. And that was exactly the situation,” Herzog told Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.”
    


            And Netanyahu aimed a message at Trump's MAGA critics. “Today, it's Tel Aviv. Tomorrow, it's New York. Look, I understand ‘America First.' I don't understand ‘America Dead'. That's what these people want,” Netanyahu told ABC.
    


            A sincere debate over Iran is underway inside Trump's grassroots movement, and it is causing splits across the right-wing media empires that normally support the president unequivocally.
    


            Bannon argued that a major new US escapade in the Middle East would deviate from the core principles of Trumpism, which involved avoiding “forever wars,” expelling undocumented migrants, securing the border and confronting China to bring back US manufacturing jobs. He said on “War Room” that Israel had to make sovereign decisions for itself, as any nation should. “But when you start making decision that are predicated on the assumption that America is going to come in, not just for defense but for offense … No, we have to make decisions that put America first.”
    


            Bannon went on: “This has to be thought through. This Pearl Harbor-type attack on the mullahs is fine for Israel. But is it right for the United States?” He concluded that the real war that the US faces is against undocumented migrants on its own soil.
    


            A fundamental question underpins this internal MAGA debate: If “America First” is not about avoiding the kind of Middle East quagmires that that ruined President George W. Bush's Republican presidency, does it really mean anything?
    


            Trump's political success was forged in the US heartland, in the kind of towns that sent their young to fight and die in the post-9/11 wars. Those conflicts started with shock-and-awe initial success like the one Israel is celebrating with its elimination of top Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists. But they degenerated into bloody slogs that still haunt American politics. No one is openly talking of a betrayal yet. But just a month ago, in Saudi Arabia, Trump restated his opposition to interventionism and nation-building in the Middle East.
    


            On the left, there was already antipathy toward Netanyahu because of the terrible toll on Palestinian civilians of his war on Hamas. But Sanders also seemed to be vying for Trump's attention, warning in a statement, “The attack was specifically designed to sabotage American diplomatic efforts: Israel assassinated the man overseeing Iran's nuclear negotiating team, despite the fact that further talks with the United States were scheduled for Sunday.”
    


            An allergy to such foreign entanglements is not just endemic to Trump's political project: His two predecessors, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, felt much the same way.
    


            But now it's fallen to Trump to make a decision that every modern president dreaded.

Follow:


            The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee on Monday released its proposal for President Donald Trump's agenda bill that calls for enacting sweeping cuts to Medicaid and preventing a multi-trillion dollar tax hike on Americans.
    


            The committee would maintain many of the provisions contained in the legislation that the House narrowly approved last month, including making permanent essentially all the individual income tax cuts contained in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are set to expire at year's end, and instituting work requirements in Medicaid for the first time.
    


            But the committee is calling for some notable changes to the package, including lowering the cap on state and local tax deductions, instituting deeper cuts to Medicaid, slowing the elimination of some clean energy tax credits and making permanent several business tax breaks and a beefed-up child tax credit.
    


            Senate committees are racing to release their versions of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” in hopes of passing their package next week so the two chambers can work out a final deal and send it to Trump by July 4.
    


            But top Senate Republicans are running into some resistance from several key senators about the details of the bill, potentially complicating plans to deliver that package by their own deadline.
    


            In the legislative text unveiled Monday, the Senate Finance Committee would permanently extend the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, potentially blowing up a carefully constructed deal in the House to lift the cap on state and local deductions to $40,000 for married couples. However, the committee noted in a summary of its provisions that the cap is “the subject of continuing negotiations.”
    


            The $10,000 cap, which was instituted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was a major sticking point in the House negotiations. Speaker Mike Johnson worked out an agreement with GOP lawmakers from high-tax states to raise the cap to $40,000 for those making $500,000 or less.
    


            But Senate Republicans have expressed disdain for the deal because of its price tag and because it primarily benefits taxpayers from blue states.
    


            Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, issued a stern warning to Senate Republicans earlier on Monday: Any changes to pare back the deal, he said, would cause the bill to collapse in the House.
    


            “After engaging in good faith negotiations, we were able to increase the cap on SALT from $10,000 to $40,000,” Lawler said in a statement. “That is the deal, and I will not accept a penny less. If the Senate reduces the SALT number, I will vote NO, and the bill will fail in the House.”
    


            Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee are also calling for making permanent several tax breaks for businesses, including allowing companies to immediately deduct the cost of equipment and research and development in the year the expense was incurred. These are designed to enhance the economic growth potential of the package but would also increase the cost.
    


            The committee would also permanently beef up the child tax credit to $2,200, in contrast to the House, which would increase the credit to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028.
    


            And while the Senate committee would keep Trump's campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, it would place caps on that relief –- allowing tipped workers to deduct only up to $25,000 in tip income and limiting the deduction for overtime pay to $12,500 for a single worker. Those tax breaks would only be in place from 2025 through 2028, as in the House version.
    


            But the Senate measure would provide a more generous deduction for senior citizens than the House bill: $6,000 versus $4,000. The provision would be in effect from 2025 through 2028 in both versions of the bill.
    


            In a contentious move, the committee would cap most states' ability to levy provider taxes on certain health care providers – notably, hospitals – to 3.5% by 2031, down from the current 6% limit. However, that provision would only apply to the 40 states and the District of Columbia that have expanded Medicaid to low-income adults.
    


            States that have not expanded Medicaid, which are largely GOP-led states, would be restricted from increasing the rate of their current provider taxes, which would not have as sizable an impact.
    


            The issue of provider taxes has divided GOP lawmakers, with conservatives arguing that states use these taxes to get more federal Medicaid matching funds, while more moderate members worry that limiting such taxes could hurt hospitals, particularly those in rural areas.
    


            States use the revenue they raise from taxing providers to boost provider rates and fund health-related initiatives, among other uses. Every state except one levies at least one type of provider tax.
    


            Also, the Senate would require more parents to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month to maintain their Medicaid benefits. The committee would mandate that parents of children ages 15 and older would be subject to the work requirement, while the House version exempted parents of dependent children.
    


            The Senate's changes would likely result in even more people losing their Medicaid coverage than the House provisions, which would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 7.8 million in 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
    


            The Senate Finance Committee text would kill a consumer tax credit for electric vehicles and quickly phase out tax credits helping homeowners defray the cost of energy efficient appliances and rooftop solar, ending those by next year.
    


            The Senate text differs somewhat from the House bill on energy tax credits for businesses producing electricity. Like the House bill, it hits wind and solar producers particularly hard, phasing out clean energy tax credits for those projects starting next year, with the credit ending by 2028. However, companies generating electricity with zero-emission sources like nuclear, geothermal or hydropower can claim the credit for a longer period of time.
    


            The Senate text is more generous than the House when it comes to a tax credit that businesses could claim for battery and clean energy manufacturing, although it eliminates that credit for wind turbine manufacturers by 2027. The text would also terminate a tax credit for companies that make clean hydrogen, something favored by the oil and gas industry.
    


            The Senate committee would raise the debt limit by $5 trillion, compared to $4 trillion in the House version, providing more time for Trump to enact his policies without needing to negotiate a deal with Democrats to address the cap.
    


            The US hit its roughly $36 trillion debt ceiling in January. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the cap before its August recess to allow the agency to continue paying the nation's bills in full and on time, preventing a default that would likely have catastrophic global economic consequences.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Tulsi Gabbard left no doubt when she testified to Congress about Iran's nuclear program earlier this year.

The country was not building a nuclear weapon, the national intelligence director told lawmakers, and its supreme leader had not reauthorized the dormant program even though it had enriched uranium to higher levels.

But President Donald Trump dismissed the assessment of U.S. spy agencies during an overnight flight back to Washington as he cut short his trip to the Group of Seven summit to focus on the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.

“I don't care what she said,” Trump told reporters. In his view, Iran was “very close” to having a nuclear bomb. 

Trump's statement aligned him with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described a nuclear-armed Iran as an imminent threat, rather than with his own top intelligence adviser. Trump was expected to meet with national security officials in the Situation Room on Tuesday as he plans next steps.

Gabbard brushed off the inconsistency, blaming the media for misconstruing her earlier testimony and asserting that “President Trump was saying the same thing that I said.”

“We are on the same page,” she told CNN. Asked for comment, Gabbard's office referred to those remarks.

In her March testimony to lawmakers, Gabbard said the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.”




She also said the U.S. was closely monitoring Iran's nuclear program, noting that the country's “enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.” 

Trump's contradiction of Gabbard echoed his feuds with U.S. spy leaders during his first term, when he viewed them as part of a “deep state” that was undermining his agenda. Most notably, he sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 when asked if Moscow had interfered in the 2016 election, saying Putin was “extremely strong and powerful in his denial.”

The latest break over Iran was striking because Trump has staffed his second administration with loyalists rather than establishment figures. Gabbard, a military veteran and former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, was narrowly confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate because of her scant experience with intelligence or managing sprawling organizations. 

Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2022 and endorsed Trump in last year's election, is expected to testify Tuesday in a closed session on Capitol Hill, along with CIA Director John Ratcliffe, during a previously scheduled budget hearing. 

Both officials likely would face questions about their views on Iran and Trump's latest statements. A representative for the CIA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly warned that Iran has enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs should it choose to do so. Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful.

An earlier intelligence report, compiled in November under then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, also said Iran “is not building a nuclear weapon.”

However, it said the country has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses,” such as increasing stockpiles of enriched uranium and operating more advanced centrifuges. The report did not include any estimates for a timeline for how quickly a bomb could be built.

Trump's immigration agenda is another place where he's split with intelligence assessments. He cited the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law, to deport Venezuelan migrants, which he justified by claiming that the Tren de Aragua gang was coordinating with the Venezuelan government. However, an intelligence assessment in April found no evidence of that.

Gabbard fired the two veteran intelligence officers who led the panel that created the assessment, saying they were terminated because of their opposition to Trump.

In response to those reports, the White House released a statement from Gabbard supporting the president.

“President Trump took necessary and historic action to safeguard our nation when he deported these violent Tren de Aragua terrorists,” the statement said. “Now that America is safer without these terrorists in our cities, deep state actors have resorted to using their propaganda arm to attack the President's successful policies.”

U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was looking for something “better than a ceasefire” in the escalating Iran-Israel conflict. Asked by a reporter aboard Air Force One what specifically he hoped to achieve, Trump responded: “An end. A real end. Not a ceasefire. An end.”

President Donald Trump said Tuesday the U.S. knows where Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is hiding during the Israel-Iran conflict but doesn't want him killed “for now.”

Trump urged, in a social media posting, Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” as the five-day conflict continues to escalate.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump added. “He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”

Trump's increasingly muscular comments towards Tehran come after urging Tehran's 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his visit to an international summit to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team.

New York City comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by federal agents at an immigration court Tuesday as he was trying to accompany a person out of a courtroom.

A reporter with The Associated Press witnessed Lander's arrest at a federal building in Manhattan. The person Lander was walking out of the courtroom was also arrested.

Lander had spent the morning observing immigration court hearings and told an AP reporter that he was there to “accompany” some immigrants out of the building.

A video of the arrest, captured by an AP reporter, shows an agent telling Lander, “You're obstructing.”

In the moments before Lander was handcuffed, agents could be seen trying to physically separate Lander from the man they had come to detain. Lander briefly struggled to stay close to the detainee before he was pulled away.

The combination of Trump's tariffs and the GOP's proposed “big, beautiful bill” would hit the finances of many working class households, according to a report from Democrats on the congressional Joint Economic Committee.

Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, the panel's top Democrat, said the analysis shows “those who make up the backbone of our country — fire fighters, teachers, truck drivers, and others — will all face higher costs,” while the top earners “get a massive windfall.”

The committee used data from various sources, including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and new data from the Yale Budget Lab.

Prominent Trump supporters, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and conservative pundit Tucker Carlson have raised concerns about how far the president should go in backing Israel after vowing during his campaign to keep the U.S. out of expensive and endless wars.

In a Tuesday posting on X, Vance said he wanted to address “a lot of crazy stuff on social media” about Trump's approach to Iran.

Vance made the case that Trump has been consistent that “Iran cannot have uranium enrichment” and has said “repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways — the easy way or the ‘other' way.”

“He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president,” Vance added. “And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release that Senate Republican proposals for the tax cuts bill “will deliver the permanence and certainty both individual taxpayers and businesses alike are looking for, driving growth and unleashing the American economy.”

“We look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to further refine this bill and get it to President Trump's desk,” he said.

Senate Republicans on Monday proposed steeper Medicaid cuts, new work requirements for parents of teens and keeping in place the current $10,000 deduction of state and local taxes, called SALT, to offset the costs of making Trump's tax breaks permanent.

Trump is pushing Congress to send the final product to his desk to become law by the Fourth of July.

It was an awkward moment at the G7 summit — President Trump dropping the papers of a newly signed U.S.-U.K. trade deal on the ground and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stooping to pick them up, all in front of the world's media.

Starmer said he had no choice, since anyone else trying to help risked being shot by the president's security team.

“There were quite strict rules about who can get close to the president,” Starmer told reporters Tuesday.

Despite Trump's mishap and early departure from the summit, Starmer said the president “was in good form yesterday,” participating in all the summit sessions and the evening dinner, where all seven leaders agreed on a statement urging de-escalation in the Middle East.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says he's confident Trump isn't about to take the U.S. into the Israel-Iran conflict, despite the president's early departure from a G7 summit to deal with the escalating crisis.

Starmer told reporters at the summit Tuesday that “I don't think anything that the president said either here or elsewhere suggests that” the U.S. will get involved. That comes after Trump on social media urged the 9.5 million residents of Tehran to leave.

Starmer pointed to a statement issued late Monday by all G7 leaders, including Trump, calling for a “de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza.”

“Throughout the dinner yesterday I was sitting right next to President Trump, so I've no doubt, in my mind, the level of agreement there was in relation to the words that were then issued immediately after that,” Starmer said.

Hey, Lisa. Thanks for your question. To answer this, we asked AP White House Reporter Aamer Madhani. Here's what he said:

That 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, was brokered by the Obama administration before being abandoned by Trump in 2018. It included caps on enrichment, how much material Iran can stockpile and limits the operation of advanced centrifuges needed to enrich. Trump called it the “worst deal ever.”

Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff have offered inconsistent public messages about whether Iran would be allowed to retain the capacity to enrich uranium to lower levels for civilian purposes.

“They don't need to enrich past 3.67%,” Witkoff said in an April Fox News interview. “This is going to be much about verification on the enrichment program and then ultimately verification on weaponization.”

The next day Witkoff backtracked. “A deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal,” Witkoff wrote in a post on X.

The administration argues the case is moot because he's back in the United States.

“Plaintiffs have now received the relief they sought in their Complaint because Defendants have taken extraordinary steps and have facilitated, and indeed effectuated, Abrego Garcia's return,” U.S. attorneys wrote in a filing Monday.

Jennifer Vasquez Sura, Abrego Garcia's American wife, filed the lawsuit in a U.S. District Court in Maryland after Abrego Garcia was expelled in March to his native El Salvador. His deportation violated a U.S. immigration judge's order in 2019 that barred him from being sent to El Salvador because he faced a credible threat of violence from local gangs there.

The Trump administration later described the deportation as an administrative error. 

The U.S. returned Abrego Garcia earlier this month to face federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee, where he remains in custody. Abrego Garcia's attorneys have characterized the smuggling case as a desperate attempt to justify the mistaken deportation.

On his social media site, Trump shared a screenshot of the text from Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee's also a Baptist minister and a former Arkansas governor.

He opens by referencing last year's attempted assassination of Trump in Pennsylvania, saying Trump was spared by God to be the “most consequential President in a century – maybe ever.”

Huckabee says no president in his lifetime “has been in a position like yours. Not since Truman in 1945.” That's a reference to President Harry Truman's decision to drop an atomic bomb on Japan during World War II.

Trump returned to Washington early Tuesday after leaving an international summit a day ahead of schedule because of the Israel-Iran conflict.

“You did not seek this moment. This moment sought YOU!” Huckabee wrote, adding, “It is my honor to serve you!”

The Senate is expected to approve the legislation Tuesday that would regulate a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, the first of what's expected to be a wave of crypto legislation from Congress the industry hopes will bolster its legitimacy and reassure consumers.

The fast-moving legislation, which will be sent to the House for potential revisions, comes on the heels of a 2024 campaign cycle where the crypto industry ranked among the top political spenders in the country, underscoring its growing influence in Washington and beyond.

Eighteen Democratic senators have shown support for the legislation as it has advanced, siding with the Republican majority in the 53-47 Senate.

Still, most Democrats oppose the bill. They've raised concerns that the measure does little to address President Trump's personal financial interests in the crypto space.

Back in March, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers U.S. spy agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon.

When asked about the comment aboard Air Force One, Trump dismissed her remark.

“I don't care what she said,” Trump said. “I think they were very close to having it.”

Trump had signed an order in early April to keep TikTok running for another 75 days after a potential deal to sell the popular video sharing app to American owners was put on ice.

“Probably yeah, yeah,” he responded when asked by reporters on Air Force One whether the deadline would be extended again.

“Probably have to get China approval but I think we'll get it. I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.”

He indicated in an interview last month with NBC that he would be open to pushing back the deadline again. If it happens, it would be third time that the deadline has been extended.

Trump bristled when asked about some of his MAGA faithful, including conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who've suggested further U.S. involvement would be a betrayal to supporters who were drawn to his promise to end U.S. involvement in expensive and endless wars.

“Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,' IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!'” the president wrote on social media.

Other prominent Trump supporters have also raised concerns about how far the president should go in backing Israel.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk are among prominent Trump World allies who've noted that voters backed Trump because he promised not to entangle the nation in foreign clashes and to be wary of expanding U.S. involvement in the Mideast conflict.

The president said he won't call Walz after the targeted shootings of two state lawmakers because it would “waste time.”

One of the lawmakers and her husband were killed.

The Republican president spoke to reporters early Tuesday aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington after abruptly leaving an international summit in Canada because of rising tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. Asked if he planned to call Walz, Trump said the Democratic governor is “slick” and “whacked out” and said, “I'm not calling him.”

Presidents often reach out to other elected officials at times of tragedy to offer condolences.

Trump added, “The guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. So, you know, I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?”

Walz was the vice presidential running mate for 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who lost her presidential bid to Trump.

If the U.S. decides to support Israel more directly in its attack on Iran, one option for Washington would be to provide the “bunker-buster” bombs believed necessary to significantly damage the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, built deeply into a mountain. Such a bomb would have to be dropped from an American aircraft, which could have wide-ranging ramifications, including jeopardizing any chance of Iran engaging in Trump's desired talks on its nuclear program.

If the U.S. decides to support Israel more directly in its attack on Iran, one option for Washington would be to provide the “bunker-buster” bombs believed necessary to significantly damage the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, built deeply into a mountain.

Such a bomb would have to be dropped from an American aircraft, which could have wide-ranging ramifications, including jeopardizing any chance of Iran engaging in Trump's desired talks on its nuclear program. Israeli officials have also suggested that there are other options for it to attack Fordo as it seeks to destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities. But aside from a commando attack on the ground or a nuclear strike, the bunker buster bomb seems the most likely option.

The bomb is believed to be able to penetrate about 200 feet (61 meters) below the surface before exploding, and the bombs can be dropped one after another, effectively drilling deeper and deeper with each successive blast.

(Stephen Lam/San Francisco Chronicle via AP)



A federal appeals court in San Francisco is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday on whether the Trump administration should return control of National Guard troops to California after they were deployed following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.

The hearing comes after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request by the administration last week to temporarily pause a lower court order that directed Trump to return control of the soldiers to the governor who filed a lawsuit over the deployment.

The three-judge panel is set to hear oral arguments via video starting at 3 p.m. ET, and protests outside the downtown San Francisco court are expected.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco ruled last week that the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. It applied only to the National Guard troops and not the Marines, who were also deployed to LA.

French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said it was “entirely positive” that President Donald Trump was to leave the Group of Seven summit a day early, as efforts to de-escalate the conflict between Israel and Iran continued. The U.S. said Trump planned to skip a series of Tuesday meetings that would address the ongoing war in Ukraine and global trade issues.



We'll answer a few each day during our live coverage.






President Donald Trump in about eight hours Monday went from suggesting a nuclear deal with Iran remained “achievable” to urging Tehran's 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his visit to an international summit to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team.

He returns to the capital at a moment of choosing in his presidency. Israel, with five days of missile strikes, has done considerable damage to Iran and believes it can now deal a permanent blow to Tehran's nuclear program — particularly if it gets a little more help from Trump.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his overnight flight back to Washington that Iranian leaders had been unwilling to reach an agreement over their nuclear program, suggesting he was now less interested in talking with them.

“They should have done the deal. I told them: Do the deal,” Trump said. “So I don't know. I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.”

The Republican president, who said he plans to meet with advisers in the Situation Room, appears to be gradually building the public case for a more direct American role in the conflict. His shift in tone comes as the U.S. has repositioned warships and military aircraft in the region to respond if the conflict between Israel and Iran further escalates.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals court in San Francisco is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday on whether the Trump administration should return control of National Guard troops to California after they were deployed following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.

The hearing comes after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request by the administration last week to temporarily pause a lower court order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of the soldiers to the governor who filed a lawsuit over the deployment.

The three-judge panel is set to hear oral arguments via video starting at noon, and protests outside the downtown San Francisco court are expected. 

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco ruled last week that the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. It applied only to the National Guard troops and not the Marines, who were also deployed to LA. 

The Trump administration argued the deployment was necessary to restore order and protect federal buildings and officers.

In his lawsuit, Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the president of inflaming tensions, breaching state sovereignty and wasting resources. The governor calls the federal government's decision to take command of the state's National Guard “illegal and immoral.”

Newsom filed the suit following days of unrest as demonstrators protested against federal immigration raids across the city.




The judge ruled the Trump violated the use of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is unable “to execute the laws of the United States.”




Breyer, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said in his ruling that what has been happening in Los Angeles does not meet the definition of a rebellion.

“The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion,'” he wrote. “Individuals' right to protest the government is one of the fundamental rights protected by the First Amendment, and just because some stray bad actors go too far does not wipe out that right for everyone.”

The National Guard hasn't been activated without a governor's permission since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday the U.S. knows where Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is hiding during the Israel-Iran conflict but doesn't want him killed “for now.”

Trump urged, in a social media posting, Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” as the five-day conflict continues to escalate.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump added. “He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”

Trump's increasingly muscular comments toward the Iranian government come after he urged Tehran's 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his visit to an international summit to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team.

The comments about Khamenei and calls for surrender came shortly after Trump in a separate posting touted complete control of the skies over Tehran.

Trump returned the White House from his abbreviated visit to the Group of Seven summit in the Canadian Rockies early Tuesday at a moment of choosing in his presidency. Israel, with five days of missile strikes, has done considerable damage to Iran and believes it can now deal a permanent blow to Tehran's nuclear program — particularly if it gets a little more help from the Republican president.

But deepening American involvement, perhaps by providing the Israelis with bunker-busting bombs to penetrate Iranian nuclear sites built deep underground or offering other direct U.S. military support, comes with enormous political risk for Trump. 




Trump, as he made his way back to Washington, expressed frustration with Iranian leaders for failing to reach an agreement. He said he was now looking for “a real end” to the conflict and a “complete give-up” of Tehran's nuclear program. 

“They should have done the deal. I told them, ‘Do the deal,'” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “So I don't know. I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.”

Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, and U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran is not actively pursuing a bomb.

Trump, who planned to meet with advisers in the Situation Room, appears to be gradually building the public case for a more direct American role in the conflict. His shift in tone comes as the U.S. has repositioned warships and military aircraft in the region to respond if the conflict between Israel and Iran further escalates.

The White House announced Monday, while Trump was at the Group of Seven summit in the Canadian Rockies, that he would cut his trip short. 

“Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” he wrote on social media. “I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!”

Asked about his evacuation comment aboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters: “I just want people to be safe.”

“We're looking at better than a ceasefire. We're not looking for a ceasefire,” Trump said.

Trump said he wasn't ruling out a diplomatic option and he could send Vice President JD Vance and special envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with the Iranians.

He also dismissed congressional testimony from National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, who told lawmakers in March that U.S. spy agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon. 

“I don't care what she said,” Trump said. “I think they were very close to having it.”

The Israelis say their offensive has eviscerated Iran's air defenses and they can now strike targets across the country at will. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Israeli bombardment will continue until Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missiles are destroyed.

So far, Israel has targeted multiple Iranian nuclear program sites but has not been able to destroy Iran's Fordo uranium enrichment facility. 

The site is buried deep underground — and to eliminate it, Israel may need the 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which uses its weight and sheer kinetic force to reach deeply buried targets and then explode. But Israel does not have the munition or the bomber needed to deliver it — the penetrator is currently delivered by the B-2 stealth bomber. 

Israel's own defenses remain largely intact in the face of Iran's retaliatory strikes, but some of Tehran's missiles are getting through and having deadly impact.

The White House dispatched Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for a prime-time TV appearance as speculation grows about whether Trump could be tilting toward more direct U.S. involvement. Hegseth told Fox News Channel that “of course” Trump wanted to see a deal made to curb Iran's nuclear program.

“His position has not changed,” Hegseth said. “What you're watching in real time is peace through strength and America first. Our job is to be strong. We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that's what happens here.” 

Trump, meanwhile, during an exchange with reporters on the sidelines of the G7, declined to say what it would take for the U.S. to get more directly involved. Instead, he continued to press Iran on negotiations over its nuclear program.

“They should talk, and they should talk immediately,” Trump said during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. He added, “I'd say Iran is not winning this war.”

To be certain, Trump in the days-old conflict has sought to restrain Netanyahu. He rejected a plan presented by Israel to the U.S. to kill Khamenei, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to comment on the sensitive matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The Israelis had informed the Trump administration in recent days that they had developed a credible plan to kill Khamenei.

Trump bristled when asked about some of his MAGA faithful, including conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who have suggested that further U.S. involvement would be a betrayal to supporters who were drawn to his promise to end U.S. involvement in expensive and endless wars.

“Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,' IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!'” the president wrote on social media.

Other prominent Trump supporters have also raised concerns about how far the president should go in backing Israel.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk are among prominent Trump World allies who have noted that voters backed Trump because he promised not to entangle the nation in foreign clashes and to be wary of expanding U.S. involvement in the Mideast conflict.

He ran on a promise to quickly end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine but has struggled to find an endgame to either.

But there are also Trump backers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who are making the case that this is Trump's moment to deliver a decisive blow to Iran. Graham is calling for Trump to “go all-in” in backing Israel and destroying Iran's nuclear program.

""I think it is great. I just want more people to play, to enjoy it, to have a good time, and experience it, whether it comes from traditional golfers, you know, the way we used to watch it on TV or read about it in magazines or whatever,"" Sorenstam told Fox News Digital. 

""Nowadays, information is shared differently, people get information in different places, so I think it is great. They bring a different view or perspective into the sport. Whether it is fashion or trick shots, I mean they all have a little niche.""

Sorenstam is set to participate in the American Century Championship at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Club next month.

Dr. Ron Taylor, a two-time World Series champion pitcher who later became the Toronto Blue Jays' team physician, has died, the New York Mets said on Monday. He was 87.

The Mets said Taylor died in Toronto after battling a long illness.

Taylor got his start with the Cleveland Indians in 1962 and helped the St. Louis Cardinals to a World Series in 1964. After spending time with the Houston Astros, he joined the New York Mets and won a World Series title with them in 1969.

""Ron was the only guy on our staff with postseason experience,"" Taylor's former teammate Art Shamsky said in a news release. ""He had won a championship with the Cardinals in 1964 and brought a winning mentality. We don't win the title without Ron Taylor.""

Taylor was credited with being the so-called ""unsung hero"" of the Mets' roster. In four postseason appearances in 1969, he had two saves and did not allow a run in 5.2 innings.

He finished his career with the San Diego Padres in 1972.

Taylor appeared in 491 games and had a 3.93 ERA with 464 strikeouts.

When his baseball career was over, Taylor enrolled in medical school and joined the Blue Jays as the team physician. He spent about 30 years with the organization.

Taylor was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.

Hunter Dobbins spoke with John Smoltz after the Boston Red Sox's win vs. the New York Yankees.

The Boston Red Sox's decision to trade Rafael Devers sparked an intriguing reaction from Baseball Hall of Famer David Ortz on Monday.

The Red Sox stunningly traded Devers to the San Francisco Giants for four players, including Kyle Harrison and Jordan Hicks. The deal marked the end of a saga between the front office and Devers, which started when Boston signed Alex Bregman.

The Red Sox asked Devers to move from third base – an ask he refused. When Triston Casas got hurt, Devers also was not going to move to first base. Red Sox manager Alex Cora even referred to Devers as his designated hitter.

The issue started a snowball effect that ended with Boston trading Devers to the National League West team. Ortiz told The Athletic he knew the situation with Devers ""wasn't going to end well,"" but seemed to suggest Devers lacked ""maturity"" in the situation.

""I played for the Red Sox a long time. You think everything with me and the Red Sox was roses and flowers? I went through some tough times also,"" he said. ""But I was mature enough to understand and keep things internal. Even in the best families, between the best brothers, s--- happens. You need to have the maturity to resolve the problems and move on.""

Ortiz said that, in the end, it is the organization that has the power to make the final decision regardless of how much money it still owes the player.

""I know the communication between Devers and the Red Sox wasn't the best at the very beginning,"" Ortiz added. ""But at some point, you have to realize the organization has the power over everyone. They can play you, trade you, let you go. 

""Sometimes, as a young player, it's hard to understand that. But they have the power to do whatever they want. The only thing you can control is what you do on the field.""

Devers was hitting .272 with a .905 OPS and 15 home runs. He was leading the American League in walks with 56 and had played the most games in the majors (73).

Former Director of Navy Staff Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan unpacks the Israel-Iran conflict on 'The Story.'

Even his worst critics will eventually have to admit that President Donald Trump has dominated international and national events since he returned to office five months ago. 

His ""masterful ambiguity"" in the third round of the Iran-Israel War is simply brilliant. History will record it as such. 

You may have attended or watched either the Army's birthday parade or a ""No Kings"" rally or perhaps just watched the U.S. Open on Father's Day, but what will history note of the weekend's events? 

That President Trump has controlled the events unfolding in the Middle East and has done so with extraordinary skill. 

ISRAEL'S ACTIONS AGAINST IRAN CREATE STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY FOR US IN NUCLEAR TALKS, EXPERTS SAY

The most serious analysts in Israel agree. For example, Amit Segal of Israel's Channel 12 —a sort of rare but highly respected combination of anchor, reporter and analyst along the lines in the U.S. of Bret Baier —Segal and others believe President Trump gave a green light to Prime Minister Netanyahu to strike Iran in this third round of direct Iran-Israel combat in the past 14 months. 

Iran entered Israel's 10/7 Long War directly on April 13, 2024, and again on October 1 of that year by firing hundreds of missiles and bombs of all types via many attempted delivery mechanisms at the civilian population of Israel. The Israeli Defense Forces (""IDF""), with the assistance of the United States and other allies of the Jewish State, intercepted those two waves of attacks, and Israel absorbed some damage and loss of life and others injured. Israel responded with small but very precise counter-attacks that damaged Iran's air defenses and which sent a message about Israel's capabilities. President Biden and his team worked to restrain Israel from additional escalation on both occasions. 

After 10/7, as Israel reeled, Iran began a rush to weaponize its enriched uranium into a nuclear weapon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave the order to advance to active planning of this past weekend's strikes, shortly after President Trump's sweeping victory in November and days before the capitulation of Hezbollah to Israel in the Lebanon theater of the 10/7 Long War in the same week of Trump's triumph. 

But Netanyahu still needed at least tacit approval from President Trump, which he received after the expiration of the 60-day window which Trump had given the Iranian theocracy to engage in serious negotiations over the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program. 

Iran tried to play the president and that was a mistake of historic proportions. Now stories are flying about Iran's desperate attempt to get the U.S. to stop Israel's pummeling of the theocratic dictatorship which has ruled Iran since 1979 under first Ayatollah Khomeini and now Ayatollah Khamenei. Those two dictators are responsible for all the ruin Iran is experiencing now and for the past 46 years. Now the aging and obviously incompetent fanatic Khamenei has been allowed to survive to see the destruction of his madness. He may not live to see the overthrow of the regime, but he might. Because Donald Trump told him what he had to do and he not only rejected it, he repeatedly mocked Trump and threatened the U.S. 

Khamenei spent decades and billions building ""proxy forces"" in Hezbollah, Hamas, Syria's Assad regime, the Houthis in Yemen and some militias in Iraq in a vain attempt to intimidate Israel and thus prevent its striking Iran's nuclear facilities openly. 

Khameini is also suspected of trying to assassinate Trump and other American officials after Trump ordered the elimination of General Qasem Soleimani when this mastermind of Iran's international terror network landed in Iraq on January 3, 2020 on a mission to kill more Americans. (The Islamic Republic of Iran is directly responsible for the killing, wounding and hostage-taking of thousands of Americans since Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran in 1979.)

In five months Trump has moved the United States from telling Israel ""don't attack Rafah"" in Gaza, to ""go ahead, strike Iran. They refuse to negotiate in good faith."" Netanyahu didn't or need or ask a second time. And, for the first time in the many times Netanyahu has asked for the support of Israel's military leadership for the strikes, the IDF agreed: Rise up and strike. 

All this time Trump has maintained a ""masterful ambiguity"" about his role. It is remarkable and unprecedented.

A name from long ago, Sir John Lawrence, should be mentioned here. Lawrence was the British governor general and Viceroy of India from 1864-1869, and used the term ""masterful inactivity"" to summarize his policy towards Afghanistan, a policy that became associated with the very long and successful tenure of Lord Salisbury as Prime Minister of the Great Britain, who served as the top official in the United Kjngdom three times at the height of its Empire, retiring finally in 1902. 

Salisbury adopted and used the Lawrence approach again and again. Trump may not be up on the details of the Great Powers' maneuverings from the late 19th century, but he certainly knows how to play the new ""Great Game"" in the 21st century. 

Trump offers to mediate peace everywhere and always. He also always tells our enemies to not kill or wound Americans or they will feel the full force of the American military. And he knows, as only very experienced real estate developers do, when to make offers, when to withdraw them or condition them —and when to walk away. 

The past 60 days of ""negotiations"" between Iranian representatives and Special Envoy Witkoff were a genuine window for Iran to avoid the punishment it is now absorbing from Israel. Trump has offered to again dispatch Witkoff and now the U.S. has much greater leverage for those talks if they resume. President Trump is allowing Israel weeks to degrade Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs —and possibly destroy its energy export lifeline if Tehran continues to target Israeli civilians. He has not said so publicly, but he warned Khamenei it could come to blows.

Trump is a master messenger.  He basically messaged the ""border is closed"" and spoke that into closure. He is now messaging the criminal element among the millions of migrants that crossed the open border in the Biden years to get out or get arrested. He's messaged the Congressional GOP to get the ""One, Big Beautiful Bill,"" H.R. 1, done and done.  

And he's messaged American pride in its military with the Army's birthday parade, which is best understood as part of our country's 250th birthday celebration which culminates on July 4, 2026.

Trump lives inside the heads of his opponents. The absurdity of the ""No Kings"" theater is just the latest example of how the left wing of the Democratic Party not only dominates it but also lacks even a basic grasp of where the majority of the country is politically. That majority elected Trump overwhelmingly and overwhelmingly both supports law enforcement at every level of government and condemns political violence, whether from the left or the far right. (Trump's condemnation of the Minnesota killer was quick and complete. As someone who has himself at least twice been the target of assassins, I expected nothing less.)

Trump has 43 months left as president. I hope they are as successful as his first five months back.

Fox News host Jesse Watters breaks down how Iran has lost any leverage in its conflict with Israel on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

President Donald Trump decided to cut his trip to the G7 short on Monday, shortly after he said on his social media platform, Truth Social, that ""everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!""

In addition to Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in Alberta, Canada, this week for the G7 conference, will be cutting his trip short as well, Fox News has learned.

""I have to be back,"" Trump said during a ceremonial photo-op with the other world leaders present at the G7 summit on Monday. ""You probably see what I see. And I have to be back as soon as I can.""

LIVE UPDATES: ISRAEL-IRAN CONFLICT

The president's comments came amid confirmation from the White House that he would be cutting the trip short ""because of what's going on in the Middle East."" Trump, meanwhile, has requested his National Security Council be prepared for his return, Fox News learned.

Trump's change of plans also comes after he sent a message on his Truth Social platform to ""everyone"" in Iran, telling them they should ""evacuate."" 

Following the president's post, videos purportedly showing Iranians evacuating their capital city have begun surfacing on social media.

""What you're watching in real time is peace through strength and America first. Our job is to be strong. We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal,"" Hegseth told Fox News' Jesse Waters Monday night. 

""My job as the secretary of defense is to ensure that our people are safe and that we're strong so that we can set the conditions for a deal. And President Trump's made it clear it's on the table. The question is whether Iran will take it.""

IDF International Spokesman (Res.) Doron Spielman provides an update on the Israel-Iran conflict on 'Fox & Friends.'

Former Cincinnati Reds shortstop Zack Cozart was a staunch supporter of Donald Trump as he defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris for the White House in the 2024 presidential election.

But the one-time MLB All-Star drew a line in his support for the president on Monday as Trump called for mass evacuations in Tehran while tensions between Israel and Iran escalated.

""If Trump gets us in a war, I will no longer support him, and I'm sure most of you know I love Trump,"" Cozart wrote in a post on X.

Trump is set to depart the G7 summit in Canada on Monday night because of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.

""President Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. ""Much was accomplished, but because of what's going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.""

Trump has requested that the National Security Council be prepared in the situation room for his return, Fox News has learned.

Meanwhile, White House spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer dismissed reports the U.S. military was joining Israel in an attack on Iran.

""This is not true. American forces are maintaining their defensive posture, and that has not changed. We will defend American interests,"" Pfeiffer wrote on X.

Cozart came out in support of Trump ahead of the president's speech at the Republican National Convention nearly a year ago.

""I dunno bout yall but I can't wait to vote for Trump… I've honestly never seen the party as united as now… they tried to kill our President … least we can do is VOTE!!"" he wrote.

Cozart played in Major League Baseball from 2011 to 2019. The Tennessee native was a second-round pick of the Reds in 2007. He played with the Los Angeles Angels for the final two years of his career in 2018 and 2019.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","One big, beautiful benefit for everyone","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3443069/one-big-beautiful-bill-benefit-for-everyone/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 04:01:00 GMT","

Democrats are latching on to a new Congressional Budget Office report that purports to show that President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act would hurt the poor while enriching the rich. The same projection also shows that the vast majority of people would benefit from the legislation, and even while doing so, it ignores the massive damage a $4 trillion tax hike would have on the economy if the bill did not pass. The hardest hit would be the poor.

At the request of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and House Budget Committee ranking member Brendan Boyle (D-PA), the CBO produced a report last week breaking down the bill's effect on each decile of households. Two conclusions that Democrats want to ignore are that it cuts everyone's taxes and that 70% of households would gain money if the bill became law. A typical middle-class household would receive a $1,000 boost in after-tax and after-transfer income, the CBO says.

Democrats want people to focus on the report's finding that the bottom three household deciles would end up with less, almost entirely because the bill trims Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program growth. 

The poorest 10% of households currently make $22,868 in pre-tax income each year but receive another $8,463 in non-means-tested benefits, such as Social Security and Medicare, plus a further $9,889 in means-tested benefits from Medicaid, SNAP, and health insurance subsidies. After taking away $1,756 in taxes, this leaves the average household in the poorest 10th of households with $39,464 after tax income transfers.

According to the CBO, if the bill becomes law, the poorest 10% of households would get a tax cut, but it would not make up for their losses from lower Medicaid and food stamp benefits. The slower growth of these programs would supposedly lead to fewer resources overall.

There are three problems with this analysis. First, the CBO assumes states will cut food stamp spending in proportion to federal reductions in spending. However, states are free to keep spending at current projected levels. Second, the CBO assumes millions will lose Medicaid benefits entirely and will not do anything, such as get off the couch and find a job, to keep their health insurance.

The CBO has a terrible track record of predicting health insurance losses. In 2017, it said Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate would cause 4 million people to lose their health insurance, including 3 million who would lose their private insurance and 1 million who would lose Medicaid. But the opposite happened. The number of people with private health insurance grew by 3 million, and the number with Medicaid grew by 10 million.

Most importantly, the CBO report ignores the macroeconomic damage that would result from rejecting the OBBB. Such an outcome would mean a $4 trillion tax hike. Recessions hit low-income households hardest; low-income workers suffered unemployment twice the rate of higher-income workers during the Great Recession.

After the Trump tax cuts became law in 2017, wages rose by 5% overall, and the bottom 10% of wage earners saw 50% more wage growth than the top 10% of earners. The CBO did not predict that.

TRUMP EPA LIBERATES POWER PLANTS FROM CLIMATE REGULATIONS

Not only would the One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut taxes for everyone and prevent a recession, but its passage would mean the wealthy would pay an even larger percentage of tax revenues. Before the 2017 tax cuts, the wealthiest 10% of earners paid 70% of federal taxes, and the top 1% paid 38.5%. If the OBBB becomes law, the top 10% will pay 77.5%, and the top 1% will pay 41.1%.

Not only would everyone benefit, but the wealthiest would pay a larger share of our collective tax bill. It would be a win for everyone.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former Libertarian vice presidential nominee Mike ter Maat and dozens of other members of the third party have joined a caucus within the Republican Party, hoping to usher in fiscally conservative policies.

Ter Maat, 2024 Libertarian presidential candidate Chase Oliver‘s running mate, left the Libertarian Party with over 40 members who have joined the Republican Liberty Caucus, a political organization working with the national party to promote limited government and free markets.

The former vice presidential nominee told the Washington Examiner that he switched parties because the “big political battle” over the next few years will be within the Republican Party.

“That's the fight that is really going to matter to public policy at the federal level, to politics at the national level,” ter Maat said in an interview. “And that's because the president will eventually leave, and that will leave a big vacuum, and the Republican Party needs to decide what it's going to look like after that.”

The departures of the now-former Libertarians come after President Donald Trump heavily courted the Libertarian vote during the 2024 election cycle, making several promises to their members during a speech at their nominating convention, such as commuting the life sentence of “Silk Road” website creator Ross Ulbricht.

Trump's address to the Libertarian Party was met with loud booing, but he was cheered for pledges to free Ulbricht and pardon the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters — two promises the president has fulfilled since taking office in January.

While Trump's term doesn't end until 2029, ter Maat and several members who have left the national Libertarian Party to join the Republican Liberty Caucus are hoping to influence the GOP from the inside.

The former Libertarians told the Washington Examiner that they see an opportunity within the Republican Party to promote fiscal conservatism and other issues they are passionate about.

That includes when the party chooses its next standard-bearer, said Joshua Hlavka, the former chairman of the Libertarian Party in Florida and a former adviser for ter Maat in 2024, pointing to the fact that Trump has not thrown his full support behind a successor yet.

“Generally speaking, when the guy in power isn't backing anybody, there's going to be a lot of people looking to influence here,” Hlavka said. “I'd like to see somebody who's going to care about issues that I'm worried about: Staying uninvolved in foreign conflicts that don't concern the American people, minimizing our tax burdens out here, protecting individual rights.”

“I want to make sure that whoever does follow up behind Trump represents those values, and also the fiscal conservatism that we're looking for here in America,” he continued.

Conversations between ter Maat and the other members of the RLC started earlier this year, with Chairman John Dennis telling the Washington Examiner the caucus is an “entry point” for Libertarians who are “disappointed or just want to move on from the Libertarian Party.”

Moving into 2026 and 2028, the RLC is hoping to recruit members from across the political spectrum, including Libertarians, Republicans, independents, and even Democrats. Dennis called the recruitment into the caucus its “primary mission.”

The wave of Libertarians joining the RLC helps the caucus build its bench with prospective volunteers, donors, and candidates. Dennis floated ter Maat as a possible candidate in a federal race down the road.

Ter Maat told the Washington Examiner that he did not have plans to run for either the GOP nomination or a congressional seat.

In the past, the RLC has supported figures such as the libertarian-leaning Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).

Massie and Paul have broken with the Republican Party multiple times, most recently over the massive Republican-led tax cut and spending bill to advance Trump's second-term agenda, which Massie voted against on the House floor. The bill, titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has been criticized by fiscal hawks for not cutting spending enough.

Amity Dolby, a former Libertarian Party chairwoman of Virginia's 5th Congressional District, said she made the switch to promote more members such as the two Kentucky Republicans and to help “steer the GOP in the direction of liberty.”

“I feel like Americans are better served making decisions for their own lives,” Dolby said. “And if we have liberty, limited government, and free markets, then they have more opportunity to do that.”

The Libertarian Party, while the biggest third-party in the United States, has received a dwindling vote share in recent election cycles. Oliver netted less than 1% of the national vote share in 2024. In 2016, then-nominee Gary Johnson received over 3% of the vote, and Jo Jorgensen, the 2020 nominee, garnered just over 1%.

Ultimately, ter Maat said a large reason he decided to leave the Libertarian Party was the “substantial disadvantage” the party is at structurally, both in terms of ballot access and infighting.

CLASH OVER DEFICITS THREATENS SENATE PASSAGE OF GOP TAX BILL

Referring to now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s unsuccessful 2024 independent presidential bid, ter Maat said it was evidence of how the U.S.'s two-party system makes it difficult for any third-party bid to get any traction.

“You know, here's a smart, charismatic guy with a good last name and a whole bunch of money behind him, and he still found it difficult, right?” ter Maat said about Kennedy, who also spoke at the Libertarian convention in an attempt to court an endorsement. “So, that's hard, and in a system that is controlled largely by two parties. It's probably going to be hard for a long time.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army was a joyous occasion that honored over two centuries of sacrifices of some of the bravest men and women in our nation's history. With the country less than 13 months from celebrating its semiquincentennial on July 4, 2026, a parade honoring 250 years of the U.S. Army was a brilliant idea. President Donald Trump has vowed to make America great again, and with Saturday's extravaganza, he also helped make patriotism great again. 

Spectators were greeted with a parade, pun intended, of American history. Chronicling the Army's journey over 250 years, the parade started with a colonial-era unit brought to life by the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, recognizing the Army's birth on June 14, 1775, in Philadelphia by the Second Continental Congress. Different units representing various eras in history marched by with Army soldiers dressed in the appropriate uniforms of the times. 

There were some time jumps in the parade. After the Revolutionary War era, the next Army unit on display was from the Civil War, skipping the Army eras of the War of 1812, the Native American conflicts of the 1820s and 1830s, and the Mexican-American War. The 4th Infantry Division was dressed in Civil War-era uniforms, honoring the soldiers of that time. Soldiers in uniforms from each era, accompanied by Army vehicles from each generation, continued until reaching the present day, with contemporary uniforms, soldiers, vehicles, and technology.

Arguably, the most impressive display was the chronological parade of Army vehicles, from the use of horses in the 18th century to the tanks, planes, jets, helicopters, drones, and robotic dogs of the 21st century. Spectators were able to see firsthand the technological advancements of the Army throughout its existence. It was a sight to behold, especially the military flyovers showcasing different planes and aircraft over the years. 

But more than the aesthetics, the parade brought an atmosphere of patriotism. It's something that has been missing in this country for quite some time. If the parade accomplished nothing else, it eliminated the shameful miasma of American guilt the Left created that has plagued American society for decades. The allure of patriotism filled the air. 

The people of this country could be proud again of their military and heroic feats over the last 250 years. We could be proud to be Americans again, proud of the Stars and Stripes again. We could look at the evolution of the U.S. Army as if it were occurring right before our very eyes and express gratitude for the bravery and courage of the soldiers of today and yesteryear and all the good they have protected and allowed to flourish in this world.

It happened because of President Donald Trump's vision.

The Left sought to demean the parade and diminish it as nothing more than Trump's vanity project. Yet, in reality, the only vanity project related to the parade came from those dead set on opposing it, seeking to quash the sentiments of pride and patriotism emanating from all those in attendance. 

If for no other reason, that is why the parade was a massive success, and it should be remembered as such. And if there is any lesson to be learned from this, it is that no day is a bad day when there is a parade for the U.S. Army.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump arrived in Washington, D.C., early Monday morning, one day ahead of his scheduled return to the White House from the G7 in Canada.

Trump has ramped up pressure on Tehran to make a “deal” with the United States after Israel began striking targets inside Iran late last week. However, he told reporters during his return flight to Joint Base Andrews that he wasn't looking to broker a “ceasefire.”

“I'm not looking for a ceasefire. We're looking at better than a ceasefire,” the president stated before adding that he is eying a “complete give-up” by Iran.

Asked about the possibility of Iran expanding its retaliation against Israel to include American targets in the region, Trump said, “They know not to touch our troops.”

“We'll come down so hard,” he continued. “It'll be gloves off.”

Trump claimed that he returned to Washington to monitor the conflict live in the Situation Room instead of being briefed by aides via phone in Canada.

“Being on the scene is much better, and we did everything I had to do at the G7,” he suggested.

Last week, White House officials had claimed that Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was still prepared to travel to the Middle East to negotiate with Iranian officials, but the president said Tuesday morning that he is now considering dispatching Witkoff or Vice President JD Vance.

“It depends what happens when I get back,” he told reporters. “I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.”

Monday evening, reports out of Israel claimed that U.S. war planes were assisting Israeli forces in carrying out strikes against Iranian targets. The Trump administration strongly denied those reports.

“American Forces are maintaining their defensive posture & that has not changed. We will protect American troops & our interests,” Defense Department spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that was later shared by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Democrats are touting former Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who they hope will be a bright spot for the party in the state's gubernatorial election later this year, after months of internal drama and political bruisings from the GOP.

Spanberger has already clinched the Democratic nomination in the race to succeed Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA), who is term-limited, ahead of Tuesday's primary.

She will run against Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R-VA), who survived two primary challengers and clinched the GOP nomination before the Tuesday primary. 

Polling from the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College last month shows Spanberger with a 17-point lead over Earle-Sears, 43%-26%. The Democratic nominee also raised $6.5 million between April 1 and June 5, more than $3 million more than her Republican competitor.

Spanberger has more than $14 million in cash on hand, far above the roughly $3 million Earle-Sears has on hand. 

“Polls do show that Abigail Spanberger right now looks pretty good in the general election,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington. “The reality of 2025 may very well be that if Spanberger wins, it will be one of the brightest spots for Democrats this year. It's clear that the Virginia Democratic Party is more energized than the national Democratic Party, which continues to seem to struggle with questions of identity.”

Democrats have struggled to find a consistent message against President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. Some leaders, such as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), have relished public battles with Trump.

Newsom and Trump traded barbs in the aftermath of some violent protests against immigration officials in Los Angeles. The California governor sued the Trump administration over deploying the National Guard to LA without Newsom's consent.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco will hold a hearing over the case on Tuesday after a separate judge ruled the National Guard deployment was illegal. 

A trio of Democratic leaders, Govs. Kathy Hochul (D-NY), JB Pritzker (D-IL), and Tim Walz (D-MN) sparred with House Republicans over immigration during a congressional hearing last week. 

Spanberger has opted to focus more on fixing the affordability crisis in Virginia and less on public feuds with the Trump administration, in her hopes to become the commonwealth's first female governor. If Earle-Sears is elected, she also would be the first female governor in the commonwealth and the first black female governor in the country.

“Virginians know that Abigail has a record of bringing people together and getting things done,” Spanberger spokeswoman Libby Wiet said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “They know that she will be a Governor who is relentlessly focused on making Virginia more affordable for their families, strengthening schools for their kids, and growing the Commonwealth's economy for everyone.”

Heading into both the primary on Tuesday and the general election in November, Democrats have historical precedent on their side. The Virginia gubernatorial race, long seen as a political bellwether for the next midterm elections, tends to vote for the political party opposite the president's party.

“We have both New Jersey and Virginia as leans democratic,” said J. Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, about the two gubernatorial races this year. “That said to kind of maybe split hairs a little, I wouldn't be surprised if Virginia ends up a bigger win for the Democrats.”

Youngkin capitalized on his conventional standard in 2021 when he defeated former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe by riding a wave of backlash against Democratic handling of school lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This time, it just doesn't feel like it has that same magic,” Coleman said about Earle-Sears's gubernatorial campaign. 

Officials with the Democratic Governors Association touted their confidence in Spanberger by announcing a $5 million investment in the Virginia race. DGA leaders claimed that Spanberger has the momentum against Earle-Sears during a recent call with reporters, but they are prepared for a competitive race.

Farnsworth claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency's cuts to federal workers, who make up a significant portion of Virginia's workforce, will likely help Democrats come November.

“Virginia looks a lot like 2017 right now,” he said, referring to just before the 2018 midterms that allowed Democrats to retake the House. “And that's before we even get to the real challenge that Winsome Earle-Sears is going to face, and that is, a lot of the policies that the Trump administration is pursuing have a disproportionately negative impact on Virginia.” 

The layoffs do not just affect federal workers, Coleman added. “There are whole industries who do work with the federal government, who are facing more uncertainty or possible layoffs, and it's kind of some backlash that we think could probably work in Spanberger's favor, especially because she comes from that world. She has a background in the intelligence community.”

Wiet said that “Virginians who have lost their jobs, are afraid their jobs will be targeted next, or are worried about Virginia's economic future deserve a Governor who will stand up to the Trump Administration's attacks, not someone whose advice is ‘do not fret' — and Virginia voters trust Abigail to always put Virginia first. That's why she will be elected to serve as the next Governor of Virginia.”

But the GOP ticket is aiming to paint Spanberger as a national Democrat who is unable to relate to the average Virginian's daily life. 

“While Democrats pin their hopes on a candidate who has only ever been a part of the problem in Washington, Winsome Earle-Sears is out talking to Virginians about real solutions to real problems,” Earle-Sears spokeswoman Peyton Vogel said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

“Winsome has a record of delivering results, and as Governor, she'll continue to build upon the successes of the Youngkin-Sears Administration that has created jobs and put more money back in Virginians' pockets,” Vofel continued. “She is a Marine, a mom, and a proven leader who knows how to fight and win, and that's exactly what she'll do in November.”

David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, agreed that Spanberger's polling and fundraising figures are in a good spot. But he also offered some caution for her campaign. 

“I saw some stuff over the weekend that I thought was a little worrisome for the Democrats' effort: The African American vote in the primaries is down,” Richards said. “That doesn't mean they're not going to vote in the general election, but if the African American vote isn't motivated, then you know that's going to hurt the Democrats in Virginia.”

Richards also offered some caution on what the Democratic ticket lineup could look like after the primary.

“If it's not going to be a very diverse ticket, then the Republicans have that advantage if they choose to use it,” he said. “Now, they have their own problems, of course.”

Two Democrats are running in the attorney general primary: former state Del. Jay Jones and Henrico County Commonwealth's Attorney Shannon Taylor. 

Six candidates are running for lieutenant governor on the Democratic side: Alex Bastani; state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi; Dr. Babur Lateef, chairman of the Prince William County School Board; state Sen. Aaron Rouse; Victor Salgado; and former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney.

On the Republican side, Attorney General Jason Miyares is seeking reelection, while John Reid is the only GOP candidate for lieutenant governor. Youngkin previously asked Reid, who is gay, to step away from the ticket after nude photos of men were posted to a social media account affiliated with the candidate.

Earle-Sears did not directly claim that the full GOP ticket would campaign together for a unity event when asked by a reporter. “Actually, as you know, we are all running our campaigns,” Earle-Sears said.

WHO IS ABIGAIL SPANBERGER? MEET THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR VIRGINIA GOVERNOR

The Virginia race likely will not turbocharge until after Labor Day, which Richards said gives the GOP ticket “plenty of time” to decide when to campaign together.

“If you check back in in October and they still haven't been onstage together, I'm going to be very concerned,” he said. “But right now, give them some time, they'll figure it out. They have to figure it out.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

BANFF, Canada — The Group of Seven leaders have condemned Iran in what has become a rare joint statement after President Donald Trump departed the 2025 annual summit early to address the crisis unfolding between Israel and Iran in the Middle East.

“We, the leaders of the G7, reiterate our commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East,” the G7 leaders wrote late Monday. “In this context, we affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself. We reiterate our support for the security of Israel. We also affirm the importance of the protection of civilians.”

#G7 leaders' statement on recent developments between Israel and Iran.Read more: https://t.co/HlV9Fcclfw pic.twitter.com/C6vvlqMmw7

The leaders specifically criticize Iran as “the principal source of regional instability and terror,” adding they have been “consistently clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon.”

“We urge that the resolution of the Iranian crisis leads to a broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza,” they wrote. “We will remain vigilant to the implications for international energy markets and stand ready to coordinate, including with like-minded partners, to safeguard market stability.”

Earlier Monday, the White House appeared to confirm reports Trump was considering not signing onto the G7 leaders' Iran-Israel statement.

“Under the strong leadership of President Trump, the United States is back to leading the effort to restore peace around the world,” a White House official told the Washington Examiner. “President Trump will continue to work towards ensuring Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon.”

This year's G7 host, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, had previewed prior to this week's summit that there would be no leaders joint communique to conclude the meeting because of deep disagreements between Trump and the rest of the group on issues from the Russia-Ukraine war to tariffs. Instead, separate statements will continue to be issued underscoring areas of agreement, though Trump is not expected to sign onto the G7 sanctions package against Russia.

The late-night statement on Iran caps a dramatic day in the Canadian city of Kananaskis, where the summit is poised to continue without Trump on Tuesday. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not even scheduled to arrive in Canada until Tuesday morning. Trump's early departure upends plans for him to meet with Zelensky and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, in addition to holding a press conference.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt surprised reporters on Monday when she announced that Trump was returning to Washington early to “attend to many important matters.”

Leavitt then issued a clarifying statement, citing the conflict in the Middle East and the progress Trump made during the first day of the two-day summit.

“President Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer,” she wrote. “Much was accomplished, but because of what's going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.”

President Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Much was accomplished, but because of what's going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.

Trump had posted his own cryptic statement on social media earlier in the day, advising the approximately 9.5 million residents of Iran's capital, Tehran, to evacuate.

“Iran should have signed the ‘deal' I told them to sign,” he wrote. “What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!”

En route back to his own capital, where he has reportedly asked his National Security Council to be ready for him, Trump posted a sharp critique of French President Emmanuel Macron, too. Macron had indirectly undermined Trump before the G7 summit by stopping in Greenland, which Trump has promised to annex, and expressing his support before traveling on to Canada.

“Publicity seeking President Emmanuel Macron, of France, mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a ‘cease fire' between Israel and Iran,” Trump wrote. “Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:vox.com","“She's not a girl's girl.”","https://www.vox.com/culture/416866/sabrina-carpenter-sydney-sweeney-kylie-jenner-girls-tiktok-feminism","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

From pick mes to “not a girl's girl,” the internet is full of woman-on-woman callouts.

The cover for Sabrina Carpenter's upcoming album, Man's Best Friend, isn't going over well. 

Last week, the singer unveiled the polarizing artwork, which shows her on all fours while a male hand grabs her hair. Within seconds, users on X and TikTok labeled the image “misogynistic” and “irresponsible.” Others claimed that Carpenter was never “for the girls. “She's never embodied the female gaze,” wrote one poster. “She is the type of man-hater that men prefer, putting on the image of a sexy and vengeful femme fatale, but all in the name of male attention and love.”

While some argued that the photograph was probably satirical, given Carpenter's reputation for calling out her lover's mistreatment in her music, others quickly dismissed those interpretations. 

Overall, the cover seemed to confirm an observation that Carpenter's critics have made throughout her Short ‘N' Sweet Tour: Her sex-tinged lyrics and hyperfeminine image are too “male-centered.” 

This line of criticism is all over social media these days, often aimed at women who are sexually forward or perceived as trying to appeal to men. There are a few different slurs and descriptions for this archetype — “pick-me,” “male-dominated,” “not a girl's girl.” Social media is cluttered with warnings and treatises about these women. At best, the conventional wisdom goes, they're annoying to be around. At worst, they're a threat to women's equality.

It's a fraught type of criticism, especially when cultural misogyny is regaining a foothold it only briefly lost in the years following #MeToo movement. Meanwhile, the conversation may also be fueled by younger people, who are reportedly developing more conservative attitudes toward sex. 

This tension around gender and sexuality feels emblematic of a particularly anxious climate, where every person, image, or viral moment feels like an explosive weapon in a cultural gender war. At the same time, these criticisms sound extremely familiar.

You can trace the recent fixation on “anti-women” behavior by women to a few viral trends, including the usage of the term “pick-me,” which originated on Black Twitter in the 2010s. 

“‘Pick-mes' are viewed as trying to get men to pick them for sex or love over other women,” says Danielle Procope Bell, an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who's done research on the online phenomenon. “Eventually, the term traveled to other internet spaces, including the ‘mainstream' white internet and the Black manosphere. Its meaning shifts depending on the group using it.” 

For a while, the pejorative was used to mock women who shamed other women for not being submissive in relationships or “respectable” in public. In the 2020s, though, the term spread to TikTok and, as with most Black slang, became flattened. What started as a pointed critique of internalized misogyny became shorthand for a host of behaviors that might happen to appeal to the male gaze. Users flooded the hashtag with innocuous if not totally random signs of “pick me” behavior, from being friends with your friend's romantic partner to liking beer. 

Maybe due to some backlash over the proliferation of the term, TikTok has recently turned its attention to “male-centered women,” a more academic-sounding label that is practically the same phenomenon. A male-centered woman may not shame other women the way a “pick me” once did, but like the latter-day examples, she will spend a bulk of her time and energy on men and their concerns. (There was a time such a woman might have been called the relatively benign epithet “boy crazy.”) On TikTok, you can find videos of women mocking “male-centered” women and explaining how they're untrustworthy. “Women who are extremely male-centered will never truly be your friend,” explained one TikToker. Sex and the City protagonist Carrie Bradshaw comes up frequently as the ultimate symbol of “male-centeredness.” 

Users are equally aggressive in adjudicating what it means to be “women-centered.” Maybe the most popular measure of morality these days is whether or not a woman can be considered “a girl's girl” or “for the girlies,” terms used to describe women who know how to get along with other women and support them in various social situations. These phrases are often weaponized on female-led reality shows like Real Housewives and routinely debated online. When a TikToker labeled Kylie Jenner as “for the girlies” after she shared the details of her breast augmentation a few weeks ago (thereby not gatekeeping her look, a primary crime of girlbossery), critics loudly disagreed. 

Hidden in these remarks are reasonable concerns about gender, power, and the ways girls and young women can easily be influenced online. Folks mad at Jenner for disclosing her plastic surgery details saw it as contributing to the pressure to fit into conventional beauty standards, one that's amplified on social media platforms like TikTok. 

Conservative propaganda aimed at women is equally hard to escape. From tradwife influencers to women promoting “soft living,” these quietly patriarchal trends can easily seep through our algorithms. When mainstream celebrities like Carpenter or Sydney Sweeney — who recently garnered backlash for selling soap supposedly made with her own bathwater — present products that appeal to men, there's reason to fear that everyone is succumbing to a larger sexist agenda. 

The form this discourse is taking might have to do with the noticeable disinterest in men among women right now. Gen Z is dating less, and more women are pursuing celibacy. Overall, it seems like younger women are acknowledging that they can live complete lives without male partnerships. At the same time, male-centered culture (and politics) seems to be desperately seeking a way to reset gender norms to the 1950s. 

Women today have no problem publicly expressing their aversion to men, whether on popular podcasts or through TikTok. Sex writer Magdalene J. Taylor explored casual man-hating online in a Substack post titled “Do Women Even Like Men Anymore?” She connects this trend to the increasingly grim realities of misogyny and violence against women. She also writes that, from a cultural standpoint, “it's become deeply uncool, as women, to acknowledge any sort of affinity or appreciation for men.”

While the effects of misandry and misogyny aren't tantamount, this online man-bashing has visibly manifested in women publicly criticizing or policing other women's relationships to men. Former Vox culture reporter Rebecca Jennings wrote about how “divorce him” has become the immediate advice for women perceived to be in unhappy or sometimes just imperfect marriages on social media. These remarks are often publicized with little concern for how they may affect the women they're aimed at or a complete picture of their relationships. 

Professor Jessa Lingel, director of the Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies Program at the University of Pennsylvania, Annenberg, says that this infighting and division over gender and sexuality echoes previous feminist movements — although it's not totally clear whether everyone participating in these conversations identifies as a feminist.

Lingel says that “in the 1970s, feminists like Betty Friedan called lesbians a ‘lavender menace'” and “saw them as a distraction from the movement's goals on economic equality and workplace rights.” 

Meanwhile, author Sophie Lewis sees the work of second-wave feminist Andrea Dworkin in these current accusations. She tells Vox that the activist, who was notably anti-sex work, has had a literary revival over the past few years, as a “particularly femmephobic strain of radical feminism” is resurging. 

Critiquing women's behavior, specifically those in positions of power, isn't inherently bad or uncalled for. Lingel says that, in feminist movements, addressing legitimate imperfections has always been necessary. However, it's hard not to notice how much of these online conversations about the patriarchy center around individual women — real or hypothetical — and not the structural forces that may be influencing their behavior. That is, if their behavior is even really a problem. 

Many of these takes, specifically the ones aimed at Carpenter, are mainly concerned with how men will respond to them. They suggest that women are to blame for men's actions or that they can protect themselves from violence by appearing a certain way. 

Likewise, social media facilitates these reductive takes and misguided conversations. TikTok's algorithm often favors conflict and polarizing opinions. Additionally, the condensed nature of these posts isn't always great for communicating nuanced ideas about gender, sex, and other social issues.

“TikTok and Instagram, which have pushed more and more to short-form video content, are really tough platforms for the sustained, careful kinds of conversation that you need to unpack the politics of any ideology,” says Lingel. 

Like many public conversations about women, we'll presumably realize in a few years that “hot takes” and hashtags aren't the best way to have them. The hullaballoo around Carpenter already feels reminiscent of the backlash surrounding fellow Disney star Miley Cyrus's heavily scrutinized entry into adulthood, while the assumptions made about Sweeney's character are similar to the way the public has judged previous Hollywood sex symbols, from Angelina Jolie to Megan Fox. These are all women the culture has found empathy for in recent years. But misogyny is always a lesson learned too late.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:vox.com","Trump is deporting way fewer people than Obama did. Why?","https://www.vox.com/politics/416901/trump-mass-deportation-obama-border-raids-ice","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The “deporter in chief” still holds the record.

President Donald Trump promised his supporters “the largest deportation program in American history” — but he's nowhere close. 

That distinction belongs to an early 20th-century program that likely saw 2 million people deported. When looking at more recent times, it's President Barack Obama — once dubbed by immigrant advocates “the deporter in chief” — who holds the 21st-century deportation record. His administration kicked out 438,421 people in 2013. No president since has come close to equaling that record, including Trump during his first term. 

The political atmosphere that made the mass deportations of the 1900s possible is long gone. Similarly, Trump is likely to find it all but impossible to approach his goal of deporting “millions and millions” by borrowing from Obama's playbook.

In fact, actions taken by Obama are part of why Trump's ambitions have been stymied. If Trump truly wants to set a new record, he'll need to more than double the current pace of deportations. And that will take a strategy that radically departs from those that have come before. 

Obama's immigration enforcement strategy was two-pronged: increasing penalties for unauthorized crossings at the southern border and deputizing local law enforcement to target immigrants with criminal records inside the US. The former increased the number of people who faced official removal proceedings and deterred repeat border crossers. And the latter allowed ICE to have its ear to the ground in cities throughout the country. 

Before Obama, unauthorized border crossers were typically allowed to voluntarily return to Mexico, without undergoing an official process or being subjected to any penalties. That meant that many attempted to recross the border, knowing that they would not face repercussions for doing so. 

The Obama administration started subjecting a greater proportion of them to formal deportation proceedings, utilizing an expanded federal immigration enforcement workforce that had grown from 12,700 in 2003 to 22,000 in 2008 with an influx of congressional funding. That drove up the deportation numbers and also barred unauthorized crossers from reentering the US for another 10 years. If they tried to reenter anyway, they could be permanently barred. 

Many proved unwilling to take that risk, with the share of unauthorized crossers making multiple attempts to cross the border coming down sharply, from 29 percent in fiscal year 2007 to 14 percent in fiscal year 2014. 

Obama also utilized tools including agreements with local law enforcement agencies that allowed them to conduct immigration enforcement and a program known as “Secure Communities” to deport undocumented immigrants inside the US, prioritizing those with criminal records.

By the time Obama took office in 2009, about 70 of these 287(g) agreements had been signed. They allowed local law enforcement to receive training from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and issue immigration detainers, effectively deputizing them. 

Through Secure Communities, local law enforcement shared fingerprints of people booked into local jails with federal immigration authorities, which would determine whether they were deportable. ICE could then ask local law enforcement to hold that person for up to 48 hours; agents would pick them up and transfer them to immigration detention. 

Initially effective at increasing deportations, the Secure Communities program was short-lived. It faced blowback from primarily liberal jurisdictions, driving a revival of the movement to offer sanctuary to undocumented immigrants in the 2010s. 

The concern among progressives was that it would reduce trust in law enforcement among immigrant communities and make everyone less safe because fewer people would report crimes. It also led to the deportation of people who had only committed minor offenses or had no criminal convictions. 

In 2014, Obama rescinded the program in response. He replaced it with another program that focused only on deporting immigrants who had committed serious offenses. As a result, the number of deportations fell to about 414,000 that year and never resurged to their 2013 peak.

Trump might struggle to ramp up deportations along the border, as Obama did, simply because significantly fewer people are coming. In March, border apprehensions fell to 7,181, a 95 percent decrease from March 2024.

Trump would also likely face great opposition to a revived Secure Communities program.

The opposition in liberal enclaves — where many undocumented immigrants reside — to cooperating with federal immigration authorities has only hardened since the Obama era. In response, Trump's border czar Tom Homan has gone as far as threatening Democratic officials with arrest for shielding immigrants from deportation. 

But for now, Democrats are holding their ground.

“I will stand in the way of Tom Homan going after people who don't deserve to be frightened in their communities,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a congressional hearing Thursday, in comments emblematic of the liberal position.

With these avenues cut off, Trump has attempted other tactics. He's launched workplace immigration raids across California, spurring mass protests in Los Angeles. He's mobilized federal resources from the National Guard to the IRS to identify and arrest undocumented immigrants. He's urged half a million immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to self-deport.

None of that has been enough to match Obama's pace of deportations so far, something that has reportedly frustrated Trump. However, deportations did increase to 17,200 in April, surpassing the number of deportations during the same period last year under the Biden administration.

It's not clear whether Trump can maintain that momentum. For one, he suggested in a recent post on Truth Social that he's now torn about deporting farmworkers and hotel workers after speaking with industry leaders who said that his policies were “taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.” In the same post, he vowed that “changes are coming,” without elaborating on what they might look like. 

At the same time, however, Trump is pushing for a spending bill now under consideration in the US Senate. It provides $155 billion in new immigration enforcement funding — more than five times the amount of current funding. While even some Republicans say that increase is too large, he may soon have considerably greater resources to carry out his vision for mass deportations if the bill passes.

﻿Muscles are a symbol of strength. So who's allowed to be strong?

If you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

A lot of people are getting jacked these days, and it's not just who you would think.

For men, muscles have always been a symbol of brute strength and power. In our current era, that's manifesting in their desire to get as chiseled as possible with a strict regimen of lifting and proteinmaxxing. But lately, muscles have also become something of a cultural battleground for women — at a time when beauty standards are dramatically in flux. 

The feminine body type of the moment shifts with time, from curvy to skinny and back again, but rarely, if ever, is America's ideal woman overtly strong. For most of my (millennial) life, women were instructed never to lift weights lest they become “bulky” (the horror!) but to do cardio instead, so that they would burn calories. 

Nevertheless, strength training has begun to trend up among women. Recent high-profile research found that lifting weights significantly increases both lifespan and healthspan for women. In turn, wellness-focused women's media — which is to say most women's media — began publishing trend pieces admonishing women to step up their muscle game. One study from this February found that women's participation rates in strength training are higher than ever before. 

For most of my (millennial) life, women were instructed never to lift weights lest they become “bulky” (the horror!).

Three new books reckon with what it means for women to, at long last, begin to embrace strength. Casey Johnston's A Physical Education is a memoir exploring Johnston's journey from a thinness-obsessed runner to an empowered weight lifter. In How to Be Well, Amy Larocca explores the wellness imperative that pushes so many women today to relentlessly optimize their health. And in On Muscle, Bonnie Tsui explores the cultural symbolism of muscles and how they provide a way for us to think about who is allowed to be strong, and who we demand be weak. 

Strength training is, in theory, an empowering alternative to the pursuit of thinness. But what happens if all our old body neuroses from the skin-and-bone days transfer right on over to the new well-muscled ideal?

There is always a type of woman you are supposed to be, a hegemonic ideal who hovers just out of reach, impossible to ever quite achieve. While America's feminine ideals shift a little, writes Larocca in How to Be Well, these ideal women always have a few basic things in common: “They are always very thin and they do not complain, no matter how many responsibilities are added to their list.” 

In the last 15 years, however, the ideal woman also became the “well” woman, Larocca writes. This is a woman who, in addition to being thin, has relentlessly optimized her health: She is pure of microplastics and pesticides, she cold plunges and owns crystals, and her skin and body glow golden with utter, unimpregnable well-being.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

The ideal American woman has not always been well. For a long time, she was just skinny. “Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels,” said Kate Moss in the heroin-chic '90s, espousing a sentiment that would carry through to the virulently anti-fat 2000s. In that era, women exercised not in order to be well, but, explicitly and vocally, to be thin. 

In the 2010s, the body ideal began to shift just a little. As the Kardashians began their long cultural dominance, pop culture began to decide that it was better to have a body with curves than to be rail thin. At the same time, the success of body positive activism started to mainstream the intoxicating idea that it might be possible to like your body even if it didn't look like the body of a supermodel. Marketers began to update their language accordingly.

The ideal American woman has not always been well. For a long time, she was just skinny.

By the mid-2010s, the body ideal for women was more or less as follows: You still had to be thin, but maybe not quite as thin as Kate Moss. As penance, however, you were no longer allowed to talk about how thin you wanted to be. “It sometimes feels,” remarks Larocca, “as if a simple replace-all function has been applied to the entire beauty marketing machine: Alexa, find ‘skinny' and replace all with ‘strong'; find ‘beauty' and replace all with ‘glow.'”

Wellness-as-health-as-beauty got more popular in 2016, after the first election of Donald Trump sent affluent liberals searching for things they could control in an ever-more chaotic world. In 2020, the pandemic came and brought the new paradigm to everyone. Now, wellness was a way of enacting control over one's body in a time that was demonstrating very clearly that we humans could control very little. 

Johnston found her way to strength training early in the transition of beauty culture to wellness culture, in 2014. In some ways, her journey mirrored the culture's larger shift in rhetoric. She admits she first got interested in weight lifting because of its aesthetic promises — it looked like a fun way to get hot that didn't involve starving and sprinting herself into a calorie deficit, as she had been doing since college. Over time, however, she began to take satisfaction in being strong for its own sake. “I felt the differences that came from investing in strength training before I really understood them,” she writes. “I was so used to distrusting myself, and that distrust included my body. Where did that come from?”

Johnston wasn't alone. In 2024, weight-lifting was the fastest-growing sport among American women. Millions of women are trying to up their protein intake and talking about their weight-lifting journeys. At a recent work meeting I attended, four women swapped protein tips while the one man in attendance stared in confusion. “Everyone's getting yoked,” he said. 

Part of why so many women are strength training now is all of those new scientific studies demonstrating how important it is for women. But muscles aren't just about health, in the same way that wellness isn't either.

“Strength as a proxy for worthiness, ability, or success has interesting legs,” writes Tsui in On Muscle. This has historically applied to men. Tsui cites the many rituals of ancient cultures that involve lifting heavy things to prove one's manhood or political strength. In the modern world, Tsui describes a venture capitalist who prefers to invest his money with founders who are also athletes, on the grounds that they “understand how to push themselves past the point of pain.”

If strength is a proxy for male worthiness, American culture tends to get nervous when it shows up in unexpected places. “When we say someone is too strong or too muscular,” writes Tsui, “it's often a comment on what we permit that person to be in society.” 

No woman is safe from being told that she is “too muscular,” but some women are more likely to be targeted with that accusation than others. Dominant Black women athletes like Serena Williams and Simone Biles frequently face just such criticism, which ballet star Misty Copeland once described as “code language for your skin is wrong.” The moral panic over trans women athletes, too, is built around the idea that trans women are too strong to be truly feminine. 

“When a woman is deemed too muscular,” writes Tsui, “it's often because her strength is perceived as taking away from someone else, or that her strength is somehow unseemly, unfair, or unnatural.” 

Instead, physical strength is seen as the natural property of men — specifically, conservative men. One 2023 study found that observers tend to assume that men with prominent upper body strength are right-wing. The stereotype might have emerged in part because we tend to see muscles as bodily and hence anti-intellectual, and conservatives tend to distrust intellectual elites. The binary follows a neat map of associations embedded below the level of conscious thought. Weight-lifting makes you strong, masculine, bodily, meatheaded, conservative. Cardio makes you small, feminine, intellectual, wiry, liberal. 

In real life, cardio and weight training both affect body shapes in strange and unpredictable ways, and they don't say anything about our political or intellectual goals. On the level of the symbol, though, the associations are strong — which is part of why it's so striking to see so many women start lifting weights.

If strength among men codes as conservative, among women it codes as subversive, feminist, and a rejection of the male gaze. As weight lifting for women has become more mainstream, however, promoters have had to begin filing away at that last association. Perhaps that's part of why women's magazine articles urging women to strength train always come with an anxious assurance that, despite popular belief, weight training won't make you bulky and unfeminine. 

In A Physical Education, Johnston writes with relish about eating more to gain muscle mass. “I had never deliberately gained weight before in my entire life,” she writes. Yet once she increases her daily calorie budget and muscle begins to pile on, she likes what she sees in the mirror: “a god, radiant like a big, beautiful horse.” 

Body positivity or no, Johnston spends a surprising amount of time dwelling on how as she lifted more, her pants “grew ever so slightly tighter in the legs and hips but fell away at the waist.” She writes extensively about how much more efficient weight lifting is at shrinking the waistline than cardio is, and she tracks cardios and macros with meticulous precision. Intuitive eating, or the process of eating what feels good to your body, she dismisses as “circular doublespeak”; she's a woman who wants her every Cup Noodles logged and its nutritional content fully analyzed.

In the bodybuilding world, food tracking is common and, at the elite level, necessary. Still, there's a tight parallel between Johnston's obsessive counting and Larocca's well woman, who follows her Oura sleep score with sleepless vigilance and wears a continuous glucose monitor to track her blood sugar even if she doesn't have diabetes. “It feels irresponsible to be satisfied with ‘fine,'” writes Larocca, and tracking biometrics promises to show a person how to optimize well beyond “fine.” 

The seductive promise of going beyond fine is at the heart of the idea of the well woman. You might be basically healthy as you are, but is that really good enough? Can you really look after your children and loved ones if your health is just fine? Will you ever be beautiful enough or thin enough or pure enough at just fine? Wellness promises to get you there, in the same way that dieting promised to get you there in 1996.

Of course, dieting hasn't stayed in 1996. It's currently rushing back into the mainstream with a vengeance. Fueled by the popularity of Ozempic, fat-shaming diet communities like SkinnyTok have begun to emerge, allowing users to share weight loss tips and “tough love” instructions to one another to stop eating, much like the magazine voices that Johnston recalled internalizing as a college student driven to starve herself. 

Strength training for women positions itself as a counterweight to communities like SkinnyTok. It's a world in which women are told in no uncertain terms that no matter what they do, they have to at least take in enough calories; a world that promises to make women bigger instead of smaller. 

Yet all the same, strength training does not seem to be quite enough to break the hold that the need to optimize has over us, in the same way that wellness culture didn't either. A well woman can still obsess over the pesticides and microplastics in her groceries. A woman who strength trains can still obsess over whether or not she is eating correctly. There is always a way to be absolutely correct, and it always seems to be drifting farther and farther away from us. 

Strength training does not seem to be quite enough to break the hold that the need to optimize has over us, in the same way that wellness culture didn't either.

We are driven to politicize and optimize the muscles of our human bodies along with everything else. But our muscles can also offer us more than their symbology.

In On Muscles, Tsui quotes the happiness scholar Dacher Keltner, who argues that many of our emotions are “about” our muscles: “Joy, for example, which often involves jumping,” he says. “Or love, which is about embracing, postural movements. Emotions are about action.” 

This idea goes back to Charles Darwin, who observed in 1872 that for both humans and animals, “under a transport of Joy or of vivid Pleasure, there is a strong tendency to various purposeless movements, and to the utterance of various sounds.” We jump and laugh and clap with delight; dogs wriggle and bark and run in circles. When we come together to express joy as a community, we dance, jumping for joy all together as one. 

Our joy exists in and through and in relation to the movement of our muscles. That's a basic physical fact. We can't change it, no matter how much we optimize.

Trump derided “kooky Tucker Carlson” — the leading right-wing voice opposing involvement in Israel's Iran war.

Tucker Carlson has been one of the right's loudest voices urging the United States to stay out of Israel's war with Iran — part of a broader effort to overturn the GOP's hawkish consensus.

But now, as tensions rise amidst Israeli strikes, Carlson has had a setback to his project: a derogatory nickname from President Donald Trump.

‘“Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,” IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!”' Trump posted on TruthSocial on Monday night.

This is more important than just a nickname; there are real stakes here. Trump's lashing out is a sign that, on this pivotal issue of potential war with Iran, he's turned against Carlson — a longtime close ally.

On Monday, I published a lengthy feature about the rise of an America First faction — including Carlson, Vice President JD Vance, and Donald Trump Jr. — that sought to overturn the Republican Party's foreign policy establishment. Famously, they want the US to stop supporting Ukraine against Russia. But they're also deeply suspicious of the US becoming embroiled in “forever wars” in the Middle East.

For the few months of this administration, they appeared to have gained remarkable sway. The America Firsters were deeply influential in staffing the new administration. And when it came to Iran, Trump seemed to be following their counsel. For the first time, he pursued talks with Iran over its nuclear program, instead of the “maximum pressure” sanctions approach of his first term.

Yet the hawks — strongly supportive of Israel, very hostile to Iran, and very skeptical any nuclear deal could be reached — remain very strong in the GOP. Every Republican senator except one (Rand Paul of Kentucky) signed a letter demanding Iran not be permitted any nuclear enrichment. Their belief is that Iran can never be “allowed” to go nuclear — that the US must stop it, by force if necessary.

When I interviewed Carlson earlier this month (before the Israeli strikes), he disputed this logic. He argued that since Pakistan already had nuclear weapons, “It's not without precedent that another Islamic nation gets the bomb.” And he argued that a war to try and stop Iran from getting nukes would be “a true disaster” and “would not stay in Iran, of course.” 

Right now, the hawks are urging Trump to enter the war against Iran more directly, arguing that the US has the responsibility, the capability, and the opportunity to end Iran's nuclear program for the foreseeable future and perhaps even to topple its regime. The America Firsters are urging restraint, worrying that US entry to the war could unleash far worse consequences.

But Carlson suggested Trump had already done too much to support Israel's strikes. “While the American military may not have physically perpetrated the assault, years of funding and sending weapons to Israel, which Donald Trump just bragged about on Truth Social, undeniably place the U.S. at the center of last night's events,” he wrote in a newsletter Friday. 

“Washington knew these attacks would happen,” Carlson added. “They aided Israel in carrying them out. Politicians purporting to be America First can't now credibly turn around and say they had nothing to do with it.”

Yet what's become clear is that, unlike many of the America Firsters, Trump doesn't truly want to withdraw from the world or stay out of foreign entanglements. He wants to accomplish and achieve big things on the global stage. He has declared that his goal is to force Iran to completely give up its nuclear ambitions. “Remember, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said Monday. “They just can't have a nuclear weapon.” 

The shifting currents could be seen in a long X post by Vance. Vance is a close Carlson ally and who (per the New York Times) worried internally that an Israeli strike could lead lead to a drawn-out war or spiral out of control. But, per his position and his political future, he's also obligated to defend the president.

So, pushing back Tuesday against what he called “crazy stuff on social media” — the MAGA influencers and America First supporters dismayed or outraged over Trump being drawn into war — Vance blamed Iran for the collapse of negotiations and praised Trump for being “amazingly consistent” and displaying “remarkable restraint.”

“He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president,” Vance added. “Of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue.”

Yet, with each new Truth Social post, the US risked getting drawn deeper into the conflict. By midday Tuesday, Trump was claiming that “we” had gained “complete and total control of the skies over Iran,” and warning Iranian leaders that “our patience is wearing thin.” Carlson's warnings had been ignored — and the future of the America First faction was in serious doubt.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned Iranian leader Ali Khamenei that he is an ""easy target"" and ""our patience is wearing thin,"" before demanding Tehran surrender in its conflict against Israel.

""We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,"" he wrote.

""But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.""

Trump in a subsequent post made clear what he does want from Iran: ""UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!""

The threat from the U.S. president came two days after news outlets reported that Trump vetoed a plan by Israel to assassinate the ayatollah.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday downplayed his reported disagreement with Trump over Khamenei, saying, ""I wouldn't rush to conclusions.""

The Trump administration has previously insisted that the U.S. was not directly involved in what Israel called a preemptive strike against Iran on Friday, kicking off five days of missile fire between the two regional powers.

But Trump's latest comments suggest the U.S. is now at least willing to threaten direct military intervention as it backs Israel's effort to bring Tehran to heel.

Trump is expected to hold a meeting in the Situation Room on Tuesday to discuss the Israel-Iran conflict with his top national security advisors.

On Monday, Trump abruptly returned to Washington, D.C., from Canada, where he had traveled for a meeting of the Group of Seven nations. 

Before he left, Trump criticized the G7 for kicking Russia out of the group in 2014 after its annexation of Crimea.

Trump teed up Tuesday's threat against Khamenei with an earlier social media post declaring, ""We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.""

Tehran ""had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn't compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured 'stuff,'"" Trump wrote.

""Nobody does it better than the good ol' USA.""

One provision in Republicans' ""big beautiful"" bill would narrow the relief options for struggling student loan borrowers. House and Senate Republicans both call for the elimination of both the economic hardship and unemployment deferment.

Those deferments allow federal student loan borrowers to pause their monthly bills during periods of joblessness or other financial setbacks, often without interest accruing on their debt.

Less attention has been paid to the GOP plan to do away with the deferments than its proposals to eliminate several student loan repayment plans and to establish a minimum monthly payment for borrowers.

The House advanced its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in May. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions released its budget bill recommendations related to student loans on June 10. Senate lawmakers are preparing to debate the massive tax and spending package.

Nixing the deferments could have major consequences, said Abby Shafroth, director of the National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project.

""I'm concerned this is going to lead more people to default on their student loans when they encounter a job loss, surprise medical expense or other economic hardship,"" Shafroth said.

The Trump administration said this spring that the number of student loan borrowers in default could soon rise from more than 5 million to roughly 10 million in the coming months.

Under the Senate Republicans' proposal, student loans received on or after July 1, 2026 would no longer qualify for the unemployment deferment or economic hardship deferment. The House plan does away with both deferments a year earlier, on July 1, 2025.

The unemployment deferment is typically available to student loan borrowers who are seeking but unable to find full-time employment or are eligible for jobless benefits, among other requirements, according to the National Consumer Law Center. Under the deferment, borrowers can pause their payments for up to six months at a time, and for a total of three years over the life of the loan.

The absence of the relief ""means that for someone who lost their job and is struggling to keep their head above water, the government will demand monthly payments on student loans,"" Shafroth said.

The bill comes as the share of entry-level employees who report feeling positive about their employers' business prospects dropped to around 43% in May, a record low, according to a recent report by Glassdoor.

The economic hardship deferment, meanwhile, is generally available to student loan borrowers who receive public assistance, earn below a certain income threshold or work in the Peace Corps. The total time a borrower can spend in an economic hardship deferment is also three years.

The end of the deferments ""eliminates one of the key benefits on subsidized loans,"" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

Persis Yu, deputy executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, agreed.

""The ability of borrowers to pause payments and interest on subsidized loans during financial shocks and hardship is a critical benefit of the federal loan program,"" Yu said.

Around 150,000 federal student loan holders were enrolled in the unemployment deferment in the second quarter of 2025, while around 70,000 borrowers had qualified for an economic hardship deferment, according to data by the U.S. Department of Education.

The absence of the deferments will push more federal student loan borrowers into a forbearance, experts say, during which interest continues to climb on their debt and borrowers often resume repayment with a larger bill.

Republicans say doing away with the payment pauses will encourage borrowers to enroll in repayment plan they can afford.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said in a statement on June 10, that his party's proposals would stop requiring that taxpayers who didn't go to college foot the loan payments for those with degrees.

""Biden and Democrats unfairly attempted to shift student debt onto taxpayers that chose not to go to college,"" Cassidy said.

Cassidy said the higher education legislation, which also stretches out student loan repayment timelines, would save taxpayers at least $300 billion.

The PGA Tour on Tuesday named top NFL executive Brian Rolapp its next chief executive officer to succeed current Commissioner Jay Monahan. 

Monahan will begin to transition his day-to-day responsibilities to Rolapp and will step down at the end of 2026. Monahan said he informed the board last year of his intention to step down in 2026 after a decade leading the organization.

""We've found exactly the right leader in Brian Rolapp, and I'm excited to support him as he transitions from the NFL into his new role leading the PGA Tour,"" Monahan said in a statement.

In an open letter published on Tuesday, Rolapp talked about the respect he has for golf's history and rich traditions but said there is still work to do and incredible opportunities ahead.

Rolapp said after talking with players, board members and fans in recent months, he plans to focus on strengthening the Tour's commercial partnerships.

""Professional golf is evolving, as are the ways fans consume sports. My goal as CEO is to honor golf's traditions but not be overly bound by them,"" he said. 

Over the course of Monahan's tenure as commissioner, he helped secure $1.5 billion in investment for the league, created equity opportunities for players and launched a Fan Forward initiative, according to a news release. 

Yet, those efforts were often overshadowed by a pending merger with Saudi-backed LIV Golf. The two announced their intention to merge in June 2023, but have yet to reach an agreement.  

Rolapp, who was considered a top successor candidate for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, brings decades of experience in forging high-profile media partnerships.

As the NFL's Chief Media and Business Officer, Rolapp oversaw the league's commercial, broadcast and digital rights.

The PGA Tour will be renewing its media rights agreements with key partners ahead of the current deal's expiration in 2030.

""Brian's appointment is a win for players and fans,"" said golf legend Tiger Woods in a statement. ""He has a clear respect for the game and our players and brings a fresh perspective from his experience in the NFL.""

In this article

Higher mortgage rates and uncertainty in the broader economy continue to weigh on consumers — and consequently on the nation's homebuilders.

Builder sentiment in June dropped 2 points from May to 32 on the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI). Anything below 50 is considered negative. The index stood at 43 in June 2024.

Analysts had been expecting a slight improvement, given recent tariff negotiations and pullbacks by the Trump administration.

This index has only seen a lower reading than June's level twice since 2012 – in December 2022, after mortgage rates shot up from record lows during the first two years of the pandemic, and in April 2020 at the very start of the pandemic.

Of the index's three components, current sales conditions fell 2 points to 35, sales expectations in the next six months dropped 2 points to 40, and buyer traffic fell 2 points to 21, the lowest reading on that metric since the end of 2023.

""Buyers are increasingly moving to the sidelines due to elevated mortgage rates and tariff and economic uncertainty,"" said Buddy Hughes, NAHB chairman and a homebuilder from Lexington, North Carolina, in a release. ""To help address affordability concerns and bring hesitant buyers off the fence, a growing number of builders are moving to cut prices.""

In the June survey, 37% of builders said they had cut prices, the highest share since NAHB started tracking the monthly metric three years ago. That is up from 34% who reported cutting prices in May and 29% in April. The average price reduction was 5%, which has been steady since late last year.

""Rising inventory levels and prospective home buyers who are on hold waiting for affordability conditions to improve are resulting in weakening price growth in most markets and generating price declines for resales in a growing number of markets,"" said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the NAHB. ""Given current market conditions, NAHB is forecasting a decline in single-family starts for 2025.""

The report follows quarterly earnings from Lennar, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, in which the second-quarter average home price dropped nearly 9% from the same quarter in 2024. Guidance on new orders and deliveries was also below analysts' expectations.

""As mortgage interest rates remained higher and consumer confidence continued to weaken, we drove volume with starts while incentivizing sales to enable affordability and help consumers to purchase homes,"" said Lennar co-CEO Stuart Miller in an earnings release.

Regionally, on a three-month moving average, the South and West showed the weakest builder sentiment. Those are the regions where the most homes are built.

Despite some improvement in the economic outlook, respondents to the June CNBC Fed Survey continue to forecast weaker growth and higher inflation than they did at the beginning of the year and most say uncertainty over tariff policy remains high.

The probability of a recession in the next year has fallen to 38%, down from 53% in May, but above the 23% level of January before President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy was unveiled.

Similarly, gross domestic product is now expected to grow 1.13% on average, up from 0.8% in the prior survey, but less than half the January expectation.

Respondents say there remains a considerable lack of clarity with 71% reporting they are very or somewhat uncertain over trade policy.

""Recent geopolitical events in the Middle East add uncertainty into an already uncertain environment on trade, tax policy, and with potentially weakening hard macroeconomic data pending,"" said Doug Gordon, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments. ""Recession can be avoided, although this will require some help in mitigating some of these sources of volatility.""

The help, he said, comes from trade deals and tax policy, with 29% saying the current tax bill in Congress makes them more optimistic about growth and 29% say it makes them more pessimistic; 43% say it has no effect on their growth outlook.

Yet 82% believe it will ""somewhat"" or ""significantly increase"" the federal budget deficit.

A 54% majority expect the U.S. to strike a new trade deal with China, compared with 39% who do not. On average, those looking for a trade deal believe it will be signed within about five months.

""While it appears that the worst-case scenario when it comes to tariffs will not happen, the best-case scenario still implies significantly higher tariffs and therefore higher inflation for an extended period,'' said Joel Naroff, president, Naroff Economics.

The Federal Reserve is expected to stand pat at the June meeting and not cut rates until September. The 28 respondents, who include economists, fund managers and analysts, see two rate reductions this year, bringing the funds rate down to 3.9% by year-end, but only one 25 basis point cut next year.

""There are multiple cross currents from geopolitical events that the Fed will have to weigh,"" said Constance Hunter, chief economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""The see-saw between slower growth and adverse supply shocks are difficult to forecast, however we expect slower growth will ultimately be what causes the Fed to move closer to a neutral stance.""

Asked how the Fed would react to a stagflationary outcome of higher prices and weaker growth, 54% believe the central bank will cut rates while 39% see the Fed holding rates steady. That's a bit more hawkish than May when 65% saw the Fed cutting.

By a slim margin, respondents don't believe the Fed will face that dilemma: 43% believe tariffs will result in just ""one-time price increases"" while 32% say they create a broader inflationary problem.

However, 61% say tariff inflation in future months will show up ""more significantly"" than it has, while 36% see it as appearing ""only modestly.""

""I expect (economic) moderation going forward as tariffs get incorporated into consumer prices and slower job growth due in part to a slower pace of immigration providing less fuel for aggregate disposable income,"" said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation.

Amid all those concerns, Mark Vitner, chief economist at Piedmont Crescent Capital & CAVU Securities, notes that the economy has remained ""Resilient, Not 'Tariffied.'""

""There's no shortage of reasons to worry — elevated interest rates, huge budget deficits, geopolitical flare-ups, tariff threats — but the U.S. economy keeps proving its doubters wrong.""

He added, ""Consumers continue to spend, and businesses are doubling down on future-facing infrastructure: AI, life sciences, DefenseTech, and other emerging technologies.""

Indeed, the outlook for stocks rose, with the S&P 500 now expected to hit 6,133 by year, for a modest 1.7% rise from current levels, but a more robust 10% increase to 6,625 by the end of 2026.

""Equity markets are near all-time highs in anticipation of certainty replacing uncertainty on tariffs, the 2017 tax cuts getting extended, deregulation, AI productivity, and Fed easing,"" said Hank Smith, head of investment strategy, Haverford Trust Co. ""If all of this occurs, the economy should reaccelerate in the second half into '26.""

When it comes to current stock levels, 58% believe they are overpriced, and 36% believe them to be correctly priced relative to their outlook for earnings and the economy. Just 7% see equities as underpriced.

The Trump Organization's newly announced smartphone will likely be made in China, experts say, despite claims that the device will be manufactured in the U.S.

Owned by U.S. President Donald Trump, the company on Monday announced the T1, a gold-colored device which it said would retail for $499. The smartphone will run Google's Android operating system.

The Trump Organization says the phone will be ""built in the United States"" — but experts note the phone was likely designed and would be manufactured by a Chinese firm.

""There is no way the phone was designed from scratch and there is no way it is going to be assembled in the U.S. or completely manufactured in the U.S.,"" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president at International Data Corp., told CNBC on Tuesday. ""That is completely impossible.""

Jeronimo suggested that the phone would likely be produced by a Chinese original device manufacturer, or ODM — a type of company that designs and manufacturers products based on the specifications of another firm.

""Despite being advertised as an American-made phone, it is likely that this device will be initially produced by a Chinese ODM,"" Blake Przesmicki, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, said in a note Monday.

Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Research, added that ""the U.S. does not have local manufacturing capabilities readily available.""

Smartphone manufacturing came into focus after Trump threatened tariffs on devices imported into the U.S. While those have yet to materialize, the American president has poured scrutiny on Apple's supply chain, urging the iPhone maker to manufacture its flagship handset in the U.S. The call is part of a broader desire from Trump to see more manufacturing of electronics be undertaken in the U.S.

Several experts have noted that manufacturing iPhones in the U.S. would be nearly impossible and would certainly raise the price of the product substantially. On top of that, getting large-scale manufacturing off the ground in the U.S. would take several years.

Even if some manufacturing of the device were done in the U.S., smartphone supply chains are global, and handset components come from several countries.

The Trump Organization's T1 is no different. While no information has been revealed on particular components, the specifications could give a hint of what to expect.

The device will have a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, a kind of screen that is made primarily by South Korean firm Samsung. LG, another South Korean firm, also produces the screen, as does Chinese firm BOE.

For comparison, Apple's top-end iPhone 16 Pro Max, has a 6.9-inch display and starts at $1,199.

At T1's $499 price point, the smartphone will likely use a processor from Taiwanese firm MediaTek, which would be manufactured in Taiwan. If the device were to contain a Qualcomm chip instead, that would also likely have to be made in Taiwan.

The phone's advertised 50-megapixel camera will meanwhile require image sensing chips — a market that is dominated by Japanese firm Sony for smartphones. There are smaller players in China and elsewhere.

The device's memory is one area that could use American technology, potentially from Micron, which manufactures its components in the U.S. But other players, like Samsung, could be potential suppliers.

""Even when there is local manufacturing available the company will have to rely on components that are being imported from outside the U.S.,"" Counterpoint Research's Fieldhack said.

New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was detained Tuesday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as he was escorting a defendant out of immigration court, his wife said in a statement.

""While escorting a defendant out of immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza, Brad was taken by masked agents and detained by ICE,"" Lander's wife, Meg Barnette, wrote on X.

""This is still developing, and our team is monitoring the situation closely,"" Barnette wrote.

ICE did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Video of the incident shows Lander standing outside a courtroom when he is approached by officers, including some wearing masks.

Lander repeatedly asks the officers to show him a judicial warrant before he is handcuffed, per the video posted by Barnette.

Lander is still in custody as of early Tuesday afternoon, Barnette said during a press conference after the incident.

""I am just very aware of how I feel right now watching Brad being taken away and that it's going to be ok, and for all of those other families in there, they can't say that,"" she said.

Lander is a candidate in next week's Democratic primary for New York City mayor. 

The incident comes days after police handcuffed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., after he was forcibly removed from a press conference that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was holding in Los Angeles.

""If that is what the administration is going to do to a United States senator for having the authority to simply ask a question, imagine what they will do to any American who dares to speak up,"" Padilla said during remarks from the Senate floor on Tuesday.

This is a developing story and will be updated.

Think you know what bosses are looking for? Think again.

Getting hired and promoted used to hinge on traditional leadership traits like executive presence and vision. But in today's world, those aren't enough. As a CEO, board member and MBA professor, my research shows that a sharper, more relevant set of criteria is rising to the top. And it's long overdue.

At NYU's Stern School of Business, I teach a popular class called ""Becoming You."" Students start by identifying their values using a tool called The Values Bridge, then explore careers that match their aptitudes and emotional, intellectual and economic needs. Finally, and critically, they assess their leadership capacity.

I used to rely on old-school aptitude tests for that last part (think: the kind your college counselor used). But over time, I saw that those tools were built for a world that no longer exists. Today's professionals face nonstop change, geopolitical chaos and ambiguity about, well, everything.

So I set out to identify the traits that actually matter now — and tested them through consulting projects with a dozen companies across industries. Focus groups and manager surveys refined the list. And now, I use these four traits in every hiring decision I make.

When I see all four in one person? I try to hire them on the spot.

The business environment today is fast, unforgiving and always on. Leaders need uncommon levels of physical and mental stamina — and not in short bursts, but continuously. Nerve means making fast, high-stakes decisions with incomplete or conflicting information. That takes real confidence.

It also means having the courage to deliver tough truths with empathy. People who combine candor with kindness are rare — but invaluable. Nerve is courage, clarity, speed, transparency and an unrelenting bias for action.

According to LinkedIn, professionals needed to update 25% of their skills every 18 months from 2015 to 2020. That ""skill churn"" is expected to hit 65% in the years ahead. So yes, adaptability has always mattered. But today, it's mission-critical.

Elasticity isn't just tolerating change — it's actually enjoying reinvention. It's a mindset that says, ""Bring on the new."" I often look for what I call ""irregular relationships"": friendships, mentorships or collaborations with people very different from oneself. They signal flexibility, openness and the social curiosity that underpins comfort with change.

It's always been important to be steady at work. What's changed is how rare it's become. Managers tell me their best people are anxious, withdrawn or just worn out. The pace and pressure of work today are real — and intense.

That's why managers are putting a premium on soundness: a bundle of traits that includes positivity, accountability, resilience and self-awareness. You can ask colleagues for feedback on the first three. But self-awareness? That's the only trait on this list you can — and should — test for. If you're job searching or feeling stalled in your career, start there.

In a world that's always changing, your currency is your currency. In other words, how ""current"" you are (on trends, technology, culture and ideas) directly affects how valuable you are to your organization.

Gone are the days when you could stay informed just by talking to colleagues or skimming a few news platforms. The most successful people don't just absorb what's next — they share it in-house, sparking fresh thinking across teams. Wonderment is intellectual curiosity, cultural fluency, peer around corners and the proactive instinct to bring the outside in.

Wondering how you would rate on all of these traits? You can find out for free using The Career Traits Compass, which I designed to help both my MBA students — and professionals seeking career growth.

Now, obviously, every role has its own must-haves. Values matter. Skills matter. But these four traits? They're what every leader is quietly scanning for. And if you've got them all, trust me: Someone is already plotting how to hire you, even if they're not hiring.

In this article

Eli Lilly will acquire gene-editing startup Verve Therapeutics for up to $1.3 billion, the companies said on Tuesday, to boost its pipeline of experimental medicines beyond its blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs.

The U.S. drugmaker, which has struck multiple partnership deals with gene-editing companies in the last two years, will buy Verve for $10.5 per share, which is at a premium of 67.5% to the company's last close.

Shares of Boston, Massachusetts-based Verve jumped 76% to $11.03 in premarket trading, while Lilly's stock fell 1%.

The deal includes an upfront payment of almost $1 billion and a further $300 million based on the genetic-medicines firm achieving certain clinical milestones.

The Financial Times was the first to report that the companies were in talks.

Lilly - the world's largest drugmaker by market capitalization - and Verve were already partnering to develop one-time gene-editing therapies to reduce high cholesterol in people with heart disease, which are expected to be used in combination with other drugs.

""We are skeptical about the true market need of additional genetic medicines in these indications,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said ahead of the deal, pointing to data from other cholesterol-lowering treatments developed by Merck and AstraZeneca.

Verve's lead therapies, which are in early-stage trials, use a form of gene editing known as base editing that causes one-time changes to the DNA, potentially turning off genes that contribute to high cholesterol levels.

Base editing is a next-generation form of gene editing which erases and rewrites a specific letter in a gene.

The company is studying its VERVE-102 therapy in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder that causes high levels of bad cholesterol and premature coronary artery disease.

Verve's gene-editing medicines target the PCSK9, ANGPTL3 and LPA genes responsible for regulating blood cholesterol.

In this article

Yum! Brands on Tuesday named Chief Financial and Franchise Officer Chris Turner as its next CEO, effective October 1.

He will replace David Gibbs, who announced his retirement earlier this year. Gibbs has led Yum since 2020 and will stay on as an advisor through 2026.

Turner joined the fast food company in 2019. Before that, he held senior roles at PepsiCo and spent over a decade at McKinsey.

""I'm deeply honored to step into the role of CEO at Yum! Brands and incredibly grateful for the opportunity to lead this global company with such iconic brands,"" Turner said in a statement. ""I'm excited to build on all that we've accomplished together alongside our talented teams and in partnership with our franchisees around the world."" 

Under Gibbs, Yum expanded digital ordering and pushed value menus. Turner is expected to continue that strategy as consumer spending shifts.

Yum operates KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger in over 150 countries.

Shares of the company are up about 5% so far this year.

In this article

Regencell Bioscience Holdings, an early-stage, Hong Kong-based bioscience company with no revenue, is the latest speculative overseas stock to attract an unusual surge in trading demand.

Shares of Regencell, which says it develops traditional Chinese herb treatments to treat childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, more than tripled on Monday — soaring more than 280% by the close after a 38-for-1 split declared on June 2 took effect. By Monday's close, Regencell, founded in 2014 and traded on Nasdaq under the ticker 'RGC' since 2021, had a total market capitalization of $29.7 billion, according to S&P Capital IQ.

The stock continued to jump on Tuesday, gaining more than 25%. The company's year to date performance is off the charts too, having risen more than 58,000% in 2025. Its current market value of $36 billion tops Lululemon, eBay and Kraft Heinz. The shares traded for pennies at one point in the past one year.

Regencell is the latest example of a speculative international stock attracting attention during summer trading. In August, 2022, for example, AMTD Digital, a Hong Kong-based fintech company, climbed 126%, briefly giving it a market value greater than Coca-Cola and Bank of America.

Earlier this month, Regencell explained the stock split as designed solely ""to enhance liquidity in the market for the company's ordinary shares and make the shares more accessible to investors."" Stock splits do not change anything fundamentally about a company.

Regencell's surge also came amid an increased focus on alternative medicines after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in February. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, has taken steps to discourage routine immunizations in the U.S., last week removing all of the members of a panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccines.

Regencell's stock often makes huge one-day swings. For example, shares jumped roughly 30% on March 21, before dropping 30% the following trading day.

In spite of the wild spike in the stock, little is known about the efficacy and commercialization of the Regencell's treatments for ADHD and Autistic Spectrum Disorders.

Regencell's business centers on a proprietary Traditional Chinese Medicine formula (TCM) developed in a partnership with TCM practitioner Sik-Kee Au using his ""Sik-Kee Au TCM Brain Theory."" Sik-Kee Au is the father of the Regencell chief executive officer Yat-Gai Au, the company said in a 2022 statement.

The CEO controls 86.24% of the total number of shares outstanding, according to FactSet data.

Three liquid-based, orally TCM formulae candidates claim to address mild, moderate and severe conditions and only contain natural ingredients such as so-called ""detoxication herbs,"" blood circulation herbs and digestion herbs.

""These TCM formulae form the basis of our TCM product candidates, which we intend to develop and commercialize for the treatment of ADHD and ASD,"" Regencell's website reads.

In its latest annual report filed last October, Regencell said that it had not generated any revenue, nor filed for any regulatory approvals of its TCM formulas. For the fiscal years ended June 2024 and 2023, Regencell incurred total net losses of $4.36 million and $6.06 million, respectively, according to a 20F filing to the SEC.

""We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable,"" read the filing.

Regencell has not responded to a CNBC request for comment.

Regencell's latest patient case study, dated Nov. 15, 2023, said 28 patients were given the treatment over a period of three months in a second efficacy trial and showed an improvement in symptoms of ADHD and ASD, according to the company's webpage.

In an earlier case, Regencell said in a 2021 news release that it treated a dozen patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases, using a modified version of Au's modified proprietary cold and flu TCM formula. What was described as an improvement of Covid conditions led Regencell to form a joint venture with Honor Epic Enterprises Limited in Sept. 2021 to conduct further tests and commercialize the company's Covid treatment in ASEAN countries, according to the statement.

The stock has attracted little chatter on social media over the past few years. Those comments that have been made suggest both retail trader enthusiasm — and skepticism.

One user on the Reddit page ""r/Shortsqueeze"" wrote on Monday that Regencell is ""trading like a meme coin. Bought a little to see what happens and it dropped 50% right after lol."" Another user said in a post made three months ago, ""I scalp RGC everyday for a bit of profit."" The stock jumped 1,360% in May alone.

On LinkedIn in May, one investor said he ""can't stop laughing,"" after reading the company description. Another post from a user in the pharmaceutical industry, according to his profile, last week said Regencell has become the ""stock to watch"" after its spike in May on ""no official news or catalysts."" Another LinkedIn user last month commented on Regencell, saying, ""China based, low volume and no official news, bizarro.""

On X, one user wrote in a Monday post said, ""for #CompleteBullsh__CompanyOfTheYear I nominate regencell.""

BitMEX co-founder and Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes is known for making big, bold — and sometimes controversial — Bitcoin price predictions, and says it doesn't faze him when he gets it wrong. 

“Nothing really happens,” Hayes tells Magazine, who asked if he worries about backlash when his Bitcoin predictions fall flat. 

The youngest African-American crypto billionaire in history is the first to admit that most of his price calls don't land. “I get it wrong, and I've gotten most of them wrong,” he laughs.

“I don't know why people are hesitant to do it; it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.”

“If you're generally correct, you're okay,” the 40-year-old former investment banker adds. 

Hayes is pretty upfront with his calls; he doesn't hide them if he's right or wrong.

In September, Hayes — now the chief investment officer at the VC firm he co-founded, Maelstrom Fund — made a short-term bearish call on Bitcoin, linking it to the sliding Japanese yen. However, things didn't unfold as he had expected over that particular weekend, and Bitcoin held strong.

Fair play to Hayes; he later owned it on X, posting, “I was wrong.”

“Time to trade some dogshit memecoins,” Hayes said. Similarly, on March 24, Hayes said that Bitcoin would hit $110,000 before it retests $76,500. But just a month later, on April 9, Bitcoin sank to $76,500.

Of course, credit where it's due; Hayes gets it right too sometimes. In December, Hayes predicted a crypto downturn and a “vicious sell-off” after US President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration…and he was spot on.

Probably because over the years, the New York-raised Bitcoin OG has developed a super-secret method to come up with his end-of-year price targets:

“Pick round numbers that humans like.” 

His latest call is that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of this year and is confident that Bitcoin won't see another $70,000 drawdown on the way there.

“I really don't see there's going to be sort of a big binary risk-off at the moment that could spook the markets, and people will dump risks that would get us down to those levels again anytime soon,” Hayes says.

That said, Hayes isn't on board with the super-bullish $1 million Bitcoin calls that some Bitcoiners, like Jan3 founder Samson Mow, think are possible by the end of the year. 

“I think it'll happen before the end of 2028; I don't think it'll happen this year,” Hayes says.

However, he's not rushing to make any short-term predictions anytime soon. “I don't know, we'll see, it's really dependent,” he says. “I usually try to make those if there's a setup where everyone thinks one way and I think another way,” he says.

Unlike most of the wannabe trading geniuses on Crypto X, Hayes actually knows his stuff — he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2008 with a BA in economics. Just six years later, in 2014, he was just 28 when he co-founded the crypto derivatives giant BitMEX alongside Ben Delo and Samuel Reed.

In 2020, Hayes stepped down from BitMEX after the US Department of Justice charged him, along with Delo, Reed and Gregory Dwyer, for allegedly violating the Bank Secrecy Act.

Hayes and Delo pleaded guilty in February 2022, admitting they “willfully fail[ed] to establish, implement and maintain an Anti-Money Laundering program” at the exchange. 

He ended up spending six months in home detention, confined to his house. It was a rough time, but Hayes also saw the positives. 

“It sucked having to be one place you couldn't leave and all that for six months, but I was in Miami; thankfully, it wasn't a jail cell,” Hayes laughs.

In March, US President Donald Trump pardoned the four former BitMEX executives.

Despite the whole legal mess, Hayes remains one of the most respected Bitcoiners in the world. He's treated like an A-list celebrity at crypto conferences, and even with his hit-or-miss track record, people still pay serious attention when he makes a price prediction.

Hayes can afford to make bold predictions because, unlike many crypto executives who stick to safe predictions, he's already a multi-billionaire living life on his own terms.

And that was Hayes' plan all along.

“I always got into this game trying to have control of my time,” he says. Hayes admits his life is pretty comfy at the moment. “I work out like two to three hours a day, read a lot of books, and then, you know, write here and there,” he says.

While Hayes does the heavy lifting in the gym, he says his team at Maelstrom Fund does most of the firm's heavy lifting, “scouring the world for decent stuff to do.” 

He admits he does work here and there for the fund, but he loves living the high life.

“I know I'm perfectly happy that I'm able to, you know, play tennis when I want to, go skiing, all that kind of stuff,” he says, adding:

“It's not really about how many Bitcoins I have or how much, you know, cash in my bank account or in my wallet. It's really, you know, can I go pay for my friends or go skiing for six months if I want to.”

It was only fitting to ask Hayes what his numerical prediction was for the US government actually buying Bitcoin for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which Trump signed off on in March.

“I'd say it's a 1% chance,” he says. 

“I'm still of the same opinion that they're not going to sell the 200,000 Bitcoin that they seized, but I don't see the US government printing money to buy Bitcoin,” he adds.

Even if other countries adopt a Bitcoin reserve, Hayes says 200,000 BTC is already worth “how many billions of dollars.”So, from the US perspective, it probably won't trigger much FOMO compared to other nations.

“Everyone else, China probably has a similar amount, but they mined it. So I think more likely countries will mine Bitcoin rather than print money and then go take printed money and buy Bitcoin, assuming they're a deficit nation,” he says.

“It's a bit different if you actually generate income as a nation,” he says.

Surprisingly, Hayes has never been an advocate for the US Bitcoin Reserve. On May 1, Hayes said in an interview that he is “not really into the whole Strategic Reserve situation.” 

At the time, he said it is hard to imagine any “properly elected” politician openly announcing that the government plans to print money to buy Bitcoin when the popular narrative is a bunch of Bitcoin bros going to the club.”

Hayes also shared his forecast on Bitcoin treasury companies, speculating that the newer firms will become more redundant.

“I think that they're going to become less and less important as these trades get a bit more saturated,” Hayes says.

“Every subsequent one of these treasury companies, at least if it's in a market that already has one, they don't do so well, but it's harder to generate a non-dilutive accumulation of Bitcoin,” Hayes explains.

He says most treasury companies will do a rights offering that decreases the ownership percentage per share, and then use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin, which is a “very dilutive strategy.”

“It's hard to keep replicating that, especially in an almost saturated market like the US, maybe in other markets where they don't have a MicoStrategy, then you'll be able to do this a few times,” he says.

Hayes is more bullish about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds; however, he doesn't have a prediction of how much money will flow into the ETFs by the end of the year.

“I think it will continue to have inflows just because it's the easiest way for anyone who's got, like traditional fiat assets, to deploy into crypto,” Hayes says.

“They don't have to worry about custody. It's a one-for-one replicate.”

He predicts that since fund managers trust spot Bitcoin ETFs — and more regulators and banks are letting funds invest in them — they'll “obviously suck capital” away from Bitcoin treasury companies.

“As a retail [investor], [they'll be thinking] well, is that another sucker who's going to pay a premium to do the simplest thing of buying Bitcoin,” he says.

When asked if he sees any near-term risks to Bitcoin's price, Hayes points to the possibility of a worldwide conflict erupting.

“Obviously, if there's some sort of global war,” Hayes says. But if a full-scale world war broke out, he's uncertain whether the price would rise or fall.

“Bitcoin could do really well or could do pretty poorly. Who knows what will happen in that situation?” Hayes says.

He brushes off the common fear among many Bitcoiners that quantum computing could break Bitcoin's security.

“I think there's so many people focused on that particular problem that I don't think that's going to be ultimately an issue for Bitcoin,” he says.

 Bitcoin order book liquidity spoofing is back as analysis says that a key BTC price event is still ""brewing"" — can bulls protect $104,000? 

Key points:

BTC price weakness accelerates after the Wall Street open as analysis warns of a “rug pull” at $104,000.

Bitcoin bulls have done their best to avoid panic reactions to downside volatility triggers.

US dollar strength eyes a comeback after hitting new three-year lows.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke below $105,000 on June 17 as analysis warned that a “big move” was yet to come.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting intraday lows of $104,401 after the Wall Street open.

A rare 11 red hourly candles in a row kept bulls firmly in check, with order book analysis warning that downside could easily snowball.

“This is what manipulation looks like in the $BTC order book,” trading resource Material Indicators summarized on X, referring to shifting bid liquidity as price fell. 

Liquidity “spoofing,” as Cointelegraph previously reported, is a common phenomenon on crypto markets when large-volume traders wish to influence price trajectory.

“If bulls can push above $108k, the door to $110k is open,” Material Indicators acknowledged the day prior.

Discussing overall market strength, popular trader Skew was fairly optimistic. Bitcoin traders, he noted, were demonstrating more restraint than during other recent market pullbacks despite considerable geopolitical pressure.

Volatility, he warned, was nonetheless around the corner.

“For a 3% or so pullback so far market isn't panicked yet, although on LTF there's clear hedge bias Previous dips were 5% or so but had aggressive shorting, spot selling & uptick in volatility with sell momentum/Volume,” part of an X post read.

With gold falling and US dollar strength showing signs of bullish divergence, perspectives on the Middle East conflict were far from panicked.

In ongoing X analysis, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter dismissed the idea that Israel-Iran tensions could spiral into a global war.

‘While gold is strong, it continues to paint a consistent narrative: We are not on the brink of World War 3,” it concluded on the day. 

The US dollar index (DXY), which traditionally trades inversely to Bitcoin, teased a recovery from multiyear lows.

“Asset managers are heavily short on the USD. The last time positioning was this bearish, the DXY staged a notable rally,” trader and market strategist Guilherme Tavares reported.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin price stabilizes and rallies amid regional conflicts, data shows","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-stabilizes-and-rallies-amid-regional-conflicts-data-shows","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:02:08 GMT","

 Throughout the last 10 years, Bitcoin's price has remained resilient to war and armed conflict. 

As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, Bitcoin's (BTC) price has remained stable. 

A look back at previous conflicts shows a similar trend, with factors like adoption and institutional involvement playing a key role.

Analysts like André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise's ETP platform ETC Group, have argued that Bitcoin's price can suffer in the days following the outbreak of a conflict. While volatility in BTC's price is overall on a downtrend, it is still seen as a risky asset and is likely to be sold quickly when a war breaks out.

Still, as Mithil Thakore, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin L2 liquidity protocol Velar, previously told Cointelegraph, “Over the longer term, geopolitical conflicts raise the prospects of higher inflation rates globally due to factors like increased fiscal spending, looser monetary policy, supply-chain disruptions and commodity price spikes, which should all benefit Bitcoin.”

Looking at past events of geopolitical instability, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, but a lack of movement doesn't necessarily mean that Bitcoin is a hedge during times of uncertainty. 

Here's a look at a few instances where Bitcoin's price has reacted, or not reacted, to large-scale armed conflict in the world:

On June 13, Israel struck dozens of targets in Iran in the largest attack on the country since the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. The two countries, arch-rivals in the Middle East, have continued strategic missile strikes against each other over the following days.

Despite concerns over wider escalation, including calls by Israel to involve the United States, markets have largely shrugged off concerns. Bitcoin is no exception.

While the asset saw a brief drop immediately after the bombings began, the price has largely recovered. Crypto analyst Za said, “Bitcoin does not seem concerned about the Israel and Iran conflict (yet).”

Perhaps the most famous Bitcoin bull, Michael Saylor, is also unfazed. On June 16, his firm, Strategy, acquired 10,001 BTC for $1 billion. The purchase comes after Strategy's third Bitcoin-backed preferred stock, STRD, began trading on Nasdaq on June 11. 

On April 1, 2024, Israel struck an Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, killing several senior officials. In response, Iran seized the Israeli ship MSC Series and launched a series of attacks on Israel on April 13.

After both dates, the price of Bitcoin saw a brief downward movement, with BTC losing over 8% just after the April 13 retaliation.

Still, as markets became accustomed to the new norm, so did Bitcoin, and it continued moving upward.

On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas forces from Gaza struck targets inside Israel, killing over 1,000 Israelis and triggering a war and humanitarian crisis that is still ongoing. 

Israeli markets saw immediate dramatic losses, while major arms manufacturers like Lockheed Martin saw spikes in stock price. 

Bitcoin remained fairly unaffected, and 50 days after the initial attacks, it was performing well above where it started. 

Following the attacks, reports that Hamas had raised money in crypto led to renewed calls from regulators to tightly regulate the space, with the US Treasury sanctioning a Gaza-based crypto operator with alleged ties to the group.

Blockchain forensic firm Elliptic said there was “no evidence” to support claims of Hamas raising funds in crypto.

In early 2022, after eight years of war in the Donbas region of Ukraine, Russia initiated a full-scale invasion in what Moscow calls a “special military operation.” 

Global financial markets were immediately affected, with economies closest to Ukraine suffering the worst. Countering this trend, Bitcoin's price spiked upward and was up 16% just five days after the invasion. 

Exchanges within Russia and Ukraine saw crypto trading at eye-watering premiums as people fleeing abroad sought to skirt currency controls with cryptocurrency. 

One week after the start of the war, Ukraine had received over $70 million in cryptocurrency donations, mostly in Ether (ETH).

Bitcoin tanked later that year, but this was fueled by the collapse of the Terra stablecoin ecosystem and other market events, more than concerns over the war in Ukraine. 

While crypto may serve as a risk-off asset during times of conflict in some parts of the world, its price movements appear to ignore internal conflicts outside of those affecting traditional markets in Europe, the Middle East and North America. 

In November 2020, war broke out in the Tigray region of Ethiopia after years of tension between the left-wing ethno-nationalist Tigray People's Liberation Front and the federal governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia. 

The war, which left hundreds of thousands dead and millions internally displaced, was characterized by the Catholic Near East Welfare Association as underreported. A 2024 report from Geographical called it “the war the world forgot.” 

Bitcoin's price didn't take much notice either. The main narrative dominating the crypto market then was the assets' unprecedented bull run driven largely by inflation worries from the COVID-19 pandemic and institutional adoption by Block (then Square) and Strategy (then MicroStrategy).

Later that year, just months after the outbreak of the Tigray war, on Feb. 1, 2021, the Tatmadaw of Myanmar overthrew the National League for Democracy in a coup d'état, sparking a civil war, which is ongoing. 

A month later, Bitcoin's price would reach its then-all-time high of $69,000.

A key factor in the discussion of Bitcoin's reaction to conflict is the degree to which Bitcoin is adopted — i.e., has exposure or correlation to traditional markets. 

Some economists have noted the effect of the geographic proximity of conflict. Financial markets in countries closer to a conflict zone will see more volatility and losses. 

Overall crypto adoption is highest in developing nations, with India, Nigeria and Indonesia leading the pack, according to Chainalysis' 2024 Global Adoption Index. This index includes onchain crypto and retail value received by centralized services, and onchain crypto and retail value received by DeFi protocols.

Bitcoin, by comparison, is finding increasingly concentrated ownership among Western institutions and world governments. As of December 2024, 1% of Bitcoin was owned by ETFs alone, more than by Satoshi Nakamoto. 

The biggest holders are now ETF issuers like BlackRock, regulated crypto exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase and even the US government. 

Bitcoin has only recently enjoyed this degree of adoption and, therefore, exposure to traditional financial markets and institutional investment.

In 2013, Bitcoin went on what some consider its first major bull run. It started the year at $13, crossing $100 by April and $200 by October. The end of the year saw it close out over $1,000. 

A “crypto winter” started the next year, in addition to two armed conflicts: the Donbas war, including Russia's annexation of Crimea, and the 2014 Gaza war. 

During this time, crypto was still in a niche industry, and miners could use the graphics card on their gaming computers to mine Bitcoin. Kraken and Coinbase were only three and two years old, respectively.

Institutional involvement was next to nonexistent, and many regarded crypto as “magic internet money” suited only for accommodating illicit activity online. 

While the onset of both conflicts affected stock markets, both regionally and farther afield, there was no discussion in crypto media, such as it existed at the time, of the wars' effect on Bitcoin's price.

Now, with increasing institutional adoption, a crypto-friendly American government and international trade conferences drawing in thousands, Bitcoin's price may be more influenced by the negative forces armed conflict puts on markets. 

Almost all of the above conflicts, which saw Bitcoin prices quickly rebound, occurred before widespread institutional adoption. This paradigm shift has seen the narrative around Bitcoin change from a risk-off to a risk-on asset. BTC has more correlation to traditional financial markets than it did previously. 

Still, analysts are cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin in the current climate. QCP stated in a June 16 note that escalation could see oil prices spike, particularly an “Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz,” with potential US involvement disrupting global risk assets.

Not long after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission clarified its stance on staking, investors have dedicated a record amount of Ethereum to the network.

The amount of Ethereum pledged toward validating network transactions crossed 35 million on Tuesday, an all-time high representing 28.3% of the asset's circulating supply, according to a Dune dashboard created by Dragonfly Capital data scientist Hildebert Moulié. At the same time, the number of validators earning rewards reached 1.1 million—a new record.

Although liquid staking solutions exist, the high water mark suggests conviction is growing for Ethereum, Carlos Guzman, a research analyst at crypto market maker GSR, told Decrypt.

“It dovetails with market expectations around ETH turning more optimistic and positive,” he said “People are maybe expecting the price to go up in the future, and therefore feeling more confident in terms of holding the asset.”

Late last month, Wall Street's top cop said in a statement that it does not view staking activities as securities transactions, noting that a lack of clarity “artificially constrained participation in network consensus and undermined the decentralization [...] of proof-of-stake blockchains.”

Although former SEC Chair Gary Gensler posited in 2022 that proof-of-stake assets could themselves be securities, the statement signaled individuals and institutions could participate, as asset managers seek to integrate staking rewards into exchange-traded funds.

Liquid staking protocols, such as Lido, allow a user to lock up their Ethereum, in exchange for a token pegged to the asset's price, while still being able to earn rewards. Crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital said on Tuesday that it would work to bring staking to institutional investors.

Ethereum was recently changing hands around $2,500, a 5.4% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. As of Tuesday, the amount of Ethereum staked is worth $90 billion, based on current prices.

In practice, the amount of Ethereum staked influences the asset's issuance, or the rate at which new Ethereum is created. As more Ethereum is staked, the asset's issuance increases at a diminishing rate, according to business development firm Etherealize.

“Even in an extreme hypothetical scenario—where the entire circulating ETH supply [...] is staked and zero ETH is burned through network usage—the maximum possible inflation rate is capped at 1.51%,” the company said in a recent research report.

Unlike Bitcoin, where computers constantly crunch complex calculations to compete for fresh coins, Ethereum relies on validators that have locked up capital in exchange for the opportunity to participate in the process of validating transactions, since the so-called Merge in 2022.

Although it's a relatively small amount, SharpLink Gaming, an online gambling marketer, said last week that it had deployed Ethereum in staking and liquid staking solutions as part of its corporate treasury strategy, totaling around 167,000 Ethereum worth roughly $418 million.

Ethereum (ETH) briefly crossed above $2,600 on Monday following a switch to accumulation in the top altcoin's exchange reserve and $583 million in inflows into ETH investment products last week.

Ethereum resumed bullish action on Monday after its exchange reserve flipped back to a downtrend, declining from 18.72 million ETH on Saturday to an all-time low of 18.57 million ETH over the past 24 hours. As the total value of exchange reserves drops, it indicates rising buying pressure.

During the period, ETH's total value staked also grew by 80K ETH, signifying a stronger bullish sentiment among investors, according to data from Beaconcha.in.

The shift toward accumulation in ETH follows a strong week of institutional buying pressure, which pushed net inflows in global Ethereum products to $583 million last week, according to CoinShares data.

The buying pressure was spearheaded by $528.12 million inflows into US spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), their highest weekly performance since December 2024. The products recorded a 19-day run of net inflows before breaking the streak on Friday, with mild outflows of $2.18 million following the escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

""Ethereum's recovery is being supported by the 'digital oil' narrative and ecosystem fundamentals, like the Pectra upgrade and increased stablecoin activity, with almost 50% of all stablecoins on the Ethereum network,"" said Tracy Jin, COO of crypto exchange MEXC.

""It's also good to see that the rules around staking and new stablecoin-related ETFs are coming into effect, which is helping to boost investor confidence,"" she added.

Despite the positive developments surrounding ETH recently, Jin maintained a cautious end-of-year price prediction for ETH.

""ETH could be between $2,800 and $3,600 by the end of the year, with the possibility of going even higher if ETF staking and network developments speed up,"" Jin said.

Ethereum experienced $134.04 million in futures liquidations, with long and short liquidations totaling $70.55 million and $63.49 million, respectively, over the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data.

ETH held support near $2,500 through the weekend and tested the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as dynamic resistance before experiencing a rejection. The top altcoin could test the $2,850 key resistance if it flips the 200-day SMA support. A rejection at $2,850 will imply a double-top formation.

On the downside, if the $2,500 support fails, ETH needs to hold the lower boundary of a key channel, strengthened by the 50-day SMA, to prevent a decline to the $2,260 to $2,110 support range.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above its neutral level and could test its moving average line, while the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) is below its neutral level. A successful crossover above in both indicators will strengthen the bullish momentum.

As Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market show tentative signs of recovery following the most recent correction, a crypto analyst has made a bold statement suggesting that the market may have already reached its peak. 

BladeDeFi, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), warned followers that a significant downturn could be on the horizon, predicting a challenging summer ahead for the crypto space.

Crypto Pump Or Trap?

In his post, BladeDeFi emphasized that “crypto has already PEAKED” and forecasted a potential slump where alternative cryptocurrencies could see declines of up to 95%. He indicated that most indicators are flashing red, suggesting that the market is on the brink of a significant downturn. 

According to him, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high early in the current cycle and is now trapped in a “slow-motion downtrend,” with each subsequent bounce becoming weaker than the last.

The analyst pointed out a concerning trend: retail investors are becoming exhausted, while larger institutional players have begun to exit the market. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and MicroStrategy are reportedly rotating their investments and hedging their positions, often without making their actions overtly public. 

The analyst suggests that this shift leaves retail investors vulnerable, potentially left holding depreciating assets as liquidity in the market continues to dwindle.

BladeDeFi also criticized the current market dynamics, warning that sudden price increases or “green candles” are often deceptive, serving only to entice late buyers into traps that lead to further losses. 

He noted that without new capital inflows—such as fresh stimulus or significant investment—the recent price pumps lack sustainability. The absence of liquidity means that any upward movements are likely to be fleeting, and the overall trend remains downward.

Bitcoin Poised For Year-End Peak?

Adding to the bearish sentiment, another analyst, Peppeso, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the top of the 2025 bull market has already been established. 

Peppeso observed historical patterns in previous market cycles, noting that while bull markets have become longer, bear markets have shortened and softened in their impact. 

Despite this, Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs in the final months of each cycle, reinforcing Peppeso's expectation of a peak around November or December 2025.

The current market environment is further complicated by macroeconomic factors, including rising interest rates and increasing geopolitical risks. With uncertainty clouding the outlook, many investors are adopting a risk-off approach, leading to a sustained downtrend in the crypto market. 

Even popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant declines of 9% and 7% in the past week alone respectively, indicating that the hype surrounding these assets is fading.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Crypto Funds Hit With Record Outflows, But Altcoin Buyers Smell Opportunity","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:f98cf6089094b:0-crypto-funds-hit-with-record-outflows-but-altcoin-buyers-smell-opportunity/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 04:00:00 GMT","

Crypto asset investment products experienced another challenging week as capital outflows continued for a second consecutive period. According to the latest report from CoinShares, a total of $584 million exited crypto-focused investment vehicles, pushing the two-week cumulative outflows to $1.2 billion.

This movement coincides with investor uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year, which James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, believes is contributing to waning sentiment in the market.

Butterfill attributed the investor pullback to growing skepticism about macroeconomic policy shifts, particularly rate reductions. At the same time, exchange-traded product (ETP) activity hit a new low, with global ETP volumes falling to just $6.9 billion, marking the weakest weekly trading volume since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Bear the Brunt of The Crypto Outflows

Bitcoin accounted for the majority of this week's outflows, with $630 million leaving BTC investment products. Despite the significant movement of funds out of long Bitcoin positions, short Bitcoin products also recorded outflows totaling $1.2 million.

This suggests that investors are not currently betting heavily on downside exposure, opting instead to stay on the sidelines amid uncertain market conditions. Ethereum similarly saw negative flow activity, with $58 million in outflows, continuing the trend of cautious investor behavior across major assets.

The report also highlighted geographical breakdowns, noting that the United States led all regions with $475 million in outflows, followed by Canada at $109 million. Germany and Hong Kong recorded smaller outflows at $24 million and $19 million, respectively.

In contrast, Switzerland and Brazil stood out as exceptions to the broader trend, bringing in net inflows of $39 million and $48.5 million, respectively. This divergence suggests that local factors or institutional strategies in those regions may be driving different investment behaviors.

Altcoins Draw Selective Support

While sentiment remained bearish for large-cap assets, some altcoins managed to attract capital inflows. Solana, Litecoin, and Polygon saw modest but notable gains of $2.7 million, $1.3 million, and $1 million, respectively.

These inflows may reflect opportunistic positioning by investors seeking exposure to assets that have underperformed recently. Additionally, multi-asset investment products, which spread exposure across various cryptocurrencies, recorded $98 million in inflows.

This signals that some investors are using recent price weaknesses to gain diversified access to the market rather than concentrating bets on single tokens.

The continued divergence in fund flows highlights the complex sentiment currently influencing crypto markets. With macroeconomic uncertainty still dominating investor outlooks, digital asset markets remain reactive to both global monetary policy signals and evolving regional investment trends.

These 4 Crypto Projects Offer Tech-Backed Value","https://bravenewcoin.com/sponsored/presale/looking-for-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-now-these-4-crypto-projects-offer-tech-backed-value","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:07:22 GMT","

Which altcoin delivers the right mix of utility, upside, and long-term scalability in today's crypto market? The first half of 2025 has exposed a clear separation between speculation-driven assets and those building real-world frameworks.

Qubetics, for instance, is drawing attention for its multi-layered development tools, while Quant is setting enterprise standards in blockchain interoperability. Maker continues stabilizing decentralized finance through DAI, and Bitcoin Cash is re-emerging with renewed retail relevance. With renewed buying interest and functional narratives defining the altcoin market, buyers are no longer just chasing hype—they're focusing on real value.

Across the board, these four tokens – Qubetics ($TICS), Quant ($QNT), Maker ($MKR), and Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) – have demonstrated a combination of resilience, technical progress, and growing adoption. Each protocol addresses a specific segment of the blockchain space: Qubetics, currently priced at $0.3370, is redefining interoperability and utility through its cross-chain infrastructure and enterprise-grade tools; Quant is enabling institutional-grade interoperability across private and public blockchains; Maker remains the backbone of DeFi stability with DAI; and Bitcoin Cash continues to offer peer-to-peer payment functionality with real-world traction.

Qubetics is a structured blockchain infrastructure protocol. Central to its framework is QubeQode, a powerful no-code/low-code integrated development environment (IDE) designed for fast-track deployment of dApps. Whether onboarding business solutions, cross-chain smart contracts, or consumer-grade dApps, QubeQode makes it simpler for non-technical users to engage with decentralized architecture. The Qubetics IDE eliminates the traditional barriers of Web3 development—by letting applications tap into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other Layer-1 networks without needing to bridge or rewrite base-level code.

This seamless interoperability, combined with intuitive tooling, positions Qubetics among the best altcoins to buy now. As the demand for accessible blockchain solutions grows, platforms like Qubetics—offering built-in scalability, multichain compatibility, and user-friendly development interfaces – are gaining significant traction. By removing friction from dApp creation and enabling deployment across major networks from a single interface, Qubetics empowers businesses, creators, and institutions to adopt blockchain faster. This practical utility, paired with its performance-first architecture, firmly anchors Qubetics as one of the best altcoins to buy now for long-term utility and ecosystem expansion.



With the current $TICS token priced at $0.3370, Qubetics is currently in its final crypto presale phase, having raised over $18 million and sold more than 515 million tokens across 28,000 holders.  Given its reduced supply model (cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion tokens), scarcity will likely amplify post-listing demand.

Why did this coin make it to this list?

Qubetics delivers more than potential – it's executing. Between its all-in-one IDE, no-code dApp builder, and robust developer toolkit, the protocol is solving real onboarding and scalability problems in blockchain. That's what makes it the best altcoin to buy now for high-utility buyers.

Quant has always been synonymous with one thing: interoperability. Its Overledger operating system allows multiple distributed ledgers to communicate, enabling applications to run across different chains simultaneously. From banking to supply chain logistics, Quant is facilitating seamless integration between Web2 institutions and decentralized Web3 environments. With governments and financial institutions exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), Overledger has positioned Quant to become an infrastructure backbone in regulated crypto environments.

Enterprise clients are now piloting cross-chain settlements, KYC-compliant identity validation systems, and asset transfers between blockchains using Quant. Unlike other projects, its ecosystem isn't just open-source hobbyism -it's targeted at real contracts and institutions with compliance mandates. Quant is often less volatile compared to other altcoins. It attracts backers looking for stability, backed by a clear business case and seasoned leadership. That alone makes it stand out among many speculative tokens.

Why did this coin make it to this list?

Quant's enterprise-grade interoperability isn't just theory—it's implementation at scale. With increasing regulatory alignment and institutional adoption, it remains one of the best altcoins to buy now for those focused on infrastructure and compliance.



Maker is the decentralized autonomous organisation (DAO) behind DAI, a stablecoin widely used in DeFi lending, borrowing, and liquidity strategies. It's a critical building block of Ethereum-based DeFi and is known for its fully collateralized design. What makes Maker powerful in 2025 is its ability to manage DAI's peg during volatile market cycles while expanding integrations across chains.

Its recent upgrade includes enhanced vault strategies, synthetic yield modules, and integration with liquid staking derivatives, allowing users to collateralize staked assets for minting DAI. That feature alone has driven protocol TVL upwards, with many buyers recognising $MKR as more than governance, it's a yield-generating engine.

With centralized stablecoins facing rising scrutiny, DAI's decentralized mechanics could pull increased attention, adding tailwinds to $MKR's valuation.

Why did this coin make it to this list?

Maker isn't speculative – it's fundamental. As the DeFi backbone stabilizing value flow, it remains the best altcoin to buy now for backers looking to participate in decentralized economies through a mature, functional protocol.

Bitcoin Cash has seen a resurgence due to its renewed focus on peer-to-peer payments and point-of-sale integrations. Originally created as a scalable alternative to Bitcoin, BCH continues to maintain fast, cheap transaction capabilities. What's changed is adoption: retail merchants, online platforms, and e-commerce processors are giving BCH a second look.

Multiple point-of-sale networks in emerging markets are re-integrating Bitcoin Cash for instant micro-transactions. With rising fees on Ethereum and Bitcoin networks, BCH provides a cost-effective alternative, especially for daily payments under $50. This kind of real-world usage is what drives BCH's recent relevance. Its cyclical pattern has broken slightly with this recent surge, suggesting increasing demand and transaction volume on-chain.

Why did this coin make it to this list?

Bitcoin Cash makes peer-to-peer crypto work in the real world. With retail applications scaling, it stands out as a best altcoin to buy now based on adoption—not just price movement.

As 2025 progresses, the market is shifting decisively toward functionality over flash. Speculative narratives are giving way to real-world solutions, and the projects making headlines are those delivering long-term infrastructure and meaningful adoption. Qubetics stands out with its multi-layered development stack, real-time cross-chain capabilities, and developer-first toolkit—positioning it as a frontrunner among the best altcoin to buy now. Quant continues to serve as a trusted bridge between enterprise systems and blockchain architecture. Maker reinforces its role as DeFi's backbone through stablecoin stability and protocol-level yield generation. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash is making crypto payments viable again with growing retail traction.

For backers seeking real returns in a maturing digital asset environment, these projects aren't just well-positioned—they're purpose-built. Whether it's onboarding global payments, powering institutional-grade infrastructure, or creating the rails for decentralized finance, each one represents a high-utility, long-term value play. In a market crowded with noise, these four names are setting the standard for what qualifies as the best altcoin to buy now.

Coinbase is seeking approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer blockchain-based stocks, according to a Reuters interview. According to the crypto exchange's chief legal officer Paul Grewal, Coinbase is looking to offer “tokenized equities” to its customers in the form of these stock shares.

JUST IN: Coinbase seeks SEC approval to offer blockchain-based stocks.

The move would allow Coinbase to offer stock trading via blockchain technology effectively. This service is already offered by retail brokerages including Robinhood (HOOD) and Charles Schwab (SCHW). The concept is a “huge priority,” Grewal said in an interview with Reuters this week.

Currently, tokenized equities are not available for trading in the United States. However, several firms are experimenting with offering these products. Coinbase rival Kraken said last month that it is launching tokens of U.S. equities, called xStocks, which will be available in select markets outside the United States. This paves a path for bringing these blockchain-based stocks to the US if the concept is eventually approved by the SEC. The regulator has yet to comment publicly on Coinbase's pitch, though.

Coinbase has made several big announcements in June already. Its EU MiCA license applications are nearing completion, and at the time of writing, it is in a prime position for European market entry. Furthermore, the crypto exchange introduced its first branded credit card in partnership with American Express last week. Cardholders will be able to earn between 2% and 4% back in bitcoin, beginning this fall, and take advantage of experiences, protections, and other benefits that are offered alongside the American Express network.

A no-action letter would be issued by SEC staff in response to a request from a company like Coinbase, saying that the SEC would not object to a certain offering and would not recommend an enforcement action if a firm were to move forward with that offering. Paul Grewal did not say if Coinbase had already submitted an official request to the SEC or when a potential product launch might happen.

“With a no-action letter, an issuer of a tokenized equity or a platform that wishes to offer secondary trading in those equities can have some confidence, some comfort, that the SEC has adopted its view of why this product is compliant,” Grewal added.

 Joey Bertschler, a former OpenAI employee, is building a crypto wage distribution system, Volante Chain, motivated in part by disillusionment with OpenAI's culture. 

Joey Bertschler, a former OpenAI employee, is building a crypto-powered earned wage access system through his new startup, Volante Chain.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at German Blockchain & AI Week, Bertschler said he worked at OpenAI before the launch of ChatGPT, helping business customers use early-stage AI tools. He later decided to switch industries and focus on financial technology, creating a blockchain-based platform that allows same-day wage access for employees.

Volante allows employees at participating companies to be paid their daily wage on the same day, rather than waiting until the end of the month. Bertschler described the current norm as “30 days of taking your freedom away, of choosing what to do with your money,” particularly for those living paycheck to paycheck.

The platform uses blockchain to enable seamless record-keeping in a verified ledger and reduce costs, which allows for low fees, he said.

Volante uses artificial intelligence to help predict employer defaults and assess risk in real time. Bertschler described the system as hybrid: partially AI-driven with human oversight and some legal review. He said AI is used for pattern detection and decision-making support, but is not fully autonomous. “There's also semi-automation, some lawyers involved, some human oversight,” he said.

Bertschler told Cointelegraph that Volante has raised about $2 million so far from private investors. He expects the lean company to be able to run for about five years without requiring further capital injections.

He said Volante is “deploying to a couple thousand test users in Vietnam and Japan,” with plans for expansion in the future. He said this was the minimum viable product stage, and compared it to a closed beta.

Bertschler said his decision to leave OpenAI and subsequent fintech pivot resulted from good offers from other companies and internal policies he did not appreciate. As an Austrian national, he claimed non-US employees faced limited advancement opportunities and were excluded from stock option plans.

“We're a bit stuck. We were paid fair wages, but we didn't get any stock options, and we couldn't really rise in our roles,” he said.

He added that the closed nature of the firm prevented workers from showcasing their code on GitHub, which allows for long-term employee growth:

Bertschler was critical of OpenAI's current direction, saying the company has become more secretive and profit-driven since Microsoft's involvement.

Bertschler claimed that OpenAI's conduct was not appropriate for its name. “You can absolutely call it closed AI,” he said, adding:

May reports indicate that Microsoft — OpenAI's top financial backer — is currently in talks with the AI behemoth to renegotiate the investment deal. 

OpenAI has attempted to restructure to shift its focus to profit-making, but this has been met with pushback from co-founders like Elon Musk and early investors.

In early May, OpenAI announced it was abandoning its shift to a purely for-profit model and is choosing to shift to a public benefit corporation. This structure would include legal obligations to fulfill social or public goods objectives and be controlled by a nonprofit entity.

sheridian, wyoming, June 17th, 2025, Chainwire



R0AR has launched its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that integrates token staking, liquidity provision, and NFT-based rewards into a single user interface. Designed to support long-term engagement, the platform streamlines participation while incorporating embedded security measures and time-based reward models.

Streamlined Staking and Liquidity Solutions

The R0AR Platform enables users to interact with three primary mechanisms:

All services are accessible via a unified dashboard compatible with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, and additional login methods.

Time-Based APY and Smart Engagement Logic

The SmartAPY system employed by R0AR replaces static returns and fixed lock-up models with a time-sensitive structure that increases rewards proportionally with the length of the stake. All liquidity and staking positions are subject to an 11-day minimum engagement window, enforced on-chain, with real-time visibility into countdowns for penalty-free withdrawal. (After 11 days their is no required lock periods letting you unstake at anytime while hitting APY tiers)

Security Infrastructure and Direct Token Access

The platform operates without reliance on third-party routing or aggregator services, reducing exposure to slippage and MEV-related risks. Smart contracts include embedded protections against unauthorized interactions and manipulation. Additionally, users can purchase $1R0R directly using ETH, Weth, USDC, or USDT via the platform, bypassing the need for centralized exchanges.

Practical Applications for NFTs

Beyond aesthetic or collectible use, ERS NFTs serve functional roles within the platform. When locked, they deliver increasing monthly payouts and can boost staking rewards when held alongside $1R0R in the same wallet. Bonus incentives are also available for verified users.

The NFTs include metadata designed to integrate with R0AR's upcoming AI tools, allowing the system to adjust experiences based on behavioral patterns without requiring active user input.

Ecosystem Integration and Technical Foundation

Each of the platform's core functions—staking, liquidity, and NFT utilities—contributes to a cohesive ecosystem. Built on the Optimism OP Stack, the R0AR Platform benefits from reduced transaction costs and scalability for future integrations, including real-world asset support and AI-enhanced personalization features.

Public Launch and Availability

The R0AR Platform is scheduled for public release on 6-16-2025 . Users will be able to access all staking, liquidity, and NFT functionalities (NFT staking to follow on the r0ar platform in the coming weeks after launch) at https://www.r0ar.io/platform.

About R0AR

R0AR is a decentralized finance platform offering token staking, liquidity solutions, and NFT-based engagement tools. Operating on the Ethereum Blockchain & R0AR's custom OP Stack Layer 2 chain, the platform emphasizes time-based rewards, user protection, and simplified participation across DeFi protocols.

UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity Magazine

Reporter, Infosecurity Magazine

Embattled genetic testing company 23andMe has been fined £2.3m ($3.1m) by the UK's privacy regulator for failing to protect customers' special category data following a 2023 cyber-attack.

The company, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US, revealed in October 2023 that customers had their profile information accessed by threat actors following a credential stuffing campaign.

According to the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the campaign ran from April to September that year, exploiting reused login credentials stolen from previous unrelated data breaches.

Hackers gained access to a small number of initial accounts via these compromised credentials, but were then able to scrape data from additional users who had registered with the DNA Relatives feature.

23andMe said at the time that the incident impacted around six million customers. 

The UK regulator has now completed a joint investigation with its Canadian counterpart.

Speaking at a press conference in Ottawa on June 17, UK Information Commissioner, John Edwards, and Canada's Privacy Commissioner, Philippe Dufresne, said the probe concluded that the personal information of a total of seven million people worldwide, including 320,000 Canadian residents and 155,592 UK residents, had been compromised.

Depending on the individual, this data may have included names, birth years, self-reported city or postcode, profile images, race, ethnicity, family trees and health reports.

Despite 23andMe suggesting some of the blame could be tied to poor password management on the part of some customers, the ICO has found that 23andMe broke data protection law in several ways:

The regulator added that 23andMe missed several opportunities to act.

It said:

The ICO said that the company only began a full investigation when the stolen data was advertised for sale on Reddit.

""The breach serves as a cautionary tale for all organizations about the importance of data protection in an era of growing cyber threats. It is particularly relevant at a time when more and more personal information is being collected, used and shared in a growing digital economy,"" Dufresne said.

During the press conference, the Privacy Commissioner also explained why the Canadian government has not issued a similar sanction as its UK counterpart's: ""Unfortunately, Canadian privacy law does not yet provide this to me. It is something that I have been advocating for since my appointment. We had proposed law reform in the last parliament in Bill C-27 and I hope and expect that this new parliament will be turning its attention to remedying this and giving us the ability to issue orders and fines.""

Back in September 2024, 23andMe agreed to pay $30m in a data breach settlement in which it denied any wrongdoing. Earlier that year, the firm's lawyers had continued to blame user negligence for the incident.

The ICO fine comes a few days after it was revealed that TTAM Research Institute, a non-profit run by 23andMe's Co-Founder and former CEO, Anne Wojcicki,  is the winner in a final round of auction bids to acquire 23andMe.

""Statements and assurances have been made by the upcoming buyer, to ensure it will respect the existing privacy policies and clauses, and we certainly expect this to be done,"" said Privacy Commissioner Dufresne.

""We will be carefully following that the obligations should continue to apply to any new owner, and that if there are any concerns, our citizens can reach out to us and we'll take the appropriate steps,"" he added.

The ICO has strong criticism for the way the genetic testing company responded to a 2023 breach.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has slapped a fine of £2.31 million on genetic testing company 23andMe for failing to protect customer data after a cyber attack.

The credential stuffing attack, which took place between April and September 2023, saw the exposure of the personal information of 155,592 UK residents.

The data exposed included names, birth years, location, profile images, race, ethnicity, family trees, and health reports.

At the time, the company was roundly criticized for appearing to blame users themselves for the breach. It wrote to customers saying they'd ""failed to update their passwords following past security incidents unrelated to 23andMe"", and had ""negligently recycled"" login credentials from other accounts that were already exposed.

The ICO, though, takes a different view.

""This was a profoundly damaging breach that exposed sensitive personal information, family histories, and even health conditions of thousands of people in the UK. As one of those impacted told us: once this information is out there, it cannot be changed or reissued like a password or credit card number,"" said information commissioner John Edwards.

""23andMe failed to take basic steps to protect this information. Their security systems were inadequate, the warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond. This left people's most sensitive data vulnerable to exploitation and harm.""

Specifically, the ICO found that 23andMe had failed to implement appropriate authentication and verification measures when customers logged in, including mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong passwords.

It also failed to put appropriate security measures in place to deal with access to and the downloading of raw genetic data.

Nor did it have the right measures in place to monitor for, detect, and appropriately respond to cyber threats to its customers' personal information.

""Strong data protection must be a priority for organizations, especially those that are holding sensitive personal information,"" said Philippe Dufresne, privacy commissioner of Canada, who collaborated with the ICO on the investigation.

""With data breaches growing in severity and complexity, and ransomware and malware attacks rising sharply, any organization that is not taking steps to prioritize data protection and address these threats is increasingly vulnerable.""

As well as failing to protect customer data, 23andMe handled the attack badly, the authorities concluded. The hackers kicked off their credential stuffing attack in April 2023, ramping up efforts in May and attempting to initiate profile transfers in July. This didn't happen invisibly, with 23andMe's platform stopping working, leaving the company's users unable to access it.

However, said the ICO, ""Despite 23andMe investigating this incident at the time, it failed to detect that this was part of a larger ongoing data breach.""

It didn't start a full investigation until October 2023, when a 23andMe employee discovered that the stolen data had been advertised for sale on Reddit. Only then did 23andMe confirm that a breach had occurred.

In August, indeed, it even dismissed a claim of data theft affecting over 10 million users as a hoax.

23andMe has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US, with a sale hearing set for today. The ICO said it was monitoring the situation closely, pointing out that the protections and restrictions of the UK GDPR continue to apply.

 Editor's Note: This article was updated at 10:30 a.m. EST with comments from a 23andMe spokesperson. 

 The United Kingdom's top data privacy regulator on Tuesday fined the embattled personal genomics company 23andMe more than $3 million over allegedly poor cybersecurity practices and a slow response to a devastating 2023 data breach. 

 The breach, which revealed the genetic data of millions of the firm's customers, spanned several months during which 23andMe failed to act, the Information Commissioner's Office said in a press release announcing the £2.31 million fine ($3.14 million). 

 The news comes on the heels of Friday's announcement that the TTAM Research Institute — a nonprofit recently founded by 23andMe's former CEO, Anne Wojcicki — won a bankruptcy auction to take control of the company.

 The ICO noted that 23andMe failed to require additional verification measures for users to “access and download their raw genetic data.” The regulator conducted its investigation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. 

 The genetic testing firm broke several U.K. laws, the ICO said, including by failing to require multifactor authentication (MFA), secure passwords and hard to predict usernames. 23andMe also did not have systems in place to monitor, detect and respond to cyber threats, they said. 

 A 23andMe spokesperson, who did not directly address the regulator's fine, said that “by the end of 2024, 23andMe had implemented multiple steps to increase security to protect individual accounts and information.” 

 The so-called credential stuffing attack began in April 2023, and a few months later the hacker logged into a free account more than a million times throughout the course of one day, the ICO said, as part of an attempt at “profile transfers.”  

 The extreme number of logins caused the company's platform to shut down, the ICO said. Later that month, the hacker again tried to trigger profile transfers in 400 separate accounts, they said.  

 23andMe probed the incident at that point but did not realize it was part of a much bigger and long-running hack, the regulator claimed. The following month, the genomics company dismissed claims of data thefts impacting more than 10 million users as untrue.  

 By September, the hacker intensified the credential stuffing scheme, the regulator said, but 23andMe did not launch a full investigation until October 2023, when one of its employees became aware that stolen company data was being peddled on Reddit. 

 At that point, six months after the attack started, 23andMe confirmed the breach. 

 It took until the end of 2024 for the company's security improvements to become “sufficient,” the ICO alleged. The hacker obtained personal data belonging to nearly 156,000 U.K. residents, and in some cases family trees and health conditions were exposed, the regulator said. 

 “As one of those impacted told us: once this information is out there, it cannot be changed or reissued like a password or credit card number,” U.K. Information Commissioner John Edwards said in a statement. 

 “23andMe failed to take basic steps to protect this information. Their security systems were inadequate, the warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond.” 

 According to the 23andMe spokesperson, as part of TTAM's agreement to buy the company, it has made “several binding commitments to enhance protections for customer data and privacy, including allowing individuals to delete their account and opt out of research at any time [and] notifying customers via email at least 2 days prior to the closing of the acquisition about details on TTAM's role.”

We frame the wide spectrum of possible system architectures for an online retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) and identify a promising architecture well-suited for basic payments. We select OpenCBDC 2PC, a representative system design that fits this architecture and analyze it using a range of criteria to assess the feasibility of such system designs. Our analysis, augmented with lab experiments, focuses on retail payment systems with two-tier deployment and includes a detailed assessment of non-repudiation, integrity of the monetary supply, privacy, compliance, scalability of performance and resilience of the system state. It suggests that such system designs can be fast and cheap for basic payments, with high privacy, although some areas such as integration with retail payments systems, performance of auditing and resilience of the core system state require further investigation. Our framing highlights other promising architectures for an online retail CBDC, whose analysis we leave as an area for further exploration.

      In 2019, Meta announced plans to launch a private digital currency. Fearing an onslaught of private cryptocurrencies, some countries responded by announcing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDC). Fast forward to today: Every G20 nation is exploring a CBDC, with 13 countries having plans in the pilot stage. Yet CBDCs have barely made a dent in national payment systems. 


     
      India launched the e-rupee for individuals in December 2022. And yet, at the end of March 2025, the value of the e-rupee in circulation, at  ₹1,016 crore, was a tiny drop in the ocean of India's digital payment ecosystem.


     
      The slow uptake of the digital rupee mirrors the experience of other countries. CBDCs launched earlier (Nigeria, China) and in countries with higher financial inclusion (Bahamas) also show low adoption rates. 


     
      Nigeria launched the e-naira in October 2021; by May 2024, there were only 13 million e-naira wallets, many inactive (Nigeria's population was 232 million, and it had over 200 million mobile phones in 2024). China's e-CNY, launched in 2020, hit 180 million wallets by mid-2024, but reports suggest that many of the accounts are dormant.


     
      The value of CBDCs currently in circulation indicates poor public demand and a lack of incentive to shift from existing payment methods. Yet it would be wrong to conclude that the CBDC experiment was a failure, or to dismiss the e-rupee. In the long run, the success of the e-rupee will depend on how it is rolled out and what use-cases it can cater to.


Patient rolloutThe Reserve Bank of India has been in no rush to roll out the e-rupee. The digital rupee remains at the pilot stage, available only to some customers of participating banks and non-banks. By going slow, and testing use-cases patiently and systematically, RBI has minimized outages and execution problems that plagued CBDC pioneers like Nigeria. 

     
      Any effort to force adoption of the e-rupee could erode trust in the currency. Nigeria faced this situation in 2022 when old naira notes were withdrawn and replaced with new notes. Nigeria's central bank claimed the note ban would create a more cashless society, but the resulting cash shortage caused much hardship and severely eroded people's trust in the system. Worse, it did not have a lasting impact on the use of the digital naira.

     
      India hasn't even offered cash incentives to encourage adoption of the e-rupee. This is probably wise. Typically, consumers take advantage of such incentives and go back to old payment modes when the incentive ends. China gave “red packets"" of CBDCs during the Lunar New Year in 2021 to incentivise digital wallet downloads, but there is no evidence that it translated to greater use of the e-CNY.

     
      All that said, RBI's two smartest moves related to the digital currency have been allowing two non-banks to offer e-rupee wallets and making digital rupee wallets compatible with the ubiquitous UPI. Non-banks have a different customer base from banks and tend to be innovative in their product design. And in a country where the majority of digital payments ride on UPI, it would have been impossible for any digital wallet to succeed without being integrated with it.

The e-rupee's potentialThere are two broad reasons to continue developing the e-rupee. 

     
      First, it is a geopolitical imperative. 

     
      As China pushes to internationalize its currency, the share of renminbi in global trade financing has gone up significantly. China has already built fintech infrastructure to settle cross-border transactions that bypass the US-dominated Swift. 

     
      In response, several central banks are working on projects to link multiple CBDCs with the objective of facilitating fast and cheap international payments. Developing robust infrastructure will allow the e-rupee to link with other CBDCs when it becomes possible; this will be a big plus for India, given the size of the country's inward remittances. 

     
      The rising popularity of cryptocurrencies in India could help drive greater adoption of the e-rupee. India's crypto adoption is quite high relative to its income level, and the e-rupee can be an effective foil for cryptocurrencies: it runs on the same secure blockchain technology but offers a safer store of value. 






     
      Second, new use-cases for the e-rupee are continually being introduced and refined based on user experience. Direct transfer of government benefits to individual e-rupee wallets (as recently done in Odisha) is now par for the course. 

     
      The real excitement is in programmable e-rupee. Programmed agricultural loans to tenant farmers in Andhra and Odisha have been piloted—these ensure that credit is used only to buy farm inputs from approved vendors. HDFC Bank has introduced user-programmable e-rupee wallets, which let the user decide the location and validity of use. 

     
      RBI is also exploring offline usage, which can be a game-changer for remote rural areas. For example, e-rupee wallets can be pre-seeded in mobile phones in disaster-prone areas. Such wallets can be programmed to activate when disaster strikes, to give digital fund access to the affected population.

The Reserve Bank of India has been in no rush to roll out the e-rupee. The digital rupee remains at the pilot stage, available only to some customers of participating banks and non-banks. By going slow, and testing use-cases patiently and systematically, RBI has minimized outages and execution problems that plagued CBDC pioneers like Nigeria. 


     
      Any effort to force adoption of the e-rupee could erode trust in the currency. Nigeria faced this situation in 2022 when old naira notes were withdrawn and replaced with new notes. Nigeria's central bank claimed the note ban would create a more cashless society, but the resulting cash shortage caused much hardship and severely eroded people's trust in the system. Worse, it did not have a lasting impact on the use of the digital naira.


     
      India hasn't even offered cash incentives to encourage adoption of the e-rupee. This is probably wise. Typically, consumers take advantage of such incentives and go back to old payment modes when the incentive ends. China gave “red packets"" of CBDCs during the Lunar New Year in 2021 to incentivise digital wallet downloads, but there is no evidence that it translated to greater use of the e-CNY.


     
      All that said, RBI's two smartest moves related to the digital currency have been allowing two non-banks to offer e-rupee wallets and making digital rupee wallets compatible with the ubiquitous UPI. Non-banks have a different customer base from banks and tend to be innovative in their product design. And in a country where the majority of digital payments ride on UPI, it would have been impossible for any digital wallet to succeed without being integrated with it.


The e-rupee's potentialThere are two broad reasons to continue developing the e-rupee. 

     
      First, it is a geopolitical imperative. 

     
      As China pushes to internationalize its currency, the share of renminbi in global trade financing has gone up significantly. China has already built fintech infrastructure to settle cross-border transactions that bypass the US-dominated Swift. 

     
      In response, several central banks are working on projects to link multiple CBDCs with the objective of facilitating fast and cheap international payments. Developing robust infrastructure will allow the e-rupee to link with other CBDCs when it becomes possible; this will be a big plus for India, given the size of the country's inward remittances. 

     
      The rising popularity of cryptocurrencies in India could help drive greater adoption of the e-rupee. India's crypto adoption is quite high relative to its income level, and the e-rupee can be an effective foil for cryptocurrencies: it runs on the same secure blockchain technology but offers a safer store of value. 






     
      Second, new use-cases for the e-rupee are continually being introduced and refined based on user experience. Direct transfer of government benefits to individual e-rupee wallets (as recently done in Odisha) is now par for the course. 

     
      The real excitement is in programmable e-rupee. Programmed agricultural loans to tenant farmers in Andhra and Odisha have been piloted—these ensure that credit is used only to buy farm inputs from approved vendors. HDFC Bank has introduced user-programmable e-rupee wallets, which let the user decide the location and validity of use. 

     
      RBI is also exploring offline usage, which can be a game-changer for remote rural areas. For example, e-rupee wallets can be pre-seeded in mobile phones in disaster-prone areas. Such wallets can be programmed to activate when disaster strikes, to give digital fund access to the affected population.

Meme coins can be a tempting investment.

They're a colorful form of cryptocurrency that can swing higher and lower at a moment's notice — offering the potential for outsize gains. However, with those large swings also come risks, which can turn some investors off.

“Memecoins, in general, get a lot of hate, but I do think it is a good way of onboarding the general public to the usage of crypto,” Charles St. Louis, CEO of DELV, which builds crypto infrastructure for investors, told The Post.

“Whether they learn a lesson of it, a loss or something, they still get some interest in the technology and I think having skin in the game is what allows you to fall down the rabbit hole of understanding why it's so good,” St. Louis added.

So how do you know if meme coins are the right investment for you – and how can you find the best ones?

Download a trusted exchange app — Start by choosing a licensed crypto exchange. We recommend starting with the Best Wallet app, available for both iOS and Android.

Create and verify your account — Sign up using your email, Google, or Apple ID. To complete registration, you'll need to verify your identity with a government-issued ID and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.

Fund your account — Deposit money into your account by linking a bank account or credit card or even using gift cards. Choose an option that best fits your lifestyle.

Buy your first cryptocurrency — Use the app's marketplace or swap tool to purchase crypto by entering the ticker symbol — like BTC for Bitcoin or ETH for Ethereum — and follow the prompts to complete the transaction.

Choose how to store your crypto — Decide whether you'll keep your crypto in the exchange, move it to a digital wallet (hot wallet), or store it offline (cold wallet) for extra protection.

A meme coin is a type of cryptocurrency, or digital cash, that is usually pegged to a humorous image or text, like an inside joke for the internet. 

Many meme coins are based on animal-related memes, like funny images of cats and dogs.

While these cryptocurrencies often start out as jokes, they can gain substantial attention and market value overnight. 

It goes without saying, then, that these same coins are often very volatile – so they can result in big losses for inexperienced investors.

Like other cryptocurrencies, meme coins sit on a foundational layer known as a blockchain, which is a digital, tamper-proof ledger that can record, verify and transfer data.

There's no shortage of meme coins available for those interested in investing.

Some of the most popular meme coins include Dogecoin, Pepe, dogwifhat – a comical abbreviation of “dog with hat” – and POPCAT, which are all based on animal memes.

“These projects have built strong followings and remain active across social channels – a critical factor in meme coin success,” Daniel Polotsky, co-founder and chairman of global crypto kiosk CoinFlip, told The Post.

There are smaller meme coins that have been gaining attention, too, like American Coin and Giga Chad, but these are “highly speculative plays and should be approached with caution,” Polotsky added.

Dogecoin, arguably the most popular meme coin, is based on an image of a Shiba Inu dog.

It opened in 2013 and hit an all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021 – meaning a hypothetical $100 investment in the coin when it launched would have been worth nearly $250,000 at its peak.

The coin's success was due, in part, to outspoken support from Elon Musk on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Dogecoin tumbled recently during Musk's public feud with President Trump.

President Trump launched his own meme coin on the Solana blockchain in January, just a few days before he took office for his second term. Known as $TRUMP, the coin was made in his likeness. A similar Melania Trump meme coin called $MELANIA launched at the same time.

The $TRUMP coin made an estimated $100 million in trading fees by Jan. 30, less than two weeks after its launch, as it skyrocketed amid his inauguration.

The digital currency enjoyed another boost in April when it announced that its top holders would be invited to a private dinner with the president. The announcement helped raise the value of the meme coin by more than 40%, partially reversing an 88% slump from the weeks prior.

The top holders of the meme coin spent as little as $53,500 to as much as $16.4 million to grab an invite to the dinner, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.

Around 2 million wallets have purchased the meme coins. Nearly 60 of these wallets have made more than $10 million each – while around 764,000 wallets have lost money on the investments, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis shared with CNBC.

Due to their volatile nature, the best meme coins to invest in are constantly changing.

Investors looking to find the next Dogecoin before it soars should spend time staying up to date on trends in the industry.

And not all meme coins are created equal. Some are much riskier investments than others.

“The more trustworthy meme coins tend to be the ones with transparent teams, consistent communication and strong, engaged communities,” Polotsky told The Post.

Since meme coins trade purely off public sentiment, social media sites like X and Reddit can be useful tools to stay informed on up-and-coming coins. 

“These are the spaces where meme coins live or die – sometimes overnight,” Polotsky said.

Sites like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap can also help investors assess potential investments, showing market cap, trading volume and other key indicators for meme coins.

Market cap is an especially important factor. Coins with lower market caps can offer potentially larger returns, but also carry much higher risk, Polotsky said. Meme coins with larger market caps are more stable but come with less growth opportunity. 

Whether or not meme coins are the right investment for you depends largely on your experience as an investor and your openness to risk.

Meme coins can be a great addition to a broader crypto portfolio, but should never make up the bulk of an investor's assets, Polotsky warned.

“Their value is often more social than financial,” Polotsky told The Post. “As a general rule, allocating more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio to meme coins is probably already pushing into risky territory.”

More experienced cryptocurrency investors might be able to withstand more risk, so these high-risk, high-reward bets could be a good option for them. 

“These investors typically understand market cycles, know how to read community signals, and can stay emotionally detached from the wild swings that meme coins are known for,” Polotsky said.

But newbie crypto investors may want to steer clear of the volatile investments. 

A common mistake with new investors is that “they feel like they missed the boat with Bitcoin,” Ben Weiss, co-founder and chief executive of CoinFlip, told The Post.

“So then they buy some of these smaller coins, like these meme coins that are like four cents a coin, thinking it'll be the next Bitcoin, and those coins are usually four cents for a reason,” Weiss continued.

Polotsky said new investors should view meme coins like venture-style investing: 90% to 99% of them may fail, but the right one could deliver outsized returns.

The American banking giant JPMorgan has just filed a mysterious trademark application named “JPMD” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This initiative fuels speculation about a potential new stablecoin. But what is really behind this discreet move?

On June 15, 2025, JPMorgan Chase officially submitted its trademark application “JPMD” to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

This file precisely describes “trading, exchange, transfer, and payment services of digital assets” issued on blockchains. The Office recorded the application without definitively approving it.

The document never mentions the term “stablecoin” nor explicitly describes the issuance of a digital asset pegged to the US dollar. 

However, the listed services — from transaction reconciliation to digital currency transmission — perfectly match the typical functionalities of stablecoins.

The “D” in the acronym JPMD hints at “JMorgan Dollar,” aligning with the naming convention of other popular tokens like Circle's US Dollar Coin. 

This hypothesis makes even more sense since the bank already has solid expertise in this area with its JPM Coin, used for institutional settlements.

On X, a member of Aptos Labs, under the pseudonym zacharyr0th, ironically summarizes the paradox: “It's not like Wall Street is buying all the coins, but they certainly want to adopt the technology (sometimes gritting their teeth)”.

This initiative fits perfectly with JP Morgan's blockchain strategy, embodied by its Kinexys platform (formerly Onyx). 

Launched in 2020, this blockchain unit has already processed more than $2 billion in daily transaction volumes, establishing JP Morgan as one of the pioneers of distributed ledger technology among major American financial institutions.

The timing of this trademark filing is no coincidence. It coincides with the progress of the Genius Act in the US Congress, a bill aimed at creating a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. This legislation, expected to be adopted this summer, promises to significantly increase stablecoin use by banks and financial institutions.

This regulatory evolution explains why several companies are already positioning themselves in this rapidly growing market. BitGo announced the launch of its USDS stablecoin, while the World Liberty project, backed by the Trump family, recently launched USD1, a dollar-backed token supported by US Treasury bonds.

JP Morgan's initiative is part of a broader dynamic of stablecoin adoption by traditional financial institutions. 

This shift can be explained by the tangible advantages these digital assets offer: reduced transaction costs, faster cross-border payments, and simplified cash flows on a global scale.

The market continues to grow at an impressive rate. In 2024, stablecoins generated $27.6 trillion in transactions, surpassing the combined volumes of Visa and Mastercard. To date, more than 161 million people worldwide hold stablecoins — a figure that alone illustrates the scale of the phenomenon. 

Faced with this massive adoption, even the most cautious institutions have no choice but to adjust. In May 2025, JP Morgan took a symbolic step by allowing its clients to buy bitcoin, despite its CEO Jamie Dimon's persistent criticisms.

The potential emergence of JPMD therefore appears as a logical step: a strategic lever to support this new demand while consolidating its position in an increasingly competitive digital ecosystem. 

While companies like Amazon and Walmart are actively exploring their own stablecoin solutions, JP Morgan intends to maintain its lead in this profound transformation of monetary infrastructures.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Funding, Mergers and Acquisitions in the World of Crypto","https://dailyhodl.com/2025/06/16/funding-mergers-and-acquisitions-in-the-world-of-crypto-navigating-the-new-financial-landscape/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 03:44:15 GMT","

After a small experiment in technology, cryptocurrency and blockchain have turned into a significant industry worth trillions of dollars, attracting many big investors.

As the market increases, funding rounds and mergers or acquisitions play a strong role in supporting new ideas, uniting companies and making the industry bigger.

The current state of crypto funding

Money from venture capital in cryptocurrencies has gone through significant changes, both showing its promise and how much it can fluctuate.

Crypto funding rose to record levels in 2021 and 2022, and then experienced a decline in 2023 before signs of rebound appeared.

Blockchain companies go through various funding phases, such as seed funding when they start out, and much larger Series C and D rounds when they are more developed.

Investors are focusing on DeFi (decentralized finance) projects, marketplaces for NFTs (non-fungible tokens), digital asset exchanges, blockchain infrastructure providers and Web 3.0 gaming platforms.

Those who manage significant institutional funds are getting more experienced in understanding crypto investments.

Firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Paradigm have launched crypto funds, and investors like Polychain Capital and Pantera Capital are now noted in the industry.

Key trends in crypto funding

Infrastructure

Support for blockchain infrastructure, scaling options, tools that help blockchains connect and methods for developers to use the technology have received significant investment these days.

This evidence indicates that industries recognize that good infrastructure plays a major part in encouraging many individuals to use cryptocurrency.

Investment

Businesses centered on following the proper rules and serving institutions have seen much investment.

Among these are keeping records clean, software for following the rules and technology built for large investors.

Real-world application

People who invest money now often look for projects that offer more than just a chance to profit from increased prices.

This category covers supply chain management, digital identity options and data storage networks that don't depend on a central system.

Geographic diversification

There is currently more cryptocurrency involvement around the globe since New York and Silicon Valley are joined by Europe, Asia and places like India, which are receiving significant funding.

Competition has increased, and as the crypto market matures, more M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activities are becoming common.

Regulatory pressure, the need to grow bigger, technological advances and the uncertain market are reasons for consolidation in the industry.

Strategic acquisitions

Many cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies have bought smaller firms to add new features, target other regions or acquire vital technology.

Deals are usually based on compliance, advanced trading technology or large user numbers.

Talent acquisitions

Crypto companies seek to purchase developers and experienced blockchain experts. Since the pool of skilled people in blockchain is small, buying talent and employing people with these skills is popular.

Cross-industry integrations

Many banks and technology companies are acquiring cryptocurrency firms to integrate blockchain technology into their standard services.

This trend shows that businesses outside finance are starting to use cryptocurrency technologies.

Notable merger and acquisition transactions

Certain deals that have taken place in the crypto mergers and acquisitions market have been very influential in the industry.

Such deals point to the fact that transactions in the sector are on the rise and fuel speculation about bona fide business deals.

Over the recent past, several large trading platforms have purchased small rivals to assist them in entering new markets or broadening their offerings.

Blockchain infrastructure providers have also been consolidated to build more end-to-end solution systems.

The overlap between TradFi (traditional finance) and crypto has been handy in that it acts as the point of entry into the digital asset ecosystem by big institutions – without which they would need to build their crypto-related business from scratch.

Regulatory uncertainty

The dynamics of regulations also create a scenario whereby crypto companies struggle to plan and conduct mergers and acquisitions.

Firms must deal with varying legislation across different jurisdictions, which could hinder transaction acceptance.

Valuation challenges

The vast changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies mean that it is difficult to value them appropriately.

Conventional methods of valuing assets do not stand a chance of developing specific aspects of crypto assets, tokenized systems and decentralized protocols.

Due diligence complexity

To review crypto companies, one must be knowledgeable about blockchain technology, token regulation, smart contract safety and law compliance.

Owing to this complexity, transaction time and transaction costs may increase.

Cultural difference

Crypto companies also tend to believe in a culture of decentralization and community-driven, which is challenging to combine in a typical corporation.

The role of tokenomics in funding and mergers and acquisitions

A special feature of crypto funding is the use of tokens, which serve purposes such as fundraising, network management and transactions within cryptocurrency systems.

Therefore, new ways of raising money have appeared, such as ICOs (initial coin offerings), STOs (security token offerings) and lately, IDOs (initial DEX offerings).

Using tokens for funding raises both positive points and challenges.

Its cost-effective fundraising and building of user-based communities might be outweighed by the extra regulations and possible disputes between those with crypto assets and those with shares in a business.

Adding tokens complicates mergers and acquisition transactions.

Acquirers have to look into the economics of the company's tokens, any possible regulatory outcomes and the responses of the blockchain community to the change in ownership.

Examining the possible trends and outcomes

Conclusion

The way cryptocurrency companies get funding and merge shows that the industry is changing from its early days to becoming a mature financial field.

Even with obstacles such as unsure regulations and markets, investors are becoming more knowledgeable.

Infrastructure improvement and involvement with traditional finance ridgelines are likely to continue driving the industry's growth.

You must manage regulations, study each opportunity closely and understand how blockchain and tokens work in this market.

As the industry matures, activity related to funding and various mergers may determine the future of cryptocurrencies.

Businesses and investors that organize their activities to fit the rules while staying innovative are most likely to win in this shifting market.

As more institutions become involved in these processes, deals will become more complex, and financial integration will grow.

 June 17, 2025 | 17:15

The law stipulates that digital assets including virtual assets in the electronic environment are a type of digital asset that can be used for exchange or investment purposes. Virtual assets do not include securities, digital forms of legal currency, or other financial assets as prescribed by civil and financial laws.

Cryptoassets are a type of digital asset that use encryption technology or digital technology with similar functions to authenticate assets during the process of creation, issuance, storage, and transfer. Cryptoassets do not include securities or digital forms of legal currency, and other financial assets as prescribed by civil and financial laws.

The law regulates that digital asset management includes creation, issuance, storage, transfer, and establishment of ownership of digital assets; rights and obligations of parties regarding activities related to digital assets; measures to ensure network safety and security; prevention and combat of money laundering, prevention and combat of terrorist financing; inspection, examination, and handling of violations; business conditions for providing cryptographic asset services; and other management contents.

According to experts, Vietnam is one of the most promising emerging markets in the digital asset space in Southeast Asia. With its tech-savvy, young population, and proactive approach to blockchain innovation, the country is well-positioned to become a regional leader. Several factors that set Vietnam apart include high crypto adoption, government support, and regulatory progress, all giving the country a competitive edge over other regional markets.

According to data from the Triple-A payment gateway, Vietnam has more than 17 million people who own crypto assets, ranking seventh globally. Over 85 per cent of freelancers own crypto assets, the highest in the world, and over 34 per cent of freelancers accept crypto payments.

A representative of Tether, a blockchain-enabled platform that facilitates the use of fiat currencies digitally, said that their company sees Vietnam as a critical part of its long-term vision for digital assets and education. The company is excited about the opportunity to contribute further to the country's blockchain evolution through strategic support.

""Regulatory clarity helps provide a structured environment for cryptocurrencies to thrive as reliable financial instruments, supporting versatile real-life use cases,"" said the Tether representative, adding ""We look forward to how Vietnam structures its approach to innovations like this.""

New regulations surrounding the pilot of a digital asset exchange will help legitimise crypto assets, entice institutional involvement, and foster regional innovation, opening up a new stream of investment to Vietnam.

Vietnamese financial institutions are exploring digital assets with growing seriousness, positioning the banking sector at a critical juncture where innovation, regulation, and risk management must converge.

The establishment of a regulated virtual asset exchange could support Vietnam's digital technology exports by providing a platform for domestic blockchain projects to access international markets, potentially increasing foreign currency earnings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","XRP Gets Another DeFi Boost Through Flare's FAssets and FXRP, Messari Says","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/17/xrp-gets-another-defi-boost-through-flare-s-fassets-and-fxrp-messari-says","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:00:09 GMT","

Flare Network is helping push XRP deeper into decentralized finance (DeFi) with FXRP — a fully collateralized, non-custodial representation of XRP on Songbird — and a growing suite of infrastructure now drawing interest from retail and institutional players alike, according to a Messari report.

Flare validates off-chain data without external middleware. The framework secures FAssets, such as FXRP, and enables cross-chain transactions, which is key to building a decentralized financial ecosystem around XRP.

At the protocol layer, FXRP minting utilizes a multi-collateral system, pooling stablecoins, FLR, and agent funds, to maintain a 2x or greater over-collateralization ratio. All participating agents are KYC'd and monitored on-chain, adding a layer of compliance uncommon in DeFi bridges.

While FXRP is currently live on Songbird (Flare's canary network), the mainnet rollout is reportedly near. In blockchain parlance, a canary network is designed for testing new features and protocols before they are deployed to a main network, but operates as a fully functional, live network (unlike a testnet, where assets don't hold any financial value).

Interest is already picking up: Trading platform Uphold, which holds 1.8 billion XRP, is looking to integrate FXRP. Separately, Nasdaq-listed VivoPower has committed $100 million in XRP for deployment on the Flare network.

Next in line is liquid staking. Firelight Protocol plans to launch stXRP, a liquid staking derivative for FXRP.

Modeled after stETH, the token will be transferable across Flare's DeFi apps and allow holders to maintain liquidity while earning rewards, further expanding XRP's use case on the network.

If the launch plays out as designed, Flare may finally bring DeFi utility to one of crypto's most held, but underutilized, tokens.

“While the XRPL has native functions like escrows, checks, and payment channels, it cannot implement complex smart contracts,” Messari analysts said in the report.

“FAssets bridge this gap by allowing XRP token holders to participate in a full range of DeFi activities (aka XRPFi), such as lending, borrowing, yield farming, and liquidity provisioning, without sacrificing custody of their underlying assets.This is particularly significant for XRP, which has historically been limited in its DeFi applications despite its substantial market capitalization and global adoption,” the analysts added.

For institutions, XRPFi offers a way to generate yield on their XRP holdings, which have traditionally been held as static assets.

The landmark acquisition of a working oil and gas facility in Latin America worth $75 million was completed using stablecoins and tokenized debt and equity through real-world asset specialist Global Settlement's platform, the firm told CoinDesk.

The purchase — orchestrated for Feniix Energy, a company that focuses on buying and operating energy assets in the region — marks the first time a fully tokenized capital stack has been used to acquire operational real estate tied to commodity production, Global Settlement said. 

The transaction was finalized last week, said Kyle Sonlin, founder of Global Settlement. Further details cannot be disclosed due to regulatory requirements, he said.

Institutions are increasingly looking at tokenization as the next frontier in capital markets, using blockchain technology for moving real-world assets (RWA) assets like bonds, funds and other securities. It promises simpler cross-border transactions, faster settlements and new liquidity channels. The tokenized RWA market could grow to trillions of dollars over the next few years. Projections range from $2 trillion by McKinsey to $18 billion by BCG and Ripple.

""This deal fundamentally transforms the financial landscape of energy infrastructure,"" Alejandro Uribe, a director at Feniix, said in a statement. ""By integrating blockchain technology, we achieve unprecedented efficiency, security, and transparency.

Global Settlement's GSX Protocol coordinated stablecoin flows between parties across Latin America, sourced vendors and supported technical infrastructure for the deal.

The process showcased that tokenization and stablecoins could reduce cross-border settlement across Latin American countries to minutes from what is typically several days through the traditional banking system, Sonlin said in an interview with CoinDesk.

Tokenization can also unlock more ways to raise funds for commodity-related investment across in emerging markets while bypassing traditional capital markets.

""I believe commodity tokenization is a key growth opportunity for emerging markets that don't have the existing access to traditional financial services,"" Sonlin said. ""Debt markets and even equity capital are hard to come by for refineries, mines and other natural resource products, despite the fact that a huge portion of GDP comes from these exports.""

For Global Settlement, which operates a layer-1 network focusing on real-world asset transactions across multiple blockchains, the deal was an opportunity to test its capabilities and replicate in future deals, Sonlin said.

""A key goal in building [the protocol] was to assist in quantifying the benefits of tokenization to issuers and family offices,"" Sonlin said. ""We are looking to expand and do more of these M&A [merger and acquisition] transactions.""

A fog of uncertainty continues to hang over global markets as crypto assets trade sideways, ahead of this week's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. While equities briefly found their footing on Monday, crypto markets remained defensive after Friday's $1.2 billion futures liquidation, which shook out overleveraged longs and sent altcoins sharply lower over the weekend.

XRP XRP$2.16 lead the pack among crypto majors. Bitcoin BTC$104,068.89 rose above $108,000 in the U.S. morning session on Monday, then slid to as low as $106,500 due to profit-taking. However, buying activity later moved prices above $107,000 in the Asian morning hours on Tuesday. 

BTC ETFs saw $1.4 billion in net inflows over the past week, reaffirming the role of spot products as price shock absorbers even during broader pullbacks.

Meanwhile, ether ETH$2,479.86 rose 1.5% over 24 hours to $2,609, still trailing Bitcoin's ETF-led strength. Solana's SOL SOL$146.99 and Tron's TRX TRX$0.27402 remained firm, up 1.5% and 2.1% respectively, though the broader tone remains cautious among traders.

Gold and oil, both traditional safe-havens during geopolitical crises, surged in early trading after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly called for the evacuation of Tehran in a statement from the G7 summit. That sparked a mini-rush into defensive assets. 

Bitcoin, however, lagged the move in a familiar pattern, according to analysts.

“Bitcoin often shows a delayed reaction to macro trends, so while gold and oil are surging on geopolitical and inflationary pressures, BTC may take time to catch up,” said Eugene Cheung, Chief Commercial Officer at OSL, in a note to CoinDesk.

“However, if risk sentiment shifts and investors look for alternative stores of value, Bitcoin could see renewed momentum in the coming weeks if this week's Fed meeting comes in as expected for investors.”

That expectation is now center stage. Markets are overwhelmingly pricing in a hold from the Fed, but attention will be focused on the tone and language of Chair Powell's comments, particularly regarding inflation and tariffs.

“We're expecting the Fed to hold rates steady this week as they wait to see how tariffs will affect the economy,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a Telegram message. “Inflation is easing and jobs are holding strong, so there's no rush to cut or raise just yet. They'll likely wait for more data before making any big moves later this year.”

Others see a subtle shift emerging, opining that a dovish pivot may not be announced outright, but the seeds could be planted.

“The Fed will likely see some dovish risk on the margin,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus. 

“The market will see whether the committee will use the recent string in downside inflation misses and weaker jobless claims to justify a more pronounced dovish pivot. We don't expect a whole lot out of the meeting, and the near-term focus will remain on the Iran-Israel situation,” Fan said.

 Bitcoin ETFs extend a six-day inflow streak, adding $412 million on Monday as institutional investors shrugged off escalating conflict between Iran and Israel. 

US spot Bitcoin exchange‑traded funds (ETFs) recorded $412.2 million in net inflows on Monday, extending their streak to six days and pushing total cumulative inflows to $46.04 billion.

The six-day run of inflows began on June 9 and has now absorbed over $1.8 billion in capital, according to data from SoSoValue. The run has continued despite escalating geopolitical tensions, including renewed conflict between Iran and Israel.

Daily contributions included $386.27 million on June 9, followed by a $431.12 million surge on June 10. Despite a slight dip mid-week, inflows rebounded sharply with $322.60 million on Friday and the most recent $412.2 million on Monday.

Total net assets across all US Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs have reached $132.5 billion, representing 6.13% of Bitcoin's total market cap. Trading volume remained strong as well, with $3.12 billion in value exchanged on Monday alone.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the charge, which recorded a $266.60 million net inflow on Monday and has now accumulated $50.03 billion.

Fidelity's FBTC followed with $82.96 million, while Grayscale's GBTC lagged behind with just $12.84 million and still shows a net outflow of $23.23 billion since inception.

“Despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, institutions are looking past short-term volatility and focusing on long-term positioning,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph, adding:

The unexpected Israeli strike on Iran on Friday triggered a market sell-off, pulling Bitcoin down over 7% and ending the week in negative territory.

Under the hood, metrics showed signs of capitulation, Bitfinex analysts said in a Monday report. They noted that Net Taker Volume hit a multi-week low at $197 million, indicating aggressive selling.

“This selling, however, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation-style setups that often mark local bottoms,” the analysts said.

They added that if Bitcoin manages to hold the $102,000–$103,000 zone, it may suggest that selling pressure is being absorbed and that the market could be primed for recovery.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Analyst: Prepare for a 530% XRP price breakout to $14 if this happens","https://cointelegraph.com/news/analyst-prepare-for-530-xrp-price-breakout-14-if-this-happens","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 08:53:08 GMT","

 XRP traders say it has the potential to rally to $14 if a technical setup similar to that in 2017 plays out, but a bull pennant breakout will be needed soon. 

Key takeaways:

Analysts predict XRP could rally 530% toward $14.

The XRP/USD pair needs to reclaim the 200-day SMA to continue the uptrend.

XRP's price has been trading between $2.05 and $2.40 over the last month while consolidating in a bull pennant in the weekly time frame. 

Several analysts say the current technical setup mirrors the 2017 price action that preceded a massive breakout to all-time highs.

XRP (XRP) price has been consolidating below $3.00 since Feb. 1. Still, analysts argue that it could see a massive recovery from the current level if it follows a breakout like it did in 2017.

Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto said that XRP's price action in the three-week time frame seems to follow a 2017 playbook where a breakout from a bull pennant led to an over 1,300% upward move to all-time highs around $3.40.

“I have seen this movie before,” the analyst said in a June 17 post on X, adding:

The altcoin's price action follows a similar setup on the weekly time frame, as shown below.

A bull pennant is a bullish continuation setup that forms when the price makes a sharp move higher (the flag pole), then pauses and consolidates in a small symmetrical triangle (the pennant).

Bull pennants typically resolve after the price breaks above the triangle's resistance line and rises by as much as the previous uptrend's height. This puts the upper target for XRP price at $14, or a 530% increase from the current price.

These analyses align with previous predictions of XRP reaching $27 based on chart fractals, Elliott wave analysis and Fibonacci extensions. Others say XRP price could rally by 1,100% to $25 if a spot XRP ETF is approved in the United States. 

XRP's potential to move higher is part of a recovery that began on April 10 and saw the relative strength index (RSI) rise to 52 at the time of writing from oversold conditions at 29.

XRP bulls are focused on breaking the resistance at $2.27 — the 50-day simple moving average (SMA).

The bullish case for the altcoin hinges on turning the resistance between $2.37 (the 200-day SMA) and $2.65 into new support. 

A close above this level will signal another escape break above the 50-day SMA, paving the way for a return to $3.00 or the seven-year high above $3.31.

As Cointelegraph reported, breaking resistance at $2.65 could launch a sustained recovery, which could see the XRP rise above $3.00.

 Over 28% of the total Ether supply is now staked, signaling that many investors are gearing up to hold their assets for the long term. 

The supply of staked Ether reached an all-time high this week, signaling growing investor confidence and a squeeze on the liquid supply of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.

Over 35 million Ether (ETH) coins are now staked under the Ethereum blockchain's proof-of-stake consensus model, according to data from Dune Analytics.

Over 28.3% of the total Ether supply is now locked into smart contracts and is unsellable for a pre-determined time in exchange for generating passive income for investors.

A growing staked supply also indicates that a large percentage of investors are preparing to hold their ETH instead of selling at current prices.

Over 500,000 ETH has been staked in the first half of June, signaling “rising confidence and a continued drop in liquid supply,” said pseudonymous CryptoQuant author Onchainschool in a Tuesday post.

Ether accumulation addresses, or holders with no history of selling, have also reached an all-time high of 22.8 million in ETH holdings, signaling that Ethereum is among the “strongest crypto assets in terms of long-term fundamentals and investor conviction,” the analyst said.

The recent rise in staking comes amid a more favorable US regulatory outlook. The record comes nearly three weeks after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released new guidance on cryptocurrency staking, widely seen as a victory for crypto regulations, Cointelegraph reported on May 30.

“Protocol Staking Activities,” such as cryptocurrencies staked in a proof-of-stake blockchain, “don't need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act,” SEC's Division of Corporation Finance said in a May 29 statement.

However, industry participants are still waiting for the approval of the first Ether staking ETFs after the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise's application to add staking to its Ether ETF on May 21.

Over 25% of the 35 million staked Ether tokens have been deployed through the liquid staking protocol Lido. Binance holds 7.5% of the staked Ether supply, and Coinbase holds 7.4%, according to Dune data.

Coinbase exchange has become Ethereum's largest node operator, holding over 11.4% of staked Ether supply through its validators, Cointelegraph reported on March 20.

Decentralization purists have previously criticized the growing Ether supply staked through liquid staking protocols as a potential centralization risk, which may create a single point of vulnerability for the network.

Despite the criticism, institutional adoption saw a significant uptick thanks to the development of liquid staking infrastructure, as a “significant percentage of Lido's TVL already comes from institutions” amid growing demand, Konstantin Lomashuk, founding contributor at Lido protocol, told Cointelegraph.

What Is Your Cat Trying to Say? These AI Tools Aim to Decipher Meows

AI is shedding new light on the 12,000-year conversation between cats and their humans, suggesting that house cats wield a far richer vocabulary than once thought

By Deni Ellis Béchard edited by Dean Visser

Life on white/Alamy Stock Photo

Meeaaaoow rises like a question mark before dawn. Anyone living with a cat knows their sounds: broken chirrups like greetings, low growls that warn, purrs stitched into sleepy conversation. Ethologists have organized feline sounds that share acoustic and contextual qualities into more than 20 groupings, including the meow, the hiss, the trill, the yowl and the chatter. Any individual meow belongs, academically speaking, to a broad “meow” category, which itself contains many variations. The house cat's verbal repertoire is far greater than that of its largely silent wild cousins. Researchers have even begun to study whether cats can drift into regional dialects, the way human accents bend along the Hudson or the Thames. And just as humans gesticulate, shrug, frown and raise their eyebrows, cats' fur and whiskers write subtitles: a twitching tail declares excitement, flattened ears signal fear, and a slow blink promises peace. Felis catus is a chatty species that, over thousands of years of domestication, has pivoted its voice toward the peculiar primate that opens the fridge.

Now imagine pointing your phone at that predawn howl and reading: “Refill bowl, please.” Last December Baidu—a Chinese multinational company that specializes in Internet services and artificial intelligence—filed a patent application for what it describes as a method for transforming animal vocalizations into human language. (A Baidu spokesperson told Reuters last month that the system is “still in the research phase.”) The proposed system would gather animal signals and process them: it would store kitten or puppy talk for “I'm hungry” as code, then pair it not only with motion-sensing data such as tail swishes but also with vital signs such as heart rate and core temperature. All of these data would get whisked through an AI system and blended before emerging as plain-language phrases in English, Mandarin or any other tongue.

The dream of decoding cat speech is much older than deep learning. By the early 20th century meows had been recorded on wax cylinders, and in the 1970s John Bradshaw, a British anthrozoologist, began more than four decades of mapping how domestic cats tell us—and each other—what they mean. By the 1990s he and his then doctoral student Charlotte Cameron-Beaumont had established that the distinct domestic “meow,” largely absent between adults in feral colonies, is a bespoke tool for managing humans. Even domestic cats rarely use it with each other, though kittens do with their mothers. Yet for all that anecdotal richness, the formal literature remained thin: there were hundreds of papers on bird song and dozens on dolphin whistles but only a scattering on feline phonology until machine learning revived the field in the past decade.

One of the first hints that computers might crack the cat code came in 2018, when AI scientist Yagya Raj Pandeya and his colleagues released CatSound, a library of roughly 3,000 clips covering 10 types of cat calls labeled by the scientists—from hiss and growl to purr and mother call. Each clip went through software trained on musical recordings to describe a sound's “shape”—how its pitch rose or fell and how long it lasted—and a second program cataloged them accordingly. When the system was tested on clips it hadn't seen during training, it identified the right call type around 91 percent of the time. The study showed that the 10 vocal signals had acoustic fingerprints a machine can spot—giving researchers a proof of concept for automated cat-sound classification and eventual translation.

Momentum built quickly. In 2019 researchers at the University of Milan in Italy published a study focused on the one sound aimed squarely at Homo sapiens. The research sliced the meow into three situational flavors: “waiting for food,” “isolation in an unfamiliar environment” and “brushing.” By turning each meow into a set of numbers, the researchers revealed that a “feed me” meow had a noticeably different shape from a “where are you?” meow or a “brush me” meow. After they trained a computer program to spot those shapes, the researchers tested the system much as Pandeya and colleagues had tested theirs: it was presented with meows not seen during training—all hand labeled based on circumstances such as hunger or isolation. The system correctly identified the meows up to 96 percent of the time, and the research confirmed that cats really do tweak their meows to match what they're trying to tell us.

The research was then scaled to smartphones, turning kitchen-table curiosity into consumer AI. Developers at software engineering company Akvelon, including a former Alexa engineer, teamed up with one of the study's researchers to create the MeowTalk app, which they claim can translate meows in real time. MeowTalk has used machine learning to categorize thousands of user-submitted meows by common intent, such as “I'm hungry,” “I'm thirsty,” “I'm in pain,” “I'm happy” or “I'm going to attack.” A 2021 validation study by MeowTalk team members claimed success rates near 90 percent. But the app also logs incorrect translation taps from skeptical owners, which serves as a reminder that the cat might be calling for something entirely different in reality. Probability scores can simply reflect pattern similarity—not necessarily the animal's exact intent.

Under the hood, these machine-learning systems treat cat audio tracks like photographs. A meow becomes a spectrogram: one axis represents time, the other indicates pitch, and colors or brightness show loudness. Just as AI systems can pick out a cat's whiskers in a photograph, they can classify sound images that subtly distinguish specific kinds of meows. Last year researchers at Duzce University in Türkiye upgraded the camera: they fed spectrograms into a vision transformer, a model that chops them into tiles and assigns weights to each one to show which parts of the sound give the meow its meaning.

And in May 2025 entrepreneur Vlad Reznikov uploaded a preprint to the social network ResearchGate on what he calls Feline Glossary Classification 2.3, a system that explodes cat vocabulary categorizations to 40 distinct call types across five behavioral groups. He used one machine-learning system to find the shapes inside each sound and another to study how those shapes change over the length of a single vocalization. Howls stretch, purrs pulse and many other distinct vocalizations link together in varying ways. According to Reznikov's preprint, the model had a greater than 95 percent accuracy in real-time recognition of cat sounds. Peer reviewers have yet to sharpen their pencils, but if the system can reliably distinguish a bored yowl from a “where's my salmon?” warble, it may, if nothing else, save a lot of carpets.

As for Baidu, the blueprint for its patent says its approach adds new kinds of information rather than deeper sound analysis. Imagine a cat with a fitness tracker and a baby monitor, as well as an AI assistant to explain what it all means. Whether combining these data will make the animal's message clearer or add confusion remains to be seen.

Machine learning is increasingly being used to understand other aspects of animal behavior as well. Brittany Florkiewicz, a comparative and evolutionary psychologist, uses it to identify how cats mimic one another's facial expressions and to track the physical distance between them to infer relationships. “Generally speaking, machine learning helps expedite the research process, making it very efficient and accurate, provided the models are properly guided,” she says. She believes the emergence of apps for pet owners shows how much people are thinking about innovative ways to better care for their pets. “It's positive to see both the research community and everyday pet owners embracing this technology,” she says.

Interest in animal vocalization extends not just to cats but to one of their favorite menu items: mice. DeepSqueak, a machine-learning system devised by psychologist Kevin Coffey and his team, does for rodents what the other systems do for cats. “Mice courtship is really interesting,” Coffey says—particularly “the full songs that they sing that humans can't hear but that are really complex songs.” Mice and rats normally communicate in an ultrasonic range, and machine learning decodes these inaudible chirps and whistles and links them to circumstances in which they occur in the lab.

Coffey points out, however, that “the animal communication space is defined by the concepts that are important to [the animals]—the things that matter in their lives.... A rat or a mouse or cat is mostly interested in communicating that they want social interaction or play or food or sex, that they're scared or hurt.” For this reason, he's skeptical of grandiose claims made by AI companies “that we can overlap the conceptual semantic space of the animal languages and then directly translate—which is, I think, kind of total nonsense. But the idea that you can record and categorize animal vocalizations, relate them to behavior, and learn more about their lives and how complex they are—that's absolutely happening.” And though he thinks an app could realistically help people recognize when their cat is hungry or wants to be petted, he doubts it's necessary. “We're already pretty good at that. Pet owners already communicate with their animal at that level.”

Domesticated animals also communicate across species. A 2020 study found that dogs and horses playing together rapidly mimicked each other's relaxed open-mouth facial expressions and self-handicapped, putting themselves into disadvantageous or vulnerable situations to maintain well-balanced play. Florkiewicz believes this might be partly a result of domestication: humans selected which animals to raise based on communicative characteristics that facilitated shared lives.

The mutual story of humans and cats is thought to have begun 12,000 years ago—when wildcats hunted rodents in the first grain stores of Neolithic farming villages in the Fertile Crescent—so there has been time for us to adapt to each other. By at least 7500 B.C.E., in Cyprus (an island with no native felines), a human had been interred with a cat. Later the Egyptians revered them; traders, sailors and eventually Vikings carried them around the world on ships; and now scientists have adapted humans' most sophisticated technology to try to comprehend their inner lives. But perhaps cats have been coaching us all along, and maybe they'll judge our software with the same cool indifference they reserve for new toys. Speech, after all, isn't merely a label but a negotiated meaning—and cats, as masters of ambiguity, may prefer a little mystery.

What else is hiding down there?

On October 14, 2024, NASA's Europa Clipper launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for Jupiter's fourth largest moon. Its mission is to assess the moon's potential to host life in the vast ocean beneath its icy crust. While the Europa Clipper is a milestone in humanity's ability to study the oceans of other worlds, Earth's oceans still hold many mysteries yet unsolved by science. 

Without leaving Earth, scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) and the Universidad de Concepción in Chile have discovered new life themselves—a previously unknown, active predator in one of the deepest trenches in the world. Four specimens were collected nearly 8,000 meters below sea level (which is almost as deep as Mount Everest is tall), and scientists named the crustacean “Dulcibella camanchaca”—a reference to the word for “darkness” in the languages of peoples living in the Andes region. 

Although its white carapace gives it a ghostly, almost Facehugger-from-Alien feel, the name is fitting if you consider that this predator lives out its life 7,000 meters below the aphotic zone, where absolute darkness reigns. The researchers described this new species late last month in the journal Systematics and Biodiversity. 

The Atacama Trench, also known as the Peru-Chile Trench, stretches about 3700 miles (6,000 kilometers) along the coast. However, off the coast of northern Chile, the trench plunges to almost 25,246 ft (8,000 m) below the surface—well within the deepest part of the ocean, known as the Hadal zone. 

Scientists have long been interested in exploring this zone, and the discoveries haven't disappointed. In 2023, the Instituto Milenio de Oceanografía (IMO)—based at Universidad de Concepción in Chile—carried out a deep ocean survey aboard the research vessel Abate Molina, which was originally donated to Chile by the Japanese government in the early 90s. Once the specimens were recovered, they were frozen for preservation and subsequently underwent genomic analysis.

""Most excitingly, the DNA and morphology data pointed to this species being a new genus too, emphasizing the Atacama Trench as an endemic hotspot,” Johanna Weston, lead author of the study and expert on the Hadal zone from WHOI, said in a press statement. 

True to its Alien-like appearance, D. camanchaca has a spine-tingling way of devouring its prey—using its raptorial appendages to essentially clamp down on other, smaller crustaceans. (Remind you of anything?) Because of its deep ocean environment, this mighty crustacean, which is only roughly four centimeters in length, can also withstand pressures up to 800 times stronger than pressures found on land. 

“This finding underlines the importance of continued deep-ocean exploration, particularly in Chile's front yard,” IMO's Carolina González, co-lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “More discoveries are expected as we continue to study the Atacama Trench.”

If something so small can persevere in conditions as adverse as those in the Hadal zone, maybe Europa Clipper has a non-zero shot at finding conditions that could support life in the vast, salty ocean of a whole different world.

While you're probably not pouring your morning cup for the long-term health benefits, coffee consumption has been linked to lower risk of mortality. In a new observational study, researchers from the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University found the association between coffee consumption and mortality risk changes with the amount of sweeteners and saturated fat added to the beverage.

The study, published online in The Journal of Nutrition, found that consumption of 1-2 cups of caffeinated coffee per day was linked to a lower risk of death from all causes and death from cardiovascular disease. Black coffee and coffee with low levels of added sugar and saturated fat were associated with a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality as compared to no coffee consumption. The same link was not observed for coffee with high amounts of added sugar and saturated fat.

""Coffee is among the most-consumed beverages in the world, and with nearly half of American adults reporting drinking at least one cup per day, it's important for us to know what it might mean for health,"" said Fang Fang Zhang, senior author of the study and the Neely Family Professor at the Friedman School. ""The health benefits of coffee might be attributable to its bioactive compounds, but our results suggest that the addition of sugar and saturated fat may reduce the mortality benefits.""

The study analyzed data from nine consecutive cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2018, linked to National Death Index Mortality Data. The study included a nationally representative sample of 46,000 adults aged 20 years and older who completed valid first-day 24-hour dietary recalls. Coffee consumption was categorized by type (caffeinated or decaffeinated), sugar, and saturated fat content. Mortality outcomes included all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Low added sugar (from granulated sugar, honey, and syrup) was defined as under 5% of the Daily Value, which is 2.5 grams per 8-ounce cup or approximately half a teaspoon of sugar. Low saturated fat (from milk, cream, and half-and-half) was defined as 5% of the Daily Value, or 1 gram per 8-ounce cup or the equivalent of 5 tablespoons of 2% milk, 1 tablespoon of light cream, or 1 tablespoon of half-and-half.

In the study, consumption of at least one cup per day was associated with a 16% lower risk of all-cause mortality. At 2-3 cups per day, the link rose to 17%. Consumption beyond three cups per day was not associated with additional reductions, and the link between coffee and a lower risk of death by cardiovascular disease weakened when coffee consumption was more than three cups per day. No significant associations were seen between coffee consumption and cancer mortality.

""Few studies have examined how coffee additives could impact the link between coffee consumption and mortality risk, and our study is among the first to quantify how much sweetener and saturated fat are being added,"" said first author Bingjie Zhou, a recent Ph.D. graduate from the nutrition epidemiology and data science program at the Friedman School. ""Our results align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which recommend limiting added sugar and saturated fat.""

Limitations of the study include the fact that self-reported recall data is subject to measurement error due to day-to-day variations in food intake. The lack of significant associations between decaffeinated coffee and all-cause mortality could be due to the low consumption among the population studied.

Nematodes are the most abundant animal on earth, but when times get tough, these tiny worms have a hard time moving up and out. So, they play to the strength of their clade. If food runs out and competition turns fierce, they slither towards their numerous kin. They climb onto each other and over one another until their bodies forge a living tower that twists skyward where they might hitch a ride on a passing animal to greener and roomier pastures.

At least that's what scientists assumed. For decades, these worm structures were more mythical than material. Such aggregations, in which animals link bodies for group movement, are rare in nature. Only slime molds, fire ants, and spider mites are known to move in this way. For nematodes, nobody had even seen the aggregations -- known as towers -- forming anywhere but within the artificial confines of laboratories and growth chambers; and nobody really knew what they were for. Did towers even exist in the real world?

Now, researchers in Konstanz, Germany, have recorded video footage of worms towering in fallen apples and pears from local orchards. The team from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior (MPI-AB) and the University of Konstanz combined fieldwork with laboratory experiments to provide the first direct evidence that towering behavior occurs naturally and functions as a means of collective transport.

 Natural towers 

""I was ecstatic when I saw these natural towers for the first time,"" says senior author Serena Ding, group leader at the MPI-AB, of the moment when co-author Ryan Greenway sent her a video recording from the field. ""For so long natural worm towers existed only in our imaginations. But with the right equipment and lots of curiosity, we found them hiding in plain sight.""

Greenway, a technical assistant at the MPI-AB, spent months with a digital microscope combing through decaying fruit in orchards near the university to record natural occurrences and behavior of worm towers. Some of these whole towers were brought into the lab. What was inside the towers surprised the team. Although the fruits were crawling with many species of nematodes, natural towers were made only of a single species, all at the tough larval stage known as a ""dauer.""

""A nematode tower is not just a pile of worms,"" says the first author Daniela Perez, a postdoctoral researcher at MPI-AB. ""It's a coordinated structure, a superorganism in motion.""

 Function of towers 

The team observed the natural dauer towers waving in unison, much like individual nematodes do by standing on their tails to latch onto a passing animal. But their new findings showed that entire worm towers could respond to touch, detach from surfaces, and collectively attach to insects such as fruit flies -- hitchhiking on mass to new environments.

To probe deeper, Perez built a controlled tower using laboratory cultures of C. elegans. When placed on food-free agar with a small vertical post -- a toothbrush bristle -- hungry worms began to self-assemble. Within two hours, living towers emerged, stable for over 12 hours, and capable of extending exploratory ""arms"" into surrounding space. Some even formed bridges across gaps to reach new surfaces.

""The towers are actively sensing and growing,"" says Perez. ""When we touched them, they responded immediately, growing toward the stimulus and attaching to it.""

This behavior, it turns out, is not restricted to the so-called ""dauer"" larval stage seen from the wild samples. Adult C. elegans and all larval stages in the lab also towered -- an unexpected twist that suggests towering may be a more generalized strategy for group movement than previously assumed.

Yet despite the architectural complexity of these towers, the worms inside showed no obvious role differentiation. Individuals from the base and the apex were equally mobile, fertile, and strong, hinting at a form of egalitarian cooperation. But so far only, the authors point out, in the controlled conditions of the laboratory. ""C. elegans is a clonal culture and so it makes sense that there is no differentiation within the tower. In natural towers, we might see separate genetic compositions and roles, which prompts fascinating questions about who cooperates and who cheats.""

As researchers seek to understand how group behavior evolves -- from insect swarms to bird migrations -- these microscopic worm towers might rise to provide some of the answers.

""Our study opens up a whole new system for exploring how and why animals move together,"" says Ding who leads a research program on nematode behavior and genetics. ""By harnessing the genetic tools available for C. elegans, we now have a powerful model to study the ecology and evolution of collective dispersal.""

The Apollo astronauts didn't know what they'd find when they explored the surface of the moon, but they certainly didn't expect to see drifts of tiny, bright orange glass beads glistening among the otherwise monochrome piles of rocks and dust.

The beads, each less than 1 mm across, formed some 3.3 to 3.6 billion years ago during volcanic eruptions on the surface of the then-young satellite. ""They're some of the most amazing extraterrestrial samples we have,"" said Ryan Ogliore, an associate professor of physics in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, home to a large repository of lunar samples that were returned to Earth. ""The beads are tiny, pristine capsules of the lunar interior.""

Using a variety of microscopic analysis techniques not available when the Apollo astronauts first returned samples from the moon, Ogliore and a team of researchers have been able to take a close look at the microscopic mineral deposits on the outside of lunar beads. The unprecedented view of the ancient lunar artifacts was published in Icarus. The investigation was led by Thomas Williams, Stephen Parman and Alberto Saal from Brown University.

The study relied, in part, on the NanoSIMS 50, an instrument at WashU that uses a high-energy ion beam to break apart small samples of material for analysis. WashU researchers have used the device for decades to study interplanetary dust particles, presolar grains in meteorites, and other small bits of debris from our solar system.

The study combined a variety of techniques -- atom probe tomography, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy -- at other institutions to get a closer look at the surface of the beads. ""We've had these samples for 50 years, but we now have the technology to fully understand them,"" Ogliore said. ""Many of these instruments would have been unimaginable when the beads were first collected.""

As Ogliore explained, each glass bead tells its own story of the moon's past. The beads -- some shiny orange, some glossy black -- formed when lunar volcanoes shot material from the interior to the surface, where each drop of lava solidified instantly in the cold vacuum that surrounds the moon. ""The very existence of these beads tells us the moon had explosive eruptions, something like the fire fountains you can see in Hawaii today,"" he said. Because of their origins, the beads have a color, shape and chemical composition unlike anything found on Earth.

Tiny minerals on the surface of the beads could react with oxygen and other components of Earth's atmosphere. To avoid this possibility, the researchers extracted beads from deep within samples and kept them protected from air exposure through every step of the analysis. ""Even with the advanced techniques we used, these were very difficult measurements to make,"" Ogliore said.

The minerals (including zinc sulfides) and isotopic composition of the bead surfaces serve as probes into the different pressure, temperature and chemical environment of lunar eruptions 3.5 billion years ago. Analyses of orange and black lunar beads have shown that the style of volcanic eruptions changed over time. ""It's like reading the journal of an ancient lunar volcanologist,"" Ogliore said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Heavy particles, big secrets: What happened right after the Big Bang","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250617014156.htm","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:51:04 GMT","

An international team of scientists has published a new report that moves towards a better understanding of the behaviour of some of the heaviest particles in the universe under extreme conditions, which are similar to those just after the big bang. The paper, published in the journal Physics Reports, is signed by physicists Juan M. Torres-Rincón, from the Institute of Cosmos Sciences at the University of Barcelona (ICCUB), Santosh K. Das, from the Indian Institute of Technology Goa (India), and Ralf Rapp, from Texas A&M University (United States).

The authors have published a comprehensive review that explores how particles containing heavy quarks (known as charm and bottom hadrons) interact in a hot, dense environment called hadronic matter. This environment is created in the last phase of high-energy collisions of atomic nuclei, such as those taking place at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The new study highlights the importance of including hadronic interactions in simulations to accurately interpret data from experiments at these large scientific infrastructures.

The study broadens the perspective on how matter behaves under extreme conditions and helps to solve some great unknowns about the origin of the universe.

Reproducing the primordial universe

When two atomic nuclei collide at near-light speeds, they generate temperatures more than a 1,000 times higher than those at the centre of the Sun. These collisions briefly produce a state of matter called a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a soup of fundamental particles that existed microseconds after the big bang. As this plasma cools, it transforms into hadronic matter, a phase composed of particles such as protons and neutrons, as well as other baryons and mesons.

The study focuses on what happens to heavy-flavour hadrons (particles containing charmed or background quarks, such as D and B mesons) during this transition and the hadronic phase expansion that follows it.

Heavy particles as probes

Heavy quarks are like tiny sensors. Being so massive, they are produced just after the initial nuclear collision and move more slowly, thus interacting differently with the surrounding matter. Knowing how they scatter and spread is key to learning about the properties of the medium through which they travel.

Researchers have reviewed a wide range of theoretical models and experimental data to understand how heavy hadrons, such as D and B mesons, interact with light particles in the hadronic phase. They have also examined how these interactions affect observable quantities such as particle flux and momentum loss.

""To really understand what we see in the experiments, it is crucial to observe how the heavy particles move and interact also during the later stages of these nuclear collisions,"" says Juan M. Torres-Rincón, member of the Department of Quantum Physics and Astrophysics and ICCUB.

""This phase, when the system has already cooled down, still plays an important role in how the particles lose energy and flow together. It is also necessary to address the microscopic and transport properties of these heavy systems right at the transition point to the quark-gluon plasma,"" he continues. ""This is the only way to achieve the degree of precision required by current experiments and simulations.""

A simple analogy can be used to better understand these results: when we drop a heavy ball into a crowded pool, even after the biggest waves have dissipated, the ball continues to move and collide with people. Similarly, heavy particles created in nuclear collisions continue to interact with other particles around them, even after the hottest and most chaotic phase. These continuous interactions subtly modify the motion of particles, and studying these changes helps scientists to better understand the conditions of the early universe. Ignoring this phase would therefore mean missing an important part of the story.

Looking to the future

Understanding how heavy particles behave in hot matter is fundamental to mapping the properties of the early universe and the fundamental forces that rule it. The findings also pave the way for future experiments at lower energies, such as those planned at CERN's Super Proton Super Synchrotron (SPS) and the future FAIR facility in Darmstadt, Germany. ​​​​​​​

A USC-led research team has created a series of supercomputer-simulated twins of our Milky Way galaxy -- which could help scientists unlock new answers about one of the biggest mysteries in the universe: dark matter, the invisible substance that makes up about 85% of all matter in existence.

The research was led by cosmologist Vera Gluscevic, who is an associate professor at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences; as well as Ethan Nadler, formerly a postdoc at USC and Carnegie Observatories who is now an assistant professor at University of California, San Diego; and Andrew Benson, a staff scientist at Carnegie Observatories.

They called their simulation project ""COZMIC"" -- short for ""Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Initial Conditions beyond Cold Dark Matter.""

Scientists have known for decades that dark matter exists -- but until now, they could not study how galaxies are born and evolve in a universe where dark and normal matter interact. COZMIC has made that possible, the team said.

The development of COZMIC and the team's results are described in a trio of studies published on June 16 in The Astrophysical Journal, a publication of the American Astronomical Society.

The heart of dark matter

Scientists know that dark matter is real because it affects how galaxies move and stick together. For example, galaxies spin so fast that they should fly apart, but they don't. Something invisible holds them together; many scientists believe that dark matter is at the heart of this -- an idea first suggested in 1933 by a Swiss researcher, Fritz Zwicky. Research on dark matter has evolved ever since.

Dark matter is tricky to study because it doesn't emit any light or energy that can be easily detected. Scientists study dark matter by watching how it affects motions and structures like galaxies. However, that is somewhat like studying someone's shadow without being able to examine in detail the actual person who cast the shadow.

For the suite of studies, the research team took the step of deploying new physics -- not just standard particle physics and relativity -- and programmed a supercomputer to create very detailed cosmological simulations through COZMIC to test different ideas about what dark matter might be doing.

""We want to measure the masses and other quantum properties of these particles, and we want to measure how they interact with everything else,"" Gluscevic said. ""With COZMIC, for the first time, we're able to simulate galaxies like our own under radically different physical laws -- and test those laws against real astronomical observations.""

In addition to Glusevic, Nadler and Benson, the team behind COZMIC includes Hai-Bo Yu of UC Riverside; Daneng Yang, formerly of UC Riverside and now at Purple Mountain Observatory CAS; Xiaolong Du of UCLA; and Rui An, formerly of USC.

Several dark matter scenarios

""Our simulations reveal that observations of the smallest galaxies can be used to distinguish dark matter models,"" said Nadler.

For the studies with COZMIC, the scientists accounted for the following dark matter behavior scenarios:

While running these simulations, the scientists input new physics into the supercomputer to produce a galaxy whose structure bears the signatures of those interactions between normal and dark matter, said Benson.

Gluscevic added: ""While many previous simulation suites have explored the effects of dark matter mass or self-interactions, until now, none have simulated dark matter interactions with normal matter. Such interactions are not exotic or implausible. They are, in fact, likely to exist.""

A new day for dark matter

The team says it is a big step forward in figuring out what dark matter really is. They hope that by comparing their twin galaxies to real telescope images, they can get even closer to solving one of space's biggest mysteries.

""We're finally able to ask, 'Which version of the universe looks most like ours?'"" Gluscevic said.

The COZMIC team plans to expand their work by directly testing the predictions from their simulations with telescope data so they may discover signatures of dark matter behavior in real galaxies.

This next stage could bring scientists closer than ever to understanding what dark matter is, and how it shapes the cosmos.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Robots that feel heat, pain, and pressure? This new “skin” makes it possible","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250616040237.htm","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 08:09:02 GMT","

Scientists have developed a low-cost, durable, highly-sensitive robotic 'skin' that can be added to robotic hands like a glove, enabling robots to detect information about their surroundings in a way that's similar to humans.

The researchers, from the University of Cambridge and University College London (UCL), developed the flexible, conductive skin, which is easy to fabricate and can be melted down and formed into a wide range of complex shapes. The technology senses and processes a range of physical inputs, allowing robots to interact with the physical world in a more meaningful way.

Unlike other solutions for robotic touch, which typically work via sensors embedded in small areas and require different sensors to detect different types of touch, the entirety of the electronic skin developed by the Cambridge and UCL researchers is a sensor, bringing it closer to our own sensor system: our skin.

Although the robotic skin is not as sensitive as human skin, it can detect signals from over 860,000 tiny pathways in the material, enabling it to recognise different types of touch and pressure - like the tap of a finger, a hot or cold surface, damage caused by cutting or stabbing, or multiple points being touched at once - in a single material.

The researchers used a combination of physical tests and machine learning techniques to help the robotic skin 'learn' which of these pathways matter most, so it can sense different types of contact more efficiently.

In addition to potential future applications for humanoid robots or human prosthetics where a sense of touch is vital, the researchers say the robotic skin could be useful in industries as varied as the automotive sector or disaster relief. The results are reported in the journal Science Robotics.

Electronic skins work by converting physical information - like pressure or temperature - into electronic signals. In most cases, different types of sensors are needed for different types of touch - one type of sensor to detect pressure, another for temperature, and so on - which are then embedded into soft, flexible materials. However, the signals from these different sensors can interfere with each other, and the materials are easily damaged.

""Having different sensors for different types of touch leads to materials that are complex to make,"" said lead author Dr David Hardman from Cambridge's Department of Engineering. ""We wanted to develop a solution that can detect multiple types of touch at once, but in a single material.""

""At the same time, we need something that's cheap and durable, so that it's suitable for widespread use,"" said co-author Dr Thomas George Thuruthel from UCL.

Their solution uses one type of sensor that reacts differently to different types of touch, known as multi-modal sensing. While it's challenging to separate out the cause of each signal, multi-modal sensing materials are easier to make and more robust.

The researchers melted down a soft, stretchy and electrically conductive gelatine-based hydrogel, and cast it into the shape of a human hand. They tested a range of different electrode configurations to determine which gave them the most useful information about different types of touch. From just 32 electrodes placed at the wrist, they were able to collect over 1.7 million pieces of information over the whole hand, thanks to the tiny pathways in the conductive material.

The skin was then tested on different types of touch: the researchers blasted it with a heat gun, pressed it with their fingers and a robotic arm, gently touched it with their fingers, and even cut it open with a scalpel. The team then used the data gathered during these tests to train a machine learning model so the hand would recognize what the different types of touch meant.

""We're able to squeeze a lot of information from these materials - they can take thousands of measurements very quickly,"" said Hardman, who is a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of co-author Professor Fumiya Iida. ""They're measuring lots of different things at once, over a large surface area.""

""We're not quite at the level where the robotic skin is as good as human skin, but we think it's better than anything else out there at the moment,"" said Thuruthel. ""Our method is flexible and easier to build than traditional sensors, and we're able to calibrate it using human touch for a range of tasks.""

In future, the researchers are hoping to improve the durability of the electronic skin, and to carry out further tests on real-world robotic tasks.

The research was supported by Samsung Global Research Outreach Program, the Royal Society, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Fumiya Iida is a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.

There might be a paradox in the biology of ageing. As humans grow older, their metabolisms tend to slow, they lose muscle mass and they burn many fewer calories. But certain cells in older people appear to do the exact opposite — they consume more energy than when they were young.

These potential energy hogs are senescent cells, older cells that have stopped dividing and no longer perform the essential functions that they used to. Because they seem idle, biologists had assumed that zombie-like senescent cells use less energy than their younger, actively replicating counterparts, says Martin Picard, a psychobiologist at Columbia University in New York City.

How to kill the ‘zombie' cells that make you age

But in 2022, Gabriel Sturm, a former graduate student of Picard's, painstakingly observed the life course of human skin cells cultured in a dish1 and, in findings that have not yet been published in full, found that cells that had stopped dividing had a metabolic rate about double that of younger cells.

For Picard and his colleagues, the energetic mismatch wasn't a paradox at all: ageing cells accumulate energetically costly forms of damage, such as alterations in DNA, and they initiate pro-inflammatory signalling. How that corresponds with the relatively low energy expenditure for ageing organisms is still unclear, but the researchers hypothesize that this tension might be an important driver of many of the negative effects of growing old, and that the brain might be playing a key part as mediator2. As some cells get older and require more energy, the brain reacts by stripping resources from other biological processes, which ultimately results in outward signs of ageing, such as greying hair or a reduction in muscle mass (see ‘Energy management and ageing').

Picard and his colleagues call this concept the ‘brain–body energy-conservation model'. And although many parts of the hypothesis are still untested, scientists are working to decipher the precise mechanisms that connect the brain to processes associated with ageing, such as senescence, inflammation and the shortening of telomeres — the stretches of repetitive DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes and protect them. This work, some researchers say, is also beginning to illuminate how psychological stress can accelerate ageing at a molecular level. Although once at the fringes of ageing research, this idea is now becoming mainstream, says Alessandro Bartolomucci, a biologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “The science speaks for itself. The field cannot dismiss it.”

Some of the earliest pieces of evidence pointing to the brain's role in ageing came from studies that revealed the effects of psychological stress on individual cells.

In the early 2000s, Elissa Epel, who was then a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), set out with her colleagues to examine whether chronic stress could leave behind a cellular signature. At the time, there was already a “very impressive literature” linking long-term stress to poor health, says Epel, who is now a health psychologist at UCSF. “But we didn't know as much about what was happening at the cellular level.”

So, the researchers decided to look at telomere length. Telomeres progressively shorten over the lifespan of an organism, and this process has been linked to senescence and other forms of age-related changes in cells.

The team recruited a group of 58 healthy women: 19 of whom had a healthy child; and 39 of whom had a child with a chronic illness. The researchers reasoned that the latter group often experienced increased levels of stress compared with the women who had healthy children3. Epel's team found that the women with a chronically ill child had shorter telomeres than those who did not — and that telomere length correlated with the number of years spent as a carer. These findings suggested that exposure to chronic stress can introduce molecular changes that are important for ageing, says biologist Noah Synder-Mackler at Arizona State University in Tempe.

Since then, teams have also found evidence of telomere shortening in people exposed to other stressors, such as adverse experiences in childhood and work-related exhaustion4. Although some of the results have been mixed when it comes to telomere length, researchers have also amassed evidence linking stress to other molecular markers of ageing.

For example, Anthony Zannas, a physician–scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and his colleagues have shown, through studies of large cohorts of people, that high levels of stress throughout life were associated with signs of accelerated ageing in the epigenome, the patterns of chemical modifications to the genome, such as DNA methylation, that help to regulate what genes are expressed. These changes might be mediated by stress hormones such as cortisol. Zannas's team found that, in women, higher levels of cortisol were linked to lower levels of DNA methylation, as well as an increase in the expression of the gene coding for tumour necrosis factor (TNF), a signalling molecule associated with inflammation5.

Others have been studying these processes in animals. Although animal models of stress have their limitations — for one, humans stressors are much more complex and can include a variety of social, psychological and biological factors — this work has provided mechanistic insights that are difficult to obtain in human studies. Bartolomucci and his team have discovered that chronic social stress in rodents, such as being subjected to aggressive behaviour from a dominant animal, can damage heart health and lead to a shorter lifespan6. They've also found that exposure to this type of adversity is linked to an increase in age-related molecular changes, such as a build-up of signals associated with senescence.

For example, in one 2024 study of male mice, Bartolomucci's team demonstrated that social stress during a relatively brief period in early life led to an increase in levels of a key marker of cellular senescence, called p16, in the brain, fat tissue and immune cells7. These changes occurred only in response to social stress: animals exposed to stress in the form of physical restraint, which involved placing them in small tubes for three hours per day for a month, did not experience a build-up of p16.

Synder-Mackler's team have been conducting similar studies in rhesus macaques. These animals tend to form hierarchies within groups, with newcomers dropping to lower social ranks. So, by sequentially introducing animals into groups, the researchers were able to examine the effects of social status on health. They found that social stress affects the immune system in multiple ways. In the immune cells of monkeys with lower social status, it led to an increase in the expression of inflammation-associated genes8. These effects were at least partially reversible: when the animals' social rankings were rearranged, the gene expression patterns in their immune cells also changed to match their standings. The team has yet to look at how these alterations affect lifespan — macaques can live for around 30 years, which makes it difficult to address this issue, Synder-Mackler says.

Metrics details

Geometry and topology endow mechanical frames with unusual properties from shape morphing to phonon wave manipulation, enabling emerging technologies. Despite important advances in macroscopic frames, the realization and phonon imaging of nanoscale mechanical metamaterials has remained challenging. Here we extend the principle of topologically engineered mechanical frames to self-assembled nanoparticle lattices, resolving phonon dynamics using liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. The vibrations of nanoparticles in Maxwell lattices are used to measure properties that have been difficult to obtain, such as phonon band structures, nanoscale spring constants and nonlinear lattice deformation paths. Studies of five different lattices reveal that these properties are modulated by nanoscale colloidal interactions. Our discrete mechanical model and simulations capture these interactions and the critical role of effects beyond nearest neighbours, bridging mechanical metamaterials with nanoparticle self-assembly. Our study provides opportunities for understanding and manufacturing self-assembled nanostructures for phonon manipulation, offering solution processability, transformability and emergent functions at underexplored scales of length, frequency and energy density.

Metrics details

An improved understanding of root vertical distribution is crucial for assessing plant-soil-atmosphere interactions and their influence on the land carbon sink. Here, we analyze a continental-scale dataset of fine roots reaching 2 meters depth, spanning from Alaskan tundra to Puerto Rican forests. Contrary to the expectation that fine root abundance decays exponentially with depth, we found root bimodality at ~20% of 44 sites, with secondary biomass peaks often below 1 m. Root bimodality was more likely in areas with low total fine root biomass and was more frequent in shrublands than grasslands. Notably, secondary peaks coincided with high soil nitrogen content at depth. Our analyses suggest that deep soil nutrients tend to be underexploited, while root bimodality offers plants a mechanism to tap into deep soil resources. Our findings add to the growing recognition that deep soil dynamics are systematically overlooked, and calls for more research attention to this deep frontier in the face of global environmental change.

Terrestrial ecosystems face a pressing challenge due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration: how can land plants satisfy their increasing nutrient demand1,2,3 and consequently sustain the terrestrial carbon sink4,5,6,7? A central piece to this puzzle is the ecology of plant roots. Plant roots not only are key to the uptake of growth-limiting soil resources8, but are also central to soil carbon input through root turnover9,10,11,12 and carbon loss through priming13,14.

Recent studies have greatly improved our understanding of plant roots through the study of their “traits”, ranging from morphological traits such as root diameter15,16,17,18 to root-symbiont relationships such as mycorrhizal colonization rate19,20, in part thanks to the rise of publicly available harmonized root trait data21,22,23. However, these trait data mostly reflect micro-scale properties of individual root segments (e.g., root diameter, root nitrogen concentration). A rooting-system level understanding of how these roots are distributed throughout the soil matrix still lags far behind (but see ref. 24), limiting our ability to scale up local, trait-based measurements to ecosystem-scale properties.

In particular, the ecology of deep fine roots (> 1 m depth) is perhaps the least understood component of root ecology due to the difficulty in sampling them25,26,27,28,29. Previous studies have reported the importance of deep fine roots in aiding plants to take up deep water30, tap into deep soil nutrient reservoirs31 and convert photosynthetic carbon into deep soil organic matter with high efficiency32. Yet, despite the importance of deep fine roots, our decades of understanding of plant rooting systems has been mostly confined to the top 5–100 cm33 due to the paucity of deeper fine root data22,34.

The recently established National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON hereafter) uniquely addresses this data gap35. First and most importantly, the NEON soil megapit data (Methods) reaches an impressive depth of 2 meters below the surface, allowing us to examine fine roots to an unprecedented depth (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1). Second, the NEON megapit root data are coupled with data on soil nutrients, soil physical properties, and soil moisture, making it possible to link root distributions to various abiotic factors. Third, the same standardized sampling approach is repeated across 44 sites ranging from Alaskan tundra to Puerto Rican neotropical forest36, enabling us to perform continental scale analysis across a range of ecosystem types and climate zones.

Leveraging these unique strengths of the NEON dataset, in this work, we address three central questions regarding the ecology of deep roots: (1) How does the abundance of fine roots change with depth? (2) What are the factors that impact the distribution of fine roots with depth? (3) Are nutrients in deeper soils equally, under-, or over-exploited by fine roots compared with surface soil? We find widespread occurrences of fine-root bimodality across ecosystems, with nearly 20% of sites showing this previously undocumented pattern. This bimodality is linked to lower total fine-root biomass and the presence of deeper nitrogen-rich soil layers, suggesting that subsoil nutrients are systematically under-exploited by fine roots.

We first examined the distribution of fine-root biomass along soil profiles up to 2 m depth. Unexpectedly, we frequently observed bimodal distributions of fine-root abundance (i.e., dry root biomass per volume), which differs from the default expectation of exponential-decay distribution37,38. In Fig. 1, we show the fine-root distribution at site SCBI (Smith Conservation Biology Institute NEON) as an example of root bimodality, in contrast to the typical unimodal exponential-decay at site YELL (Yellowstone National Park NEON). The bimodal SCBI site's secondary peak of fine root biomass is found well beneath the soil surface (~1.3 m, Supplementary Table 1), and well beyond the 30 cm or rarely 1 m depth where most sampling efforts stop22,34.

Note that the root abundance is standardized based on the maximum abundance to facilitate visualization and cross-site comparison. Error bands represent the 95% confidence intervals around LOESS fits (solid black), with red fill denoting bimodal distribution and blue denoting the unimodal exponential decay. c The spatial distribution of rooting profiles across 44 NEON sites (R package “maps v3.4.2”). Detailed site descriptions can be found in Supplementary Table 1 along with all 44 rooting profiles (Fig. S2). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

What's more, this surprising phenomenon of bimodal rooting distribution is widespread across the continental US, displaying no apparent patterning with regards to spatial clustering (Fig. 1c; bimodal sites in red, unimodal in blue). We estimate that 9 out of 44 ( ~ 20%) sites in the NEON dataset have bimodal root distributions (see Methods). It is especially noteworthy that all of these bimodal sites feature a secondary root peak deeper than 60 cm (with 33% deeper than 1 m; Supplementary Table 1), meaning these sites would not have been classified as bimodal using more common, shallower sampling depths.

As a natural phenomenon, bimodality has been widely spotted across multiple science disciplines: the bimodal body mass of African weaver ants39, the bimodal mycorrhizal association in tropical rainforest19, the distribution of water vapor in Earth's atmospheric system40, all the way to the color and shape distribution of galaxies in our cosmos41. The observation of bimodality often indicates the coexistence of two contrasting regimes/processes, of which the underlying mechanism is so far unaccounted for, raising the question of what process can give rise to the observed root bimodality.

Intuitively, if there exists a singular mechanism underlying all these bimodal root distributions (9 out of 44 NEON sites), there is a good chance we can detect the mechanism using statistical tools. In reality however, many processes can potentially cause bimodality of fine roots. For instance, the presence of a buried soil horizon rich in nutrients, surface drought coupled with presence of water supply in deeper soil, the presence of certain species that specialize in foraging for deep soil resources, and ecosystems that have documented binary niche partitioning42,43, to name a few. The potential multi-cause of bimodality and the inherent heterogeneity of edaphic conditions might limit our ability to derive an universal explaining mechanism. But failure to pin down a singular universal cause would then suggest that different NEON sites might operate under very different rules and bimodality might be due to distinct site-specific mechanisms. In the next two sections, we evaluate how root bimodality is linked to a range of factors, across and within the NEON sites.

We first analyzed whether the presence of root bimodality is linked to site-level features across all NEON sites. We built a classification model that takes into account 12 site-level features (Methods, Fig. 2a, S3) to examine the predictive power of each feature for bimodality. We chose a random forest algorithm for our classification model because (1) it is robust to the presence of outliers and nonlinear relationships and (2) it has a built-in validation mechanism that is particularly valuable for our small sample size (44 NEON sites). The resulting best performing classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 64% (correctly predicting the modality of 28 out of 44 sites), with a 66.7% accuracy for predicting bimodal and 63% accuracy for predicting unimodal sites. The importance ranking of features (Fig. 2a) from this classification model identifies total fine root biomass (g/m2; per square meter surface to maximal pit depth) as the most important predictor of bimodality, followed by gross primary production (GPP), and a range of other features.

a Feature importance ranking from a random forest classification model (Methods) identify total fine root biomass (g/m2) as the most important factor in predicting the modality of a site. Of these 12 factors (see Methods, site-level factors), land cover is the only categorical variable, the rest are continuous. The features in the orange bars are highlighted in (b, c). b Unimodal sites (n = 35, 990 g/m2) have nearly 3 times more root biomass than that of bimodal sites (n = 9, 368 g/m2; two-sided Student's t-test, p = 0.004). Note that y axis is on logarithmic scale. c Site modality (bimodal vs. unimodal) are not independently distributed across vegetation types (forest in green, grassland in blue, shrubland in purple, cultivated in red). Bimodal sites are more frequently associated with shrubland but less with grassland (two-sided chi-square test, p = 0.019, χ2 = 9.6). In each box plot, the lower and upper bounds of the whiskers denote minima and maxima, the center line denotes the median, and the lower and upper bounds of the boxes represent the 25% and 75% quantiles, respectively. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Out of the 12 factors analyzed, we selected two (one continuous and one categorical) to visualize differences among sites associated with bimodality in more detail (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for the other 10 factors). Figure 2b reveals that unimodal sites have nearly 3 times total fine root biomass compared to that of bimodal sites (990 vs. 368 g/m2). This pattern is rather unexpected yet significant despite the small sample size (p = 0.004, student's t-test). We also show that site vegetation cover is associated with site modality (Fig. 3c; p = 0.019, χ2 = 9.6; Methods). While the majority of bimodal sites are forested, bimodality is more frequently associated with shrublands than with grasslands. We also explored whether classifying sites based on growth forms (woody vs. herbaceous) would help explain the occurrence of bimodality. Due to the small sample size (N = 44), we did not find significant evidence to support an association between bimodality and growth form (p = 0.43, χ2 = 0.98). However, that doesn't rule out the possibility of growth-form playing an important role. Our analysis thus calls for more extensive sampling efforts.

a, b Illustration of a unimodal distribution (a) and a bimodal distribution (b) of property Y (root biomass in this case). Three depths derived from bimodal distribution are highlighted with filled dots: primary mode depth (D0), antimode depth (D1), and secondary mode depth (D2) (Methods). Using a given property value (Y) at depth D1 and D2, we can calculate ɸ as the ratio of Y(D2) and Y(D1). c Comparison of ɸ (root biomass) across unimodal (n = 35) and bimodal (n = 9) sites (two-sided Welch's t-test, p = 2.4e-06). d Comparison of ɸ (soil nitrogen concentration) across unimodal (n = 27) and bimodal (n = 7) sites (two-sided Welch's t-test, p = 0.013). Note that ɸ is unitless. In each box plot, the lower and upper bounds of the whiskers denote minima and maxima, the center line denotes the median, and the lower and upper bounds of the boxes represent the 25% and 75% quantiles, respectively. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

When we removed total fine root biomass from our predictive model, the resulting model had little predictive power, suggesting that no environmental factor is a universal cause for root bimodality across all sites. This result, however, does not rule out the possibility that these factors might be important at each individual site. In fact, the finding that bimodality is strongly linked to root biomass suggests that factors that can induce low root biomass might be important for inducing root bimodality (e.g., high aridity, low GPP, low soil pH, inherent species differences), but the specific cause of low root biomass at each site can be different.

We next zoom into within-site factors along the soil depth profile (i.e., depth-level) to examine whether soil nutrient concentrations and/or soil moisture may play a role in the emergence of root bimodality. To quantify the degree of bimodality in root biomass and its associated predictors, we devised a signature metric ɸ defined as the ratio of Y(D2) and Y(D1) where D2 is the depth of secondary root biomass mode, D1 the antimode (D0 for primary mode, see Fig. 3b), and Y denotes properties such as root biomass density, soil moisture, soil nutrient content, etc. (Fig. 3a, b).

By the definition of bimodality, when we calculate ɸ for root biomass across 44 sites, bimodal sites have significantly higher ɸ value than unimodal sites (Fig. 3c; p = 2.4e-6, Student's t-test). When we extend this analysis to a range of soil conditions (nutrient content, soil texture, soil moisture, etc.), our results only identify an analogous pattern in soil nitrogen concentration: bimodal sites contain significantly more nitrogen at depth D2 compared with the default expectation (Fig. 3d).

Two alternative mechanisms might explain the presence of a nitrogen rich layer that coincides with the secondary peak of root biomass: the “nitrogen-driven hypothesis” and the “water-driven hypothesis”.

For the “nitrogen-driven hypothesis”, we speculate that the presence of nitrogen in the soil can induce fine root growth. It is not uncommon that nutrient concentrations can feature a secondary peak in deep soil due to a number of factors, such as weathering of primary rock (albeit low concentrations44,45), accumulation of nutrients beyond the typical root uptake zone46, and the presence of buried soil horizons rich in nutrients47. In turn, these deep nutrient anomalies can trigger the growth of fine roots which are responsible for foraging for limiting nutrients. This ability of roots to respond to nutrient cues has been extensively demonstrated by physiology literature looking at root production in response to localized chemical cues48, or in response to heterogenous nutrient patches in the soil matrix49.

However, the presence of deep nitrogen-rich layers could also be the result —instead of the cause— of the abundant fine roots, which might be produced to forage for other limiting resources such as water (“water-driven hypothesis”) or phosphorus. It is well known that the presence and turnover of fine roots can build up soil organic matter and consequently soil nitrogen9,50. It is thus possible that the nitrogen layer can be caused by the decay of water-seeking or phosphorus-seeking fine roots.

Potentially due to the limited depth-resolution of soil moisture sensors (Methods), we didn't find definitive evidence that supports the presence of a soil moisture peak coinciding with the presence of a secondary root peak. Specifically, when we analyzed long-term dynamics of soil moisture (ɸsoil moisture) between unimodal vs. bimodal sites, we found no meaningful difference (Supplementary Fig. 5; Methods). In evaluating whether surface drought might induce bimodality, an in-depth look at surface soil moisture (at D0) did not render a consistent difference between bimodal vs. unimodal sites (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, in natural ecosystems, fine roots are very plastic and responsive to localized and temporally brief supply of water51. It is thus entirely possible that the lack of support for the “water-driven hypothesis” was simply due to low spatial resolution of soil moisture data.

The “nitrogen-driven hypothesis” and the “water-driven hypothesis” do not have to be mutually exclusive. After all, the process of nitrogen mineralization — microbial release of available nitrogen from soil organic matter—is often limited by water availability52. Moreover, it is very likely that different mechanisms (water, or different types of nutrients) might be causing bimodality at different sites. For instance, we didn't find statistical support for phosphorus driving root bimodality, yet we cannot rule out the possibility of foraging for phosphorus being the cause of root bimodality at certain NEON sites, especially because only total rather than available phosphorus was measured at the 44 sites. Future studies with higher spatial resolution, especially controlled experiments, might help us address these unresolved questions.

To evaluate the potential impact of root bimodality on plant resource uptake, we next analyzed the spatial distribution of soil nutrients in relation to the vertical distribution of roots. We choose to use root biomass as a surrogate for root uptake as some biomass proliferation represents a direct plant investment for resource acquisition. In natural settings, however, the realized uptake rate often depends on nutrient availability in the soil solution53. But the use of root biomass provides a good estimate of resource uptake potential, as one would expect strong correlation between root biomass and realized nutrient uptake when averaged over time and space. Alternative metrics for root uptake also include root surface area and root length (not available in our dataset); both correlate with root biomass.

When expressed relative to the abundance of fine root biomass (see Methods), relative soil nutrients appear to increase in abundance with increasing depth. For example, the relative phosphorus (P) abundance from site “YELL” (Yellowstone National Park NEON) increases with depth (Fig. 4a; r2 = 0.85), indicating that subsoil phosphorus is becoming relatively more abundant from the perspective of the roots.

 a We calculated relative nutrient concentration by dividing absolute nutrient concentration by the root biomass. For ease of comparison across sites, we rescaled relative root biomass by dividing relative biomass using topsoil value such that topsoil (Depth=0 cm) relative nutrient concentration is 1(i.e., dimensionless, see Methods). Using YELL (Yellowstone National Park NEON) as an example, both soil P content and root abundance decrease exponentially with increasing soil depth, but root abundance decays at a faster pace with depth. The resulting relative P concentration (black circle) increases exponentially with increasing soil depth (exponent = 0.013). This pattern suggests that as soil depth increases, nutrients become comparatively more abundant or underexploited in the subsoil (red area 1). Note that the Y axis is in logarithmic scale and the goodness of fit (r2) applies to the corresponding linear regression (log10(y) instead of y). Gray ribbon represents the 95% confidence intervals around linear regression. b Using SCBI (Smith Conservation Biology Institute NEON) as an example, the presence of bimodal root distribution generates a region of low relative nutrient concentration in the subsoil (red area 2). Given the presence of root bimodality rendering a linear regression (on log scale) unfit for this analysis, we used loess fit (span=0.5) to capture the nonlinearity. Gray ribbon represents the 95% confidence interval for loess fit. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We can expand the example analysis in Fig. 4a to all 44 NEON sites and across four major soil nutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) (Supplementary Figs. 7–10). We can summarize the exponents across all sites for each individual nutrient, with each datapoint in Supplementary Fig. 11 corresponding to the slope value of a given NEON site (for example, 0.013 in Fig. 4a for P at YELL). Despite considerable variation across sites, our results clearly identify a general trend across the unimodal sites similar to what is shown in Fig. 4a: root abundance decays relatively faster than nutrients with increasing depth, leading to increasing relative nutrient abundance (i.e., positive exponent).

However, the presence of bimodal root distribution seems to disrupt the aforementioned general trend: the subsoil relative nutrient concentration in bimodal site (red area in Fig. 4b, site SCBI) is dramatically lower compared to the expectation set up by the unimodal site (red area in Fig. 4a, site YELL). And consequently, the goodness of regression fit is much poorer for bimodal sites across all nutrient types (Supplementary Fig. 12).

Our finding that soil nutrients become relatively more abundant relative to root biomass with increasing soil depth suggests that subsoil resources might be systematically under-exploited by plant roots (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 11). This finding is puzzling given how frequently nitrogen54, phosphorus55, potassium56, and calcium57,58 can limit the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems, pointing to some fundamental constraints that limit plant roots to exploit subsoil. For example, many studies have argued that plants preferentially use resources from shallower depths due to: 1) the high carbon cost associated with growing deeper root systems, 2) morphologically-induced hydraulic limitations, 3) the evaporative demand of acquiring resources from deeper depths, and 4) declining oxygen concentrations impeding root growth at depth46,59,60,61,62,63.

However, the discovery of bimodal root distribution across a range of sites suggests otherwise (Fig. 1, Fig. 4b). In fact, the presence of root bimodality indicates that root depth distribution can be flexible and opportunistic: given the right condition, plants can send abundant roots to deep soil. Numerous previous studies corroborate this argument. For example, Iversen et al. (2010) reviewed the change of root distribution in response to elevated CO2 treatment64, and discovered that roots can “dig deeper” with increased carbon supply (and consequently higher nutrient demand). Dry sites or sites with high seasonality in precipitation have also shown evidence of flexible bimodal distributions wherein the depth of water uptake becomes deep in the dry season and shallow in the wet season65,66,67,68.

The carbon consequence of enhanced root growth in deep soil can be far-reaching14. On the one hand, we would expect enhanced input of new carbon due to root turnover. Deep soil carbon relies much more on root carbon input than aboveground litter input9,11,69. And once root carbon is deposited, the carbon decomposition rate can be 60% slower compared with the rate derived from the surface soil11,70, in part due to the combined effect of lower microbial community density and increased mineral protection71,72,73. Alternatively, we might also expect enhanced decomposition of old carbon induced by root production at deeper depths: physical disturbance of carbon-mineral complex74, impacts on the soil food web75, and enhanced microbial activities through priming effects76,77,78 can lead to potential destabilization of subsoil.

The implications of our finding can be profound especially against the backdrop of rapid global change. An extensive literature examines the role of increasing CO2 in driving an increasing degree of plant/ecosystem scale nutrient limitation2,3,79: plants are getting increased supply of carbon but increasingly less nutrients as more and more nutrients are locked up in plant biomass. The resulting progressive nutrient limitation has fueled the fear of a saturating land carbon sink4 due to the inability of the ecosystem to fix additional carbon3,5,7. Our analyses thus suggest plants can potentially invest an increasing amount of their photosynthates to tap into the previously under-exploited soil nutrient pool as the plant cost-benefit equation is being shifted by global warming and rising CO2.

Taken together, these findings emphasize the need for an improved understanding of the spatial distribution of plant roots, which is critical for understanding the nutritional life of land plants, and may help to predict the future trajectory of the land carbon sink. We report a surprisingly widespread occurrence of root bimodality across a broad range of ecosystems. This new understanding of the vertical distribution of plant roots could help us to better scale up point measurements to the entire soil profile, a knowledge gap especially relevant to the study of ecosystem nutrient cycles and the land carbon sink. In addition, our observation can inform the development of the next-generation mechanistic vegetation models, which for decades have relied on relatively simplistic representation of roots (if any). But perhaps more broadly, our findings add to the growing recognition that the field of soil ecology and ecosystem ecology might have systematically overlooked dynamics and phenomena taking place in the deep soil; our results call for more research attention to this deep frontier in the face of rapid environmental change.

At each terrestrial field site, NEON collected soil at a single, temporary soil pit (i.e., the megapit). The pit was selected to be in the locally dominant soil type and within a few hundred meters of the instrumented NEON tower and soil sensors. At non-permafrost sites the soil pit was 2 m deep or extended to bedrock or other restrictive feature, whichever was shallower. Since soil sensors were placed up to 3 m deep to monitor changes in permafrost at some Alaskan sites, these soil pits were up to 3 m deep (yet note that root sampling only extends to 2 m regardless of pit depth, Supplementary Fig. 2). For each soil pit, 5 classes of measurements and samples were collected: (1) Soil profile description, (2) Photos showing entire soil profile, as well as close-ups of each horizon, (3) Terrestrial-Instrument-System (TIS) soil archive and biogeochemistry samples collection from each horizon, (4) Bulk density sample collection from each horizon, (5) Intact soil block sample collection (≤ 6 per soil pit). The resulting soil physical and chemical properties from these samples (DP1.00096.001), includes data on the soil taxon­omy, horizon names, horizon depths, soil bulk density, coarse fragment content, texture (sand, silt, and clay content), pH, electrical conductivity, and total content of a range of chemical ele­ments in the <2 mm soil fraction for each soil horizon. More detailed methods can be accessed from the official user guide and protocols (https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00096.001).

The megapit described above is sampled once during construction and represents a point in time. Each pit has three vertically oriented sampling profiles up to 2 meters. From the surface to 1 m, a sample of soil is removed for each 10 cm depth increment. From 1 m to 2 m depth, each profile is divided into 20 cm depth increments. Roots are then sorted into two root statuses (alive or dead) and two size classes (coarse roots and fine roots diameter). Root biomass, carbon and nitrogen content, and 13 C and 15 N ratios of roots sampled were analyzed. This root data was available for the majority but not all of the terrestrial NEON sites (44/47). More detailed methods can be accessed from the official user guide and protocols (https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10066.001).

Throughout our analyses, we have focused on the most metabolically active component of the rooting system, the fine roots, due to their central role in water and nutrient uptake15, their fast turnover and thus central role in soil carbon dynamics50,80,81. However, we do need to mention that the NEON terrestrial sites (mega-pit project in particular) used two operational definitions of fine roots: <2 mm and <4 mm. This discrepancy was caused by an accident in how different NEON technicians were using the tools to classify root diameters in the early days of the observatory. According to Supplementary Table 1, there are 30 sites that define fine roots as <2 mm while the other 14 sites use <4 mm as the cutoff. To address this issue, we conducted two side analyses that suggest that our main findings are not sensitive to the discrepancy of fine root definition. Our side analyses are as follows:

First, we analyzed literature data on the correlation between 2 mm and 4 mm root classes. Our analysis (Supplementary Note 1) reveals that biomass calculations based on different cutoffs are in fact highly correlated (R2 > 0.99) such that root biomass based on 2 mm definition (B2mm) can be linearly rescaled to root biomass based on 4 mm definition (B4mm), or vice versa. On average, for each 1 gram of fine root observed using the <2 mm standard, one would observe ~1.3 gram of fine roots if they were to use the <4 mm standard (Supplementary Note 1). And given our main results are based on rescaled relative root biomass, the arbitrary choice of size cutoff should have little to no effect on the results. In fact, our analyses (Supplementary Note S1) suggest the possibility that findings of bimodality in fine roots (<2 mm or <4 mm cutoff) might be extended to other root classes that are harder to sample given their high degree of correlation. Second, we found that our main findings remain unaltered even if we limit our analysis to only include sites with the <2 mm standard (detailed in Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 1).

The mega-pit root biomass dataset included measurements of root biomass and associated root chemical properties at specific depth increments across various sites (1 data point per 10 cm of soil depth for the first meter and per 20 cm in the second meter of soil, in total 15 data points). However, characterization of soil horizons differ across sites. The horizon-based soil property database is about half the spatial resolution of the root biomass database. For example, the site YELL (Yellowstone National Park NEON) has a total of 8 horizons characterized (i.e., 8 data points): A (center depth 2 cm), Bt1 (16.5 cm), Bw (37 cm), Bt2 (56 cm), Btk1 (82.5 cm), Btk2 (112 cm), Btk3 (143.5 cm), Btk4 (180.5 cm), compared to the 15 root samples. In order to more robustly compare these two datasets, we “standardized” the horizon-based soil property database to a depth-based format82. For instance, for a given site, if the depth interval [20-30 cm] falls completely within a single horizon (for example B horizon), then we simply populate the depth interval [20–30 cm] with soil property data from that horizon. However, if the depth interval [20–30 cm] contains a mixture of horizons (for example, 3 cm of A, 5 cm of B, 2 cm of C), we will populate that depth interval with depth-weighted average soil properties based on the specific horizon composition.

We downloaded soil moisture time series from all sites with data ranging between 2018-Sep and 2021-Aug (3 year span). Soil sensor measures soil water content/ion content across a 10 cm vertical measurement zone (5 cm above and below). Sensor depth represents the center of the measurement zone, at 6 cm, 16 cm, 26 cm, 56 cm, 86 cm, 116 cm, 146 cm, 176 cm (exact depth varies across sites, exact depths can be found in our data deposit). To ensure data coverage, multiple soil moisture sensors were installed at each depth across different profiles within each site. Two temporal resolutions were provided from the soil moisture data product: 1 min resolution vs. 30 min. Given plant rooting systems are unlikely to be sensitive to 1min-level soil moisture variation, we used soil moisture sensor data that was averaged at 30 mins (DP1.00094.001)83.

We first selected live fine roots from all profiles across all sites (3 profiles per site) and merged profile level data into a site level mean root biomass density (biomass per volume of soil, hereafter “root biomass”) at each depth. We then translated biomass data (double precision) into frequency of counts (integer) in order to process the modality of biomass depth distribution. Using R package “multimode”, we can derive the number, magnitude, and location of mode/modes in a distribution84,85. Given the root sampling depth is not continuous according to NEON sampling procedure, we used a bandwidth of 15 cm for kernel density estimation such that the algorithm would not pick up each sampling depth as a distinct mode. We also defined a threshold for classifying bimodal distribution: the secondary peak has to be equal or larger to 10% of the magnitude of the primary peak. Increasing this cutoff value will select for sites with more prominent secondary peaks but leaves few sites qualifying. In theory, our approach allows for detection of more than 2 modes, but in practice, a maximum of 2 modes was detected (especially after applying the threshold for mode magnitude). For bimodal distribution, depth locations of each mode and antimode are recorded as (D0, D1, D2) for primary mode, antimode, secondary mode respectively.

We downloaded the NEON field site information table from the official NEON website (https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/explore-field-sites). From this information table, we extracted the following site-level factors for our classification model (detailed in Statistics): (1) ecosystem type, (2) ecoregion, (3) land cover type, (4) elevation, (5) root biomass per profile, (6) mean annual temperature (MAT_C), (7) mean annual precipitation (MAP_mm). We further expanded the site-level climatic features by adding (8) annual temperature range (TempRange), (9) dry season precipitation (PrecipDry), and (10) precipitation seasonality (PrecipSeas) from WorldClim (http://worldclim.org/version286,); (11) aridity index and (12) potential evapotranspiration (PET) from the Global-Aridity/PET geospatial database87. To complement the climatic factors, we compiled a range of site-level edaphic features: (13) sand percentage (PercSand), (14) clay percentage (PercClay), (15) soil taxonomy (SoilTaxo), (16) soil acidity (SoilpH), (17) average cation exchange capacity (SoilCEC), (18) soil carbon content (SoilC) from the Soil Grids (https://soilgrids.org), and (19) soil organic carbon of the top 30 cm (SOC30cm) from the Global Soil Organic Carbon map (GSOCmap1.5, FAO). To approximate the site-level productivity, we used site-level gross primary production to derive (20) the long-term average GPP (GPP, 2000-2016)88. Our random-forest classification model (Statistics section) allowed us to evaluate the feature importance score (Fig. 2) of each site-level factors and their combined predictive power. We sequentially dropped the factors with the smallest importance score until the combined predictive power was maximized. The resulting 12 factors were visualized in Fig. 2 (2 factors) and Supplementary Fig. 4 (the remaining 10 factors).

We devised a profile-level metric ɸ that describes the ratio of property Y(D2) and Y(D1) where D2 identify the depth of secondary root biomass mode, D1 the antimode (D0 for primary mode), and Y denote properties such as root biomass density, soil nutrient content, soil moisture, etc (Fig. 3A, B). For unimodal sites (n = 35) where antimode depth D1 and secondary model depth D2 is not available, we prescribe D1 = 70 cm, D2 = 100 cm that is consistent with the mean value from across all bimodal sites (n = 9).

For root biomass and soil nutrient content that is only sampled once, we derive a single ɸ value per site. For soil moisture data however, we derive a time series of ɸ for soil moisture at each profile within each site. The use of time series (instead one time point) would allow us to examine the entire dynamics of soil moisture instead of just the mean or median, as the root status we observe (at a single time point) might be a response to a past short-period of soil moisture stress or incentive. For each time series, we visualize the full frequency distribution of soil moisture and subsequently calculate a list of distribution metrics: mean, median, max, min, standard deviation, coefficient of variance, 75th quantile, 25th quantile, interquartile range.

The depth resolution of our soil moisture data resolution (roughly, 6 cm, 16 cm, 26 cm, 56 cm, 86 cm, 116 cm, 146 cm, 176 cm) might not be ideal to distinguish D1 and D2 for certain sites. To compensate for this low depth resolution of soil moisture, we additionally examined the soil moisture dynamics of the surface sensor (6 cm) to evaluate whether the presence of bimodality is a result of surface drought.

To calculate relative nutrient concentration in Fig. 4, we first transformed the original nutrient concentration (N, P, K, or Ca) by dividing them using the root biomass density (mg/cm3) across all profiles of all 44 sites. For ease of cross-site comparison, we then rescaled the resulting relative nutrient concentration using relative nutrient concentration at surface depth. The rescaled relative nutrient concentration is thus dimensionless, and the surface soil has an average value 1.

We used the neonUtilities R package89 to access the following NEON data products: Root biomass and chemistry, Megapit (DP1.10066.001)90 and Soil physical and chemical properties, Megapit (DP1.00096.001)91. All NEON datasets used in our analyses are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. We developed a classification model based random forest algorithm (Fig. 2a; R package randomForest). Given the unbalanced nature of our dataset (9 bimodal vs. 35 unimodal sites), we need to make sure that we predict the minority class (bimodal sites) equally well as the majority class (unimodal sites). The default behavior of random forest algorithms will prioritize the prediction accuracy of the majority class (thus maximizing overall accuracy). As a result, we modified the default voting rule such that the algorithm weighs more on the prediction accuracy of the minority class. We next searched the best performing model (highest bimodality prediction accuracy) by finding the best parameter combination across a grid of conditions (num.trees = 500, mtry = 6, min.node.size = 3, sample.fraction = 0.3, seed = 123). The best performing model after removing profile root biomass has the following parameter combination: num.trees = 500, mtry = 6, min.node.size = 3,sample.fraction = 0.3, seed = 123. The feature importance score shown in Fig. 2a is based on mean decrease in Gini coefficient, a measure of out-of-bag cross validated predictions. We sequentially dropped factors with the lowest Gini coefficient (such as temperature range, dry season precipitation, precipitation seasonality, etc.), when trimming the model would enhance the overall performance of the model. We used t-test to examine the feature differences between bimodal and unimodal sites (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 4). We first visualize the distribution of each feature splitted by modality and log10 transforms the data to conform with normality. Then we used the F test to test equal variance between the unimodal and bimodal group to determine the use of Student's (equal variance) or Welch's t-test (unequal variance). We used the χ2 test of independence to test the association between site modality and site vegetation cover (Fig. 2c). Due to the small sample size (N = 44), we used the Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (R base function chisq.test, simulate.p-value = true, 2000 replicates). We used linear regression to fit the relationship between rescaled relative nutrient abundance and depth (Fig. 4a, b). Rescaled relative nutrient abundance is log10 transformed in all regression analyses, consistent with our visualization. All statistical analyses were performed using the R platform (R version 4.0.5).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Complaints About Tariff Evasion Have Jumped 160 Percent Under Trump","https://www.wired.com/story/tariff-evasion-reports-trump-cbp/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

US Customs and Border Protection experienced a sharp rise in reports about potential tariff evasion after President Donald Trump abruptly imposed new duties on over 100 countries earlier this year, according to data the agency shared with WIRED. From March through May, CBP's official e-Allegations tipline received 542 complaints about alleged duty dodging, an almost 160 percent increase from the same three months in 2024.

Importers have long tried to evade tariffs and lower their costs by mislabeling the origin, value, and nature of the products they bring into the country. But the new data suggests that Trump's policies may have pushed more firms to adopt these kinds of legally risky tactics. Over the same recent period, CBP fielded 242 tips about other types of potential violations, such as the import of counterfeit or unsafe items, an increase of just 42 percent. Submissions can be made anonymously, and trade experts say they often come from a company's former employees or competitors.

Trade attorney Jennifer Diaz says her law firm files “tons of e-Allegations” on behalf of clients, and she has found that CBP often does take them seriously. It takes up to half a year for the agency to vet a claim, but the wait can be worth it. When CBP catches wrongdoing, it can “help level the playing field,” says Diaz, including by wiping out artificially low prices from a market.

Whether CBP is equipped to handle the surge in tips is unclear. Congress has yet to finalize legislation known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would increase border staffing and resources for countering smuggling. As of April, CBP was on track to conduct roughly the same number of audits and issue about as many penalties for alleged trade violations as it had in recent years, according to public data.

Last year, a US Department of Treasury inspector general audit report concluded that CBP had not adequately tracked the outcomes of e-Allegations tips and called for new training and oversight measures to be put in place. From October 2018 through September 2020, CBP confirmed 68 out of over 900 duty evasion tips it received, the report found. But out of an estimated $65 million in unpaid duties, CBP did not know how much it ended up collecting. The agency responded that it was already rolling out improvements.

Data on tips and penalties are important because, unless Trump's tariffs are sufficiently enforced, they may fall short of the president's stated goals of increasing revenue and US manufacturing. Some companies also could grow frustrated with his administration if illegal conduct by their competitors goes unpunished. Businesses reluctant to engage in evasion could lose market share to those more willing to gamble as tariffs go up. Violators can face a variety of charges and be on the hook for multiples of the amount they evaded.

CBP spokesperson Trish Driscoll declined to comment on the number of duty evasion investigations happening at US ports and whether they have increased, citing law enforcement sensitivities. In general, she says that the agency uses a combination of “advanced data analytics, risk-based targeting, inspections, audits, investigations, and coordination with government agencies to identify patterns of evasion.”

Since Trump began announcing sweeping new tariffs in February, importers have been filling online forums with questions and advice about tactics that could help them reduce their tariff burdens. Consultants who help importers previously told WIRED that clients have received unsolicited offers from foreign business partners to skirt tariffs using dodgy tactics.

Companies can legally obtain lower tariff rates by shifting their manufacturing operations to other jurisdictions or changing the components, materials, and features of their products. But those maneuvers can be costly. More quick and affordable options, though, may violate the law. They include lying about the price of an item or shipping products to the US through a country subject to lower tariffs. Another common tactic is to misrepresent the type of item being imported on customs declarations, since tariffs can vary by product.

Whistleblowers can earn a reward of up to $250,000 through the e-Allegations program. They can receive higher sums by filing what's known as a qui tam lawsuit under the False Claims Act, though that process includes jumping through extra legal hoops. The lawsuits are initially filed under seal, so it may not be evident for years whether there has been an increase recently, says Gregg Shapiro, an attorney who specializes in the False Claims Act.

Even given the recent increase in tips, many tariff violations may be going unreported, according to trade experts. CBP processes roughly 10 million customs declarations every three months, covering goods with a collective value in the hundreds of billions of dollars. During the seven months from last October through this April, the agency collected about $82 billion in tariffs and related fees. About $14 billion in assessed tariffs stemmed from Trump's new policies, but the total lost to evasion will likely never be known.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Minnesota Shooting Suspect Allegedly Used Data Broker Sites to Find Targets' Addresses","https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-lawmaker-shootings-people-search-data-brokers/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 02:24:10 GMT","

The man who allegedly assassinated a Democratic Minnesota state representative, murdered her husband, and shot a state senator and his wife at their homes in a violent spree early Saturday morning may have gotten their addresses or other personal details from online data broker services, according to court documents.

Suspect Vance Boelter, 57, is accused of shooting Minnesota representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, in their home on Saturday. The couple died from their injuries. Authorities claim the suspect also shot state senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman in their home earlier that night. The pair are currently recovering and are “incredibly lucky to be alive,” according to a statement from their family.

According to an FBI affidavit, police searched the SUV believed to be the suspect's and found notebooks that included handwritten lists of “more than 45 Minnesota state and federal public officials, including Representative Hortman's, whose home address was written next to her name.” According to the same affidavit, one notebook also listed 11 mainstream search platforms for finding people's home addresses and other personal information, like phone numbers and relatives.

The addresses for both lawmakers targeted on Saturday were readily available. Representative Hortman's campaign website listed her home address, while Senator Hoffman's appeared on his legislative webpage, The New York Times reports.

“Boelter stalked his victims like prey,” acting US attorney Joseph Thompson alleged at a press conference on Monday. “He researched his victims and their families. He used the internet and other tools to find their addresses and names, the names of their family members.” Thompson also alleged that the suspect surveilled victims' homes.

The suspect faces several charges of second-degree murder.

Privacy and public safety advocates have long argued that the US should regulate data brokers to guarantee that people have better control over the sensitive information available about them. The US has no comprehensive data privacy legislation, and efforts to regulate data brokers from within federal agencies have largely been quashed.

“The accused Minneapolis assassin allegedly used data brokers as a key part of his plot to track down and murder Democratic lawmakers,” Ron Wyden, the US senator from Oregon, tells WIRED. “Congress doesn't need any more proof that people are being killed based on data for sale to anyone with a credit card. Every single American's safety is at risk until Congress cracks down on this sleazy industry.”

In many cases, basic information like home addresses can be found through public records, including voter registration data (which is public in some states) and political donations data, says Gary Warner, a longtime digital scams researcher and director of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm DarkTower. Anything that isn't readily available through public records is almost always easy to find using popular “people search” services.

“Finding a home address, especially if someone has lived in the same place for many years is trivial,” Warner says. He adds that for “younger people, non-homeowners, and less political people, there are other favorite sites” for finding personal information.

For many in the general public as well as in politics, Saturday's violent crime spree brings new urgency to the long-standing question of how to protect sensitive personal data online.

“These are not the first murders that have been abetted by the data broker industry. But most of the previous targets were relatively unknown victims of stalking and abuse,” alleges Evan Greer, deputy director of the digital rights group Fight for the Future. “Lawmakers need to act before they have more blood on their hands.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","eBay and Vestiaire Collective Want an Exemption from Trump's Tariffs","https://www.wired.com/story/tariffs-secondhand-shopping-china-surprise/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

Last month, Suzanne Smith-Darley felt fantastic. She had just bought a used Chanel handbag from a Japanese seller on eBay for $800—a steal compared to the original asking price of $1,400. About a week later an email arrived that crushed her: DHL was demanding a $142 fee for US tariffs before it would deliver the well-worn medallion tote to Smith-Darley's Atlanta doorstep. “It goes to Japan, has a whole life, and it could be in the trash literally,” she says. “I'm willing to pick it out of the trash, and I get this huge tariff. It's ridiculous.”

Tariffs imposed this year by President Donald Trump have triggered higher prices and decreased selection, and some shoppers have been surprised to learn that the taxes apply to used goods.

Several online marketplaces, including eBay and Vestiaire Collective, have been urging lawmakers and officials in Washington, DC, to exempt used items from import duties, including those recently imposed by President Trump, according to industry executives. “We're still a maturing industry, but we are the future,” says Rachel Kibbe, CEO of American Circular Textiles, an advocacy group that represents about 30 organizations, including Vestiaire Collective, that make, fix, rent, sell, recycle, or resell clothes. “We would just like preferential trade treatment for secondhand imports.”

But a carve-out for used items does not appear to be in the works, according to a person close to the White House who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions. An exemption would likely lead importers to try to pass off new items as used, creating an additional enforcement burden for a government that's already stretched thin by Trump's “government efficiency” efforts.

Historians say used imports, from ancient jewelry to outdated smartphones, have always been subject to US tariffs. They note that the concept of duties on pre-owned wares dates back to at least medieval-era trade. But Trump has applied tariffs to many more countries and raised rates to historically high levels. The combination has prompted people to question the benefits of tariffs and has led to increased calls for reprieves. “We've never had a situation like this before,” says Andrew Wender Cohen, a historian at Syracuse University who studies trade history.

Trump has described his policies as necessary to increase domestic manufacturing, and it's possible to see how, over time, fees that discourage the import of new clothing and gadgets could prompt some companies to shift at least part of their manufacturing to the US. It's far more challenging to envision a payoff from applying those same tariffs to used goods that are destined for new homes instead of landfills.

Cohen says a reasonable approach would be to maintain tariffs on used items but at lower rates that would be commensurate with the risk posed to domestic manufacturing.

Some secondhand items have no alternatives; new versions may not be appealing, or the product may be discontinued. Looking overseas may also be unavoidable for niche items, like trading cards and used handbags. Circular economy advocates contend that reuse, even when it involves an item crossing national borders, still may produce some environmental benefit by cutting waste. “There should be policies that encourage people to choose used items first,” says Liisa Jokinen, founder of the vintage clothing app Gem.

As consumers seek out products that are more sustainable for the environment and their wallets, a new supply chain has emerged. Merchants now refurbish and resell used items such as clothing and electronics, and a growing number of online marketplaces have made it easier for Americans to source these items from almost anywhere in the world.

Earlier this year, eBay's Japanese unit disclosed surging demand for secondhand cameras as people panic-shopped before Trump's tariffs took effect. Worldwide, about 40 percent of eBay's gross sales come from what it calls “pre-loved and refurbished items.”

Previously, imports under $800, whether used or new, were not subject to tariffs. This “de minimis” exemption benefited eBay sellers as well as China-based ultrafast services like Temu and Shein. Trump eliminated the exemption for Chinese goods, contributing to some of the sticker shock buyers have been experiencing.

People accustomed to buying goods such as pre-owned, luxury accessories that are above the de minimis threshold weren't as surprised by the higher fees. Trump, though, has added an additional minimum tariff of 10 percent globally. That's forced people to adapt, whether by accepting higher prices or by getting creative.

Isaac Panzarella, who co-owns the Brooklyn, New York, shop Raleigh Vintage with his wife, says increased shipping costs and greater pressure to source the right items have led the couple to visit Europe more frequently, personally selecting merchandise to stock their racks. He believes there should be an exemption for items older than say, 20 years, making them free from tariffs. “At that point, it's not really displacing production or jobs in the US,” he says. “If anything, we're creating jobs.”

Having tariffs on used items has arguably benefitted the US economy during certain periods. Scott Reynolds Nelson, a historian at the University of Georgia, says that in the early 1800s, the US imposed high tariffs on used military surplus items including woolen jackets and metal pots and pans from the UK. Cheap imports had been hurting US merchants, he says. “There is a good reason for taxing things that are used if there is some necessary industry to protect,” he explains.

In the end, the eBay shopper Smith-Darley paid the tariffs for her coveted Chanel bag, which she believes was made in Italy, rather than requesting a return that could have left her bagless and out $800. But this week, Smith-Darley says she learned that DHL had failed to hold her package while she was out of town and that it will be sent back to Japan. It's unclear what refunds, if any, she might receive. DHL didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. “This is a nightmare,” Smith-Darley says.

In a way, the tariffs may be working as intended. Vestiaire Collective is nudging US shoppers to select used options from domestic sellers, and customers are buying them up, says US CEO Samina Virk. Smith-Darley, for her part, isn't slowing down her hunt for vintage goods—she's just making sure the ones she buys are sourced from the US. “I just walked in there like an idiot before,” she says. “I'm much more careful now.”

The Switch 2 isn't like other consoles. If you were meant to take your Xbox Series X (7/10, WIRED Review) to the park, you'd probably need a very strange-looking backpack. For the Switch 2, portability isn't just a feature, it's a key selling point. With that in mind, there are two paths you can take to outfit your console for adventure, based on how you play.

If your Switch 2 will spend most of its life in the dock or in your hands on the couch, I'd recommend an attachable grip case. Like your phone case, these clamp onto the console and Joy-Cons, providing a minor shield for bumps and bruises. They often add extra features like ergonomic grips, while still allowing access to commonly used ports.

On the other hand, if you're a world traveler planning to take your Switch 2 on every flight, train ride, or road trip, I'd opt for a classic carrying case. These hold your console and games and usually have extra room for cables or adapters. You can toss these into your bag while packing up for a trip and know your console will make it safely to your destination.

Joy-Con Grips

One of the recurring complaints about the original Switch, at least for me, is that the Joy-Cons are super slim and not very ergonomic. Especially for folks with bigger hands, the Pro Controller made for a much better option. For handheld play, extra attachments became increasingly common further into the console's life, adding extra bulk and more traditional rounded grips to the Joy-Cons.

Because the Joy-Cons are still flat on the back, many manufacturers have gone ahead and built these into cases right from the jump. This is, to me, one of the main draws of adding a case to your Switch 2, especially if you plan on playing primarily in handheld mode.

Screen Protectors

Unfortunately, you need a screen protector for your Switch 2, thanks to the built-in plastic cover that will likely scratch and scuff over time. In general, I'd recommend buying one from the same brand that you get your case or grip from, if they sell one. You'll avoid any issues with sizing or compatibility, and almost every accessory maker on this list offers some kind of discount if you buy them as a bundle, not to mention saving on shipping.

There are still a few factors to take into consideration. Some dedicated manufacturers offer different finishes for specific situations, and applicators are also becoming more common, which help make sure everything is smooth and lined up correctly.

The Kickstand

One of the major upgrades Nintendo made for the Switch 2 is a new kickstand. It runs the width of the console, with two firm hinges, and it's a massive improvement for playing on the go. Unfortunately, none of the case makers could figure out what to do with it, which is understandable. There's no clear attachment point, so most cases included double-sided tape and a kickstand-shaped chunk of plastic you could just stick to the back.

I'd be more worried about lining it up wrong or potentially breaking the kickstand if you tried to remove it for some reason than I would about a slight gap on the back of the case. Because I had to swap through a bunch of cases, I generally skipped this step, and in almost all cases, the extra piece is only cosmetic. Instead, I briefly tested the included strips of adhesive on a single spot on the back of my Switch, just to make sure they didn't leave any obvious residue.

dbrand

dbrand

I've had a chance to check out a variety of grip cases and bumpers of various sizes and weights, and the dbrand Killswitch 2 is the one I'll be using on my console.

The unique texture on the outside is almost sticky without being uncomfortable, and it makes me feel confident carrying my brand-new $450 console around the house. It's the same finish and material found on the dbrand Grip, our favorite Pixel 9 case, and it works here just as well. The Killswitch 2 builds chunky, comfortable Joy-Con grips right into the case, which makes the console instantly more comfortable to play in handheld mode.

Every Killswitch 2 includes a dock adapter, which cleverly slots into the official dock so you don't have to take the case off. Because it won't fit into most cases with the extra bulk, you can also buy a sturdy plastic lid that clamps around the front and protects the screen, while also holding up to 10 cartridges. I don't think I'd pack it in a suitcase like that, but I'll toss it in my backpack with other junk and go for a bike ride without worrying about it.

Belkin

Amazon

Belkin

For a more traditional option, I'd go with Belkin's Charging Case. As the name implies, there's a battery pack that slides into its own compartment in the bottom of the case, with a short right-angle cable that fits perfectly into the console's lower charging port. I really appreciate the thoughtful design here, with little touches like a hidden Airtag compartment, and a kickstand groove so you can play in tabletop mode while still charging.

The inside feels soft and cozy, and the outside is rigid enough that I'd feel comfortable packing it up in my carry-on. There's room for games, extra cables, and there was even enough extra space inside that some of the smaller joy-con grips, like the Spigen Nano Pop, can stay on. The bonus compartment has room for my headphone pick, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds. This is the kit I'd pack up for flying or a road trip, where I might be away from outlets and navigating busy areas, but usually parked in one spot while I actually play.

SteelSeries

Amazon

Best Buy

SteelSeries

While you could certainly opt for any number of bulky over-ear gaming headsets, I think the Switch 2's portable nature pairs perfectly with the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The slim adapter plugs right into the console's USB-C port for low-latency 2.4GHz audio, and the SteelSeries app has equalizer profiles for Switch games that help improve the already impressive sound quality.

I also found they fit right into the extra compartment on the Belkin Charging Case, which helps turn that compact carrying case into a fully-equipped portable gaming station. These are way easier to carry around than any over-ear option, super comfortable, and a natural companion for making sure you hear that blue shell coming, even on a full flight.

Spigen

Amazon

For an attachable grip case that's a bit slimmer than our primary pick, Spigen's Nano Pop case provides light protection from bumps and scratches. It also includes Joy-Con grips which add just a little bit of extra bulk to the controllers, making them more comfortable for handheld play without limiting your other case options as much. They come in a variety of fun colors too, which adds a little pop to the Switch 2's more serious face.

It technically fits into the official dock, but it's a tight squeeze, and you'll need to carefully situate everything to get it seated, although it fits in the Belkin Charging Case just fine. I think these are a great option for someone who rarely plays docked, but still wants some extra ergonomic benefits and a shell for minor scratches. My only minor complaint here is that quite a few pieces of double-sided tape were involved in the installation.

Spigen

Amazon

It's generally worth buying a screen protector from the same manufacturer where you get your case. Most of the brands mentioned above will offer a discount or bundle if you buy them together, and you'll avoid any fit or compatibility issues. I didn't find any of the options compelling enough over the others to warrant going out of my way to find it.

That said, the Spigen Glas.tR EZ Fit had an easy application process and went on perfectly straight, and after that I forgot it was there. I appreciate the inclusion of a proper cleaning wipe, which I find does a better job preventing dust or particles from getting stuck underneath than just a basic microfiber. You get a two pack for $25, so you can share with a friend, or keep one on ice in case the unthinkable happens.

SanDisk

Amazon

The Switch 2 has 256GB of internal storage, but games are getting bigger in a hurry, so it's likely you'll need to add more before you know it. The MicroSD card from your old Switch won't work, however, so you'll need to pick up a new MicroSD Express card. I wrote up a guide explaining the new standard and its benefits, and in a quick game transfer, the SanDisk was slightly faster. I recommend at least 256GB, since you only have one slot.

Samsung

Amazon

Walmart

Best Buy

Our favorite gaming TV, the Samsung S90D QD-OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends), has a great feature set that takes advantage of the Switch 2's improved video capabilities. It supports resolutions up to 4K and up to 120Hz refresh rate and Dolby Vision HDR, so there's plenty of headroom over the console's primary settings. QD-OLED panels are my favorite for gaming, with incredible colors and black levels that video games are naturally equipped to utilize.

Nintendo

Nintendo

At the moment, if you need an extra dock, you'll have to go with the official Nintendo option. I've tried a few USB-C hubs, and while some charged the system, none of them were able to output video. The good news is that the official dock from Nintendo is noticeably wider and less tippable than the Switch 1 version, and it's easier to get plugged in.

The bad news is that the only place to buy a replacement or additional dock is currently directly from Nintendo, and you'll likely need to log in to your qualified Nintendo account. It costs $120, which feels pretty steep for a charger, HDMI cable, and chunk of plastic.

Spigen Rugged Armor ($30):  This molded grip case has heavy bumpers and thick Joy-Con grips, but it was tough to remove, which you'll have to do a lot because it won't fit in the dock with the case on, and you can't separate the Joy-Cons either. This would be a good case if you're buying the console for a younger kid who you don't trust to treat it gently.

Belkin TemperedGlass Screen Protector with Blue Light Filter ($30): While I liked the look of this screen protector, and the blue light filter is great for late night gaming sessions, the lackluster applicator frame isn't quite as nice as the other options. It's also a bit expensive, at $30 for just one.

dbrand Prism 2.0 ($35): I liked the Prism 2.0 screen protectors and their application process as much as the Spigen option. Unfortunately they're slightly more expensive and only available directly from dbrand, so if you buy them on their own you'll have to pay shipping. If you're buying anything else, like a case or a skin, you'll get a discount and likely qualify for free shipping, making these well worth it.

If you're looking to buy a mattress, I don't need to tell you the research process is complex. To assist with that, we have a whole guide that lays out (no pun intended … OK, partially intended) where to begin. But for now, I'm going to walk through the various types of mattress materials. My hope is that by the time you finish reading this, you'll have a better idea of what kind of mattress you're looking for, which will make your final decision that much easier.

To put your mind at ease, let me walk you through my credentials: I'm a certified Sleep Science coach and mattress tester of over five years. I can dissect a mattress blueprint faster than pouring your morning cup of coffee, I've perfected my unboxing form (because mattresses are heavy), and I can recite the manufacturing process of major mattress materials at any given moment. It's a fun party trick, but it makes me what I like to think of as the final boss of mattress testing. My teammates also know their stuff (we sleep on mattresses we test for a week or more, then report back on our findings), which helped us compile this list of the best mattresses of 2025.

So, back to picking a type of mattress: Despite the popularity of mattresses in a box and the image they project in our heads, it's so much more than a rectangular piece of foam you sleep on. There are four main types of mattresses: innerspring, hybrid, memory foam, and latex. To help me explain these materials even more, I asked John Merwin, CEO of 3Z Brands (parent company of Helix, Birch, Bear, Nolah, and Leesa) and founder of Brooklyn Bedding, to weigh in as well.

Truth be told, this is more of a history lesson than a type of mattress you want to shop for (unless you really love this kind of mattress; to each their own). “Traditional” innerspring mattresses are the firm-feeling beds you probably have early memories of, given that the makeup is just innerspring coils wrapped in a cover. It's just as squeaky as you probably remember, too, as the coil type used involves connecting each and every coil to work as one unit.

These are Bonnell coils, and they connect both laterally and vertically. All to say, when you lie down and your weight is pressed into the mattress, all those coils act as “one for all and all for one” and simultaneously compress down. It's not going to work wonders for pressure relief like modern hybrids will, but it is highly responsive, which means it'll pop back into its original shape as you move around. So if you're a sleeper who moves around between sleeping positions, coils are a good feature to have, so you're getting near-instantaneous support.

Why aren't traditional coils in the works with mattresses nowadays? According to Merwin, upgraded pocketed coils far outperform traditional ones.

“Unlike traditional coils that are wired together and move as a unit, pocketed coils are encased individually, which allows each coil to respond independently to movement and pressure,"" he said. ""This design minimizes motion transfer, so when one person moves or gets out of bed, their partner feels far less disruption. It also provides more targeted support, contouring to the body in a way that improves spinal alignment and overall comfort.” While you can still find innerspring mattresses with traditional coils out there, they're typically getting phased out in favor of hybrids. Truth be told, I've only tested less than a handful of them over the years. If you're dead set on this mattress type, all power to you, and have fun on your personal mattress treasure hunt.

Traditional coil mattresses have evolved into hybrids, which is what you will likely encounter on today's mattress market (aside from latex and foam options). Hybrid mattresses are highly customizable, allowing you to pick and choose what you want in your bed, whether that's a combination of foam and coils, latex and coils, or even a mix of the three. Many mattress reviews will use the phrase “best of both worlds” to describe hybrids, as this mattress lets you sample the design aspects of the materials involved. You can get the pressure relief you need from memory foam or latex on top, but ample support from the coil core (not to mention the aforementioned responsiveness from coil inclusion).

Nolah

Speaking of coils and harking back to traditional mattress design, the type of coil used in hybrid mattresses matters too, as it improves upon the design of the Bonnell coil. The keywords to look for are “pocketed coils” or “individually wrapped coils,” which make up the main support mechanism of a mattress. Instead of being interconnected, each coil stays in its own lane (pocket, really) and will compress uninhibited by the other coils around it. In other words, where there is more weight, the bed will feel firmer.

This is especially applicable for areas where body weight is centralized when you're lying down, particularly around the hips and shoulders. Pocketed coils are also meant to outperform traditional ones in the motion isolation arena, meaning that when you move around, the individual coil takes the heat motion-wise and stops the bed from reenacting a small earthquake. With the interconnectivity of traditional coils, it doesn't take much for the feeling of movement to travel along the entire surface of the bed.

Fun fact: You do not need a box spring with a hybrid mattress. This is a recurring question I see, and pocketed coils in hybrids eliminate the need for one. Box springs were designed to give more support and elevate performance to traditional coil beds, which would align certain sections of coils to yield more support. Nowadays, you may actually void your warranty if you use a box spring with a hybrid mattress—be sure to check that fine print.

We actually have NASA to thank for this one. If you google images of those early space missions, it's no wonder that something was needed to keep astronauts from being jostled around inside rockets; hence, memory foam was born. It's evolved quite a bit from those initial iterations, especially when Tempur-Pedic came onto the scene in the '80s with a vision for it to become the basis of sleep products. Today, memory foam stands in a league of its own when it comes to the unique, compressive feel.

Memory foam is more of an umbrella term for all the iterations mattress brands have come up with today, but let's refer to the mattress manufacturing expert for this one.

""Memory foam is produced by combining liquid polyurethane with various chemicals, like polyols and isocyanates, to enhance its viscosity and density,"" says Merwin. Without whipping out the periodic table of elements and giving you a science lesson in the chemical components of this material, here's the need-to-know: These compounds form a malleable foam that holds teeny-tiny bubbles within it. How it works is, as you lie on it, your body imparts heat onto the surface, flowing into these air pockets, which in turn allows it to become softer to contour around your body.

But for the science enthusiasts reading this, Merwin's got you covered: “The key ingredient is a polymer that creates an open-cell structure, which allows the material to respond to heat and pressure. This is what gives memory foam its signature contouring or ‘hugging' feel. During the manufacturing process, the liquid foam mixture is poured onto a moving line, where it expands and solidifies into large foam blocks, which we call ‘buns.' At a high level, it's a blend of chemistry and precision that transforms raw materials into a high-quality product.”

To say it's a natural fit for those who need pressure relief from their mattress may be a bit too on the nose, but it's arguably the most standout feature of this material. It also lessens the feeling of movement for the most restless of sleepers, which also makes it an attractive option for couples. Arguably, the biggest issue that plagues memory foam is heat retention, since once the heat has entered into these air chambers, it turns into something akin to microscopic saunas that can make the overall mattress into a nightmare for those who sleep warm. This is where the various iterations of foam come into play, as some brands infuse elements like graphite, copper, gel, or more advanced cooling technology like phase-change materials into the foams that they use.

The same stuff that goes into tires, balloons, and sports equipment can also be used for mattresses—and it's the good stuff, too. Latex acts similarly to memory foam when it comes to pressure relief, but is far more reactive to you moving around. Think of a rubber band snapping back into shape when released; it's pretty dang close to that. Many brands rely on organic rubber sap to create latex as we know it, and there are two categories of latex foam you'll usually find with mattresses: Dunlop and Talalay. These names refer to the production process and resulting product, as liquid rubber is poured into molds, torched at high temperatures (called “vulcanization” and yes, I have to resist doing Spock's “live long and prosper” hand signal every time), and flash-frozen to retain the feel. Dunlop is a firmer latex foam, and hence, firmer feel. Talalay yields a more plush feel. Latex is generally pretty even-keeled when it comes to temperature, too, keeping heat from accumulating within your mattress to maintain a nice, room-temperature feel.

Congratulations, if you made it to this part of this article, you've passed your mattress type crash course. Hopefully, it's a bit less overwhelming to kick off your mattress research when you better understand what each product actually is. And to further your mattress education, we are actively testing beds to put into our mattress guides. These picks are not only what material works in what instance, but specific models we've tested that best exemplify what the material has to offer.

There is always the option to try these mattress types in person to better discern what the bounciness of latex feels like, or the pressure relief of memory foam. But if you aren't all for a field trip to the mattress store, online brands offer sleep trials so that you can comfortably try out their products without leaving your house. Now comes the next part of our course: becoming a mattress tester yourself!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Nissan Leaf Is Back and Looking to Make Up Lost Ground","https://www.wired.com/story/the-nissan-leaf-is-back-and-looking-to-make-up-lost-ground/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Finally, after 15 years, we have a new 2026 Nissan Leaf coming. As befits the “truckification” of global car markets, it's no longer a compact hatchback. Now it's a compact SUV—or, more accurately, a crossover utility vehicle built on passenger-vehicle underpinnings.

The new Leaf will offer a range of up to 303 miles, Nissan says, from a 75-kilowatt-hour battery pack powering a 160-kilowatt (214-horsepower) motor that produces 261 pound-feet (354 newton-meters) of torque. That motor drives the front wheels, but despite its tall, utility appearance, all-wheel-drive isn't on the table.

The 2026 Leaf can charge at up to 150 kW via a North American Charging Standard port on the right-front fender, with fast-charging from 10 to 80 percent of battery capacity in 35 minutes under ideal conditions. Drivers will benefit from the standard Plug & Charge protocol that lets them plug in the car and walk away, with validation and billing handled automatically, at capable charging networks. Notably, the AC charging port with a J-1772 socket is on the left-front fender; dual charge ports remain uncommon outside higher-end models like the Porsche Taycan.

Stylistically, the Leaf resembles a smaller Nissan Ariya—the brand's larger EV crossover. The new Leaf, however, is sleeker—Nissan quotes a drag coefficient of 0.26, down from the prior Leaf's 0.29 and the Ariya's 0.297—and uses such drag-reducing features as the company's first powered, flush-fitting front door handles (the rears are scooped out of the roof pillar behind the rear doors). The very high tail provides a large cargo area, at up to 55.5 cubic feet (1.6 cubic meters) behind the rear seats.

Depending on trim level, the 2026 Leaf comes with 18- or 19-inch wheels, though the smaller wheels may produce slightly higher range ratings. A heat pump is standard for cabin heating; Nissan notes the Leaf now captures waste heat from both the power electronics during charging and the drive motor, using it to warm the battery to its optimal operating temperature.

Inside, most models use dual 14.3-inch displays mounted side-by-side on a flat dash tray, à la any number of Hyundai EVs. Google Maps and Google Assistant are built into the dash, and, as with many new EVs, Maps will recommend charging stops on routes that exceed the car's range. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay phone mirroring remains available, both wirelessly and wired, with available options including an electrically dimming panoramic glass moon roof, and a battery heater, to warm the battery in winter while the car is still plugged in.

Sometime after the 2026 Leaf goes on sale in a variety of trim levels, Nissan also plans to offer a basic Leaf S version with a smaller 52-kWh battery and a 130-kW (174-hp) motor. No range was projected for this configuration, however.

It's important to recall that in December 2010, when the first US Leaf was delivered to a paying customer, there were just three cars for sale in the US market with plugs: the Tesla Roadster, a crudely-built $100,000 two-seat roadster; the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, a concept virtually no salesperson could cogently explain to shoppers; and the Leaf. The Tesla Model S wouldn't struggle into production for more than 18 months.

Taking perhaps the wrong lesson from the unexpected sales success of the 2004 Toyota Prius hybrid, its designers gave the Leaf a design like no other car on the road. It was all curves, with a beveled nose, swept-back headlights, and almost a bustle on its rounded hatchback rear. “Weird” was the general consensus.

Still, even with only 74 miles of range, it was at least semi-affordable, at around $40,000. And in the following 15 years, Nissan would go on to sell more than 650,000 Leafs globally, with 150,000 of those in the US. But low range and weird looks proved not to be an appealing combination, even if affordable—and the sleek lines, startling acceleration, and 200-plus-mile range of every Tesla Model S soon outgunned the modest little Leaf.

Worse, the Leaf's Achilles' heel turned out to be the cost-saving decision by powertrain engineers to forego active thermal conditioning for its battery—meaning the pack had no liquid cooling or heating. That worked adequately in most circumstances. But a small number of Leaf drivers in places like Arizona, where pavement temperature just 6.3 inches below the battery can reach 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius), found their batteries losing capacity within months, or failing outright.

Overall, according to owner-provided telematics data from battery-health firm Recurrent, 2011 to 2016 Leafs did significantly worse in retaining battery range than the next high-volume EV to hit the market, the Tesla Model S. The average Leaf from that period, says Recurrent, retained only 83 percent of its battery range—versus almost 93 percent for the average Model S. (For what it's worth, the Leaf still bested the BMW i3, which had an even worse 78 percent.) Recurrent notes any EVs whose batteries were replaced are not called out, nor are any EVs whose batteries died completely and were then scrapped.

For the 2026 Nissan Leaf and the 2023 Ariya before it, Nissan learned its lesson. The new Leaf's battery pack is liquid-cooled; Arizona EV drivers can rest easy.

The first-generation Leaf has had a staggering 15-year model life, albeit with one major redesign in 2018 to make it less odd-looking—which succeeded, as it now largely resembles every other small Nissan. Over that time, battery capacity grew from 24 to 62 kilowatt-hours in various iterations. An EV launched with a 74-mile range was EPA-rated as high as 212 miles for the Leaf Plus model. US production began in 2013, though it's expected to wind down this year.

Former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn was an early champion of EVs. He was also, however, a relentless cost-cutter, and he axed multiple proposed new EV models, intending that the Leaf first show that EVs could be profitable. Every Leaf sold for many years likely lost more money for the company; instant profitability is a tall order for any new technology. Toyota has acknowledged it lost money for almost 10 years on its first two generations of Prius.

Ghosn was arrested and jailed in Japan for financial misconduct in 2018, then fled the country to Lebanon while on house arrest. Nissan has never regained its footing. EVs were not, frankly, its biggest problem. And that's where we remain today, with Nissan now planning to close assembly plants, slash jobs, and retrench for survival following a failed Honda merger.

Over those 15 years, Nissan utterly squandered its first-mover advantage. Could it have taken lessons from Tesla, and launched a more stylish, longer-range EV to establish a range of electric-car options? It could have … but it didn't. With close to 100 separate EV models on sale in the US today, the Leaf faces tough competitors from around the globe—if not yet China. The new Leaf will compete with a score of smaller, front-wheel-drive crossovers from Hyundai, Kia, Chevrolet, Volkswagen, and others. We'll wait for a first drive to see how it stacks up.

Very likely, the 2026 Nissan Leaf will likely be a competent, efficient smaller EV crossover. But it's hard not to think what might have been if Nissan had stayed the course.

Elon Musk's startup xAI is trying to raise a $4.3 billion equity investment, according to a report from Bloomberg. This equity funding would be in addition to the $5 billion that Musk is allegedly trying to raise in debt funding for the combined entity of X and xAI.

The company appears to be raising money again after landing a $6 billion cash infusion in December, because it has already spent much of its money.

xAI makes Grok, the AI chatbot that's embedded inside the social network X, as well as the image generator Aurora. The technology that powers these products is notoriously resource-intensive, which could be contributing to the rate at which the company is spending money.

Adobe has been on a quest to attract users to its platform for their AI needs. The company in April launched a redesigned Firefly web app that lets users use Adobe's own Firefly image- and video-generation models as well as third-party models. 

Now, it is releasing a Firefly app on both iOS and Android that lets people use all of its models as well as models from OpenAI (GPT image generation), Google (Imagen 3 and Veo 2), and Flux (Flux 1.1 Pro).

Like the web app, the new smartphone apps let you use prompts to generate images or videos or convert images into videos. You can also edit certain parts of images using generative fill or expand an image with generative expand. Adobe Creative Cloud subscribers can start a project on the Firefly mobile app and store it in the cloud to access it through the web or desktop app.

The company is now also supporting more third-party models, including Flux.1 Kontext by Black Forest Labs, Ideogram 3.0 by Ideogram, and Gen-4 Image by Runway.

The company is also updating Firefly Boards, its collaborative whiteboarding tool, with the ability to generate videos. Canvas lets users generate videos with Adobe's own video models as well as those made by its competitors.

Adobe said users have so far created more than 24 billion media assets with its Firefly models, and that its AI features have been a big factor in increasing the number of first-time subscribers 30% quarter-over-quarter.

Social networks are bolstering their terms of service against scrapers and bots that crawl the website to train AI models. Days after Elon Musk-owned X updated its terms to explicitly prohibit AI model training, decentralized social network Mastodon today updated its own rules to bar any kind of model training, as well. 

“We explicitly prohibit the scraping of user data for unauthorized purposes, e.g. archival or large language model (LLM) training. We want to make it clear that training LLMs on the data of Mastodon users on our instances is not permitted,” Mastodon said in an email sent to users. 

The new terms, which will be applicable to the social network starting July 1, have legal language that prohibits any data extraction and development of an automated system.

“Use, launch, develop, or distribute any automated system, including without limitation, any spider, robot, cheat utility, scraper, offline reader, or any data mining or similar data gathering extraction tools to access the Instance, except in each case as may be the result of standard search engine or Internet browser and local caching or for human review and interaction with Content on the Instance,” the terms note. 

It's important to note that these terms apply only to Mastodon.social server, which is only one of the instances on the fediverse, a distributed network. This means scrapers could still extract data from other servers and use that to train AI models if they don't explicitly bar that in their terms of service.

Other platforms, including OpenAI, Reddit, and The Browser Company, have added similar clauses to their rules to prevent other companies from training models.

Apart from this change, Mastodon is also enforcing a new age limit of 16 for users. The social network had an age limit of 13 for users in the U.S., but it is changing the age limit globally.

Walk around a big city like New York or Amsterdam long enough and you're bound to notice something: tiny four-wheeled cargo carriers zipping down bike lanes.

These battery-assisted vehicles, often called e-quads, are distinct from cargo e-bikes, which tend to be geared toward households. E-quads are larger and sport enclosed cargo holds, making them a darling of delivery companies, including Amazon and UPS, allowing them to sidestep congestion that bogs down regular box trucks.

Now, Honda is offering its own take on the vehicle type, the Fastport eQuad. 

The eQuad comes in two sizes built on the same basic platform, small and large. Both are smaller than the smallest Mini Cooper, but can carry between 320 to 650 pounds. They have pedals, and their top speed is limited to 12 mph (20 kph), both requirements to keep them bike-lane legal.

To keep the eQuad trucking, Honda is using its Mobile Power Pack batteries. The 22-pound batteries can be swapped for a fresh pack much like Gogoro or Zeno. By grabbing the built-in handle, drivers (or riders?) can drop them into a caddy located just behind and below the cockpit.

Inside the cockpit, drivers have the usual bike seat, pedals, and windscreen. A display helps the driver stay on route. Based on the number of mentions in the press release, Honda really wants this to be considered a software-defined vehicle, which it says will unlock “continuous value and improvements over the vehicle's lifetime,” though it doesn't specify what those are.

U.S.-bound eQuads will be built at the Honda Performance Manufacturing Center in Ohio. For the craftspeople who work there, the trundling eQuad will be a very different assignment. Previously, they were best known for hand assembling the second-generation Acura NSX, a 500-plus horsepower supercar capable of 191 mph.

Food distribution giant United Natural Foods (UNFI) said it is making “significant progress” in recovering from a cyberattack that occurred almost two weeks ago, as grocery stores across North America reliant on the distributor continue to report food shortages.

UNFI said in an update on Sunday that it was restoring its electronic ordering systems, which its customers use to place orders for their grocery stores and supermarkets.

The company, which provides more than 30,000 stores across the United States and Canada with fresh produce and other products, was hit by a cyberattack on June 5, which the company disclosed several days later. 

UNFI has not yet described the nature of the cyberattack, though it told investors last week that it had shut down its entire network to contain the incident. The ongoing outage is preventing the company from fulfilling and distributing customer orders at scale.

One of the largest grocers affected is Whole Foods, which relies on UNFI as its “primary distributor.” Several Whole Foods stores, including one visited by TechCrunch last week and others in the New York area, are experiencing shelf shortages amid the UNFI outages. One employee at a Whole Foods in California told TechCrunch about the supply issues at their store, saying they had not seen some products for days. 

Whole Foods previously told TechCrunch that it was working to restore its shelves “as quickly as possible,” but did not say when shipments would return to normal.

People working at local grocery stores and big-chain supermarkets alike have told TechCrunch that they continue to experience disruption of varying degrees. Some said that other distributors are providing some supplies, while others are still reporting issues with ordering products from UNFI. 

The outages are also affecting grocery stores run by the U.S. Defense Department for active duty personnel and retired veterans. One employee at a grocery store run by the Defense Commissary Agency said they were seeing empty shelves and delayed shipments.

Kevin Robinson, a spokesperson for the Defense Commissary Agency, confirmed the UNFI cyberattack was affecting dozens of its stores.

“This incident has affected deliveries across multiple grocery chains, including 53 Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) stores,” said Robinson. “The DeCA supply chain team has worked closely with UNFI to implement manual workarounds that have effectively minimized in-store disruptions.”

UNFI has not yet provided a timeline for recovery.

This story was first published on June 16, and updated June 17 with details from the U.S. Defense Department.

All of a sudden one day, I was cut off from all my music, by the creators of the iPod!I switched away from Apple Music and will never return. 15 years of extensive usage of iTunes, and now I will never trust Apple with my music needs again. I'm sure they don't care, or consider the move a good tradeoff for their user base, but it's the most user hostile thing I've ever experienced in two decades on Apple platforms.

I couldn't be bothered to spend time manually selecting stuff to download back then.  It was offensive to even ask that spend 30 minutes manually correcting a completely unnecessary mistake on their part. And this was during a really really bad time in interface, with the flat ui idiocy all the rage, and when people were abandoning all UI standards that gave any affordances at all.If I'm going to go and correct Apple's mistake, I may as well switch to another vendor and do it. Which is what I did. I'm now on Spotify to this day, even though it has many of the problems as Appple Music. At least Spotify had fewer bugs at the time, and they hadn't deleted music off my device.Good riddance and I'll never go back to Apple Music.

I can (and do) find things around the house that don't depend on a screen, but it's annoying to know that I don't really have much of a backup way to access the internet if the power is out for an extended period of time. (Short of plunking down for an inverter generator or UPS I suppose.)

Turns out, it's really tough to do accurately. The main reason is that the public datasets are a mess. For example, the internet availability data is in neat hexagons, while the census demographic data is in weird, irregular shapes that don't line up. Trying to merge them is a nightmare and you lose a ton of detail.So our main takeaway, rather than just being a pretty map, was that our public data is too broken to even see the problem clearly.I wrote up our experience here if anyone's curious: https://zeinh.ca/projects/mapping-digital-divide/

I think in so many fields the datasets are by far the highest impact thing someone can work on, even if it seems a bit mundane and boring. Basically every field I've worked in struggles for need of reliable, well maintained and open access data, and when they do get it, it usually sets off a massive amount of related work (Seen this happen in genetics, ML of course once we got ImageNet and also started getting social media text instead of just old newspaper corpuses).That would definitely be advice I'd give to many people searching for a project in a field -- high quality data is the bedrock infrastructure for basically all projects in academic and corporate research, so if you provide the data, you will have a major impact, pretty much guaranteed.

So anyways, I bring this up with my local government in Chicago and they recommend that I switch to AT&T Fiber because it's listed as available at my address in the FCC's database. Well, I would love to do that except that1. The FCC's database was wrong and rejected my corrections multiple times before AT&T finally ran fiber to my building this year (only 7 years after they claimed that it was available in the database despite refusing to connect to the building whenever we tried).2. Now that it is in the building, their Fiber ISP service can't figure out that my address exists and has existing copper telephone lines run to it by AT&T themselves so their system cannot sell me the service. I've been arguing with them for 3 months on this and have even sent them pictures of their own demarc and the existing copper lines to my unit.3. Even if they fixed the 1st issue, they coded my address as being on a different street than its mailing address and can't figure out how to sell me a consumer internet plan with this mismatch. They could sell me a business internet plan at 5x the price though.And that's just my personal issues. And I haven't even touched on how not every cell phone is equally reliable, how the switch to 5G has made many cell phones less reliable compared to 3G and 4G networks, how some people live next to live event venues where they can have great mobile connections 70% of the time but the other 30% of the time it becomes borderline unusable, etc.

It's really eye-opening to set up something like toxiproxy, configure bandwidth limitations, latency variability, and packet loss in it, and run your app, or your site, or your API endpoints over it. You notice all kinds of UI freezing, lack of placeholders, gratuitously large images, lack of / inadequate configuration of retries, etc.

You can easily see this when using WiFi aboard a flight, where latency is around 600 msec at minimum (most airlines use geostationary satellites, NGSO for airline use isn't quite there yet). There is so much stuff that happens serially in back-and-forth client-server communication in modern web apps. The developer sitting in SF with a sub-10 ms latency to their development instance on AWS doesn't notice this, but it's sure as as heck noticeable when the round trip is 60x that. Obviously, some exchanges have to be serial, but there is a lot of room for optimization and batching that just gets left on the floor.It's really useful to use some sort of network emulation tool like tc-netem as part of basic usability testing. Establish a few baseline cases (slow link, high packet loss, high latency, etc) and see how usable your service is. Fixing it so it's better in these cases will make it better for everyone else too.

Just a warning about the screenshot he's referencing here: the slice of map that he shows is of the western half of the US, which includes a lot of BLM land and other federal property where literally no one lives [0], which makes the map look a lot sparser in rural areas than it is in practice for humans on the ground. If you look instead at the Midwest on this map you'll see pretty decent coverage even in most rural areas.The weakest coverage for actually-inhabited rural areas seems to be the South and Appalachia.[0] https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/US_feder...

This often fails in all sorts of ways:* The client treats timeout as end-of-file, and thinks the resource is complete even though it isn't. This can be very difficult for the user to fix, except as a side-effect of other breakages.* The client correctly detects the truncation, but either it or the server are incapable of range-based downloads and try to download the whole thing from scratch, which is likely to eventually fail again unless you're really lucky.* Various problems with automatic refreshing.* The client's only (working) option is ""full page refresh"", and that re-fetches all resources including those that should have been cached.* There's some kind of evil proxy returning completely bogus content. Thankfully less common on the client end in a modern HTTPS world, but there are several ways this can still happen in various contexts.

- Depending on your product or use case, somewhere between a majority and a vast majority of your users will be using your product from a mobile device. Throughput and latency can be extremely high, but also highly variable over time. You might be able to squeeze 30Mbps and 200ms pings for one request and then face 2Mbps and 4000ms pings seconds later.- WiFi generally sucks for most people. The fact that they have a 100Mbps/20Mbps terrestrial link doesn't mean squat if they're eking out 3Mbps with eye-watering packet loss because they're in their attic office. The vast majority of your users are using wireless links (WiFi or cell) and are not in any way hardlined to the internet.

It's a nice feature, but it would be even nicer if you could pin some apps to prevent their offloading even if you haven't used them in ages.


reply



That change would make _viable_ for me at all, right now it's next to useless.Currently iOS will offload apps that provide widgets (like Widgetsmith) even when I have multiple Widgetsmith widgets on my 1st and 2nd homescreens, I just never open the app (I don't need to, the widgets are all I use). One day the widgets will just be black and clicking on them does nothing. I have to search for Widgetsmith and then make the phone re-download it. So annoying.Also annoying is you can get push notifications from offloaded apps. Tapping on the notification does _nothing_ no alert, no re-download, just nothing. Again, you have to connect the dots and redownload it yourself.This ""feature"" is very badly implemented. If they just allowed me to pin things and added some better UX (and logic for the widget issue) it would be much better.

Part of the problem is the acceptance of the term ""long tail"" as normal.  It is not.  It is a method of marginalizing people.These are not numbers, these are people.  Just because someone is on an older phone or a slower connection does not make them any less of a human being than someone on a new phone with the latest, fastest connection.You either serve, or you don't.  If your business model requires you to ignore 20% of potential customers because they're not on the latest tech, then your business model is broken and you shouldn't be in business.The whole reason companies are allowed to incorporate is to give them certain legal and financial benefits in exchange for providing benefits (economic and other) to society.  If your company can't hold up its end of the bargain, then please do go out of business.

This is spot on for me. I live in a low-density community that got telcom early and the infrastructure has yet to be upgraded. So, despite being a relatively wealthy area, we suffer from poor service and have to choose between flaky high latency high bandwidth (Starlink) and flaky low latency low bandwidth (DSL). I've chosen the latter to this point. Point to point wireless isn't an option because of the geography.

The rule I've come up with is one user action, one request, one response. By 'one response', I mean one HTTP response containing DOM data; if that response triggers further requests for CSS, images, fonts, or whatever, that's fine, but all the modifications to the DOM need to be in that first request.

Many people have already said designing for iffy internet helps everyone: this is true for slimming your payload, but not necessarily designing around dropped connections. On a plane or train, you might alternate between no internet and good internet, so you can just retry anything that failed when the connection is back, but a rural connection can be always spotty. And I think the calculus for devs isn't clearly positive when you have to design qualitatively new error handling pathways that many people will never use.For example, cloning a git repo is non-resumable. Cloning a larger repo can be almost impossible since the probability the connection doesn't drop in the middle falls to zero. The sparse checkout feature has helped a lot here. Cargo also used to be very hard to use on rural internet until sparse registries.

Their lifestyle just doesn't use the internet much at all by necessity but at those speeds even when willing to pay the exorbitant cost sites will just timeout.Starlink has been a revolution for these communities but it's still not everywhere yet.

Use the software that you make, in the same conditions that your users will use it in.Most mobile apps are developed by people in offices with massive connections, or home offices with symmetric gigabit fiber or similar. The developers make sure the stuff works and then they're on to the next thing. The first time someone tries to use it on a spotty cellular connection is probably when the first user installs the update.You don't have to work on a connection like that all the time, but you need to experience your app on that sort of connection, on a regular basis, if you care about your users' experience.Of course, it's that last part that's the critical missing piece from most app development.

There is no need or moral obligation for all of the internet to be accessible to everyone. If you're not a millionaire, you're not going to be join a rich country club. If you don't have a background in physics, the latest research won't be accessible to you. If you don't have a decent video card, you won't be able to play many of the latest games. The idea that everything should be equally accessible to everyone is simply the wrong assumption. Inequality is not a bad thing per se.However, good design principles involve an element of parsimony. Not minimalism, mind you, but a purposeful use of technology. So if the content you wish to show is best served by something resource intensive that excludes some or even most people from using it, but those that can access it are the intended audience, then that's fine. But if you're just jamming a crapton of worthless gimmickry into your website that doesn't serve the purpose of the website, and on top of that, it prevents your target audience from using it, then that's just bad design.Begin with purpose and a clear view of your intended audience and most of this problem will go away.

I use only the APIs directly with Aider (so no experience with AI Studio).My feeling with Claude is that they still perform good with weak prompts, the ""taste"" is maybe a little better when the direction is kinda unknown by the prompter.When the direction is known I see Gemini 2.5 Pro (with thinking) on top of Claude with code which does not break. And with o4-mini and o3 I see more ""smart"" thinking (as if there is a little bit of brain inside these models) at the expense of producing unstable code (Gemini produces more stable code).I see problems with Claude when complexity increases and I would put it behind Gemini and o3 in my personal ranking.So far I had no reason to go back to Claude since o3-mini was released.

I also believe Gemini is much better than ChatGPT in generating deep research reports. Google has an edge in web search and it shows. Gemini's reports draw on a vast number of sources, thus tend to be more accurate.

Custom instructions, projects, temporary chats… these things either have no equivalent in Gemini or are underdeveloped.

My favorite personal use of Gemini right now is basically as a book club. Of course it's not as good as my real one but I often can't them to read the books I want and Gemini is always ready when I want to explore themes. It's often more profound than the book club too and seems a bit less likely to tunnel vision. Before LLMs I found exploring book themes pretty tedious, often I would have to wait a while to find someone who had read it but now I can get into it as soon as I'm done reading.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","When AIs bargain, a less advanced agent could cost you","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/17/1118910/ai-price-negotiation/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

New research shows that in AI-to-AI price negotiations, weaker models often lose out—costing users real money and raising concerns about growing digital inequality.

The race to build ever larger AI models is slowing down. The industry's focus is shifting toward agents—systems that can act autonomously, make decisions, and negotiate on users' behalf. 

But what would happen if both a customer and a seller were using an AI agent? A recent study put agent-to-agent negotiations to the test and found that stronger agents can exploit weaker ones to get a better deal. It's a bit like entering court with a seasoned attorney versus a rookie: You're technically playing the same game, but the odds are skewed from the start.

The paper, posted to arXiv's preprint site, found that access to more advanced AI models —those with greater reasoning ability, better training data, and more parameters—could lead to consistently better financial deals, potentially widening the gap between people with greater resources and technical access and those without. If agent-to-agent interactions become the norm, disparities in AI capabilities could quietly deepen existing inequalities.

“Over time, this could create a digital divide where your financial outcomes are shaped less by your negotiating skill and more by the strength of your AI proxy,” says Jiaxin Pei, a postdoc researcher at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study.

OpenAI's GPT-4 is much better at getting people to accept its point of view during an argument than humans are—but there's a catch.

In their experiment, the researchers had AI models play the roles of buyers and sellers in three scenarios, negotiating deals for electronics, motor vehicles, and real estate. Each seller agent received the product's specs, wholesale cost, and retail price, with instructions to maximize profit. Buyer agents, in contrast, were given a budget, the retail price, and ideal product requirements and were tasked with driving the price down.

Each agent had some, but not all, relevant details. This setup mimics many real-world negotiation conditions, where parties lack full visibility into each other's constraints or objectives.

The differences in performance were striking. OpenAI's ChatGPT-o3 delivered the strongest overall negotiation results, followed by the company's GPT-4.1 and o4-mini. GPT-3.5, which came out almost two years earlier and is the oldest model included in the study,  lagged significantly in both roles—it made the least money as the seller and spent the most as a buyer. DeepSeek R1 and V3 also performed well, particularly as sellers. Qwen2.5 trailed behind, though it showed more strength in the buyer role.

One notable pattern was that some agents often failed to close deals but effectively maximize profit in the sales they did make, while others completed more negotiations but settled for lower margins. GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek R1 struck the best balance, achieving both solid profits and high completion rates.

Beyond financial losses, the researchers found that AI agents could get stuck in prolonged negotiation loops without reaching an agreement—or end talks prematurely, even when instructed to push for the best possible deal. Even the most capable models were prone to these failures.

“The result was very surprising to us,” says Pei. “We all believe LLMs are pretty good these days, but they can be untrustworthy in high-stakes scenarios.”

The disparity in negotiation performance could be caused by a number of factors, says Pei. These include differences in training data and the models' ability to reason and infer missing information. The precise causes remain uncertain, but one factor seems clear: Model size plays a significant role. According to the scaling laws of large language models, capabilities tend to improve with an increase in the number of parameters. This trend held true in the study: Even within the same model family, larger models were consistently able to strike better deals as both buyers and sellers.

We're starting to give AI agents real autonomy, and we're not prepared for what could happen next.

This study is part of a growing body of research warning about the risks of deploying AI agents in real-world financial decision-making. Earlier this month, a group of researchers from multiple universities argued that LLM agents should be evaluated primarily on the basis of their risk profiles, not just their peak performance. Current benchmarks, they say, emphasize accuracy and return-based metrics, which measure how well an agent can perform at its best but overlook how safely it can fail. Their research also found that even top-performing models are more likely to break down under adversarial conditions.

The team suggests that in the context of real-world finances, a tiny weakness—even a 1% failure rate—could expose the system to systemic risks. They recommend that AI agents be “stress tested” before being put into practical use.

Hancheng Cao, an incoming assistant professor at Emory University, notes that the price negotiation study has limitations. “The experiments were conducted in simulated environments that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world negotiations or user behavior,” says Cao. 

Pei, the researcher, says researchers and industry practitioners are experimenting with a variety of strategies to reduce these risks. These include refining the prompts given to AI agents, enabling agents to use external tools or code to make better decisions, coordinating multiple models to double-check each other's work, and fine-tuning models on domain-specific financial data—all of which have shown promise in improving performance.

Many prominent AI shopping tools are currently limited to product recommendation. In April, for example, Amazon launched “Buy for Me,” an AI agent that helps customers find and buy products from other brands' sites if Amazon doesn't sell them directly.

While price negotiation is rare in consumer e-commerce, it's more common in business-to-business transactions. Alibaba.com has rolled out a sourcing assistant called Accio, built on its open-source Qwen models, that helps businesses find suppliers and research products. The company told MIT Technology Review it has no plans to automate price bargaining so far, citing high risk.

That may be a wise move. For now, Pei advises consumers to treat AI shopping assistants as helpful tools—not stand-ins for humans in decision-making.

“I don't think we are fully ready to delegate our decisions to AI shopping agents,” he says. “So maybe just use it as an information tool, not a negotiator.”

Correction: We removed a line about agent deployment 

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

AlphaEvolve uses large language models to find new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more.

Every original creation is an act of generative recombination. Why should the use of AI be held to a different standard?

Last fall, while attending a board meeting in Amsterdam, I had a few free hours and made an impromptu visit to the Van Gogh Museum. I often steal time for visits like this—a perk of global business travel for which I am grateful. Wandering the galleries, I found myself before The Courtesan (after Eisen), painted in 1887. Van Gogh had based it on a Japanese woodblock print by Keisai Eisen, which he encountered in the magazine Paris Illustré. He explicitly copied and reinterpreted Eisen's composition, adding his own vivid border of frogs, cranes, and bamboo.

As I stood there, I imagined the painting as the product of a generative AI model prompted with the query How would van Gogh reinterpret a Japanese woodblock in the style of Keisai Eisen? And I wondered: If van Gogh had used such an AI tool to stimulate his imagination, would Eisen—or his heirs—have had a strong legal claim?  If van Gogh were working today, that might be the case. Two years ago, the US Supreme Court found that Andy Warhol had infringed upon the photographer Lynn Goldsmith's copyright by using her photo of the musician Prince for a series of silkscreens. The court said the works were not sufficiently transformative to constitute fair use—a provision in the law that allows for others to make limited use of copyrighted material.

A few months later, at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, I visited a Salvador Dalí exhibition. I had always thought of Dalí as a true original genius who conjured surreal visions out of thin air. But the show included several Dutch engravings, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Seven Deadly Sins (1558), that clearly influenced Dalí's 8 Mortal Sins Suite (1966). The stylistic differences are significant, but the lineage is undeniable. Dalí himself cited Bruegel as a surrealist forerunner, someone who tapped into the same dream logic and bizarre forms that Dalí celebrated. Suddenly, I was seeing Dalí not just as an original but also as a reinterpreter. Should Bruegel have been flattered that Dalí built on his work—or should he have sued him for making it so “grotesque”?

Forget one-click creativity. These artists and musicians are finding new ways to make art using AI, by injecting friction, challenge, and serendipity into the process.

During a later visit to a Picasso exhibit in Milan, I came across a famous informational diagram by the art historian Alfred Barr, mapping how modernist movements like Cubism evolved from earlier artistic traditions. Picasso is often held up as one of modern art's most original and influential figures, but Barr's chart made plain the many artists he drew from—Goya, El Greco, Cézanne, African sculptors. This made me wonder: If a generative AI model had been fed all those inputs, might it have produced Cubism? Could it have generated the next great artistic “breakthrough”?

These experiences—spread across three cities and centered on three iconic artists—coalesced into a broader reflection I'd already begun. I had recently spoken with Daniel Ek, the founder of Spotify, about how restrictive copyright laws are in music. Song arrangements and lyrics enjoy longer protection than many pharmaceutical patents. Ek sits at the leading edge of this debate, and he observed that generative AI already produces an astonishing range of music. Some of it is good. Much of it is terrible. But nearly all of it borrows from the patterns and structures of existing work.

Musicians already routinely sue one another for borrowing from previous works. How will the law adapt to a form of artistry that's driven by prompts and precedent, built entirely on a corpus of existing material?

And the questions don't stop there. Who, exactly, owns the outputs of a generative model? The user who crafted the prompt? The developer who built the model? The artists whose works were ingested to train it? Will the social forces that shape artistic standing—critics, curators, tastemakers—still hold sway? Or will a new, AI-era hierarchy emerge? If every artist has always borrowed from others, is AI's generative recombination really so different? And in such a litigious culture, how long can copyright law hold its current form? The US Copyright Office has begun to tackle the thorny issues of ownership and says that generative outputs can be copyrighted if they are sufficiently human-authored. But it is playing catch-up in a rapidly evolving field. 

Different industries are responding in different ways. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently announced that filmmakers' use of generative AI would not disqualify them from Oscar contention—and that they wouldn't be required to disclose when they'd used the technology. Several acclaimed films, including Oscar winner The Brutalist, incorporated AI into their production processes.

The music world, meanwhile, continues to wrestle with its definitions of originality. Consider the recent lawsuit against Ed Sheeran. In 2016, he was sued by the heirs of Ed Townsend, co-writer of Marvin Gaye's “Let's Get It On,” who claimed that Sheeran's “Thinking Out Loud” copied the earlier song's melody, harmony, and rhythm. When the case finally went to trial in 2023, Sheeran brought a guitar to the stand. He played the disputed four-chord progression—I–iii–IV–V—and wove together a mash-up of songs built on the same foundation. The point was clear: These are the elemental units of songwriting. After a brief deliberation, the jury found Sheeran not liable.

Reflecting after the trial, Sheeran said: “These chords are common building blocks … No one owns them or the way they're played, in the same way no one owns the colour blue.”

Exactly. Whether it's expressed with a guitar, a paintbrush, or a generative algorithm, creativity has always been built on what came before.

I don't consider this essay to be great art. But I should be transparent: I relied extensively on ChatGPT while drafting it. I began with a rough outline, notes typed on my phone in museum galleries, and transcripts from conversations with colleagues. I uploaded older writing samples to give the model a sense of my voice. Then I used the tool to shape a draft, which I revised repeatedly—by hand and with help from an editor—over several weeks.

There may still be phrases or sentences in here that came directly from the model. But I've iterated so much that I no longer know which ones. Nor, I suspect, could any reader—or any AI detector. (In fact, Grammarly found that 0% of this text appeared to be AI-generated.)

Many people today remain uneasy about using these tools. They worry it's cheating, or feel embarrassed to admit that they've sought such help. I've moved past that. I assume all my students at Harvard Business School are using AI. I assume most academic research begins with literature scanned and synthesized by these models. And I assume that many of the essays I now read in leading publications were shaped, at least in part, by generative tools.

Why? Because we are professionals. And professionals adopt efficiency tools early. Generative AI joins a long lineage that includes the word processor, the search engine, and editing tools like Grammarly. The question is no longer Who's using AI? but Why wouldn't you?

I recognize the counterargument, notably put forward by Nicholas Thompson, CEO of the Atlantic: that content produced with AI assistance should not be eligible for copyright protection, because it blurs the boundaries of authorship. I understand the instinct. AI recombines vast corpora of preexisting work, and the results can feel derivative or machine-like.

But when I reflect on the history of creativity—van Gogh reworking Eisen, Dalí channeling Bruegel, Sheeran defending common musical DNA—I'm reminded that recombination has always been central to creation. The economist Joseph Schumpeter famously wrote that innovation is less about invention than “the novel reassembly of existing ideas.” If we tried to trace and assign ownership to every prior influence, we'd grind creativity to a halt.

From the outset, I knew the tools had transformative potential. What I underestimated was how quickly they would become ubiquitous across industries and in my own daily work.

Our copyright system has never required total originality. It demands meaningful human input. That standard should apply in the age of AI as well. When people thoughtfully engage with these models—choosing prompts, curating inputs, shaping the results—they are creating. The medium has changed, but the impulse remains the same: to build something new from the materials we inherit.

Nitin Nohria is the George F. Baker Jr. Professor at Harvard Business School and its former dean. He is also the chair of Thrive Capital, an early investor in several prominent AI firms, including OpenAI.

MIT Technology Review's editorial guidelines state that generative AI should not be used to draft articles unless the article is meant to illustrate the capabilities of such tools and its use is clearly disclosed.

The island is staring down a dirtier, and potentially darker, future — with little say over what happens.

At first glance, it seems as if life teems around Carmen Suárez Vázquez's little teal-painted house in the municipality of Guayama, on Puerto Rico's southeastern coast.

The edge of the Aguirre State Forest, home to manatees, reptiles, as many as 184 species of birds, and at least three types of mangrove trees, is just a few feet south of the property line. A feral pig roams the neighborhood, trailed by her bumbling piglets. Bougainvillea blossoms ring brightly painted houses soaked in Caribbean sun.

Yet fine particles of black dust coat the windowpanes and the leaves of the blooming vines. Because of this, Suárez Vázquez feels she is stalked by death. The dust is in the air, so she seals her windows with plastic to reduce the time she spends wheezing—a sound that has grown as natural in this place as the whistling croak of Puerto Rico's ubiquitous coquí frog. It's in the taps, so a watercooler and extra bottles take up prime real estate in her kitchen. She doesn't know exactly how the coal pollution got there, but she is certain it ended up in her youngest son, Edgardo, who died of a rare form of cancer.

And she believes she knows where it came from. Just a few minutes' drive down the road is Puerto Rico's only coal-fired power station, flanked by a mountain of toxic ash.

The plant, owned by the utility giant AES, has long plagued this part of Puerto Rico with air and water pollution. During Hurricane Maria in 2017, powerful winds and rain swept the unsecured pile—towering more than 12 stories high—out into the ocean and the surrounding area. Though the company had moved millions of tons of ash around Puerto Rico to be used in construction and landfill, much of it had stayed in Guayama, according to a 2018 investigation by the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, a nonprofit investigative newsroom. Last October, AES settled with the US Environmental Protection Agency over alleged violations of groundwater rules, including failure to properly monitor wells and notify the public about significant pollution levels. 

Governor Jenniffer González-Colón has signed a new law rolling back the island's clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goal of 40% renewables by 2025.

Between 1990 and 2000—before the coal plant opened—Guayama had on average just over 103 cancer cases per year. In 2003, the year after the plant opened, the number of cancer cases in the municipality surged by 50%, to 167. In 2022, the most recent year with available data in Puerto Rico's central cancer registry, cases hit a new high of 209—a more than 88% increase from the year AES started burning coal. A study by University of Puerto Rico researchers found cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses on the rise in the area. They suggested that proximity to the coal plant may be to blame, describing the “operation, emissions, and handling of coal ash from the company” as “a case of environmental injustice.”

Seemingly everyone Suárez Vázquez knows has some kind of health problem. Nearly every house on her street has someone who's sick, she told me. Her best friend, who grew up down the block, died of cancer a year ago, aged 55. Her mother has survived 15 heart attacks. Her own lungs are so damaged she requires a breathing machine to sleep at night, and she was forced to quit her job at a nearby pharmaceutical factory because she could no longer make it up and down the stairs without gasping for air. 

When we met in her living room one sunny March afternoon, she had just returned from two weeks in the hospital, where doctors were treating her for lung inflammation.

“In one community, we have so many cases of cancer, respiratory problems, and heart disease,” she said, her voice cracking as tears filled her eyes and she clutched a pillow on which a photo of Edgardo's face was printed. “It's disgraceful.”

Neighbors have helped her install solar panels and batteries on the roof of her home, helping to offset the cost of running her air conditioner, purifier, and breathing machine. They also allow the devices to operate even when the grid goes down—as it still does multiple times a week, nearly eight years after Hurricane Maria laid waste to Puerto Rico's electrical infrastructure.

Suárez Vázquez had hoped that relief would be on the way by now. That the billions of dollars Congress designated for fixing the island's infrastructure would have made solar panels ubiquitous. That AES's coal plant, which for nearly a quarter century has supplied up to 20% of the old, faulty electrical grid's power, would be near its end—its closure had been set for late 2027. That the Caribbean's first virtual power plant—a decentralized network of solar panels and batteries that could be remotely tapped into and used to balance the grid like a centralized fuel-burning station—would be well on its way to establishing a new model for the troubled island. 

Puerto Rico once seemed to be on that path. In 2019, two years after Hurricane Maria sent the island into the second-longest blackout in world history, the Puerto Rican government set out to make its energy system cheaper, more resilient, and less dependent on imported fossil fuels, passing a law that set a target of 100% renewable energy by 2050. Under the Biden administration, a gas company took charge of Puerto Rico's power plants and started importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), while the federal government funded major new solar farms and programs to install panels and batteries on rooftops across the island. 

Now, with Donald Trump back in the White House and his close ally Jenniffer González-Colón serving as Puerto Rico's governor, America's largest unincorporated territory is on track for a fossil-fuel resurgence. The island quietly approved a new gas power plant in 2024, and earlier this year it laid out plans for a second one. Arguing that it was the only way to avoid massive blackouts, the governor signed legislation to keep Puerto Rico's lone coal plant open for at least another seven years and potentially more. The new law also rolls back the island's clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goals of 40% renewables by 2025 and 60% by 2040, though it preserves the goal of reaching 100% by 2050. At the start of April, González-Colón issued an executive order fast-­tracking permits for new fossil-fuel plants. 

In May the new US energy secretary, Chris Wright, redirected $365 million in federal funds the Biden administration had committed to solar panels and batteries to instead pay for “practical fixes and emergency activities” to improve the grid.

It's all part of a desperate effort to shore up Puerto Rico's grid before what's forecast to be a hotter-than-­average summer—and highlights the thorny bramble of bureaucracy and business deals that prevents the territory's elected government from making progress on the most basic demand from voters to restore some semblance of modern American living standards.

Puerto Ricans already pay higher electricity prices than most other American citizens, and Luma Energy, the private company put in charge of selling and distributing power from the territory's state-owned generating stations four years ago, keeps raising rates despite ongoing outages. In April González-Colón moved to crack down on Luma, whose contract she pledged to cancel on the campaign trail, though it remains unclear how she will find a suitable replacement. 



At the same time, she's trying to enforce a separate contract with New Fortress Energy, the New York–based natural-gas company that gained control of Puerto Rico's state-owned power plants in a hotly criticized privatization deal in 2023—all while the company is pushing to build more gas-fired generating stations to increase the island's demand for liquefied natural gas. Just weeks before the coal plant won its extension, New Fortress secured a deal to sell even more LNG to Puerto Rico—despite the company's failure to win federal permits for a controversial import terminal in San Juan Bay, already in operation, that critics fear puts the most densely populated part of the island at major risk, with no real plan for what to do if something goes wrong.

Those contracts infamously offered Luma and New Fortress plenty of carrots in the form of decades-long deals and access to billions of dollars in federal reconstruction money, but few sticks the Puerto Rican government could wield against them when ratepayers' lights went out and prices went up. In a sign of how dim the prospects for improvement look, New Fortress even opted in March to forgo nearly $1 billion in performance bonuses over the next decade in favor of getting $110 million in cash up front. Spending any money to fix the problems Puerto Rico faces, meanwhile, requires approval from an unelected fiscal control board that Congress put in charge of the territory's finances during a government debt crisis nearly a decade ago, further reducing voters' ability to steer their own fate. 

AES declined an interview with MIT Technology Review and did not respond to a detailed list of emailed questions. Neither New Fortress nor a spokesperson for González-Colón responded to repeated requests for comment. 

“I was born on Puerto Rico's Emancipation Day, but I'm not liberated because that coal plant is still operating,” says Alberto Colón, 75, a retired public school administrator who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez, referring to the holiday that celebrates the abolition of slavery in what was then a Spanish colony. “I have sinus problems, and I'm lucky. My wife has many, many health problems. It's gotten really bad in the last few years. Even with screens in the windows, the dust gets into the house.”

What's happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender. 

The question for anyone who visits this place and tries to understand why things are the way they are is: How did it get this bad? 

The complicated answer is a story about colonialism, corruption, and the challenges of rebuilding an island that was smothered by debt—a direct consequence of federal policy changes in the 1990s. Although they are citizens, Puerto Ricans don't have votes that count in US presidential elections. They don't typically pay US federal income taxes, but they also don't benefit fully from federal programs, receiving capped block grants that frequently run out. Today the island has even less control over its fate than in years past and is entirely beholden to a government—the US federal government—that its 3.2 million citizens had no part in choosing.

What's happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.

A phrase that's ubiquitous in graffiti on transmission poles and concrete walls in the towns around Guayama and in the artsy parts of San Juan places the blame deep in history: El problema es la colonia—the problem is the colony.

By some measures, Puerto Rico is the world's oldest colony, officially established under the Spanish crown in 1508. The US seized the island as a trophy in 1898 following its victory in the Spanish-American War. In the grips of an expansionist quest to place itself on par with European empires, Washington pried Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines away from Madrid, granting each territory the same status then afforded to the newly annexed formerly independent kingdom of Hawaii. Acolytes of President William McKinley saw themselves as accepting what the Indian-born British poet Rudyard Kipling called “the white man's burden”—the duty to civilize his subjects.

Although direct military rule lasted just two years, Puerto Ricans had virtually no say over the civil government that came to power in 1900, in which the White House appointed the governor. That explicitly colonial arrangement ended only in 1948 with the first island-wide elections for governor. Even then, the US instituted a gag law just months before the election that would remain in effect for nearly a decade, making agitation for independence illegal. Still, the following decades were a period of relative prosperity for Puerto Rico. Money from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal had modernized the island's infrastructure, and rural farmers flocked to bustling cities like Ponce and San Juan for jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing sector. The pharmaceutical industry in particular became a major employer. By the start of the 21st century, Pfizer's plant in the Puerto Rican town of Barceloneta was the largest Viagra manufacturer in the world.

But in 1996, Republicans in Congress struck a deal with President Bill Clinton to phase out federal tax breaks that had helped draw those manufacturers to Puerto Rico. As factories closed, the jobs that had built up the island's middle class disappeared. To compensate, the government hired more workers as teachers and police officers, borrowing money on the bond market to pay their salaries and make up for the drop in local tax revenue. Puerto Rico's territorial status meant it could not legally declare bankruptcy, and lenders assumed the island enjoyed the full backing of the US Treasury. Before long, it was known on Wall Street as the “belle of the bond markets.” By the mid-2010s, however, the bond debt had grown to $74 billion, and a $49 billion chasm had opened between the amount the government needed to pay public pensions and the money it had available. It began shedding more and more of its payroll. 

The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the government-­owned utility, had racked up $9 billion in debt. Unlike US states, which can buy electricity from neighboring grids and benefit from interstate gas pipelines, Puerto Rico needed to import fuel to run its power plants. The majority of that power came from burning oil, since petroleum was easier to store for long periods of time. But oil, and diesel in particular, was expensive and pushed the utility further and further into the red.

Where does nuclear power fit into climate action?

By 2016, Puerto Rico could no longer afford to pay its bills. Since the law that gave the US jurisdiction over nonstate territories made Puerto Rico a “possession” of Congress, it fell on the federal legislature—in which the island's elected delegate had no vote—to decide what to do. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act—shortened to PROMESA, or “promise” in Spanish. It established a fiscal control board appointed by the White House, with veto power over all spending by the island's elected government. The board had authority over how the money the territorial government collected in taxes and utility bills could be used. It was a significant shift in the island's autonomy. 

“The United States cannot continue its state of denial by failing to accept that its relationship with its citizens who reside in Puerto Rico is an egregious violation of their civil rights,” Juan R. Torruella, the late federal appeals court judge, wrote in a landmark paper in the Harvard Law Review in 2018, excoriating the legislation as yet another “colonial experiment.” “The democratic deficits inherent in this relationship cast doubt on its legitimacy, and require that it be frontally attacked and corrected ‘with all deliberate speed.'” 

Hurricane Maria struck a little over a year after PROMESA passed, and according to official figures, killed dozens. That proved to be just the start, however. As months ground on without any electricity and more people were forced to go without medicine or clean water, the death toll rose to the thousands. It would be 11 months before the grid would be fully restored, and even then, outages and appliance-­destroying electrical surges were distressingly common.

The spotty service wasn't the only defining characteristic of the new era after Puerto Rico's great blackout. The fiscal control board—which critics pejoratively referred to as “la junta,” using a term typically reserved for Latin America's most notorious military dictatorships—saw privatization as the best path to solvency for the troubled state utility.

In 2020, the board approved a deal for Luma Energy—a joint venture between Quanta Services, a Texas-based energy infrastructure company, and its Canadian rival ATCO—to take over the distribution and sale of electricity in Puerto Rico. The contract was awarded through a process that clean-energy and anticorruption advocates said lacked transparency and delivered an agreement with few penalties for poor service. It was almost immediately mired in controversy.

Until that point, life was looking up for Suárez Vázquez. Her family had emerged from the aftermath of Maria without any loss of life. In 2019, her children were out of the house, and her youngest son, Edgardo, was studying at an aviation school in Ceiba, roughly two hours northeast of Guayama. He excelled. During regular health checks at the school, Edgardo was deemed fit. Gift bags started showing up at the house from American Airlines and JetBlue.

“They were courting him,” Suárez Vázquez says. “He was going to graduate with a great job.”

That summer of 2019, however, Edgardo began complaining of abdominal pain. He ignored it for a few months but promised his mother he would go to the doctor to get it checked out. On September 23, she got a call from her godson, a radiologist at the hospital. Not wanting to burden his anxious mother, Edgardo had gone to the hospital alone at 3 a.m., and tests had revealed three tumors entwined in his intestines.

So began a two-year battle with a form of cancer so rare that doctors said Edgardo's case was one of only a few hundred worldwide. He gave up on flight school and took a job at the pharmaceutical factory with his parents. Coworkers raised money to help the family afford flights and stays to see specialists in other parts of Puerto Rico and then in Florida. Edgardo suspected the cause was something in the water. Doctors gave him inconclusive answers; they just wanted to study him to understand the unusual tumors. He got water-testing kits and discovered that the taps in their home were laden with high amounts of heavy metals typically found in coal ash. 

Ewing's sarcoma tumors occur at a rate of about one in one million cancer diagnoses in the US each year. What Edgardo had—extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma, in which tumors form in soft tissue rather than bone—is even rarer. 

As a result, there's scant research on what causes that kind of cancer. While the National Institutes of Health have found “no well-established association between Ewing sarcoma and environmental risk factors,” researchers cautioned in a 2024 paper that findings have been limited to “small, retrospective, case-control studies.”

The push to give control over the territory's power system to private companies with fossil-fuel interests ignored the reality that for many Puerto Ricans, rooftop solar panels and batteries were among the most dependable options for generating power after the hurricane. Solar power was relatively affordable, especially as Luma jacked up what were already some of the highest electricity rates in the US. It also didn't lead to sudden surges that fried refrigerators and microwaves. Its output was as predictable as Caribbean sunshine.

But rooftop panels could generate only so much electricity for the island's residents. Last year, when the Biden administration's Department of Energy conducted its PR100 study into how Puerto Rico could meet its legally mandated goals of 100% renewable power by the middle of the century, the research showed that the bulk of the work would need to be done by big, utility-scale solar farms. 

With its flat lands once used to grow sugarcane, the southeastern part of Puerto Rico proved perfect for devoting acres to solar production. Several enormous solar farms with enough panels to generate hundreds of megawatts of electricity were planned for the area, including one owned by AES. But early efforts to get the projects off the ground stumbled once the fiscal oversight board got involved. The solar farms that Puerto Rico's energy regulators approved ultimately faced rejection by federal overseers who complained that the panels in areas near Guayama could be built even more cheaply.

In a September 2023 letter to PREPA vetoing the projects, the oversight board's lawyer chastised the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau, a government regulatory body whose five commissioners are appointed by the governor, for allowing the solar developers to update contracts to account for surging costs from inflation that year. It was said to have created “a precedent that bids will be renegotiated, distorting market pricing and creating litigation risk.” In another letter to PREPA, in January 2024, the board agreed to allow projects generating up to 150 megawatts of power to move forward, acknowledging “the importance of developing renewable energy projects.”

“There's no trust. That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It's disappointing, but that's why we weren't able to build large things.”

But that was hardly enough power to provide what the island needed, and critics said the agreement was guilty of the very thing the board accused Puerto Rican regulators of doing: discrediting the permitting process in the eyes of investors.

The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau “negotiated down to the bone to very inexpensive prices” on a handful of projects, says Javier Rúa-Jovet, the chief policy officer at the Solar & Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. “Then the fiscal board—in my opinion arbitrarily—canceled 450 megawatts of projects, saying they were expensive. That action by the fiscal board was a major factor in predetermining the failure of all future large-scale procurements,” he says.

When the independence of the Puerto Rican regulator responsible for issuing and judging the requests for proposals is overruled, project developers no longer believe that anything coming from the government's local experts will be final. “There's no trust,” says Rúa-Jovet. “That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It's disappointing, but that's why we weren't able to build large things.”

That isn't to say the board alone bears all responsibility. An investigation released in January by the Energy Bureau blamed PREPA and Luma for causing “deep structural inefficiencies” that “ultimately delayed progress” toward Puerto Rico's renewables goals.

The finding only further reinforced the idea that the most trustworthy path to steady power would be one Puerto Ricans built themselves. At the residential scale, Rúa-Jovet says, solar and batteries continue to be popular. Nearly 160,000 households—roughly 13% of the population—have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 households are enrolled in the pilot virtual power plant, a collection of small-scale energy resources that have aggregated together and coordinated with grid operations. During blackouts, he says, Luma can tap into the network of panels and batteries to back up the grid. The total generation capacity on a sunny day is nearly 600 megawatts—eclipsing the 500 megawatts that the coal plant generates. But the project is just at the pilot stage. 

The country's final coal-fired power plant just shut down, marking a major milestone for the notoriously polluting fossil fuel.

The share of renewables on Puerto Rico's power grid hit 7% last year, up one percentage point from 2023. That increase was driven primarily by rooftop solar. Despite the growth and dependability of solar, in December Puerto Rican regulators approved New Fortress's request to build an even bigger gas power station in San Juan, which is currently scheduled to come online in 2028.

“There's been a strong grassroots push for a decentralized grid,” says Cathy Kunkel, a consultant who researches Puerto Rico for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and lived in San Juan until recently. She'd be more interested, she adds, if the proposals focused on “smaller-­scale natural-gas plants” that could be used to back up renewables, but “what they're talking about doing instead are these giant gas plants in the San Juan metro area.” She says, “That's just not going to provide the kind of household level of resilience that people are demanding.”

What's more, New Fortress has taken a somewhat unusual approach to storing its natural gas. The company has built a makeshift import terminal next to a power plant in a corner of San Juan Bay by semipermanently mooring an LNG tanker, a vessel specifically designed for transport. Since Puerto Rico has no connections to an interstate pipeline network, New Fortress argued that the project didn't require federal permits under the law that governs most natural-gas facilities in the US. As a result, the import terminal did not get federal approval for a safety plan in case of an accident like the ones that recently rocked Texas and Louisiana. 

Skipping the permitting process also meant skirting public hearings, spurring outrage from Catholic clergy such as Lissette Avilés-Ríos, an activist nun who lives in the neighborhood next to the import terminal and who led protests to halt gas shipments. “Imagine what a hurricane like Maria could do to a natural-gas station like that,” she told me last summer, standing on the shoreline in front of her parish and peering out on San Juan Bay. “The pollution impact alone would be horrible.”

The shipments ultimately did stop for a few months—but not because of any regulatory enforcement. In fact, it was in violation of its contract that New Fortress abruptly cut off shipments when the price of natural gas skyrocketed globally in late 2021. When other buyers overseas said they'd pay higher prices for LNG than the contract in Puerto Rico guaranteed, New Fortress announced with little notice that it would cease deliveries for six months while upgrading its terminal.

“The government justifies extending coal plants because they say it's the cheapest form of energy.”

The missed shipments exemplified the challenges in enforcing Puerto Rico's contracts with the private companies that control its energy system and highlighted what Gretchen Sierra-Zorita, former president Joe Biden's senior advisor on Puerto Rico and the territories, called the “troubling” fact that the same company operating the power plants is selling itself the fuel on which they run—disincentivizing any transition to alternatives.

“Territories want to diversify their energy sources and maximize the use of abundant solar energy,” she told me. “The Trump administration's emphasis on domestic production of fossil fuels and defunding climate and clean-­energy initiatives will not provide the territories with affordable energy options they need to grow their economies, increase their self-sufficiency, and take care of their people.”

Puerto Rico's other energy prospects are limited. The Energy Department study determined that offshore wind would be too expensive. Nuclear is also unlikely; the small modular reactors that would be the most realistic way to deliver nuclear energy here are still years away from commercialization and would likely cost too much for PREPA to purchase. Moreover, nuclear power would almost certainly face fierce opposition from residents in a disaster-prone place that has already seen how willing the federal government is to tolerate high casualty rates in a catastrophe. That leaves little option, the federal researchers concluded, beyond the type of utility-scale solar projects the fiscal oversight board has made impossible to build.

“Puerto Rico has been unsuccessful in building large-scale solar and large-scale batteries that could have substituted [for] the coal plant's generation. Without that new, clean generation, you just can't turn off the coal plant without causing a perennial blackout,” Rúa-Jovet says. “That's just a physical fact.”

The AES coal plant does produce some of the least expensive large-scale electricity currently available in Puerto Rico, says Cate Long, the founder of Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, a financial research service targeted at the island's bondholders. “From a bondholder perspective, [it's] the lowest cost,” she explains. “From the client and user perspective, it's the lowest cost. It's always been the cheapest form of energy down there.” 

The issue is that the price never factors in the cost to the health of people near the plant. 

“The government justifies extending coal plants because they say it's the cheapest form of energy,” says Aldwin José Colón, 51, who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez. He says he's had cancer twice already.

On an island where nearly half the population relies on health-care programs paid for by frequently depleted Medicaid block grants, he says, “the government ends up paying the expense of people's asthma and heart attacks, and the people just suffer.” 

On December 2, 2021, at 9:15 p.m., Edgardo died in the hospital. He was 25 years old. “So many people have died,” Suárez Vázquez told me, choking back tears. “They contaminated the water. The soil. The fish. The coast is black. My son's insides were black. This never ends.” 

Nor do the blackouts. At 12:38 p.m. on April 16, as this story was being edited, all of Puerto Rico's power plants went down in an island-wide outage triggered by a transmission line failure. As officials warned that the blackout would persist well into the next day, Casa Pueblo, a community group that advocates for rooftop solar, posted an invitation on X to charge phones and go online under its outdoor solar array near its headquarters in a town in the western part of Puerto Rico's central mountain range.

“Come to the Solar Forest and the Energy Independence Plaza in Adjuntas,” the group beckoned, “where we have electricity and internet.”

Dan Trachtenberg has ideas for another Predator film after Badlands. A familiar face will return for American Horror Story‘s next season. Plus, get a look at Shea Couleé's Ironheart character. Spoilers get!



Star Trek: Voyager‘s Tim Russ seemingly confirmed on Twitter he's set to return as the trooper who “ain't found shit” while combing the desert in Spaceballs 2.

I may be ….. combing the desert again..!!! https://t.co/DjtBWKpznG

During a recent interview with SFX Magazine (via Games Radar), Dan Trachtenberg stated he has a third idea for a Predator movie he'd “love to get to when Badlands is finished.”

After Prey came out, and I started thinking about sequel stuff, there were three ideas that I had. Killers is one, Badlands is two and the third one is something else. The reason why I felt possessed to make them and sort of why I rushed – I did two at once because I could multitask with animation – was because I was so eager to get to the third thing. There's a lot of cool ideas out there and none of them are just like, ‘Oh, we have to say the next part of this story because it was successful.' All of it is like, ‘Whoa, no one has done that in sci-fi. No one has done that in Predator. No one's done that with the creature,' all of those ideas are generated from that instinct. So, yeah, there is definitely a third thing that I'd love to get to when Badlands is finished.

And speaking of Badlands, a new poster has emerged featuring the Predator carrying the half-destroyed android body of Elle Fanning's Thia.

Godzilla's been having a comics cameo queen moment for a while now, and Marvel has been celebrating the Big G's 70th anniversary in style with a series of fun one-issue crossovers with a whole host of Marvel heroes, from the Fantastic Four to Spider-Man. But the fun's over now: Godzilla's here to stomp over the Marvel Universe for real, and as things get from bad to worse for heroes and villains alike, it's almost time for mutantkind to enter the fight to save Earth.

Gerry Duggan and Javier Garron, and Paco Medina's Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe is set to kick off next month, and we've already had a few tempting teases of just how bad things are going to get as Godzilla reawakens in Marvel's Manhattan, forcing heroes and villains alike to unite in a desperate gambit to stop the King of All Monsters.

Our first teases for August's second issue of the five-issue mini have already teases that Godzilla might become even more dangerous by bonding with the Venom symbiote, but io9 has your first exclusive look the solicit for issue 3 of the series–as the X-Men hope to survive the experience that is a battle with Godzilla himself!

Check out the solicit for Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe #3 below, as well as your first look at all covers for the issue.

As Godzilla's wave of desolation arrives on the shores of Madripoor, the X-Men join the fight for the planet's survival! As they struggle to hold the line against the King of the Monsters, Professor Xavier fights his own mental battle as he attempts to penetrate and pacify the mind of the Kaiju–but when he discovers what lurks in the mind of the rampaging Godzilla, all bets are off! Plus, the Hulk enters the fray with an earth-shattering entrance that sends ripples felt across the world, including in Wakanda, where Black Panther is done waiting to be the next victim of the kaiju's frenzy. If Godzilla insists on fighting, Wakanda will prove the kaiju isn't the only one capable of bringing the destruction!

Issue 3 will feature a main cover from Marvel stalwart Mark Brooks, depicting Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Storm, Gambit, and Rogue alongside Godzilla, as well as a series of variant covers, including an action-figure style cover by John Tyler Christopher (featuring classic Godzilla kaiju Hedorah the Smog Monster), a “Marvelized” Godzilla cover by Dave Wachter depicting an Iron Man/Mechagodzilla mashup, and a gorgeous variant from Jeremy Wilson showcasing Cyclops and Godzilla blasting it out.

But perhaps our favourite is a bold cover by Jeehyung Lee that asks the ultimate question: who will win, one giant kaiju, or one very small, angry Canadian? Check them all out below!

Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe #3 is set to hit comic book stores September 24, 2025. Check out where you can find a store to add a copy to your pull list at Comic Shop Locator.

If you're out there building yourself your first gaming PC, let me just say it's not as hard as it looks. Once you find all the parts you need for the budget you want to spend, it is just a matter of putting them all together. And there and plenty of YouTube videos that will show you exactly what to do if you are nervous on that front. No, the hard part is actually that first part — finding the parts your need for the budget you want to spend. There are a lot of options out there with hard-to-decipher specs if you're not sure what you're looking at.

See at Amazon

Fret not, because here is one part down for you. Amazon has a bundle of two Crucial Pro DDR5 RAM 32GB memory cards which together can bring you 64 GB of memory, all for just $158. Normally, the two Crucial Pro memory cards would be selling for $228. Amazon has the kit discounted at the moment by 31% which cuts the price down and saves you a whole $70.

The Crucial Pro DDR5 RAM will give you accelerated performance while gaming. It's capable of 6000MHz at CL40. With 64GB of the Crucial Pro DDR5 RAM, you'll find yourself experiencing low latency, high frame rates, and smooth gameplay. It's ideal for any game—be it you're playing a small indie title, or a graphically intense, fast-paced AAA shooter.

The overclocking memory features a white, aluminum heat spreader. It has a unique, origami-like design that both looks cool and stays cool to the touch. The units are available in your choice of black or white so you can best match the aesthetic of the gaming rig you're building. They don't have integrated RGB lighting, but honestly that's not what makes a good memory card good. There will surely be plenty of other components that light up on your gaming PC be it your choice or otherwise.

Crucial's Pro DDR5 RAM kit is widely compatible. You'll be able to install this into your PC that's running any Intel Core 12th, generation, 13th, generation, or 14th generation desktop CPU. It's also compatible with the AMD Ryzen 7000 series or any higher desktop CPU from AMD. It's got support for both Intel XMP 3.0 and AMD EXPO on the same module.

For a limited time, Amazon has the bundle of two Crucial Pro DDR5 RAM 32GB memory cards discounted down by 31%. That brings the price down to just $158, making them just $79 per car.

It really pays to have a good portable power station these days. Whether you're going camping for a long weekend, spending all day at the beach, or you just want a backup in case something happens to the power grid, having one of these devices around can be a huge help. They're very expensive normally though, so you're nearly always best off waiting for a really good deal.

See at Amazon

Well, we just so happen to have found a really good deal today, and on a really good brand. The Anker Solix C1000 Portable Power Station is a mighty option, and while it'd normally set you back $799 on Amazon, it's currently a massive 44% off, making it just $449 right now. This is a limited-time deal though, so we're not expecting it to last long. If you want this for this price, make sure you act quickly to avoid missing out.

This portable power station has a lot of stuff going for it. One of the best things about it is that it has an incredibly fast charge time. In just 43 minutes of charging, this thing will have 80% of its battery capacity. It's durable too, and can manage 3,000 battery cycles over a 10-year period, meaning it should be good for even the most hardcore outdoorsy types.

It can also deliver up to 2400W of output, which means it can comfortably power the vast majority of appliances, and it has 11 ports and can charge multiple devices at once if it needs to. It just means it can do basically everything you need it to, so you won't need a second one. If you do want to upgrade though, then getting some solar panels can allow it to passively charge throughout the day, and makes for a great way to stay powered-up even on longer trips.

You can even customize how it delivers power using the Anker app, meaning it's easier than ever to really fine-tune it to your own needs. It's a small benefit that not everyone is going to use, but those who want to will adore being able to really take control of this device. That's an awful lot of good for just $449 (-44%), but just keep in mind that it's unlikely to stay at this price for very long because of how Amazon's limited-time deals work. Make sure you grab this one now if you like the look of it.

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that often causes sudden and intense shortness of breath. The disease impacts around 339 million people worldwide, and in the U.S. nine people on average die from asthma every day.

Researchers in the U.K. have found that women who work night shifts are more likely to have moderate or severe asthma than women who work during the day. The study, published Monday in the journal ERJ Open Research, does not reveal any such tendency in men working nightshifts, and could hold important implications for public health guidance.

The team had previously shown that permanent night shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from moderate-severe asthma compared to day workers. Scientists also know that asthma is more prevalent and severe in adult women than adult men. “Since increasing numbers of females are becoming shift workers it is important to determine if shift work-associated asthma risk is higher in females,” the researchers wrote in the study. Shift work refers to scheduled working periods that fall outside of traditional daytime hours. “Our main aim was to investigate sex differences in the association between shift work and asthma.”

The researchers did so by analyzing data belonging to over 274,541 working people from the U.K. Biobank, a biomedical database open to health researchers. From this initial pool, they found that 5.3% had asthma, and 1.9% of those had moderate or severe asthma. The team then looked into whether the people in these categories worked during the day, during nightshifts, or a mix of both.

The researchers found that female shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from asthma, and women who only work nightshifts have 50% higher likelihood of developing moderate or severe asthma than female daytime workers. Furthermore, the risk increases “with both number of monthly night shifts and longer lifetime duration of night shift work,” they explained. Interestingly, the data did not reveal any differences in the prevalence of asthma in men based on their work schedule.

“This type of research cannot explain why shift work and asthma are linked,” Robert Maidstone, a co-author of the study and a researcher at the University of Manchester's School of Biological Sciences, said in a university statement. “However, it could be because shift work disrupts the body clock, including the levels of male and female sex hormones. High testosterone has previously been shown to be protective against asthma, and so lower testosterone in women could play a role. Alternatively, men and women work different types of shift jobs, and this could be a factor.”

Among women not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT, a treatment for menopausal symptoms), postmenopausal women working only night shifts were almost twice as likely to have moderate-severe asthma than female day workers. This suggests that HRT might protect nightshift workers from asthma, though the researchers admit that more studies are needed to confirm this.

“This research suggests that working nightshifts could be a risk factor for asthma in women, but not in men. The majority of workers will not have an easy option of switching their shift pattern, so we need further research to verify and understand this link and find out what could be done to reduce the risk for women who work shifts,” explained Florence Schleich from the European Respiratory Society, who was not involved in the study.

Moving forward, the researchers aim to investigate how sex hormones might influence asthma prevalence among shift workers. Perhaps this line of research will also shed light on what drives the respiratory disease, given that the exact cause remains a mystery.

Dev also touts image quality improvements after ‘significant architectural improvements.'

Another killer update has been unleashed by the developer of the Lossless Scaling utility. For those on the lookout for an alternative game upscaling solution, the new LSFG 3.1 update comes with image quality and performance gains, potentially delivering “up to 2x GPU load reduction,” according to the developer.

The headlining 2x GPU load reduction comes courtesy of this tool's new Performance Mode. According to the release notes, the new mode delivers this boost, depending on hardware config and settings, “with a slight reduction in image quality.” So, as is often the case with these kinds of tools, there can be a trade-off.



In some cases, it is noted that the new Performance Mode can, conversely, “improve image quality by allowing the game to achieve a higher base frame rate.” So, this is yet another graphical tweak that gamers will need to explore on a per-hardware-config, per-game, and per-preference basis.

Sticking to the topic of quality, the developer has announced that the following improvements have been introduced with the new LSFG 3.1 update:

Developed by a one-man band, the Lossless Scaling utility is a GPU-agnostic tool that provides an alternative graphics upscaling technology at the one-off bargain price of $6.99.

If your GPU doesn't support technologies like DLSS, FSR, or XeSS, you may be attracted to Lossless Scaling to fill the gap with admirable performance and configurability. The tool has found a lot of fans within the PC gaming community, especially among those who sometimes find the best GPU they have at hand is an older discrete card or integrated graphics. But it has other use cases.

As well as offering up its own built-in upscaling options (like LS1, Nearest Neighbor, xBR, Bicubic CAS, and Anime 4K), Lossless Scaling can work its magic via AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution or Nvidia Image Scaling.

Like other upscalers, Lossless Scaling isn't without its issues, particularly apparent when pixel peeping, or in games where frame gen latency is a no-no.

Though flagged as a “major update” and containing “significant architectural improvements” the Lossless Scaling tool version is only incremented by 0.1, to 3.1. Our inner marketeer would have perhaps suggested that LSFG move to version 4 to look more competitive against DLSS4 and FSR4. It already features machine learning enhanced upscaling. But for all we know, there may be even more significant updates and feature introductions in line to push the version up a whole number.

It is going to get hot.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The power consumption of AI GPUs has steadily increased in recent years and is expected to continue rising as AI processors incorporate more compute and HBM chiplets. Some of our sources in the industry have indicated that Nvidia is looking at 6,000W to 9,000W for thermal design power for its next-generation GPUs, but experts from KAIST, a leading Korean research institute, believe that the TDP of AI GPUs will increase all the way to 15,360W over the next 10 years. As a result, they will require rather extreme cooling methods, including immersion cooling and even embedded cooling.



Until recently, high-performance air-cooling systems, which involved copper radiators and high-pressure fans, were sufficient to cool Nvidia's H100 AI processors. However, as Nvidia's Blackwell increased its heat dissipation to 1,200W and then Blackwell Ultra increased its TDP to 1,400W, liquid cooling solutions became almost mandatory. Things are going hotter with Rubin, which will increase its TDP to 1,800W, and with Rubin Ultra, which will double the number of GPU chiplets and HBM modules, along with a TDP that will go all the way to 3,600W. Researchers from KAIST believe that Nvidia and its partners will use direct-to-chip (D2C) liquid cooling with Rubin Ultra, but with Feynman, they will have to use something more powerful.

*Industry source

Researchers from KAIST predict that AI GPU modules (particularly Nvidia's Feynman) will dissipate 4,400W, whereas some other sources from the industry believe that Nvidia's Feynman Ultra will increase its TDP to 6,000W. Such extreme thermals will require the usage of immersion cooling, where entire GPU-HBM modules are submerged in a thermal fluid. In addition, such processors and their HBM modules are expected to be introduced through thermal vias (TTVs), vertical channels in the silicon substrate dedicated to heat dissipation. These will be paired with thermal bonding layers and temperature sensors embedded in the HBM module base die for real-time thermal monitoring and feedback control.

Immersion cooling is expected to be good enough till 2032, when post-Feynman GPU architectures will increase per-package TDP to 5,920W (post-Feynman) or even 9000W (post-Feynman Ultra).

It is necessary to note that the main power consumers in a GPU module are compute chiplets. However, as the number of HBM stacks increases to 16 with post-Feynman, and per-stack power consumption increases to 120W with HBM6, the power consumption of memory will be around 2,000W, which is around 1/3 of the whole package.

Researchers from KAIST theorize that by 2035 power consumption of AI GPUs will increase to around 15,360, which will call for embedded cooling structures both for compute and memory chiplets. The experts mention two key innovations: thermal transmission lines (TTLs) that move heat laterally from hotspots to cooling interfaces, and fluidic TSVs (F-TSVs) that allow coolant to flow vertically through the HBM stack.

By 2038, fully integrated thermal solutions will get even more widespread and advanced. They will use double-sided interposers to enable vertical stacking on both sides, with fluidic cooling embedded throughout. Also, GPU-on-top architectures will help prioritize heat removal from the compute layer, while coaxial TSVs assist in balancing signal integrity and thermal flow.

It's going to be a beast.

Yesterday, it emerged that Intel's next-generation Core Ultra 9 'Nova Lake-S' processors for desktops will feature as many as 52 cores, which makes them quite formidable contenders both for gaming and for performance-demanding applications. It turns out that the whole Nova Lake-S platform will be quite beastly too, as it will support DDR5-8000 memory and will feature as many as 32 PCIe 5.0 lanes, according to Jaykihn, a blogger with an excellent reputation when it comes to Intel's plans.

Intel's range-topping Core Ultra 9 'Nova Lake-S' processors for desktop PCs are set to pack 16 high-performance Coyote Cove cores, 32 energy-efficient Arctic Wolf cores, and four low-power Arctic Wolf cores. Memory subsystem of the new CPU will feature two channels supporting up to one DDR5-8000 memory module per channel, though it is unclear whether Intel plans to support regular DDR5-8000 DIMMs, or DDR5-8000 CUDIMMs with a clock driver chip.

There is a small catch, though, as each pair of Nova Lake's high-performance cores will feature a shared 2MB L2 cache, according to HXL. Using shared L2 cache will affect the performance of Coyote Cove cores, though this is a necessary tradeoff to pack up to 52 cores into next-generation Core Ultra 9 and up to 42 cores into next-generation Core Ultra 7 CPUs, as well as double the number of high-performance cores in high-end CPUs. Hopefully, support for high-speed DDR5 memory will offset the smaller L2 cache, and the performance of Coyote Cove will not be lower than the performance of Lion Cove cores.

Furthermore, Intel's Nova Lake CPUs will feature 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes: x16 lanes for graphics cards (which can be bifurcated to two x8 or to four x4 lanes) as well as two x4 lanes for SSDs. In addition, the chipset will support eight PCIe 5.0 lanes and 16 PCIe 4.0 lanes for peripherals, which could enable rather monstrous systems with loads of storage and plenty of add-in cards and accelerators.

Intel's next-generation Core Ultra 'Nova Lake-S' processors for desktops will reportedly use the all-new LGA1954 packaging and a new socket, so those who want to have up to 52 cores will have to upgrade to a new platform.

Other divisions will face similar reductions.

The first reports about Intel's plans to cut workforce in its manufacturing division starting mid-July emerged last Friday. However, the report lacked specifics, which appear to be quite dramatic as the chipmaker reportedly plans to eliminate between 15% to 20% of its Intel Foundry personnel, which will affect over 8,170-10,890 people globally, reports OregonLive.

Naga Chandrasekaran, the head of Intel Foundry, informed staff that the layoffs are necessary to address cost-related challenges and the company's financial position. He stated that reductions would be guided by business priorities, individual evaluations, and decisions around which projects to continue funding.

As of December 28, 2024, Intel's workforce comprised 108,900 people, down from around 124,800 people from the previous year. Intel's Silicon Forest Oregon facilities were not spared from layoffs last year, cutting approximately 3,000 jobs while still retaining roughly 20,000 employees.

Intel has 15 wafer fabs in production worldwide at 10 locations. Intel does not disclose exactly how many of its employees work in production and related services, though the company says that approximately half of its workforce handles production or production services. The remaining half is distributed across R&D, design, sales, administrative roles, client, data center, and other business units. Keep in mind that other divisions are to face similar 15% to 20% cuts this year.

Assuming that around 50% of Intel's personnel are involved in fab operations, that means around 54,450 people. Eliminating 15% to 20% of them means that from 8,170 to 10,890 personnel will be eliminated worldwide.

Intel will not offer buyouts or voluntary departures this year, opting instead for selective terminations in an attempt to keep the best employees with the company, the report says. When the 2025 layoffs were announced this spring, the company emphasized that its intention was to reduce the number of management layers and bureaucracy within the company. However, the new report indicates that affected roles may span a range of positions, from technicians working directly on factory floors or under them to tool operators and support personnel.

Key roles, such as engineers working on cutting-edge process technologies and skilled technicians managing EUV and High-NA EUV lithography equipment, are vital and unlikely to face layoffs. However, Intel may trim positions made redundant by automation or organizational efficiency. While reducing non-essential roles helps cut costs while maintaining critical expertise in the company, it may also reduce operational agility, slow responses to equipment problems, and increase pressure on remaining employees, which lowers morale and could result in costly downtime.

OregonLive notes that federal and state funding are also in question. Intel secured $7.9 billion from the CHIPS Act, receiving $1 billion last year. But the rest of the subsidy package remains uncertain, as the new Trump administration is reviewing ongoing allocations. Separately, Oregon pledged $115 million in public funds, but those are conditional on meeting future hiring and tax revenue targets. If hiring or revenue projections are missed, state funding could be withdrawn.

Octa-core CPU and at least RTX 3080 / RX 6800 XT recommended. Price starts at $70, up to $130 for Super Deluxe Edition.

The pricing, availability, and minimum and recommended PC specs for Borderlands 4 were unveiled on Monday. Today, it is very clear to see that Borderlands fans aren't happy about several aspects of the announcement, particularly the PC recommended specs and the pricing tiers.

Fans of the franchise are quite furious about the PC requirements and the pricing structure they are now looking at.

On Reddit, a very spicy thread calls into question the necessity for recommended hardware such as an octa-core CPU, and at least an RTX 3080 / RX 6800 XT, to enjoy Borderlands 4. We also note that 32GB of RAM is recommended, and this game will eat up to 100GB of SSD storage at launch.

Interestingly, even the recommended RTX 3080 may struggle. This card originally launched with 10GB on board, but was refreshed with 12GB. However, small print under the recommended specs listing asserts that “12GB+” is required. We wonder if VRAM might become an issue with GPUs like the new RTX 5070.

From its origins, Borderlands set itself apart in visual style using a ‘cel-shading' graphical style, using thick outlines and stylized textures throughout.

While this simpler-than-nature representation of characters and 3D worlds should have made the game less demanding in the 3D stakes, layering on all sorts of enhancing graphical enhancements and particle effects worked against this. Actually, the initial trio of Borderlands games made use of Nvidia PhysX to render its best dynamic cloth, explosive debris, and particle effects.

Borderlands 3 moved away from dedicated GPU PhysX, handling the same style of visual effects in a more GPU-agnostic manner. And now we have Borderlands 4 set to arrive in a few months, packing the latest Unreal Engine 5 – a notoriously demanding foundation for PC games.

PC gaming stalwarts may also not be surprised to see that Borderlands 4 is also going to feature potentially performance-impacting DRM. The product page says it will arrive laced with Denuvo and Symbiote.



The pricing for the ‘Standard Edition' of the new game at $69.99 isn't the source of much resentment on social media. That price is in line with the BL3 launch. However, the Deluxe ($99.99) and Super Deluxe ($129.99) editions have been criticized for ‘paywalling' day-1 content.

Indeed, it is apparent there aren't just cosmetics and the like stuffed into the more expensive editions. The Deluxe adds “4 unique areas, missions, & bosses,” as well as some new gear and weapons, and four new vehicles.

Moving up to the Super Deluxe edition, gamers are most upset by there being “2 new playable Vault Hunters” exclusively included at this price. Vault Hunters are the characters you play in this franchise, and each has their own unique character, abilities, and skill trees, boosting game fun and replayability.

Hopefully, Gearbox, the dev team behind the franchise, can do some optimization between now and September 12 to ensure Borderlands 4 can run more smoothly and slickly on lesser hardware. We shall have to wait and see. For those who care very deeply about price, patience will usually be rewarded.

Borderlands 4 releases simultaneously on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on PC, as well as on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles. Switch 2 gamers will have to wait a little longer.

 June 17, 2025  

Diuretic doses in patients with heart failure could be down-titrated effectively using a simple, noninvasive, home-based monitoring system, according to findings from a pilot study presented at the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (HFA-ESC) 2025 Congress in Belgrade, Spain, and published in the European Journal of Heart Failure.

International guidelines recommend loop diuretics for relieving symptoms of fluid overload in patients with heart failure. However, the dose should be lowered as quickly as possible to prevent potential deleterious effects of diuretics, said Evelyne Meekers, MD, lead author of the new study called EASY-STOP.

“Currently, optimal measures for diuretic titration are lacking,” said Meekers, a cardiologist at Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg Hospital in Genk, Belgium. Pulmonary artery pressure sensors are effective but also invasive and costly to implement, she added.

Meekers and her colleagues designed EASY-STOP to examine whether the use of a home-based test kit for urinary sodium could guide clinicians in effectively down-titrating doses of diuretics. The study enrolled 50 adults with stable heart failure who performed monitoring of sodium levels using the wand-type point-of-care sensors.

Subjects took urine samples twice daily (first urinary void and 2 hours after a diuretic dose) for 1 week while maintaining their diuretic dose. Over the following 3 weeks, they continued the sampling while clinicians attempted to reduce or discontinue the diuretic as symptoms allowed.

Increases in the excretion of urinary sodium in the first void of the day were an indicator of successful reduction in the dosage of diuretic, the researchers found. But the lack of an increase in sodium excretion suggested a need to escalate the diuretic dose.

Of the 62 down-titrations of diuretics performed by Meekers' group, 34 (55%) were successful, while 28 (45%) required reinitiation of the previous dose. Factors associated with unsuccessful down-titration included an increase in right ventricular systolic pressure > 10 mm Hg (54%), an increase in New York Heart Association class of 1 or more (50%), presence of edema (46%), weight gain (46%), and an increase in diastolic dysfunction (29%).

According to a 2019 position statement in the European Journal of Heart Failure, diuretic dosing should be individualized in patients with heart failure, using dynamic adjustments over time to achieve the lowest effective dose. Failure to reduce diuretic doses when appropriate may lead to consequences such as:

“When it comes to heart failure GDMT, three of the four pillars have diuretic effects,” said Glenn Herrington, PharmD, a certified cardiac clinical pharmacist at Novant Health Heart & Vascular Institute in Wilmington, North Carolina. These pillars are angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. “Clinicians must be mindful of this when implementing and titrating doses, as this typically does require the de-escalation of loop diuretics,” Herrington said.

However, finding the best dose for the patient can be challenging. Standard methods for adjusting diuretic doses require patients to be educated and actively involved in their care, Herrington said. “Patients need to know how to identify the signs of over-diuresis. During the implementation-titration phase, patients should keep daily weights, monitor blood pressure and pulse rate, and know how to adjust their loop diuretic accordingly.”

Laboratory values should be obtained 1-2 weeks after medication changes to monitor renal function and electrolytes, Herrington recommended, while levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels may be used to assess volume status.

“In some cases, patients may not be able to be as engaged in their care,” Herrington said. “That is when other methods for monitoring volume status may be useful. For patients who are not good candidates for noninvasive monitoring, point-of-care urinary sodium monitoring may be an option for guiding diuretic dosing.”

For clinicians who elect to use home sodium monitoring, Meekers stressed the need for clear patient education on the use of home monitoring materials, recognizing symptoms, and setting realistic expectations about the time commitment and possible failure of down-titration.

“After validation from larger studies, we believe the findings of the EASY-STOP study could meaningfully change clinical practice regarding diuretic down-titration in heart failure,” she said. “Ultimately, the hope is that such an approach will help shift the focus toward a more individualized and long-term optimization of heart failure care.”

An analysis of the SOUL trial, the largest trial to date of oral semaglutide vs placebo, showed nonsignificant trends of kidney-related effects in contrast to the striking benefits observed with the injectable version of the drug seen in previous trials.

However, clearer benefits with the oral formulation may be masked by key trial limitations, said first author Johannes Mann, MD, of the KfH Kidney Center, in Munich, Germany, and the Friedrich Alexander University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany, who presented the findings at 62nd European Renal Association (ERA) Congress 2025.

The SOUL trial was primarily a cardiovascular outcomes trial, so albuminuria was not measured, and, overall, “we had a group of patients with a low kidney risk,” according to estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR), Mann explained. But we did see positive trends for kidney health associated with oral semaglutide, he added.

In the trial, 9650 patients with type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease and/or chronic kidney disease were randomized 1:1 to treatment either with daily oral semaglutide 14 mg or placebo.

Of note, all patients also received standard of care medications, with 78.9% reporting baseline use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers and 26.9% using SGLT2 inhibitors.

The study's primary outcome focused on major adverse CV events, and with a median follow-up of 47.5 months, those treated with oral semaglutide had a significant 14% reduction in a composite of the CV outcomes compared with those treated with placebo (P = .006).

The drug's effects on kidneys were evaluated as confirmatory secondary outcomes, with a 5-component composite outcome of major kidney disease events, which included a 50% or greater reduction in eGFR from baseline, persistent eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy, or death from kidney-related or CV causes.

For the composite outcome, an event occurred in 8.4% of patients receiving oral semaglutide and 9.0% of those receiving placebo, which was not a significant difference (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; P = .19).

The analysis of a separate four-component, kidney-specific composite outcome that excluded the component of death from CV causes showed differences that were still not significant, with the four-component composite outcome occurring in 2.3% of the oral semaglutide group vs 2.7% of the placebo group (HR, 0.86; P = .23).

Importantly, patients in the SOUL trial overall had a mean baseline eGFR of 73.8 mL/min/1.73 m2, reflecting relatively mild kidney impairment.

However, 29.2% of patients had more serious kidney disease, with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, indicative of moderate to severe kidney impairment.

Among those higher-risk patients, the main five-component kidney outcome occurred in 185 patients (13.2%) compared with 214 (15.2%) in the oral semaglutide and placebo groups, respectively, which, though still not significant, did suggest a notable trend of improvement with oral semaglutide (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69-1.02; P = .08).

For the four-point kidney specific outcomes among patients with impaired kidney function, rates of events were predictably higher and slightly more separated, occurring in 5.1% and 6.2% participants, respectively, however, also not significantly different (HR, 0.80; P = .16).

In looking at outcomes of specific components of the composites, the analysis showed that those treated with oral semaglutide generally had trends for greater improvement, including a lower mean annual decrease in eGFR vs placebo, with a -1.67 mL/min/1.73 m2 reduction vs -2.06 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year, for an estimated treatment difference of 0.40.

And fewer patients treated with oral semaglutide had an indication of kidney failure (eGFR < 15mL/min/1.73 m2) than those treated with placebo (HR, 0.69).

The oral semaglutide group further had a notable but nonsignificant difference in having a ≥ 50% reduction in eGFR (HR, 0.81) and a lower need for chronic kidney replacement therapy (HR, 0.82) than placebo.

In terms of safety, those treated with oral semaglutide had slightly fewer serious adverse events than those treated with placebo (47.9% vs 50.3%).

Kidney benefits reported with the use of injectable semaglutide, administered once weekly, in the landmark FLOW trial, as reported by Medscape Medical News, were much more significant.

In that study, the relative risk reduction in the primary composite outcome, which included dialysis, transplantation, or an eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, along with at least a 50% reduction in the eGFR from baseline, or death from kidney-related or CV causes, was indeed significant, with a HR of 0.76 (P = .0003).

Importantly, the mean baseline eGFR in the FLOW trial was much lower than that in the SOUL trial (47.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 73.8 mL/min/1.73 m2).

And the data on patients' median urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was not reported for the simple reason of cost, Mann explained.

“When you have more than 9000 patients, getting the samples, [etc.], amounts to a tremendous amount of money,” he said.

Commenting on the study, Ronald T. Gansevoort, MD, PhD, a professor of medicine and nephrologist at the UMC Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands, said the findings provide important insights on oral semaglutide, with the lack of albuminuria representing a notable limitation.

“The severity of chronic kidney disease as well as the speed of disease progression is normally assessed by eGFR and albuminuria,” he told Medscape Medical News.

“That in this cardiovascular outcome trial albuminuria was not measured is therefore a pity from a renal point of view,” Gansevoort said.

“Notwithstanding, the data obtained are reassuring,” he added.

“They also show that in the future, in all cardiovascular outcome trials, not only eGFR, but also albuminuria should be measured. Such information will give the public, and guidelines, important information.”

The SOUL and FLOW trials were each funded by Novo Nordisk. Mann's disclosures include relationships with Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer, Hexal, and Sanofi. Gansevoort had no disclosures to report relating to the analysis.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello, everyone. This is Dr Bishal Gyawali, from Queens University, Kingston, Canada. I'm back again in this Skills Lab Series on Medscape. 

Thank you for joining us in the past few lectures. Today is going to be the last lecture regarding surrogate endpoints. We will discuss how physicians and patients understand surrogate endpoints. Do they clearly understand, and do they make the right clinical decisions based on their understanding of surrogate endpoints? 

First, let's talk about patient understanding of progression-free survival (PFS), the most commonly used endpoint in advanced cancer drug trials. In fact, colleagues from the FDA conducted a fantastic study, in which they asked participants about their understanding of surrogate endpoints, and how they did this was very clever. 

They showed a direct-to-consumer television advertisement about a cancer drug, and the advertisement mentioned that the drug improved progression-free survival. It did not mention anything about overall survival (OS) or anything else. It just said that the drug improved progression-free survival. 

There were almost 1000 participants in this study and, after watching that advertisement that mentioned improved progression-free survival, more than 90% of the participants thought that the drug improved survival. There was no mention of overall survival, but just by hearing that it improved progression-free survival, they assumed that the drug improved overall survival, which is quite telling.

The researchers went one step further. They did a fantastic intervention. Now the participants saw the same advertisement again, but this time the advertisement specifically mentioned that the survival data were unknown. It improved progression-free survival, but we don't know whether it improves [overall] survival.

Even after that disclosure, 40% of the participants continued to believe that the drug improved survival, and I think this is because we call it progression-free survival. When we call it that, they hear the last word, ""survival,"" and they inherently assume that if a drug improves progression-free survival, it improves their survival. Even after disclosing that survival effects are unknown, 40% of the participants continued to believe that the drug improves survival. 

One more very interesting study was conducted in 100 patients with advanced cancer in Canada. These were actual patients who were receiving treatment for cancer. PFS and OS were explained to these patients, and they were given a hypothetical scenario about a drug that improved PFS and had some toxicities but did not improve OS. 

In this experiment, 17% of the patients said they would prefer to receive the drug even if there was no PFS benefit. This is similar to what we see. Some of our patients just want something. They just want a drug. Even if there is no PFS or OS benefit, they just do not want to give up. 

Of the patients, 26% said they would want the drug for some PFS benefit, within the range of 3-9 months. If the drug improved PFS between 3 and 9 months, even if it did not improve OS, patients would still want to get the drug. However, the majority of them, 51%, would decline the drug, regardless of PFS benefit. 

This is important. What this is telling us is that if the drug does not offer any OS advantage, more than half of our patients would decline a drug with toxicities, irrespective of how big the magnitude of the PFS benefit is.

Therefore, we wrote a paper in The Lancet Oncology back in 2022, in which we called on the community to change the name of progression-free survival because it is confusing, and patients assume it is a survival advantage when it's actually not. If a drug does not improve survival, then they would probably not want a drug with PFS benefit alone. 

We said that it's time for a new name, and we proposed that instead of PFS, progression-free survival, we should call it PFI — progression-free interval — because it gets rid of the word ""survival"" and patients won't be confused. 

Now, let's talk about physicians' understanding of surrogate endpoints. Do physicians understand this well? This is a very recent paper that we published in ESMO Open. This was a mixed-methods study of oncologists' perceptions on endpoints, benefit, price, and value of cancer drugs. 

We conducted this study among oncologists in India, so there might be some limitations about how applicable it is elsewhere, but I don't think the results we found are very different from what we would find in any other country. 

First, we found that 20% of oncologists rarely use cancer drugs that improve only response rate but not survival. Almost an equal percentage said that they would often use drugs that improved response rate but not survival. In regard to PFS, 20% of oncologists rarely used cancer drugs that did not improve survival and only improved PFS, but 48% of them often used such a drug.

We asked them the reasons for this. First, let's talk about response rate. Among the oncologists who said they would not use a drug that improves only response rate, the most common reason was lack of any effect on survival or quality of life because the drug just shrinks the tumor. It does not help patients live longer or better, so what's the point? The second was toxicity, and the drug will definitely have many side effects. That was the reason why they did not want to use a drug with response alone. 

Among oncologists who said they would use the drug based on response rate alone, when we asked why, the most common answer was for symptom relief or improved quality of life. This is quite interesting because there are no data to say that response rate leads to improved quality of life or symptom relief. If it is in a tricky location, then it can, but there is no evidence that, in general, shrinking a tumor leads to improved quality of life. This indicates that oncologists' understanding of surrogate endpoints is also not optimal.

The second most common reason was to downstage disease, which is understandable. The third one is also very interesting because they said ""something is better than nothing."" That means they know that response rate does not lead to improved clinical outcomes, but they can't just do nothing for their patients. They have to do something and the patient wants something, so something is better than nothing. 

The fourth one is very interesting. They talk about the impact of drug approval and having it included in guidelines. Even if they know that it's based on response rate alone and they don't want to use the drug, if it's approved and if it's in the guidelines, then they feel like they're forced to use it.

Some of the oncologists also said that it's on a case-by-case basis. For example, if they have a drug that is cheaper or a biosimilar for a drug that improves response rate alone, they would use it. For rare cancers or where there is no other option, as we discussed, they would use such a drug. 

The most common reason for not using a drug based on PFS alone was the lack of effect on survival because it was not known whether the drug improved survival or not, which is very appropriate. Reasons in support of PFS were very interesting. The number-one reason here was cost. Oncologists said that a drug that improves PFS costs less than a drug that improves OS. The patients cannot afford the expensive drug, so they're using a cheaper drug. 

Again, this is very interesting because that's not true, especially in the context of the United States, Canada, and other high-income countries where we have done these studies. There is no correlation between whether the drug is approved based on PFS or OS and the price of the drug. A drug approved based on PFS can cost even more than a drug that is approved based on OS. 

The second reason was the impact of medical literature. If, in the editorials, commentaries, and CMEs, people are promoting a drug that is based on PFS alone, then that leads to their use. Then, on a case-by-case basis, people also talk about cost-effectiveness and for rare cancers or lack of alternatives.

Overall, I'm trying to show that when oncologists understand that it's only response rate or PFS, they still use these drugs based on some misguided assumptions that delaying PFS or improving response rate leads to improved quality of life, which is objectively untrue, and that drugs approved based on surrogate endpoints cost less than drugs approved based on OS, which is also untrue.

It's also interesting that we have this culture of always trying to do something rather than having that difficult discussion about end of life. Doing something is always easier than doing nothing, so we end up prescribing these drugs, although we know that it does not benefit patients. I think these findings are quite interesting, and I want our entire oncology community to be aware of these biases within ourselves. 

To close the loop, we also asked these oncologists about whether magnitude and price matter. They said that, for a drug that impacts only PFS, they would want to see at least a 4.5-month improvement in PFS, with the range of answers from 1.5 to 12 months, so quite a big range there. The price is interesting. This is not applicable to high-income countries. This is applicable only in the Indian context. They said that 120 USD per month was appropriate for such a drug.

For OS, again, they wanted an improvement of 4.5 months, with a range of 2-24 months. They said 360 USD per month was justified.

It's not about the exact number, but what they are telling us here is that a drug that improves OS can cost up to three times more than a drug that improves PFS alone. If you think about it the other way around, a drug that only improves PFS but not OS should be costing one third of the drugs that improve OS. That's not the case in reality. 

We talked about all the surrogate endpoints in these lectures and today is the end of this topic. To clarify, just because a trial's endpoint is overall survival does not necessarily mean that the benefits are meaningful. 

There can be several other issues, which we'll discuss in our subsequent lectures. The next few lectures will talk about statistical analysis, sample sizes, power calculations, and so on. Stay tuned.

A 55-year-old patient who was right-handed consulted a neurologist for episodes of inter-manual conflict due to uncontrolled movements of his left hand, marked by involuntary movements of his left hand that interfered with the right hand. Each time he reached for a door handle with his right hand, his left hand counteracted the movement. He reported similar interference during other manual tasks. The patient was anxious and feared the persistence of these movements. A brain MRI prescribed by the neurologist allowed the diagnosis of infarction of the corpus callosum.

This rare case of alien hand syndrome reported by Léonard Kouamé Kouassi, MD, and colleagues at Félix Houphouët-Boigny University in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, recommends brain imaging in case of unusual clinical manifestation or prompt referral of the patient to a neurologist.

The right-handed patient had episodes of uncontrolled movements of his left hand. According to him, this phenomenon had been developing for 8 days, preceded by a numbness sensation in his left upper limb 6 days earlier. He is right-handed. Whenever he moves his right hand to perform an activity, his left hand interferes. He has the impression that his left hand is being controlled by someone else, preventing him from performing his activities. These symptoms made him anxious, and he kept asking the neurologist if this hand behaviour would ever stop. His medical history included high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes for at least 5 years. There was no history of alcohol or tobacco use and no family history of hypertension or diabetes.

On admission, neurologic examination was normal, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg, temperature was 37.2 °C, pulse was 84 beats/min and was regular, weight was 93 kg, and height was 1.76 m. A scheduled neuropsychological evaluation could not be performed.

Complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, urea, and creatinine levels were within the reference range. Only low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was elevated at 1.37 g/dL. The retroviral serology results were negative. The immunological and thrombophilia test results were normal.

Cerebral MRI showed well-systematised signal anomalies within the corpus callosum splenium, extending anteriorly to its trunk, with a discrete mass effect on the corpus callosum body. These anomalies appeared in hyposignal on the T1 sequence, hypersignal on the T2 sequences, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in diffusion 1000, without restriction on the apparent diffusion coefficient and without haemorrhagic stigmata in gradient echo, corresponding to images of a relatively recent corpus callosum ischaemic stroke in the territories of the left pericallosal and posterior cerebral arteries. An old punctuated vascular lesion of the left caudate nucleus and acquired leukoencephalopathy of old vascular origin were also noted.

ECG showed sinus tachycardia associated with an incomplete right branch block with a V5-V6 late S-wave. A Holter ECG could not be performed. Transthoracic echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricular walls and no intracavity thrombus. Transoesophageal echocardiography was non-specific. Doppler ultrasound of supra-aortic trunks showed marked bilateral atheromatosis, with the presence of a non-stenotic heterogeneous plaque at the ostium of the right internal carotid artery.

On the basis of these findings, the patient was diagnosed with alien hand syndrome. The management was that of ischaemic stroke. Medications prescribed to the patient included an antidiabetic by a diabetologist, an antihypertensive (perindopril arginine/amlodipine besylate), a statin (Rosuvastatin EG), an antiplatelet aggregator (aspirin), and an anxiolytic (prazepam). Around 21 days after the onset of the stroke, the patient noted a significant improvement in the behaviour of his left hand, which became less and less troublesome, with the disappearance of the inter-manual conflict. However, the patient reported difficulties in deciding which of the two opposite actions to initiate.

Alien hand syndrome is a rare manifestation of stroke. The diagnostic workup followed standard stroke protocols. There is no approved or recommended therapy, and its management is based on anecdotal reports of pharmacological interventions using botulinum toxin and clonazepam, as well as behavioural interventions. In this case, in addition to the usual treatment of cerebral infarction, prazepam is an anxiolytic. Clonazepam and prazepam belong to the same therapeutic group and have similar actions, which may explain the improvement seen in our patient. “We hope, by updating this syndrome, to attract the attention of physicians to avoid diagnostic delays. In addition, this case report could contribute to enriching data on alien hand syndrome in sub-Saharan Africa,” the authors wrote.

 June 17, 2025  

Breathing is something you normally do without thinking. Adults do it some 12-18 times per minute.

For your patients with chronic respiratory illness, every breath is not always so easy and automatic.

Around 27 million Americans have asthma, which accounts for millions of emergency room visits each year. Another 12 million have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

These common conditions, plus seasonal allergies, can be successfully managed by primary care physicians (PCPs), said Jonathan Jennings, MD, an internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan in New York City.

“The role of the primary care physician is to recognize the condition and assist with facilitating definitive diagnosis and treatment plans,” Jennings said. “We also assist with educating patients and their families about the condition and treatment strategies.” 

“Patients with chronic lung disease often live in a state of ‘diagnosis limbo' for years, so it's important to provide them with a clear diagnosis and a structured treatment plan,” said Sanjay Ramakrishnan, a board-certified respiratory physician and specialist in asthma and COPD care at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and The Institute for Respiratory Health at The University of Western Australia in Nedlands, Australia.

For example, Ramakrishnan said, “COPD diagnosis is often delayed. In the United States, it can take a patient many events over a number of years before they go to their PCPs for a diagnosis.

Patients may initially present with milder symptoms, such as cough or chest infection, which could get misdiagnosed. Sometimes, these symptoms could take years before progressing to something worse that prompts testing and further investigation.”

Ramakrishnan recommends doing a spirometry test to test lung function if a patient presents with chronic cough and has known risk factors, such as a history of smoking, childhood respiratory infections, and long-term exposure to indoor or outdoor pollutants.

“This offers a safe and affordable method to glean valuable insights for their care,” he said.

Ramakrishnan is also a proponent of pulmonary rehabilitation. “It's an essential part of the management plan for individuals living with a chronic lung disease, such as asthma or COPD,” he said.

“Red-flag symptoms are not only condition-specific but patient-specific, and a clear understanding of the condition and their symptoms is the best method to keep respiratory conditions well controlled,” Jennings said.

Some common signs of worsening disease include cough, fever, and a need for rescue medications more frequently.

Repeated COPD exacerbations are a warning sign that more needs to be done to control the disease.

Check blood eosinophil levels on a complete blood count test, even if that was already done as part of a routine exam and not during the time of exacerbation, Ramakrishnan advised.

For patients having exacerbations and a raised blood eosinophil count (≥ 300 cells/μL), treatment guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids. However, despite this, about half of the patients with COPD continue to experience exacerbations. For some of those patients, Dupixent (dupilumab) can be included as an add-on maintenance treatment with unstable COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype.

In a phase 3 clinical trial, Dupixent resulted in an up to 34% reduction in COPD exacerbations over a year and more than two times greater improvement in lung function at 12 weeks.

If your patients are on prednisone, it is important to make sure they are not overusing it. There can be serious consequences if prednisone is not managed properly. Continued refills might be a sign that the disease is not well controlled and further investigation is needed, according to Ramakrishnan.

“Smoking cigarettes and vaping pose significant risks, and we should help patients prioritize clean air in their lungs,” Ramakrishnan said. “On average, in the US, quitting smoking takes up to eight attempts. As healthcare professionals, if we haven't helped our patients reach their eighth attempt, then I would say we haven't tried hard enough.” 

Talk to your patients on every visit and remind them that quitting smoking is one of the best things they can do to improve their health. Counseling and FDA-approved smoking cessation medications used together can double your patients' chances of success.

Some current or former smokers older than 50 years may be eligible for lung cancer screening. Discuss the pros and cons of this special low-dose CT scan with your high-risk patients.

Respiratory conditions are often worsened by common viruses like the flu. Baseline damage to the respiratory tissues in those with chronic lung conditions make complications more common and can lead to a slow recovery, Jennings said.

Preventative vaccinations for flu, pneumonia, COVID, and respiratory syncytial virus are critical for these patients.

There are a number of chronic respiratory conditions, and various specialists are charged with managing different components of the respiratory system. One of the roles of the primary care provider is to figure out which specialist is most appropriate for the respiratory condition of concern, Jennings said.

Complicated conditions that need focused attention and advanced treatment are usually managed by a specialist. These include:

There is often an overlap in conditions, and some patients require multiple specialists. Sometimes asthma, COPD, and allergies need specialist care if they aren't responding to first-line treatment or if there's a question about the diagnosis, Jennings said.

Chronic lung disease disproportionately affects working class people — especially those living in cities, Ramakrishnan said. These patients sometimes downplay their problems and, therefore, don't get a timely diagnosis.

“They may dismiss their symptoms as ‘just a cough' when it could be much more than that,” Ramakrishnan said. “So it is important to help them understand the significance of their symptoms and help them prioritize their health.”

“These conversations can sometimes be challenging, but if we don't have them, we run the risk of allowing them to tolerate their symptoms for a long time until they significantly worsen,” he said.

Jennings encourages patients to trust their bodies and find doctors they are comfortable working with in order to develop the best individualized treatment plans.

 June 17, 2025  

Norovirus GII.17 accounted for 75% of outbreaks in the US in the 2024-2025 season, outpacing outbreaks caused by the GII.4 norovirus, according to new data published in Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Noroviruses are classified into 10 groups known as GI-GX, but most norovirus outbreaks are caused by viruses in genogroups GI and GII, wrote Leslie Barclay, microbiologist at the CDC, Atlanta, and Jan Vinje, PhD, also of the CDC. The norovirus season on the US has been defined as September 1 of 1 year through August 31 of the following year, they noted.

Norovirus GII.17 accounted for < 10% of outbreaks in the US 2022-23 season, but rose to 75% during the 2024-25 season, passing the number of GII.4 outbreaks.

During the 2022-23 season, GII.17 accounted for only 7.5% of all norovirus outbreaks, whereas GII.4 accounted for nearly half (48.9%).

The following season (2023-2024), GII.17 accounted for approximately one third of norovirus outbreaks (34.3%), whereas GII.4 accounted for 27.7%. In the 2024-25 season, GII.17 accounted for 75.4% of norovirus outbreaks, whereas GII.4 accounted for 10.7%.

In addition, norovirus activity peaked earlier in 2024-25 (accompanying the rise in GII.17) compared to previous seasons. The 2024-25 season peaked in January 2025, vs peak periods in February 2023 and March 2024 when GII.4 still dominated.

The researchers observed no regional differences in the distribution patterns of the GII.4 or GII.17 outbreaks.

The study findings were based on data from CaliciNet, a national laboratory-based surveillance network. “Norovirus surveillance plays a crucial role in detecting and monitoring emerging strains, serving as an early warning system that enables rapid response to outbreak investigations and timely implementation of interventions and prevention strategies,” the authors noted.

However, the results highlight the need for improved norovirus surveillance to detect and monitor emerging strains, they added. Specifically, more sequencing analysis is needed to compare cross-protective neutralizing antibodies of GII.17 with those of GII.4 to help determine whether GII.17 is likely to continue as the dominant norovirus genotype, the authors concluded.

Tracking dominant norovirus strains is important for public health and clinical reasons, as dominant strains often drive regional or global outbreaks, said Rebecca Yee, PhD, D(ABMM), chief of microbiology and assistant professor of pathology at the George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, in an interview.

“Tracking specific strains allows public health agencies to perform surveillance and trace sources, monitor spread, and implement control measures more effectively,” said Yee, who was not involved in the study. “As the virus undergoes genetic changes, monitoring viral genomics allows researchers to study emerging variants that may have higher transmissibility or altered virulence in the human host,” she said. Since some molecular assays are designed to detect specific genotypes, understanding shifts in circulating strains helps clinical laboratories anticipate the need for test updates to maintain diagnostic accuracy, and these insights also will be valuable for vaccine development, Yee said.

The recent shift in genotype distribution is not entirely surprising, given norovirus's reputation for rapid genetic evolution through acquisition of mutations and genetic recombination with other strains, Yee told Medscape Medical News.

“In theory, these genetic changes allow new variants or strains to harbor characteristics that can make the virus more transmissible, resistant to existing immunity, capable of causing more severe disease and leading to periodic shifts in dominant strains is not an exception. However, the timing or speed of a shift can still be surprising, especially if it leads to unusually large or early-season outbreaks such as what we are seeing with the recent norovirus cases,” Yee said.

Studies using dominant circulating strains and genetic variants can be performed to evaluate cross-protection and vaccine effectiveness, said Yee. “As new norovirus variants emerge, it is critical to assess their clinical severity, particularly in vulnerable populations; these variants may exhibit changes in viral attachment, immune evasion, or modulation of host responses that can enhance their pathogenicity,” she emphasized.

“Furthermore, diagnostic assays must be evaluated to ensure they remain sensitive to emerging variants. Together, these efforts will help inform vaccine design, clinical management, and testing strategies,” Yee said.

This study received no outside funding. The researchers had no financial conflicts to disclose. Yee disclosed receiving research support from BioMerieux.

Prolonged water-only fasting increased inflammation and stress on the body, despite weight loss, a small trial showed.

“Our hypothesis was that prolonged water fasting would reduce inflammation in the body,” Luigi Fontana, MD, PhD, University of Sydney, Sydney, said in a press release. “However, we found the opposite was true — that prolonged fasting put stress on the body and increased the number of proinflammatory proteins in the blood, potentially increasing the risk of health issues for people with existing heart and vascular conditions.”

Fontana was the principal investigator of the study, which was published online in Molecular Metabolism.

Limitations included the study's single-arm design with no control group, the small sample size, and the variability in fasting and refeeding durations decided by the volunteers.

Fontana declared no competing interests. Three study authors disclosed relevant commercial affiliations.

A new study reveals how estrogen fine-tunes gut cell communication to amplify serotonin-driven pain, shedding light on why women suffer more from IBS and offering new leads for targeted therapies.

*Important notice:  bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

A recent study posted to the bioRxiv preprint* server identified a new estrogen-responsive pathway in which two types of enteroendocrine cells (EECs) communicate to increase gut sensitivity in females.

Chronic gastrointestinal (GI) pain conditions are more common in females, which can be aggravated with changes in estrogen levels during pregnancy and the menstrual cycle. While the relevant estrogen targets remain unknown, the gut mucosa could be a potential site of action, where sensory nerve fibers interact with epithelial cells. Most epithelial cells lining the gut are enterocytes, which primarily function to absorb electrolytes, nutrients, and water from the digestive tract.

The rare, excitable EECs are interspersed among the enterocytes and detect luminal contents and release neurotransmitters and peptides, triggering physiological responses. Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells are a subtype of EEC cells that activate mucosal spinal afferents to induce visceral pain. This EC cell-sensory nerve circuit exhibits increased sensitivity in female mice, suggesting that it might be the locus for the enhancement of visceral pain.

The L-cell, another EEC subtype, is known for its role in secreting hormones, such as peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and sensing postprandial nutrients. Exogenous administration of the cleaved PYY3-36 peptide causes gastrointestinal discomfort. PYY3-36 selectively binds to neuropeptide Y2 receptors (NPY2Rs) in the brain and vagal afferents.

The larger PYY1-36 peptide also activates the NPY1R, expressed by spinal afferents and EC cells in the gut. With EC cells being the primary detectors of noxious stimuli along the gut epithelium, coupling between NPY1R and PYY1-36 could presumably lead to hypersensitivity and visceral discomfort. However, few studies have investigated paracrine coupling between EC and L cells and their consequences on visceral pain.

The present study demonstrated that crosstalk between EC and L cells results in visceral hypersensitivity. First, the team investigated whether estrogen is involved in the differential sensitivity of mucosal sensory afferents, which have been previously shown to exhibit higher baseline activity in female mice compared to male mice. To this end, afferent nerve fiber activity in ex vivo mucosal preparations (evMAR) was compared between male and ovariectomized (OVX) or intact female mice.

Higher responses were recorded in females compared to males, and this difference was attenuated in OVX females. Moreover, estrogen had a marked effect on behavioral measures of visceral sensitivity, determined by evaluating visceral motor responses to colorectal distension. Responses in females were significantly attenuated when OVX depleted estrogen. Notably, a single treatment of OVX females with estradiol benzoate (EB) reversed this attenuation.

Furthermore, the team observed that the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) was expressed at relatively low levels in proximal gut regions but at markedly high levels in a sparse population of cells, especially in the distal colon, where visceral pain is most acutely perceived. This enrichment of ERα in the colon relative to the small intestine suggests regional specialization in estrogen responsiveness. Therefore, they investigated how the loss of ERα impacts visceral sensitivity and gut function.

While mutant mice lacking intestinal ERα showed no changes in gross metabolic parameters (e.g., daily food intake, body weight), colonic motility and GI transit times were significantly accelerated, particularly in females. ERα depletion also reduced mucosal afferent sensitivity in females relative to males. Interestingly, estrogen treatment failed to increase visceral sensitivity in mutant females, indicating that ERα was central to estrogen-dependent enhancement of visceral sensitivity.

Unexpectedly, EC cells lacked ERα, but ERα was found to overlap completely with Pyy-expressing cells, particularly in the distal colon. Additional experiments showed that PYY1-36 could fully restore gut sensitivity in OVX females or after the loss of estrogen signaling in the gut epithelium, and that PYY1-36 acts locally to bind to NPY1R on EC cells, triggering serotonin release that enhances activity of the EC-mucosal afferent circuit and induces gut pain.

The researchers also demonstrated that blocking this pathway pharmacologically—either at the level of NPY1R or the serotonin 5HT3R—abolished the estrogen- and PYY1-36-induced visceral hypersensitivity. These findings reinforce the pathway's central role in mediating pain signaling.

Finally, the researchers identified estrogen-responsive targets that could modulate visceral sensitivity by profiling sorted L-cells from vehicle- or EB-treated OVX females. This revealed multiple targets sensitive to estrogen, including known ERα targets. In total, 248 genes were upregulated and 35 downregulated, highlighting a broad transcriptional response in L-cells, while only a few estrogen-responsive genes were identified in sorted EC cells.

The short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) receptor, encoded by the olfactory receptor 78 (Olfr78), emerged as the top hit, and its expression in L-cells upon estrogen treatment was confirmed. However, Olfr78 was unchanged in EC cells after estrogen treatment. Preincubating female intestinal organoids with estrogen and treating them with acetate (OLFR78 ligand) significantly increased L-cell responses to acetate.

Together, the findings reveal how estrogen signaling modulates paracrine interactions between two EEC subtypes, illuminating the mechanism of heightened visceral sensitivity in females. PYY1-36 from L cells initiates the cellular cascade by amplifying the serotonergic tone in EC cells, activating nearby mucosal spinal afferents. Estrogen plays a crucial role in triggering these events by enhancing PYY release and increasing the sensitivity of L cells to bacterial metabolites (SCFAs) through the upregulation of Olfr78.

The results also suggest therapeutic strategies for conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including combined use of NPY1R and 5HT3R antagonists, alongside dietary interventions that reduce SCFA production (e.g., low FODMAP diets).

Can everyday medications impact your body's most important systems? A genetic study reveals how common painkillers can reshape your gut's microbiome.

Study: Assessing the impact of common pain medications on gut microbiota composition and metabolites: insights from a Mendelian randomization study. Image credit: Tatiana Shepeleva/Shutterstock.com

A study published in the Journal of Medical Microbiology revealed that long-term use of salicylic acid-based painkillers may substantially alter gut microbiota composition and circulating metabolite levels.

The human gut microbiota is crucial in regulating various physiological functions, including metabolic, immune, and neurological functions. The bidirectional communication network between gut microbiota and the brain is referred to as the gut-brain axis, and it has a broad impact on overall health.

The gut-brain axis has gained significant attention in the scientific world due to its involvement in several human diseases, including digestive, immunological, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Chronic pain is a condition of persistent discomfort that can affect a person's physical and mental health. The condition is primarily treated with analgesics, including opioids, anilides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and salicylic acid, which are known to have gastrointestinal side effects.

Emerging evidence suggests that analgesics may affect the functionality of the gut-brain axis, as analgesic receptors are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and brain. Long-term use of analgesics has been found to alter the composition of gut microbiota and circulating levels of gut microbiota-derived metabolites. However, the causal association between these three factors remains uncertain.

Given the increasing use of analgesics and the significant impact of the gut-brain axis on human health, the current study investigated the causal association between common analgesics and gut microbiota.

The study used the Mendelian randomization approach to determine causal associations between genetic susceptibility to four common analgesics used (NSAIDs, salicylic acid, opioids, and anilides) and changes in gut microbiota composition and circulating metabolites.

The Mendelian randomization approach uses genetic variants as the key variables to infer causal relationships between exposures and outcomes; this study uses analgesics and gut microbiota-related alterations, respectively. This approach can effectively rule out the possible bias caused by confounding factors and reverse causality.

It is important to note that this method assesses genetic predisposition to medication use as a substitute for long-term drug exposure rather than measuring the effects of directly taking these medications in a clinical trial.

Summary-level data on analgesic use and gut microbiota were derived from genome-wide association studies primarily involving European ancestry cohorts, including 466,457 participants from the UK Biobank and 18,340 individuals from the MiBioGen consortium.

The study reported a significant impact of salicylic acid use on the abundance of gut microbiota. Specifically, salicylic acid use was associated with a reduced abundance of eight microbiota traits, including genus Clostridiumsensustricto1, Adlercreutzia, Akkermansia, family Clostridiaceae1, and Verrucomicrobiaceae, phylum Verrucomicrobia, class Verrucomicrobiae, and order Verrucomicrobiales and an increased abundance of the family Prevotellaceae. 

The study did not find any significant impact of anilide and opioid use on the gut microbiota composition. Conversely, NSAID exhibited only one causal association with the increased abundance of group Eubacterium xylanophilum.

Regarding circulating metabolites, the study found significant causal associations of salicylic acid use with four metabolites, including acetoacetate, creatinine, omega-3 fatty acids, and triglycerides in very large high-density lipoprotein.  

Among other tested analgesics, anilide exhibited potential causal associations with three metabolites (citrate, glutamine, and urea), opioid with two metabolites (apolipoproteins and glucose), and NSAID with one metabolite (acetoacetate).  

The study identifies significant gut microbiota-altering effects of long-term salicylic acid consumption. Notably, the findings suggest that salicylic acid, as a pain relief medication, can exert potential multi-level effects on the gut microbiota composition. However, the study could not find strong associations with gut microbiota regarding other tested analgesics.

Regarding circulating metabolites, the study finds potential causal associations with all four classes of analgesics tested. The metabolites affected by salicylic acid use play crucial roles in brain glucose uptake, memory decay, and Alzheimer's disease development. Similarly, metabolites affected by anilides and opioids are associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, acute colitis, and schizophrenia.

However, these links are not the direct effects observed in this study; they are discussed as possibilities based on the known roles of these metabolites in disease.

Overall, the study findings highlight the need for future investigations to more conclusively understand the extent to which analgesics can potentially trigger the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric and digestive disorders through the gut-brain axis.

This study is the first of its kind to apply Mendelian randomization to assess the causal relationship between analgesic drugs and gut microbiota. Multiple methods were used to accurately generate Mendelian randomization estimates and substantially improve the robustness of observed associations.

Despite robust methodologies, the study has some limitations. Many factors, including diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle habits, can influence gut microbiota composition. The study analysis did not control for these confounding factors. Further investigations are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms.

Furthermore, the Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted based on the assumption of linear correlation, limiting the possibility of ruling out a nonlinear relationship between exposure and outcome.    

While these results provide evidence of potential causal relationships between certain analgesics and changes in gut microbiota and metabolites, direct clinical studies are needed to confirm these effects and clarify their clinical significance.

Bladder tumors that have been excluded from clinical trials have a few things in common that could lead to new therapies. 

Scientists at UC San Francisco have found a way to identify and possibly treat a mysterious type of bladder cancer that affects up to 1 in 4 cases. 

First, they found a marker on the surface of the tumor cells that until now had only been associated with ovarian cancer; then they designed CAR-T therapy to kill the tumors in mice. 

The discovery, which was made possible through funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), appears June 17 in Nature Communications. 

Unlike conventional bladder cancer, which has a consistent look under the microscope and succumbs predictably to therapy, the deadliest bladder tumors, collectively known as histologic variant (HV) bladder cancer, each look very different and can only be effectively treated with surgery.""

Sima Porten, MD, associate professor of urology at UCSF and co-senior author of the paper

Far too often, however, these tumors grow back.

Using a sequencing technology developed in-house, the researchers analyzed gene expression in single cells in conventional and HV bladder tumors from patients at UCSF. They found that most HV tumors, regardless of subtype, had cells that expressed CA125, which is associated with ovarian cancer. Conventional bladder tumors did not have these cells. 

The HV tumors also had a protein, TM4SF1, on the surface of their cells. Immune cells engineered to home in on TM4SF1 successfully tracked down these tumors in mice and destroyed them - a sign that such immunotherapy could someday be useful in treating the cancer. 

The discovery holds immense promise for patients. HV tumors are often excluded from clinical trials due to their diverse appearances, precluding the development of new therapies.

""Our lab's single cell sequencing technology enabled us to go from patient biopsies to laboratory testing and back to a promising therapy in just a few years,"" said Franklin Huang, MD, PhD, an oncologist and professor of medicine and urology at UCSF who is a co-senior author of the paper. ""We think this could finally move the needle for patients with HV bladder cancer, who typically have very few options for treatment.""

Bedfont's dedicated Wellbeing Garden, which opened in 2023, offers staff a tranquil space to take time out, relax, and reflect. The wellbeing room is another space for staff to take time out, play games, or use the red light therapy machine and CELLER8® Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) device. Red light therapy and PEMF therapy support wellbeing by enhancing cellular function, reducing inflammation, and promoting relaxation, recovery, and overall energy balance.

""At Bedfont®, wellbeing is more than a policy, it's a daily priority.” Said Jason Smith, CEO at Bedfont®. “We genuinely care about how our people feel, and that's why we've introduced things like red light and PEMF therapy, a Wellbeing Garden, and flexible work options. When our team feels supported and balanced, they can perform at their best, individually and collectively.""

Earlier this month, the most recent team-building event saw the Bedfont® office close for the afternoon, and staff were treated to various activities and relaxation at St Andrews Lake. This is just one of many initiatives arranged by the Wellbeing Warriors, which give staff a much-needed wellbeing boost.

By embedding wellbeing into its culture and daily operations, Bedfont® has seen the positive impact, and other organizations can benefit from a similar approach.

Mursla Bio, a leader in Extracellular Vesicle (EV) science on a mission to advance precision diagnostics and significantly improve cancer outcomes for at-risk patients, today announced the commercial launch of its AI Precision Medicine Platform, alongside a pre-print reporting the first validated method for isolating hepatocyte EVs from plasma for organ-specific proteomic and miRNA profiling. Mursla Bio is engaging with potential partners to apply its Platform to additional disease areas, biomarker discovery and IVD translation programs.

The Platform addresses a major gap in liquid biopsy and precision medicine: enabling non-invasive access to organ-specific molecular information from blood with high spatial and biological resolution. Mursla Bio's Platform is built on its ability to isolate and analyze EVs which are secreted by specific organs into the bloodstream. The Platform reduces non-target background by up to five orders of magnitude compared to standard bulk EV isolation and significantly improves data structure, enhancing prediction model generalization.

The pre-print presents the first multi-layered validation of hepatocyte EV isolation in humans, confirming liver origin through proteomic and nucleic acid markers. Key supporting proteomics data was generated in collaboration with Evotec International GmbH. Patient samples were provided by University College London, with Professor Brian Davidson, a global leader in liver disease surgery and clinical research, contributing as a co-author. The study shows that Mursla Bio's method yields robust, organ-specific multi-omics data using minimal blood volume, offering a novel scalable approach for biomarker and AI development.

Mursla Bio's Platform incorporates optimized multi-omics workflows, embedded AI pipelines, and IVD translation processes to convert complex biological signals into practical, regulatory-grade assays. These assays are deployable on standard commercial instruments using patented, PCR and ELISA-like steps designed for clinical adoption. The Platform also underpins the development of EvoLiver™, the Company's lead clinical program for liver cancer surveillance in cirrhotic patients. Built on multi-omics data from over 300 patients, EvoLiver achieved 86% sensitivity and 88% specificity on a locked, IVD-compatible assay for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma detection², and has received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA³.

EVs are nature's native signal enrichment system for long-distance communication between cells and organs. Our platform harnesses this biology to non-invasively access organ-specific, multi-omics data from just a small blood sample. It produces structured, biologically labeled datasets that are optimized for AI and ready to support diagnostic translation. EvoLiver is our first proof point of real-world clinical impact, and we are now expanding access to the platform to advance our pipeline and enable partnerships across other disease areas.""

Pierre Arsène, Founder and CEO, Mursla Bio

Mursla Bio is expanding its pipeline and collaborations, with additional organ programs underway in cardiometabolic, lung, and neurological indications. The Platform will support pharma development through dynamic patient stratification, therapeutic response monitoring, surrogate markers and molecular phenotyping across complex disease biology.

Black patients are more likely to experience minor complications after metabolic and bariatric surgery than White patients, according to new study presented today at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

Researchers from the Yale School of Medicine found Black patients had a higher overall incidence of minor complications such as dehydration, trips to the emergency department (ED) and infections in each of the seven years, growing from 10.2% in 2016 to 15% in 2023 versus 7.6% to 12.1% for White patients. Post-operative visits to the ED not requiring hospital admission, increased from 6.1% to 9.1%, and IV treatments for hydration, from 3.7% to 4.6%. Serious complication (0.4%) and mortality rates (0.1%) remained low throughout the seven years and were about the same for both patient groups.

We were surprised the minor complication rate increased year after year and that racial disparities persisted. More work is needed to identify what's causing the uptick and how it can be reversed. A focus on enhanced discharge education and an action plan surrounding postoperative hydration may be beneficial.""

Safraz Hamid, MD, study co-author, Yale School of Medicine

Researchers reviewed the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database to identify 1,106,419 patients (75% White patients, 25% Black patients) who had either primary laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) between 2016 and 2023. Surgical complications were ranked for severity using the Clavien-Dindo system and rates of complications were compared between the two patient groups.

""The study underscores the safety of metabolic and bariatric surgery but also suggests a need to focus more attention on identifying patients at higher risk for minor complications so that we can take measures to prevent them,"" said ASMBS President Ann M. Rogers, MD, MD, FACS, FASMBS, who was not involved in the study. ""This study reveals a trend that we should work to understand better and need to reverse.""

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of obesity and severe obesity is 40.3% and 9.4%, respectively. Studies show the disease can weaken or impair the body's immune system and cause chronic inflammation and increase the risk of many other diseases and conditions including cardiovascular disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.

People who have metabolic and bariatric surgery are significantly less likely to develop psychiatric disorders compared to those who take weekly injections of GLP-1 anti-obesity medications, according to a new study presented today at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting. Over a five-year period, the risk of developing cognitive deficits was 54% lower and 18% and 17% lower for anxiety disorders and substance use disorders, respectively.

The study shows metabolic and bariatric surgery confers a strong protective effect against common mental health disorders in a head-to-head comparison with GLP-1 pharmacotherapy. The data supports embedding psychiatric screening and support within both surgical and medical obesity programs to help reduce the potential mental health burden after treatment. Further investigation is needed, however, to determine why the psychological impact is so different between treatment modalities.""

Shauna Levy, MD, MS, study co-author, Assistant Professor, Chief, Division of MIS/Bariatric Surgery, Tulane University School Medicine

Researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of metabolic and bariatric surgery patients and patients on GLP-1 agonists, semaglutide, liraglutide, and dulaglutide, using the TriNetX database. After propensity score matching to balance demographic and clinical characteristics, 33,600 surgical patients and 33,600 pharmacotherapy patients were compared for the incidence of new psychiatric disorders. The follow-up period lasted up to five years.

""Maintaining mental health is important regardless of treatment choice. Even small differences can impact quality of life, so patients and their doctors should be proactive about monitoring mood, cognition, and substance use after starting any obesity therapy. Mental health is just as important as physical health and must be considered along with any treatment,"" said Ann M. Rogers, MD, MD, ACS FASMBS, President, ASMBS, who was not involved in the study.

A new proteomics study reveals that even short-term COVID-19 in children can leave behind blood markers of cardiovascular risk, particularly in those with MIS-C, challenging the notion that children recover unscathed.

Study: Children with Post COVID-19 Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Display Unique Pathophysiological Metabolic Phenotypes. Image Credit: Chatchai.wa / Shutterstock

Observational accounts have led many clinicians to believe that, unlike their adult counterparts, children generally experience milder outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the underlying metabolic effects have not been fully characterized. In a recent study in the Journal of Proteome Research, a collaborative research team from the Australian National Phenome Centre and Harvard analysed blood plasma samples (n = 147) from pediatric patients to investigate these effects.

Advanced blood characterization tools identified acute disruptions in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, known markers of long-term cardiovascular risk. During acute COVID-19 infections, children exhibit plasma signatures similar to those observed in adults with severe COVID-19, which contain markers associated with long-term cardiovascular risk. This study challenges the assumptions of a universally mild pediatric COVID-19 and calls for further investigation and monitoring in children to mitigate future cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

Children have long been considered largely untouched by COVID-19's long-term consequences, especially concerning heart health. However, the emergence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), alongside broader reports of persistent symptoms in pediatric long COVID cases, has shattered these perceptions, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can spark life-threatening systemic inflammation weeks after recovery from mild COVID-associated respiratory illnesses.

MIS-C is a rare but severe condition characterized by potentially life-threatening multi-organ inflammation across cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and mucocutaneous systems. A growing body of evidence suggests shared metabolic pathways between some post-COVID illnesses and the severe inflammatory response seen in MIS-C.

Unfortunately, given the relative novelty of COVID-19 and the prevailing scientific views on child-associated SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, only a handful of studies have explored the lingering metabolic effects of pediatric COVID-19. Data from blood-based biomarker analyses, particularly those that identify previously undetected, long-term cardiovascular risks, are lacking.

The present study aims to address existing scientific knowledge gaps by conducting a comprehensive suite of advanced biochemical and proteomic assays on children during acute COVID-19 and MIS-C.

Study data were obtained from the Massachusetts General Hospital Pediatric COVID-19 Biorepository, Boston, US, and included sociodemographic information and medical health records. Biometric measures and plasma samples were collected once from each participant during their acute illness.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions were used to classify the study participants into three categories: 1. Healthy children who had never been infected by SARS-CoV-2 (healthy), 2. Acute COVID-19 (COVID-19), and 3. Confirmed MIS-C cases (MIS-C). All participant plasma samples were subjected to high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to facilitate the identification of a broad spectrum of metabolites.

To obtain a detailed metabolic fingerprint, researchers used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data to identify and quantify cholesterol and its derivatives, triglycerides, and inflammatory markers. They then compared these metabolic profiles to those from a previously studied cohort of adults with COVID-19.

Statistical analyses included principal component analyses (PCAs) to identify the primary sources of data variation, random forest data imputation (for missing data), and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) for elucidating infection-associated data variance. The data were subsequently analyzed and visualized using multivariate analyses, adjusted for demographics and other confounding factors.

The final study sample cohort comprised 147 children. CDC guidelines classified these participants into three groups: 1. 66 healthy children (no SARS-CoV-2 infections), 2. 55 with acute COVID-19 infections (25% severe), and 3. 26 with MIS-C. MIS-C patients exhibited symptoms involving the cardiovascular, mucocutaneous, and gastrointestinal systems.

Study findings revealed several alarming outcomes:

Children with COVID-19 (particularly those with MIS-C) demonstrated marked alterations in lipid metabolism during their acute illness. These include elevated triglyceride levels indicative of pediatric hypertriglyceridemia, marked reductions in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations, and increased inflammatory lipoproteins, as well as certain low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles.

Elevated triglycerides and specific LDL particles are hallmarks of early cardiovascular disease, while HDL cholesterol is a known protective factor against cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. These findings hence suggest that children with acute COVID-19 (especially MIS-C patients) exhibit a profile that may place them at increased risk of chronic CVD outcomes.

Lipoprotein analyses revealed that the inflammatory lipoproteins in children with COVID-19 and MIS-C showed a strong similarity to those seen in adults with severe COVID-19.

The authors also noted a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in the patient cohorts, which they suggest could be a contributing factor that exacerbates the observed lipid abnormalities and future cardiovascular risk.

Notably, individuals in the healthy control group did not mirror any of these findings, suggesting a COVID-19-specific metabolic shift in childhood patients.

The present study debunks the comforting assumption that children experience mild COVID-19 infections without lasting consequences. It highlights that children with acute COVID-19 and MIS-C develop metabolic profiles closely resembling those containing markers of future cardiovascular risk. MIS-C patients, in particular, showed significant metabolic disruption, foreshadowing potential long-term cardiovascular risk.

These insights underscore the need for further investigation into the lasting effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pediatric health. Clinicians and public health officials must now consider that follow-up beyond respiratory recovery may be warranted to facilitate timely treatment and mitigate potential long-term health implications.

Shining a spotlight on the urgent need for better regulation and honest marketing. New research reveals how supermarket catalogs are steering Australian parents towards unhealthy packaged foods for infants and toddlers.

Study: The marketing of commercial foods for infants and toddlers in Australian supermarket catalogues. Image credit: FamVeld/Shutterstock.com

Supermarkets in Australia promote commercially packaged foods for infants and toddlers with little regulation, potentially normalizing unhealthy foods for young children. This was the focus of a recent study published in Health Promotion International.

The Australian Infant Feeding Guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for up to six months, after which solid foods should be introduced. Like adults, children need a healthy diet. This should include fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains (core foods) while avoiding highly processed food with high saturated fat, excessive salt, sugar, and sodium (discretionary or “junk” foods).

Between one and three years, children should be fed all the core foods (vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, meats or meat alternatives, and dairy or dairy alternatives) served to adults at mealtimes. In reality, 80% of Australian two-year-olds eat too little fruit and vegetables, and 60% regularly consume junk food treats, mostly snacks and sweet drinks. These make up a third of their total caloric intake.

Commercial spaces constantly push food marketing, mostly junk food, onto consumers. This decides children's food preferences and eating patterns. It also heavily influences how parents perceive and choose food products for children.

 “The result is a food marketing environment that promotes unhealthy products at multiple points along a consumer's ‘path to purchase', nudging consumers towards unhealthy eating behaviors.”

There is little regulation for the marketing of commercial foods targeting infants and children in Australia, though sales are rapidly growing. The study refers to commercial infant and toddler foods (CITFs) as packaged foods or drinks marketed explicitly as suitable for children under three years, other than breastmilk substitutes. Squeeze pouches dominated the global market for infant and toddler foods, with US$2,111 million in 2018. By 2026, spout pack sales are expected to have grown by 7.5%. 

Besides being high in sugar and low in iron, these soft foods, if used too long, prevent children from learning to eat and enjoy lumpy, non-sweet foods and may shape lifelong unhealthy food preferences.

In one Australian survey, one in two parents reported that these foods comprised half of what their children ate. Apart from being tasty, self-feeding-friendly, and affordable, parents felt they were healthy and nutritious and appreciated not having to worry about cooking or food safety. Parental anxiety and uncertainty about food preparation and concerns about food safety also contribute, especially among single parents and families experiencing socioeconomic disadvantages.

These foods and their marketing strategies are specifically designed to target parents and caregivers of young children, with packaging and messaging sometimes appealing to the children themselves. The current study examined the products and their marketing via supermarket catalogs.

Digital and paper catalogs are the basis of grocery shopping for 75% of Australian shoppers, often luring people to buy things not on their list. Supermarket catalogs reach a large audience and capture an average of six minutes of attention. One in three people read them from cover to cover.

The current study used weekly catalogs from four major Australian supermarket chains (Aldi, Coles, IGA, and Woolworths) – representing 70% of the Australian market, downloaded for 12 successive weeks. Aldi's catalogs were among the most widely read, although in this study, Aldi featured CIFT promotions in only one catalog.

The researchers analyzed over 2,000 pages from 60 different catalogs. Overall, 63% of the catalogs promoted food or drinks, mostly junk food (56%). Infant and toddler foods comprised 3.5% of all pages, being promoted across 49 pages in the catalogs.

While some CIFTs are more nutritious than others, most products promoted were discretionary and often misaligned with guidelines, even among some core food categories. Even many commercial foods marketed as ‘core' or nutritious options for infants and toddlers do not meet Australian or WHO nutritional standards

While 74% targeted infants, 26% were labeled for toddlers aged 12 - 36 months, and 21% were labeled as suitable for infants from four months of age. These complementary foods should be used only from six months to two years.

A single page in one Aldi's catalog featured eight items, six sweets, and two snacks. At the same time, 92% of Coles' catalogs included promotions for 54 different items. Among all infant and toddler food promotions, fruit purees, primarily for infants, comprised 40%, while snacks and sweets accounted for 27% and 12% of promotions respectively.

However, the exact share varied between supermarkets. Woolworths had 44% fruit purees and snack promotions, IGA had 56% and 5%, and Coles featured 31% and 39% in its catalog.

Pouches made up 50% of all packaging types, used for 59% of foods for infant consumption but only 20% for toddlers. For toddler foods, boxes were the most common packaging, accounting for 47%.

Marketing techniques included offering low prices (95%), using baby-related text or images, health-related text, and images of healthy foods. Catalogs and food packaging carry visuals of core foods, babies, toys, and other props, with 90% on the same page as other everyday baby products such as wipes or diapers.

Associating commercial baby foods with other commonly used infant or toddler products normalized their use and directed parental attention away from core foods. This placement, along with labeling some products as suitable from four months of age, may undermine breastfeeding recommendations that advocate exclusive breastfeeding until six months old.

Many parents view providing ultra-processed snacks to very young children as normal. These snacks replace healthier, iron-rich foods in the diet, increasing the risk of micronutrient deficiencies. In many cases, promotions for infant formula or toddler milk drinks appeared alongside these foods, potentially discouraging breastfeeding.

Most are marketed with misleading on-pack labeling, claiming, for instance, to be preservative-free. This type of claim creates a “health halo,” making products appear healthier than they are. Research shows this is especially persuasive for families with three or more children or those facing higher stress levels and time pressure.

Global health organizations, notably the World Health Organization (WHO), have made efforts to guide food marketing for young children. Yet, most of these foods do not meet either the Australian food guidelines or the WHO guidelines.

Paying attention to dietary patterns in infancy and early childhood promotes learning of lifelong healthy eating habits. Yet most commercial foods for infants and toddlers are unhealthy and promote negative nutritional patterns and eating behaviors.

Although a minority of catalog pages featured CIFTs, the placement and marketing techniques may have influenced parents to normalize feeding packaged foods to infants and toddlers rather than encouraging meals and snacks prepared from whole foods.

This should encourage policies to minimize supermarket catalog promotions, helping parents escape misinformation and choose healthier foods for their young children. They should make efforts “to curtail the unhealthy influence of food marketing on children's diets and reorient this powerful marketing medium towards promoting healthier whole foods over processed, packaged commercial foods for infants and toddlers.”

It is important to note that the study focused on major supermarket chains and digital catalogs and did not examine smaller retailers or other marketing channels. The authors also acknowledge that content analysis alone cannot prove the direct impact on purchasing or dietary behaviors. These limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings.

Digital inhalers may help predict impending acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to a new study. The study is published in the May 2025 issue of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases: Journal of the COPD Foundation, a peer-reviewed, open-access journal.

COPD is an inflammatory lung disease, comprising several conditions, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be caused by genetics and irritants like smoke or pollution. The disease affects more than 30 million Americans and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide.

Exacerbations, or flare-ups, can cause accelerated loss of lung function, a decrease in quality of life, and reduce a person's physical function and activity. More than 50% of people with COPD experience at least one acute COPD exacerbation within four years of an initial COPD diagnosis. Increased respiratory rates and decreased lung volumes are early signs of an exacerbation.

This new study examines how digital inhalers using remote monitoring data can help predict and identify early or impending COPD exacerbations. The digital inhaler used in this study measured peak inspiratory flow, inhalation volume, inhalation duration, time to peak inhalation, and inhaler use. The study examined whether the data collected by the digital inhaler could identify a possible early-stage exacerbation.

While this study examined a small group of participants, the remote monitoring data showed people experienced significant decreases in the amount of air they inhaled and how long that inhalation lasted in the approximately two weeks prior to experiencing an exacerbation. As these remote monitoring technologies get more advanced, we can help both patients and health care providers identify exacerbations earlier, which allows us to provide better exacerbation management and improve health outcomes.""

Researchers uncover subtype-specific effects of tea, soda, and pesticides on Parkinson's disease, revealing how lifestyle and environment can shape motor symptom severity long after diagnosis.

Study: Longitudinal assessment of the association between pesticide exposure and lifestyle with Parkinson's disease motor severity. Image Credit: Pixel-Shot / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal npj Parkinson's Disease, researchers investigated how lifestyle factors and environmental exposures affect the severity of motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease over time.

They found that the consumption of black tea was linked to milder motor symptoms in one form of the disease. At the same time, pesticide exposure and the consumption of caffeinated soda have been implicated in worsening motor symptoms in another disease type.

Sugar's role hinted: Diet caffeinated soda, which lacks the high sugar of regular soda, showed no link to motor severity. This suggests sugar might be the key driver behind regular soda's negative effects.

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder currently affecting about 12 million people worldwide, with cases rising by over 60% from 1990 to 2021. The lack of a cure means the burden on society continues to grow.

Around 15% of Parkinson's cases are caused by single gene mutations or strong risk factors, with the LRRK2 G2019S variant being the most common for autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (LRRK2-PD).

Previous research suggests that LRRK2-PD patients often have more pronounced motor issues but less severe non-motor symptoms compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) patients.

Environmental and lifestyle factors also play a significant role in the development and progression of this condition. Pesticide exposure is a well-established risk factor, linked to earlier disease onset and faster progression.

Other environmental risks, like air pollution, solvents, and heavy metals, show mixed results. Drinking coffee and smoking consistently appear protective, delaying onset in both iPD and LRRK2-PD, whereas caffeinated soda may hasten onset in LRRK2-PD.

However, the effect of these factors on motor severity over time remains unclear, especially for smoking and caffeine intake. Cross-sectional studies hint that smoking could worsen symptoms post-onset, creating a paradox where a factor that protects against developing the disease might be harmful after diagnosis.

Therefore, more robust longitudinal studies using large cohorts are needed to clarify how environment and lifestyle impact motor symptom progression, particularly distinguishing between LRRK2-PD and iPD.

Sex-specific vulnerability: Women with iPD who drank caffeinated soda experienced a much stronger worsening of motor symptoms than men.

This study used data from two large online cohorts. Participants with Parkinson's disease were recruited and followed through routine online assessments of non-motor and motor symptoms, as well as detailed questionnaires on lifestyle habits and environmental exposures.

Ethical approval and informed consent were secured for both cohorts.

To ensure consistency, only participants with an age at onset of over 25 years, a disease duration of under 50 years, and at least three motor assessments were included. This resulted in 5,134 iPD patients and 81 LRRK2-PD patients.

Motor symptom severity was measured using a cumulative score, consistently collected in both cohorts. Follow-up lasted up to 35 months for one cohort and 60 months for the second, divided into discrete periods for analysis.

Environmental and lifestyle factors, including pesticide exposure, smoking, and caffeine intake, were measured using standardized Parkinson's disease Risk Factor Questionnaires.

Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the relationship between these factors and motor symptom progression over time. The models adjusted for age at onset, disease duration, experience of OFF episodes, and sex, with the patient's identification number as a random effect.

Significance thresholds were adjusted for multiple comparisons in pesticide exposure analyses; other analyses were exploratory. This approach ensured a robust, longitudinal assessment of how environment and lifestyle may influence Parkinson's disease motor outcomes.

Unique vulnerability of LRRK2-PD: The beneficial effect of black tea was specific to LRRK2-PD, with a significant interaction between PD type and tea consumption (p=0.045), meaning black tea didn't just help, it helped differently in this genetic subtype.

Across multiple assessments, motor symptoms worsened gradually in both groups, but iPD patients generally showed more severe progression than LRRK2-PD patients.

Notably, exposure to pesticides at work was linked to greater motor severity in iPD patients in the PPMI-Online cohort, with a similar but non-significant trend observed in the Fox Insight cohort. This association persisted after adjusting for sex. No such association was found in LRRK2-PD patients.

Smoking was also associated with increased motor symptom severity over time in iPD patients. This effect was significant in the PPMI-Online cohort, but only a subtle trend was observed in the Fox Insight cohort. This effect held after controlling for sex.

Regarding caffeinated drinks, black tea consumption did not influence motor severity in iPD but was linked to milder symptoms in LRRK2-PD patients. While the authors caution that this subgroup was small, they strengthened this preliminary finding by replicating it in a second, independent cohort of LRRK2-PD patients.

Conversely, caffeinated soda consumption was associated with more severe motor symptoms in iPD patients and showed a similar trend in LRRK2-PD, though less robustly. The paper notes that caffeinated diet soda, which lacks high sugar content, showed no such association.

Interestingly, the link between caffeinated soda intake and worse motor symptoms was stronger among women than men with iPD. Consumption of coffee and green tea showed no clear impact on motor symptom progression in either group.

This study highlights the impact of environmental and lifestyle factors on the progression of Parkinson's disease. It found that pesticide exposure and caffeinated soda intake were linked to worse motor symptoms in iPD, while smoking showed a weaker association that was not consistent across both study cohorts.

For LRRK2-PD, black tea consumption appeared protective, though this effect was not seen in iPD, suggesting subtype-specific impacts. This finding is notable because it was observed in two independent cohorts, although both were small.

The study's strengths include its large sample size, long follow-up period, and use of two independent cohorts, which support robust findings. However, small LRRK2-PD samples limit generalizability, and other monogenic forms have not been thoroughly examined. Lack of data on medication doses, dietary details (such as sugar intake), and potential recall bias are additional limitations.

Despite these, the study emphasizes that environmental exposures, which are harder to control than lifestyle choices, can worsen Parkinson's symptoms even after disease onset. The findings also underscore how a factor like smoking can be protective before onset but potentially harmful after, and suggest how ingredients like sugar in soda may play a role separate from caffeine.

Future research should confirm these results in larger, diverse genetic groups and use objective measures of exposure. Understanding these relationships may help tailor prevention and management strategies for different Parkinson's disease subtypes.

The higher a person's body mass index (BMI), the higher their risk for complications after bariatric surgery, especially those with BMI of 50 or more, according to a new study presented today at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

Researchers found that the rate of complications increased by an average of 5.56% and serious occurrences rose 3.21% from the lowest BMI category to the highest, with people with a BMI 50 or more the most likely to experience complications of any kind.

The study gives new insights into the risks associated with each BMI category and identifies the inflection point for increased risk of morbidity and mortality, which occurs when patients pass BMI 50,"" said study co-author John Scott, MD, FACS, FASMBS, Chief for the Division of Minimal Access and Bariatric Surgery for the Prisma Health Dept. of Surgery in Greenville, SC. ""Obesity itself is a risk factor in surgeries of all kinds, but in bariatric surgery the risks remain relatively low.""

The retrospective study involved a review of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database for patients with obesity (BMI 30 or more) who had either sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between 2020 and 2023. A total of 665,047 cases were included.

""While complication rates are generally low, this study provides granular data not previously reported that can help with pre-operative counseling and to make surgery even safer and patient outcomes even better,"" said Richard M. Peterson, MD, MPH, FACS, FASMBS, President-elect, ASMBS, and Professor of Surgery, UT Health San Antonio, who was not involved in the study.

A new modeling study finds that replacing a single serving of fruit with berries each day dramatically improves anthocyanin and fiber intake, offering a simple, cost-effective upgrade to American diets.

Study: Effect of replacing commonly consumed fruit in the United States with berries in the USDA healthy Dietary Patterns: a modeling analysis. Image Credit: Sabino Parente / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Annals of Medicine, a group of researchers evaluated the nutritional effects of substituting commonly eaten fruits with berries in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) dietary models.

Why do most Americans eat the same fruits every day, like apples, bananas, and grapes, even though a wide variety is available? According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), most adults in the US do not eat fruit every day, and when they do, they often rely on just a few types. This limited variety may reduce exposure to important nutrients and bioactive compounds such as anthocyanins, which are especially rich in berries.

Anthocyanins are associated with cardiovascular benefits and may improve vascular function and metabolic health, although clinical intake recommendations are not yet established. Despite these potential benefits, berries are under-consumed in typical American diets. Further research is needed to understand how incorporating more berries into daily fruit intake can improve overall nutritional quality.

Fruit categorization matters: Unlike vegetables, which have official subgroups in dietary guidelines, fruits lack targeted categorization, potentially limiting nutrient diversity in American diets.

The researchers used the USDA food pattern modeling method to explore the nutritional effects of replacing one daily serving of commonly consumed fruit like apple, banana, or grape, with one serving of berries. This substitution was tested in three USDA dietary models: Healthy Mediterranean-Style (HMS), Healthy United States-Style (HUS), and Healthy Vegetarian (HV). Each model was designed for a 2,000-calorie daily intake over a 7-day menu. Each day included two servings of fruit, with the intervention replacing seven of the fourteen weekly servings of common fruits with berries.

Nutrient analysis was conducted using the Elizabeth Stewart Hands and Associates (ESHA) Food Processor software version 11.14.x. The software utilized data from multiple databases, including the USDA FoodData Central and the USDA Database for Flavonoid Content of Selected Foods, Release 3.3. Over a 7-day menu, berry servings included three cups of blueberries and four cups of a mixed blend (blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries), with one cup consumed daily in place of a commonly eaten fruit.

The researchers evaluated changes in energy, macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), dietary fiber (total and soluble), vitamins, minerals, and anthocyanins. Food cost estimates were derived from Walmart retail prices in Grand Junction, Colorado, which reflected average pricing in the US market.

Anthocyanin intake is low: Current US adults consume just 13.8–16.4mg anthocyanins daily; berry substitution nearly doubled this intake in the models.

Replacing one daily serving of commonly consumed fruit with one serving of berries led to a 93.8% increase in anthocyanin intake across all three dietary models. This major gain in bioactive compounds was achieved without significant changes in calorie count, fat, protein, or cholesterol, suggesting that the substitution was nutritionally balanced.

In the HUS model, total dietary fiber increased by 5.1% and soluble fiber by 10.1%. Vitamin C rose by 16%, while vitamin E and vitamin K increased by 6.0% and 5.4%, respectively. Sugar intake dropped by 8.1%, and total carbohydrates decreased by 3.1%. Protein and fat values remained nearly the same. The weekly cost of food increased by $7.28, a 10.4% rise compared to the baseline menu. Potassium decreased by 3.3%, while other minerals changed by less than 2%.

The HMS model showed similar trends, with total fiber increasing by 4.7% and soluble fiber rising by 5.3%. Vitamin C increased by 13.9%, vitamin E by 5.3%, and vitamin K by 4.7%. Sugar intake declined by 8.1%, and carbohydrates showed a modest decrease. The weekly cost of food increased by $6.72, marking a 9.2% increase. Potassium decreased slightly by 1.2%, with minimal changes in other minerals.

In the HV model, soluble fiber rose by 10.2%, and total fiber increased by 1%. Vitamin C rose by 11.9%, vitamin E by 5.4%, and vitamin K by 5.1%. Carbohydrate intake dropped by 4.6%, and sugar fell by 9.2%. Potassium decreased slightly by 3.8%, while other minerals showed minimal changes. The cost of food increased by $6.97 per week, a 10.5% rise.

Berry seeds hold hidden value: Beyond flesh nutrients, berry seeds may offer understudied vitamin E benefits, adding to their nutritional profile.

These results suggest that incorporating berries into the USDA dietary patterns enhances nutritional quality without compromising calorie or macronutrient balance. The increase in fiber and key vitamins is particularly relevant, given the widespread deficiency of these nutrients in American diets. The weekly grocery cost increased by about 10%, yet remained within the USDA's moderate-cost food plan range ($73.90–$87.60 per week for adults aged 19–50 in 2024).

These nutrient gains may justify the added cost, particularly for households aiming to improve diet quality through small, sustainable changes. However, the authors noted that because this was a modeling analysis, the findings may not accurately reflect actual individual food intake.

To summarize, replacing one serving of commonly eaten fruit with a serving of berries in the USDA dietary models led to notable improvements in nutrient density. Anthocyanins, fiber, and key vitamins, including vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin K, increased significantly, while calorie and macronutrient levels remained stable.

These benefits were observed in all three USDA dietary patterns. While food costs increased by approximately 10%, they remained comparable to those outlined in the USDA's moderate-cost weekly food plan.

This modeling analysis suggests that including berries as a daily fruit option may offer nutritional benefits without compromising dietary balance or affordability. Including berry subgroups in future federal dietary recommendations may offer a practical strategy for improving public health nutrition.

The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team will host its first-ever College Talent ID Camp, and a handful of local players received an invitation.

Presley Freeman (BYU), Abby Sine (BYU), Lucy Kesler (BYU midfielder), Kunie Hirai (Utah State), and Austin Miller (Utah State) were the locals to be invited.

Forty-two players have been called up to a first-of-its-kind Women's College Talent ID Camp taking place in June.

Freeman is a sophomore defender from Atlanta, Georgia. In high school, she was named the Georgia Gatorade Player of the Year, Region 7A Player of the Year, and helped lead her school to the 2024 7A GHSA State Championship.

In her freshman year with the Cougars, Freeman played 1,658 minutes and logged two assists and five shots.

Sine is a sophomore defender from Coppell, Texas. Coming out of high school, she was a four-star recruit and ranked as the No. 2 prospect in the state of Texas by PrepSoccer.

In 2024, Sine played in nine games and had one shot attempt.

Kesler is a sophomore midfielder from American Fork, Utah. As a three-time varsity starter at American Fork High School, she was named to to the Deseret News First Team All-State, the Deseret News offensive MVP, and was also a 2024 6A American Fork State Champion finalist.

In her freshman campaign, Kesler played in 19 games with 12 starts and 1,335 minutes on the pitch. She finished the year with one goal, three assists, and 19 total shots. Those stats earned her a spot on the All-Big 12 All-Freshman Team.

Hirai is a freshman forward from Boise, Idaho. She was a four-year letterwinner at Boise High School and helped lead the team to a 2022 state championship. In each of the other three years, Boise was the runner-up in the 5A division.

Miller is a sophomore forward from Providence, Utah. She was a first-team all-state and all-region player in 2021 and 2022 and helped lead the Green Canyon Wolves to their first-ever state championship in 2023.

In her freshman year with the Aggies, Miller played in all 24 games, recorded four goals and five assists, and was put on the Mountain West All-Newcomer team.

According to a press release, 42 players from 28 different colleges will head to Atlanta from June 18 to 22.

The camp's purpose is to “increase programming opportunities for college-specific players and expand the U.S. Under-18, Under-19 and Under-20 Women's National Team player pools.”

Nicole Lukic, U.S. Soccer's Director of Talent ID for women and girls, said that the idea of the camp originally came up in January meetings.

“The project initially arose from the January WNT Way meetings, where we held interactive workshops and brainstorming with all departments, to look at everything we do through a female-specific lens,” Lukic said. “When looking at player scouting through a female-specific lens, our Women's Talent ID team recognized an opportunity to adapt our strategy to continue to expand our player pools in the older age groups.”

Lukic went on to say that the program felt it was a good time to “further develop our female-specific scouting strategy, dive deeper into our data and analysis of scouting pathways, and create this unique camp opportunity.”

BYU and Michigan State are the schools with the most players invited with three each.

Hayes gives players ‘much-needed' rest

Just months into the job, head coach Emma Hayes pushed the U.S. women's national team nearly to the brink at the Olympics — she even referenced the ultramarathon ideology of the “pain cave.” But like any good leader, Hayes understands balance. This year she's giving key players a “much-needed break.”

Advertisement

Roughly 10 days out from the next USWNT camp, we are still waiting for the roster. But Hayes revealed in an interview with ESPN that she plans to give the Europe-based players the next summer window off. This includes two games against Ireland in Denver and Cincinnati next week and one versus Canada in Washington, D.C., on July 2.

With the 2027 World Cup in Brazil two years away and her core group starting to take shape, Hayes said that “player welfare” and “rest and recovery” are important, especially considering number of games played, the length of seasons and the frequency of games since the 2023 World Cup. The camp will help key players returning from injury, too.

📺 Hayes has handed out nearly two dozen first-time call-ups already. Watch former USWNT midfielder Sam Mewis share who she thinks should be next.

A tale of 2 teams

I won't reference the U.S. men often in this newsletter, but I think there is too stark of a juxtaposition between the teams right now not to. (And with Midge Purce pointing out the drama, it only felt right.) For those who don't know, here's what the men have been up to:

The situations aren't identical, and we won't know if Hayes' approach will pay off until 2027, but it does appear she's getting ahead of any future tension by considering her players' workload before competitive matches pick back up.

US Women's million-dollar goal scorer

Evelyn Shores was still jetlagged from her trip to Germany when she scored the goal worth $1 million for the US Women at The Soccer Tournament last week.

The 20-year-old Atlanta native had a breakout year after consecutive injuries sidelined her during her senior year of high school and freshman season at UNC — the school she'd dreamed of attending since eighth grade.

 

 

A post shared by TST (@tst7v7)



Unfortunately for Shores, NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes from accepting prize money. However, she wasn't in it for that.

“Playing one-v-one in practice with Carli Lloyd the day after flying in from Germany? That was insane,” she told Asli. “They made us feel like equals. That was the craziest part.”

Could she be the next U.S. player called into the senior team?

The less said about Angel City's last-gasp loss at home to the North Carolina Courage the better for Angel City fans. However, the events happening off the pitch at BMO Stadium went beyond soccer this weekend and took center stage in the NWSL, following a week of immigration raids and resulting protests in Los Angeles.

The club distributed 10,000 T-shirts reading “Immigrant City Football Club” and “Los Angeles is for everyone / Los Ángeles es para todos” to players, staff, supporters and fans. They are also available in their online shop, with net proceeds going to a local legal service for immigrants.

“The fabric of this city is made of immigrants. Football does not exist without immigrants. This club does not exist without immigrants,” Angel City wrote on a message card handed out on Saturday night. Founding investor and recording artist Becky G also read it out before the match.

It was an affirmative, if not outright earnest, reply from Angel City as a club and as a part of the Los Angeles community to the fear and uncertainty stemming from the week's events. The NWSLPA also released a joint statement with the WNBA players association, and Chicago Stars FC pointed to local resources in a brief statement.

The league itself has yet to address the topic, however, even if it was clear how the NWSL community as a whole appreciated Angel City's willingness to step up and meet the moment.

Lyonnes in talks with USWNT teen star

Lily the Lyonne might have to become a thing.

Ajax and USWNT midfielder Lily Yohannes, who recently celebrated her 18th birthday, may soon be the latest signing of OL Lyonnes, joining French striker Marie Antoinette Katoto and incoming head coach Jonathan Giráldez, making the eight-time Champions League title holders look even more ferocious next season.

Last week, Tamerra reported that Ajax, where Yohannes signed her first professional contract, and the French powerhouse were in talks over a potential summer transfer, introducing a bit of a plot twist to the recent reports that the Springfield, Va., native might be headed to Chelsea. A source said Ajax's talks are currently focused on OL Lyonnes, though nothing has been signed yet. Trust and believe Chelsea fans will be processing this as a loss if the deal goes through.

World Cup 2031 check-in

With all this talk about the men's World Cup next year, we asked Asli to get the lowdown on the women's tournament the U.S. is hosting alongside Mexico in 2031.

U.S. Soccer kicked off its city selection process last month. Twenty-nine cities, including 11 cities that will host the 2026 men's World Cup, received the information packets. The list is not exclusive, meaning if another city wants to throw its hat in the ring, it can. But time is running short. The deadline to submit detailed proposals is September, and formal bids must be submitted to FIFA at the end of November, according to sources. 

The timing is notable: 2026 host cities haven't even had a chance to evaluate the full impact of hosting the men's tournament before committing to 2031. That's a big risk given that economic, logistical and reputational risks can be significant. They'll need to secure additional funding and make sure FIFA's infrastructure demands have been taken care of.

Inaugural champions: The other Division I league in the U.S., the USL Super League, wrapped its first season Saturday with a 1-0 championship victory for the Tampa Bay Sun over Fort Lauderdale United. Captain Jordyn Listro joined “Full Time” to talk about the special win.

Scary situation: I was horrified to read about Seattle Reign forward Jordyn Huitema's experience with a high-profile home invasion and moved by the trust and care with which Susie Rantz told her story: “She had broken her back the year before, and as she sat behind the door, she made peace with the idea that if she had to break it again to keep the door shut, she would.”

Championship by the Bay: How does Thanksgiving in the Bay Area sound? The 2025 NWSL final is heading to San Jose's 18,000-seat PayPal Park, the home stadium of Bay FC and MLS' San Jose Earthquakes, on Nov. 22 at 8 p.m. ET.

Before we go … check out who joined Meg at the Vermont Green women's exhibition games last week. (Spoiler: It's fellow Vermonter, Ilona Maher, Olympic bronze medalist in Rugby Sevens.)

                Alexander Freeman #16 of the United States battles Sheldon Bateau #4 of Trinidad and Tobago during the Gold Cup 2025 on Sunday in San Jose, Calif. The U.S. defeated Trinidad and Tobago to snap a four-game losing streak as it eyes next year's World Cup, which the U.S. is co-hosting.

The pressure on the U.S. men's national soccer team couldn't be higher. The world of American soccer has a rare, priceless opportunity arriving a year from now: the 2026 FIFA World Cup, to be hosted largely on U.S. soil.

But the sentiment around the U.S. men's national team isn't one of excitement or optimism. Instead, it has been doom and gloom among fans and pundits alike after a series of disappointing losses and an escalating drama between the team's biggest star, Christian Pulisic, and its new, top-dollar head coach, Mauricio Pochettino.

""It's a storm,"" veteran defender Tim Ream said last Friday of the negativity. ""You can either run from it, you can hide from it, or you put yourself back out there and say, 'Okay, we're going again.'""

Even players will admit that it's been a tough stretch for the national team. Last year's embarrassing group stage elimination in the Copa America tournament led to the firing of then-coach Gregg Berhalter. The team hired Pochettino to acclaim in the fall, but soon followed that with the U.S.'s first four-game losing streak since 2007.

Two defeats came in March to Panama and Canada, followed by a one-goal loss to Türkiye and a 4-0 pounding by Switzerland last week. All four are the caliber of team the U.S. would likely need to beat in order to advance in next year's World Cup.

""I don't think there's any denying that some of our performances have fallen short over the past year to 18 months,"" said defender Walker Zimmerman earlier this month. ""It's something that, us as players, we obviously aren't satisfied with.""

It hasn't helped that some of the team's top players have been absent from the recent games due to injury, like Sergiño Dest. Others' club teams declined to make them available this summer due to participation in the FIFA Club World Cup, including Weston McKinnie and Tim Weah.

But one conspicuous absence was neither: Christian Pulisic, the 26-year-old star and face of the USMNT — who reportedly chose to sit out in order to rest.

His absence, coupled with the team's poor showings on the field, sparked criticism from some former national team players, including Landon Donovan. During a TV broadcast of the UEFA Nations League Final between Portugal and Spain, Donovan praised the participation of the 40-year-old Portuguese national team legend Cristiano Ronaldo to make a point about, it seemed, Pulisic.


                American star Christian Pulisic, shown here last month playing for AC Milan in Italy, reportedly decided to sit out the Gold Cup for the USMNT to rest. His decision has sparked criticism from former players.

""[Ronaldo]'s tired. He's out there grinding,"" Donovan said. ""And I can't help but think about some of our guys who are on vacation right now, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's pissing me off.""

Now, both Pulisic and Pochettino have spoken publicly about Pulisic's absence, escalating the drama with each response.

Last week, Pulisic appeared on the CBS Sports Golazo America podcast to air his side. Toward the end of the soccer season in Europe, he felt that he was at risk of injury if he continued to play through the summer, especially in the Gold Cup, in which the U.S. could play in as many as six games.

""I had to make the best decision for myself and in the long run for my team, even though some people haven't seen it that way,"" Pulisic said on the podcast. ""I did want to be part of at least the two friendlies [against Turkiye and Switzerland]. I did speak with the coaches, and I did ask to be part of the team in whatever capacity they could. They said no. They said they only wanted one roster. But it is what it is.""

At a press conference Saturday, Pochettino responded bluntly.

""Players don't need to understand or not understand. Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan,"" the coach said.

To earn their place on the World Cup roster, players, including Pulisic, will have to perform well, Pochettino said — not simply say ""'I want to be, I want to play, I want to this, I want to that,'"" he added.

""When I signed my contract with the federation, I am a head coach. I am not a mannequin,"" Pochettino said.

For the players on the team this month, it has been ""a chaotic time,"" said John Tolkin, a 22-year-old defender who recently made his fifth appearance with the national team.

""What you see online, all that media, all the opinions, it's impossible this day not to see it,"" Tolkin told reporters Friday.

The absence of Pulisic and other key veterans has meant there are valuable game minutes up for grabs for younger players, like Tolkin, who are eager to prove themselves to Pochettino for a spot on the World Cup roster next summer.

Their opportunity is this month's Gold Cup, a biannual tournament for national teams in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. This summer's edition also includes Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. opened play in the tournament Sunday with a dominating 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago, the No. 100 team on FIFA's international rankings.

The star of the match was 23-year-old forward Malik Tillman, who scored two goals.

Afterward, he told reporters that it felt ""amazing"" and like ""a relief"" to have a good game amid the external negativity. ""After those two friendlies, it's been a tough, more disappointing period,"" he said.

The U.S. has two more games in the Gold Cup group stage — a tilt against Saudi Arabia on Thursday, followed by Haiti on Sunday. A second win would assure the U.S. advances to a knockout round with as many as three more games.

A title in the tournament, with a win or two over quality opponents like Mexico or Canada, could completely change the narrative.

""That's the blessing and a curse that comes with playing a professional soccer player and ultimately representing a nation,"" said forward Patrick Agyemang after Sunday's win. ""For us, each day we take at a time.""

Alexi Lalas recently blamed the U.S. Men Soccer's struggles on “diversity,” following some disappointing games of late. The former Rutgers and Team USA standout chalked it up to 11 men representing the United States and all being on the same page is going to be difficult.

It's certainly an interesting reason as to why the men's team is struggling right now, at least according to Lalas. He argued being “exclusive” rather than “inclusive” would be key to the U.S's success in the future.

With just a year to go before the FIFA World Cup is held on American, as well as Canadian and Mexican, soil, some fans are panicking. That was after a 4-0 loss to Switzerland ahead of the CONCACAF Gold Cup, which the USA won 5-0 over Trinidad and Tobago in the opening group stage game. 

“We oftentimes talk about our diversity and we talk about it in the fact that it is one of the advantages we have, and of the great things about our country,” Lalas said on First Things First. “But with that diversity comes diversity of thought. If I go and ask a hundred soccer people out there, ‘What's beautiful soccer?' I'm going to get a hundred different answers. And it might be based on ethnicity, where you grew up, even geography. All of these different things.

“So I've argued that the homogenous nature of some other countries and cultures just in population in terms of size are much more manageable. And there is a collective understanding and, more importantly, an agreement in this is how we're going to play. But getting 11 men to represent this great country of 350 million people, and all be on the same page, that is very, very difficult.”

Team USA isn't helped by the fact that star player Christian Pulisic, who's considered one of the best American soccer players in recent memory, isn't playing in the Gold Cup. He decided not to play due to a grueling season with his club team AC Milan.

As Awful Announcing pointed out, France won the last World Cup with a very diverse group, so it's hard to understand when Lalas is coming from, at least from that perspective. But Lalas, who initially bought into the melting pot argument, wants all players to be on the same page and develop more of an American style, so to speak.

“I've argued before that maybe our best route to actually being better from a men's perspective in soccer is actually being more exclusive, not being as inclusive,” Lalas said. “In that if you went to the New York metropolitan area or Southern California and you just took players that all grew up in the same area, had all this shared experiences, maybe that would be better in terms of an understanding.

“This melting pot fallacy that I'll be the first to admit, I bought into. And I'm not saying it can't happen. It just takes a lot longer and with a lot more work. And especially when it comes to a national team, you don't have time to be able to do that.”

Every few years, ex-U.S. soccer star Alexi Lalas, 55 — who attended Rutgers from 1988-91 — scapegoats diversity for the team's recent struggles despite teams like France, that won the 2018 World Cup with a roster comprised of players of different ethnicities and backgrounds, proving him wrong.

TOPICS:

In the weeks leading up to this summer's Gold Cup, storylines around U.S. Soccer have been dominated by the team's star player, Christian Pulisic, opting to sit out the tournament in favor of resting and recuperating for the season ahead.  Last week, on the Call it What You Want podcast, Pulisic elaborated on his decision saying that he had offered to participate in the team's two pre-tournament friendlies against Türkiye and Switzerland, a decision which U.S. Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino rejected.  Pulisic said that he “didn't understand” Pochettino's rejection prompting Pochettino to respond by saying ""Players need to listen and to stick with our plan.  They cannot dictate the plan.”



On the latest episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, the two former American soccer stars shared their thoughts on the brewing controversy with Donovan looking at the situation from the manager's perspective.  “In [Pochettino's] mind, he must think this is absolutely crazy,” Donovan said. “He probably literally cannot believe some of the stuff he's reading and hearing.  He's the coach. He will tell you if you're getting called in, when you're getting called in, if you're playing. You don't decide which games you get to choose to play for your national teams. That's what [Pochettino's] saying.”

Howard believes that this incident is indicative of a cultural shift within U.S. Soccer towards players holding more control, a shift that Pochettino could be trying to reverse.  “Pochettino has walked into that,” said Howard.  “And what he's trying to do now is regain some of that power. And I think he was doing that in a quiet way until he was called out in the Christian Pulisic interview. And now I think for the first time, you know, U.S. Soccer, has a bit of an issue. They have an issue because, you know, Pochettino, who's the manager and is getting paid $6 million a year and is a big manager and his star player now are seemingly at odds.”

Following their 4-0 defeat on June 10th against Switzerland, the U.S. Men's National Team had lost four consecutive matches for the first time since 2007, a streak which they snapped on Sunday with their emphatic 5-0 Gold Cup opening win against Trinidad & Tobago.  While the win may have helped to temporarily settle a tense situation, Howard says that current national team players should not expect blind support from former national team players.

“I've heard from people on the inside, friends of ours on the inside of U.S. Soccer, and there's this feeling going around that they should be supporting us. ‘They' [meaning] you [Landon Donovan] and I, other folks on the outside, should be supporting [the team].  U.S. Soccer and the players within U.S. Soccer want a free pass for being average. You don't get a free pass for being average.”

The Americans next Gold Cup match comes Thursday night against Saudi Arabia at the Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas.

Club World Cup

FIFA has decided not to show any videos, signage or marketing assets in venues hosting the Club World Cup in the United States which explicitly mention challenging racism or discrimination.

According to multiple sources briefed on FIFA's planning for the tournament, the world football governing body did develop promotional materials in the months leading up to the tournament for their “no racism” and “no discrimination” campaign but it has not been visible during the opening round of fixtures at the tournament in stadiums or on social media platforms.

This approach represents a significant change from previous competitions, such as the Women's World Cup in 2023 in Australia and New Zealand and the men's World Cup in 2022 in Qatar when messages were shown in the stadium on big screens and on social media.

FIFA has also not performed any announcements within its stadiums explaining the anti-racism protocols or the organisation's “universal anti-racism gesture” which was rolled out in September last year and was supposed to be applied to all competitions.

FIFA did not respond when asked if it consulted competing clubs in the Club World Cup over its strategy on these matters.

The reasons for FIFA's apparent change of policy are not known. Earlier this year, the NFL Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles marked the first time since February 2021 that “End Racism” was not included as a message in the back of a Super Bowl end zone. This was widely interpreted as a nod to the current climate in the U.S. where many corporations and institutions are abandoning their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

FIFA's President Gianni Infantino has developed a close bond with President Donald Trump's administration, even attending a Trump pre-inauguration rally, the inauguration itself and visiting the White House. FIFA did not respond when asked if the current political climate in the U.S. played any part in their decision. They did point to their statutes, which say “FIFA remain neutral in matters of politics.”

At the Women's World Cup in 2023, FIFA also rolled out a series of social causes, with armbands at the Women's World Cup such as “Unite for Inclusion” and “Unite for Indigenous Peoples”, “Unite for Gender Equality”, “Unite for Peace”, “Unite for Education for All”, “Unite for Zero Hunger”, “Unite for Ending Violence Against Women” and “Football is Joy, Peace, Love, Hope & Passion”. These messages were visible on captain's armbands, as well as being shared on LED advertising boards around the stadium. They were also present on giant screens and on flags.

In Qatar, FIFA blocked a small number of European nations from wearing a ‘OneLove' armband, which was perceived to be challenging homophobia in a country that criminalises same-sex relations, but FIFA's own campaigns during the tournament included the following slogans: No Discrimination, Save the Planet, Protect Children, End Hunger, Education for All and Be Active.

At this tournament, the only visible signs have been the non specific “Football Unites the World” slogan, which has been present on captain's armbands, and a Dance Cam, partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO), which includes the strapline “Be Active.” FIFA have maintained their partnership with the WHO but President Trump has signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the organisation.

There has been no Twitter messaging at all on the official FIFA Club World Cup account about FIFA's no discrimination or no racism campaigns.

FIFA have been asked whether the World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada in 2026, will include messaging about its anti-discrimination and anti-racism campaigns but they did not answer the question.

Only last month, FIFA President Infantino urged policy makers and legislators globally to join FIFA in the fight against racism and discrimination by imposing criminal penalties on offenders, claiming FIFA cannot win the battle alone.

He said: “FIFA's Global Stand Against Racism called for the football world to take action, to educate, to raise awareness and, when necessary, to punish,” he said.

“Racism and discrimination — they are not just wrong, they are crimes.”

In a statement to The Athletic, FIFA did not explain why they have reduced their in-tournament messaging for this competition in the United States.

A FIFA spokesperson said: “FIFA has a firm, zero-tolerance stance against all forms of discrimination and racism. This commitment was recently reinforced through the unanimous approval by the FIFA Council of the revised FIFA Disciplinary Code, which introduces new measures to fight racist abuse — including increased minimum bans for racist incidents and enhanced financial penalties as duly informed to the 75th FIFA Congress in Asuncion in May 2025.”

They also said their three-step anti-discrimination procedure is in effect should incidents occur, while also saying a social media protection service is available to players and match officials, which helps hide abuse from their social media channels.

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca comments on the lack of fans at their 2-0 win against LAFC in the Club World Cup. (0:58)

LaLiga president Javier Tebas has doubled down on his criticism of FIFA's expanded Club World Cup, saying it's his objective to ""eliminate"" the competition from the football calendar.

Tebas said last week the tournament is ""completely absurd"" and went one step further on Tuesday after watching 25 minutes of Chelsea's 2-0 win over LAFC, which he compared to a friendly.

""By eliminating it,"" Tebas said at an event at the ESADE Business School in Madrid when asked how FIFA could do a better job of structuring the Club World Cup in the future.

""My objective is that there will be no more Club World Cups, I'm very clear about that,"" he said.

""There is no room for it. There is no need for another competition that moves money towards the [same] clubs and players. The model affects the entire ecosystem of national leagues, especially in Europe, and there's no more money in the world of audiovisual rights.

""We have to maintain the ecosystem we have already and eliminate it. Keep [the Club World Cup] as it was before, when it was played basically over one weekend and that was that. There are no available dates.""

Asked if had watched any matches, he added: ""I saw a bit of the Chelsea game and it looked like a preseason friendly. I didn't see any intensity, at least for the 25 minutes I watched.""

The Club World Cup, which is taking place across the United States, kicked off on June 14 with Inter Miami's goalless draw against Al Ahly and runs until July 13, when the final will take place.

There are 32 teams taking part in this expanded version, including two from Spain in Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, and it is scheduled to take place every four years.

Barcelona, meanwhile, who are not involved in the competition, are pressing ahead with plans to strengthen their squad this summer.

ESPN revealed last week they have activated Espanyol goalkeeper Joan García's €25 million ($28.9m) release clause, while they have been heavily linked with Athletic Club and Spain winger Nico Williams in recent days.

Tebas said Barça are still not able to register players freely, though, and they remain subjected to LaLiga rules which only allow them to spend a fraction of what they save or raise in the transfer market on new signings.

""One thing is making [García's signing] official, another is being able to register players,"" Tebas said.

""We will see. Barça still need to do some things to be able to register signings. Not a lot in this case, but they will have to make room, for sure. Barça know what they must do already.

""All I hear is Nico Williams, someone else and then another... I don't know. First, it has to be true what is reported, which I don't know if it is or not. But they're still not in the 1:1 rule. There still need to be movements.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Club World Cup

Today's News

Connections: Sports Edition

La Liga president Javier Tebas has told FIFA to abandon their newly-expanded Club World Cup.

Tebas said it was his “goal” to ensure that there were no more editions of the month-long, 32-team version of the tournament, which is currently being staged in the U.S.

Spanish top flight clubs Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are both involved in the tournament, which Tebas has called on FIFA to “eliminate” from the football calendar.

“My goal is to ensure there are no more Club World Cups, that's very clear,” said Tebas, speaking on Tuesday at an event marking the 10-year anniversary of the centralisation of La Liga's audiovisual rights.

“There's no need for another competition that moves money to a sector of clubs and players,” Tebas said. “There's no more money here; we have to maintain the ecosystem and eliminate this.”

The 62-year-old has long been at odds with Real president Florentino Perez over a multitude of issues, most notably the Super League project that was strongly promoted by Madrid.

Tebas said his issues with Perez were “not personal” but added: “He is from a completely different industry model. He defends a Super League that would destroy the national leagues.”

The Spanish league president said that “piracy” and “new competitions” were the two main threats facing his organisation.

In April 2024, Tebas insisted that he wanted to stage La Liga matches abroad by 2025-26, saying that a match in the U.S. would “strengthen our position in the North American market”.

Kylian Mbappé is now a doubt to play in Real Madrid‘s FIFA Club World Cup opener against Al Hilal, it has emerged.

The Frenchman missed the team‘s final training ahead of Wednesday‘s fixture due to sickness. MARCA report Mbappé has come down with a fever and remained at the team hotel while Xabi Alonso worked with his new squad in the Miami heat.

Real Madrid are carefully monitoring Mbappé‘s condition and do not want the forward “overexerted”, especially given the warm weather in Florida. The club will reassess his condition in the hours leading up to its match against Al Hilal and make a decision then.

It goes without saying that losing Mbappé would be a huge blow for Real Madrid. The France captain led the team in scoring last season, bagging 43 goals across all competitions. He also took home the Pichichi Trophy and the European Golden Boot in his debut campaign in a white shirt. 

Without Mbappé or the injured Endrick, Alonso could be forced to manage his first match in charge of the biggest club in the world without a striker.

The good news for the new boss and Real Madrid is that Mbappé is not dealing with an injury, and therefore should not be out of the action for too long. Even if he is unable to feature in Los Blancos‘ opening match of the FIFA Club World Cup, he will likely be fully recovered from his sickness in time for the team's fixture against Pachuca on Sunday, June 22.

Xabi Alonso will take charge of his first Real Madrid game, and it's straight into the fire as a competitive one. Los Blancos will take on Al-Hilal in their first group-stage game of the Club World Cup.

The Spaniard has new signings Dean Huijsen and Trent Alexander-Arnold to choose from, as well as players returning from long-term injuries. Defenders Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao are available, but are they ready to start after missing 6-8 months of the 2024-25 season?

🔵⚔️🟢 pic.twitter.com/pqKGTnKodg

Alonso has had time to address who could start the first game, with a good performance vital. Here is the predicted lineup for the match against Al-Hilal.

GK: Thibault Courtois - The Belgium stopper is a guaranteed starter if he is fit, with Alonso putting out his strongest team available.

RB: Trent Alexander-Arnold - The former Liverpool man could be in line to make his debut, with Dani Carvajal just recently back from injury. 

CB: Antonio Rudiger - The veteran center-back will likely partner one of the younger players, with Eder Militao likely not yet ready to start.

CB: Dean Huijsen - The second signing, Huijsen, could also make his debut, but Raul Asencio is also available. Both could play if Alonso believes Rudiger has not fully recovered from his injury.

LB: Fran Garcia - The left-back situation is unclear at the club under Alonso, but Garcia could be the starter for this game, having played the final games of last season.

CDM: Aurélien Tchouaméni - The Frenchman played a lot at center-back at the end of last season but should revert to his original position in midfield.

CDM: Federico Valverde - Valverde also played a lot out of position during the final months of the season, but he is one of the best at his position, center midfielder.

RM: Arda Guler - The young Turkish player capitalized on the injury to Rodrgyo in the final three games, playing exceptionally well. The Brazilian is back, but Guler could still start in front of him.

CM: Jude Bellingham - Bellingham hasn't been in great form over the last few games, but a new chapter under Alonso may help find his feet again.

LM: Vinicius Jr. - The Brazilian has put in the air miles recently with his national team but looks in good form, so he should start.

ST: Kylian Mbappé - The European Golden Boot winner will hope his goalscoring form continues in the tournament and that he has the opportunity to be the top scorer in this tournament.

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. — There's a possibility Real Madrid will begin the FIFA Club World Cup without its biggest star.

French World Cup champion Kylian Mbappé did not practice with his teammates n Tuesday because of a fever, a Real Madrid spokesman told USA TODAY Sports.

New Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso will have a press conference Tuesday afternoon, and will likely address Mbappe's condition before the club's opener in the tournament.

Real Madrid will play against Saudi Arabian standouts Al Hilal at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Wednesday at 3 p.m. ET.

Mbappe is undoubtedly the biggest star in the Club World Cup field outside of Argentine World Cup champion and Inter Miami star Lionel Messi.

If Mbappe is unable to play, Real Madrid will rely on a slew of other stars like Brazilian standouts Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo, English star Jude Bellingham and Croatian Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modrić.

Boca Juniors fans get ready for the Club World Cup with chants and drums on Miami beach. (2:07)

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is off and running, with four strong days of fun and drama already in the books. So let's get you caught up with what you missed and what's ahead today and tomorrow.

Check in with ESPN as we bring you the latest news and analysis, all the way up to the tournament final at MetLife Stadium on July 13.

MIAMI GARDENS, Florida -- The press box at Hard Rock Stadium trembled as Boca Juniors fans celebrated the opening whistle of the team's inaugural Club World Cup match against Benfica. Argentine supporters traveled in their thousands to take over the 200- and 300-level sections behind one of the goals, hanging yellow-and-blue flags and banners on the railings to create a makeshift La Bombonera more than 4,400 miles away in Miami Gardens. It was no surprise after Boca Juniors supporters organized a massive gathering the day prior to the match to celebrate the beginning of the tournament, bringing instruments, flags, banners and an immense passion to Miami Beach. A sea of blue and yellow dominated as far as the eye could see while ""Boca, Boca, Boca"" resonated throughout. Families, from months-old babies to great grandparents, boasted the jerseys.

The Boca Juniors fan base completely took over the city and stadium, making the Argentine team locals away from home. And as the match progressed, the energy inside Hard Rock intensified and proved an integral part of Boca Juniors' success on the pitch.

Boca began Miguel Angel Russo's third term as head coach of the team with the opening goal against Benfica in the 21st minute. Miguel Merentiel shocked the Portuguese team to sneak a goal past goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin. Fans erupted in cheers, throwing drinks in the air, hugging the nearest neighbor before singing ""Dale Bo, Dale Bo"" in perfect unison. Benfica players seemed flustered on the field, overwhelmed by the intensity of the Argentines both on and off the pitch.

Boca Juniors fans and players jumped at any split call from the referee Cesar Ramos, leaving Benfica vulnerable to the pressure. Once Rodrigo Battaglia doubled the lead, the South Americans appeared unstoppable. But the feeling of power, superiority and intensity backfired, leading to a penalty scored by Angel Di Maria for a foul inside the box.

Tension continued to rise, eventually leading to a red card for Boca Juniors' Ander Herrera on the bench and Benfica player Andrea Belotti to leave the Portuguese side down to 10 men on the field.

And it only got worse for Boca Juniors in the second half, when Nicolas Otamendi, loyal fan of their eternal rivals River Plate, scored the equalizer for Benfica. When the announcer presented Otamendi at the beginning of the game, his name was drowned out by boos from Boca fans. This time, fans simply stood in silence and confusion at what just happened in front of their goal.

By the 87th minute, hostility on the pitch took an elevated form and a third, and final, red card was given to Boca Juniors' Jorge Figal to equalize the playing field to 10 each.

The 2-2 draw seemed like an appropriate ending to a tension-fueled match that saw drama on and off the field. And It's only the beginning of the Club World Cup for these two teams. -- Lizzy Becherano

ATLANTA -- Chelsea's 2-0 win over LAFC in Atlanta was FIFA's first significant embarrassment of the tournament to date. Despite spending a reported $50 million on marketing and insisting fans would be enthralled by the newly expanded tournament, Mercedes-Benz Stadium was a hollow shell on Monday.

There is mitigation, of course, given a weekday afternoon scheduling and a U.S.-based team playing more than 2,000 miles from their home having just qualified for this event a couple of weeks ago, but the sight of a wonderful 71,000-capacity stadium like this less than a third full -- 22,137 was the given attendance -- was a far cry from the enthusiasm FIFA had promised.

Ticket prices had been slashed, with general admission available on the day for $51, but there was little late take-up in a city whose team, Atlanta United, have by some distance the best average attendance per game (nearly 47,000 in 2024) of any MLS side.

The city itself is not exactly awash with marketing, either. One bar close to the stadium is the self-appointed ""Club World Cup Headquarters,"" but it did not show Sunday's game involving Bayern Munich and closed minutes after Botafogo vs. Seattle Sounders got underway. FIFA was quick to promote the high attendance at the Rose Bowl when Paris Saint-Germain beat Atlético Madrid and for the opening game in Miami, but they would do well to acknowledge and address the failings here given there is palpable still work to do. -- James Olley

James Olley reacts to Chelsea's 2-0 win over LAFC at the Club World Cup.

BOCA RATON, Florida -- Lots of Man City fans (and Liverpool, for that matter) are waiting to see how Pep Guardiola works with new assistant coach Pep Lijnders, who was such a crucial part of Jurgen Klopp's backroom team at Anfield. It's an interesting union given how fierce the rivalry was between Guardiola's City and Klopp's Liverpool between 2018 and 2024.

At training at Lynn University over the week, it was Lijnders taking centre stage. Guardiola strolled around in the middle of the drills, while Lijnders barked at the different groups to move the ball more quickly. He could he heard shouting ""speed"" again and again -- when he saw something he liked, he'd say ""that's the right tempo.""

Guardiola's City have occasionally been accused of being too slow with the ball, particularly around the opposition penalty area, but it looks like that might be about to change. A team containing the best bits from Guardiola and Klopp is certainly a frightening prospect. -- Rob Dawson

PHILADELPHIA -- Flamengo are talented and experienced. And on a night like this -- in an unseasonably chilly stadium, staring down a bank of Esperance fans intent on making their end of Lincoln Financial Field into some kind of perpetual noise and motion machine -- they needed both.

The Brazilian giants looked to be well on their way a first half which saw the double playmaker combo of Erick Pulgar and Jorginho turn the screws in possession with cult hero Giorgian de Arrascaeta side-footing Luiz Araujo's cutback home. They were 1-0 up at the break, and it could have been more. And it would have been more if Pedro hadn't squandered his chance early in the second half. For 15 minutes or so, the game got a bit scary for Filipe Luis' crew; Youcef Belaili raced down Guillermo Varela's wing as if he owned it, and twice forced saves that were a little too close for comfort. That's why Araujo's pretty diagonal 29 minutes from time to put Flamengo 2-0 up brought a palpable sigh of relief.

Flamengo can out-football almost anyone at this Club World Cup. And they have plenty of been there, done that experience. They just need to ensure they make it count for 90 minutes. -- Gab Marcotti

PASADENA, Calif. -- Just imagine a heat so intense, it makes your toenails hurt. And if you're thinking ""well, that sounds unlikely..."" well you didn't play 90 minutes against the world's best club team, Paris Saint-Germain, in the midday sun at the Rose Bowl on Sunday, did you?

Marcos Llorente's complaint about conditions in Pasadena during the 4-0 loss may have been unexpectedly specific -- ""it's impossible, a terrible heat. My toenails were hurting. I couldn't stop [running], or start,"" he told reporters in the mixed zone -- but the Atlético right-back is far from alone. Even PSG coach Luis Enrique, who was otherwise delighted with his team's comfortable win, said the game was ""clearly impacted"" by the heat. ""It's all very well to pick the kickoff times so that [games] are watched in Europe,"" he jibed, ""but the teams feel the effects of it.""

As for Atlético, it wasn't their last midday appearance at the Rose Bowl. They'll be back in Pasadena on June 23 for another lunchtime kickoff against Botafogo, in what's now a likely must-win game if they want to make the knockout stage.

Over in Florida, where Real Madrid have been training in Palm Beach Gardens, it's as much a question of humidity as heat. Madrid will make their tournament debut against Al Hilal at Hard Rock Stadium, with 60% humidity forecast and temperatures of 91 degrees Fahrenheit. ""It's very hot,"" Vinícius Júnior said on Sunday. ""The game is at 3pm. It's going to be tough.""

Just watch out for those toenails. -- Alex Kirkland

Steve Nicol explains the impact of high temperatures on players and managers at the Club World Cup.

Neto no doubt was the standout player for Enzo Marseca's side as Chelsea kicked off their Club World Cup campaign with a 2-0 win over LAFC on Monday.

Coming in hot after winning the UEFA Nations League with Portugal last week, the 25-year-old was able to score the Blues' first goal by getting the ball from Nicolas Jackson on the flank, before sending defender Ryan Hollingshead to the floor with his turn and slotting his shot into the bottom corner.

If Chelsea looks to win this title in the United States, they will need to rely on the depth of their team, especially in the attack -- now with the addition of new signing Liam Delap -- and players like Neto will be absolutely vital. -- Roberto Rojas

Odds (via ESPN BET): Fluminense (+450), Draw (+340), Dortmund (-190)

Like it or loathe it, the Club World Cup is full of intriguing games and Borussia Dortmund against Fluminense at MetLife Stadium is one of them. Fluminense were beaten Club World Cup finalists in 2023, while Dortmund reached the Champions League final as recently as 2024. One of the most interesting aspects of this tournaments is the ability to compare levels of teams and leagues and this pits Brazil against Germany. Dortmund are favourites after ending their domestic season strongly, but Fluminense -- in the middle of the domestic campaign -- will fancy their chances. -- Dawson

Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).

Odds: River Plate (-180), Draw (+310), Urawa RD (+450)

We'll be saying this a lot during this competition, but yes: this is the first time these two teams have ever met, and I must say that's a fun thing in a competition like this to have such wildly diverging sides and soccer cultures colliding. The odds are tilted quite far in River Plate's favor heading into their Group E opener, the Argentine side boasting several familiar faces -- including former MLS star Sebastian Driussi and midfielder Franco Mastantuono, who is joining Real Madrid following his 18th birthday in August -- and all the momentum. They're still alive in the Copa Libertadores, South America's top continental club competition, and finished second in the league's Apertura, with 10 wins from 16 matches.

Their opponents, meanwhile, are ranked between Raja Casablanca and English minnows Plymouth Argyle in the Opta rankings (298th), a decent approximation of team strength in the world game. Much of Urawa's hopes will fall on midfielder Ryoma Watanabe, who leads the team with six goals in the J.League so far this season, and former Brazil U20 star Matheus Savio, who has a team-high four assists. -- James Tyler

Odds: Ulsan HD (+200), Draw (+220), Sundowns (+140)

You can do a deeper dive on Mamelodi Sundowns and what they hope to get out of this Club World Cup here, but in the interim they are looking to bounce back from the disappointment of losing the African Champions League. Given the dynamics of the group, on paper this is a must-win for both sides, so look out for Sundowns' reliable striker Iqraam Rayners. Sundowns are nicknamed ""the Brazilians"" -- partly for the football they try to play, partly for their bright Selecao-inspired jerseys -- and they have a couple Brazilans that stand out too, like Lucas Ribeiro, who wears the No. 10 (as you'd expect).

Ulsan have been among the top-rated team in Asia for a while now and won the AFC Champions League in 2020. In addition to a strong core of national team players, they boast some imports to watch, above all veteran striker Erick Farias and midfield stalwart (and former Sweden international) Darijan Bojanic. -- Marcotti

Odds: Monterrey (+550), Draw (+360), Inter (-220)

Monterrey enters the Club World Cup with a new head coach and an immense set of expectations as one of just two Liga MX representatives in the tournament. Following a disappointing Clausura campaign, finishing seventh before falling to Toluca in the quarterfinals of the playoffs, formert New York City FC, Flamengo and Galatasaray boss Domenec Torrent took the helm as head coach. Fans now expect the Spaniard to lead Monterrey to glory at the Club World Cup despite the difficult opponents of Group E.

Internazionale, on the other hand, debuts in the Club World Cup after coming second in the 2024-25 Serie A season. There's a fresh face in the Inter dugout too, with Cristian Chivu taking the place of Simone Inzaghi, who left the role following the Italian side's Champions League final loss to Paris Saint-Germain. -- Becherano","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Club World Cup

FIFA has decided not to show any videos, signage or marketing assets in venues hosting the Club World Cup in the United States which explicitly mention challenging racism or discrimination.

According to multiple sources briefed on FIFA's planning for the tournament, the world football governing body did develop promotional materials in the months leading up to the tournament for their “no racism” and “no discrimination” campaign but it has not been visible during the opening round of fixtures at the tournament in stadiums or on social media platforms.

This approach represents a significant change from previous competitions, such as the Women's World Cup in 2023 in Australia and New Zealand and the men's World Cup in 2022 in Qatar when messages were shown in the stadium on big screens and on social media.

FIFA has also not performed any announcements within its stadiums explaining the anti-racism protocols or the organisation's “universal anti-racism gesture” which was rolled out in September last year and was supposed to be applied to all competitions.

FIFA did not respond when asked if it consulted competing clubs in the Club World Cup over its strategy on these matters.

The reasons for FIFA's apparent change of policy are not known. Earlier this year, the NFL Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles marked the first time since February 2021 that “End Racism” was not included as a message in the back of a Super Bowl end zone. This was widely interpreted as a nod to the current climate in the U.S. where many corporations and institutions are abandoning their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

FIFA's President Gianni Infantino has developed a close bond with President Donald Trump's administration, even attending a Trump pre-inauguration rally, the inauguration itself and visiting the White House. FIFA did not respond when asked if the current political climate in the U.S. played any part in their decision. They did point to their statutes, which say “FIFA remain neutral in matters of politics.”

At the Women's World Cup in 2023, FIFA also rolled out a series of social causes, with armbands at the Women's World Cup such as “Unite for Inclusion” and “Unite for Indigenous Peoples”, “Unite for Gender Equality”, “Unite for Peace”, “Unite for Education for All”, “Unite for Zero Hunger”, “Unite for Ending Violence Against Women” and “Football is Joy, Peace, Love, Hope & Passion”. These messages were visible on captain's armbands, as well as being shared on LED advertising boards around the stadium. They were also present on giant screens and on flags.

In Qatar, FIFA blocked a small number of European nations from wearing a ‘OneLove' armband, which was perceived to be challenging homophobia in a country that criminalises same-sex relations, but FIFA's own campaigns during the tournament included the following slogans: No Discrimination, Save the Planet, Protect Children, End Hunger, Education for All and Be Active.

At this tournament, the only visible signs have been the non specific “Football Unites the World” slogan, which has been present on captain's armbands, and a Dance Cam, partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO), which includes the strapline “Be Active.” FIFA have maintained their partnership with the WHO but President Trump has signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the organisation.

There has been no Twitter messaging at all on the official FIFA Club World Cup account about FIFA's no discrimination or no racism campaigns.

FIFA have been asked whether the World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada in 2026, will include messaging about its anti-discrimination and anti-racism campaigns but they did not answer the question.

Only last month, FIFA President Infantino urged policy makers and legislators globally to join FIFA in the fight against racism and discrimination by imposing criminal penalties on offenders, claiming FIFA cannot win the battle alone.

He said: “FIFA's Global Stand Against Racism called for the football world to take action, to educate, to raise awareness and, when necessary, to punish,” he said.

“Racism and discrimination — they are not just wrong, they are crimes.”

In a statement to The Athletic, FIFA did not explain why they have reduced their in-tournament messaging for this competition in the United States.

A FIFA spokesperson said: “FIFA has a firm, zero-tolerance stance against all forms of discrimination and racism. This commitment was recently reinforced through the unanimous approval by the FIFA Council of the revised FIFA Disciplinary Code, which introduces new measures to fight racist abuse — including increased minimum bans for racist incidents and enhanced financial penalties as duly informed to the 75th FIFA Congress in Asuncion in May 2025.”

They also said their three-step anti-discrimination procedure is in effect should incidents occur, while also saying a social media protection service is available to players and match officials, which helps hide abuse from their social media channels.

The pressure on the U.S. men's national soccer team couldn't be higher. The world of American soccer has a rare, priceless opportunity arriving a year from now: the 2026 FIFA World Cup, to be hosted largely on U.S. soil.

But the sentiment around the U.S. men's national team isn't one of excitement or optimism. Instead, it has been doom and gloom among fans and pundits alike after a series of disappointing losses and an escalating drama between the team's biggest star, Christian Pulisic, and its new, top-dollar head coach, Mauricio Pochettino.

""It's a storm,"" veteran defender Tim Ream said last Friday of the negativity. ""You can either run from it, you can hide from it, or you put yourself back out there and say, 'Okay, we're going again.'""

Even players will admit that it's been a tough stretch for the national team. Last year's embarrassing group stage elimination in the Copa America tournament led to the firing of then-coach Gregg Berhalter. The team hired Pochettino to acclaim in the fall, but soon followed that with the U.S.'s first four-game losing streak since 2007.

Two defeats came in March to Panama and Canada, followed by a one-goal loss to Türkiye and a 4-0 pounding by Switzerland last week. All four are the caliber of team the U.S. would likely need to beat in order to advance in next year's World Cup.

""I don't think there's any denying that some of our performances have fallen short over the past year to 18 months,"" said defender Walker Zimmerman earlier this month. ""It's something that, us as players, we obviously aren't satisfied with.""

It hasn't helped that some of the team's top players have been absent from the recent games due to injury, like Sergiño Dest. Others' club teams declined to make them available this summer due to participation in the FIFA Club World Cup, including Weston McKinnie and Tim Weah.

But one conspicuous absence was neither: Christian Pulisic, the 26-year-old star and face of the USMNT — who reportedly chose to sit out in order to rest.

His absence, coupled with the team's poor showings on the field, sparked criticism from some former national team players, including Landon Donovan. During a TV broadcast of the UEFA Nations League Final between Portugal and Spain, Donovan praised the participation of the 40-year-old Portuguese national team legend Cristiano Ronaldo to make a point about, it seemed, Pulisic.


                American star Christian Pulisic, shown here last month playing for AC Milan in Italy, reportedly decided to sit out the Gold Cup for the USMNT to rest. His decision has sparked criticism from former players.

""[Ronaldo]'s tired. He's out there grinding,"" Donovan said. ""And I can't help but think about some of our guys who are on vacation right now, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's pissing me off.""

Now, both Pulisic and Pochettino have spoken publicly about Pulisic's absence, escalating the drama with each response.

Last week, Pulisic appeared on the CBS Sports Golazo America podcast to air his side. Toward the end of the soccer season in Europe, he felt that he was at risk of injury if he continued to play through the summer, especially in the Gold Cup, in which the U.S. could play in as many as six games.

""I had to make the best decision for myself and in the long run for my team, even though some people haven't seen it that way,"" Pulisic said on the podcast. ""I did want to be part of at least the two friendlies [against Turkiye and Switzerland]. I did speak with the coaches, and I did ask to be part of the team in whatever capacity they could. They said no. They said they only wanted one roster. But it is what it is.""

At a press conference Saturday, Pochettino responded bluntly.

""Players don't need to understand or not understand. Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan,"" the coach said.

To earn their place on the World Cup roster, players, including Pulisic, will have to perform well, Pochettino said — not simply say ""'I want to be, I want to play, I want to this, I want to that,'"" he added.

""When I signed my contract with the federation, I am a head coach. I am not a mannequin,"" Pochettino said.

For the players on the team this month, it has been ""a chaotic time,"" said John Tolkin, a 22-year-old defender who recently made his fifth appearance with the national team.

""What you see online, all that media, all the opinions, it's impossible this day not to see it,"" Tolkin told reporters Friday.

The absence of Pulisic and other key veterans has meant there are valuable game minutes up for grabs for younger players, like Tolkin, who are eager to prove themselves to Pochettino for a spot on the World Cup roster next summer.

Their opportunity is this month's Gold Cup, a biannual tournament for national teams in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. This summer's edition also includes Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. opened play in the tournament Sunday with a dominating 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago, the No. 100 team on FIFA's international rankings.

The star of the match was 23-year-old forward Malik Tillman, who scored two goals.

Afterward, he told reporters that it felt ""amazing"" and like ""a relief"" to have a good game amid the external negativity. ""After those two friendlies, it's been a tough, more disappointing period,"" he said.

The U.S. has two more games in the Gold Cup group stage — a tilt against Saudi Arabia on Thursday, followed by Haiti on Sunday. A second win would assure the U.S. advances to a knockout round with as many as three more games.

A title in the tournament, with a win or two over quality opponents like Mexico or Canada, could completely change the narrative.

""That's the blessing and a curse that comes with playing a professional soccer player and ultimately representing a nation,"" said forward Patrick Agyemang after Sunday's win. ""For us, each day we take at a time.""

...

We're not even a week into the Club World Cup, and the prevailing theme has to be embarrassing for FIFA.

Concerns about poor ticket sales have been realized across the country as fans haven't been turning up in huge numbers to watch the inaugural edition of the expanded club tournament. The images of near-empty stadiums have been so sad that many fans are already declaring the tournament a failure.

But really, FIFA only has its own arrogance to blame with puzzling scheduling decisions. Some common sense could have changed the tournament's entire perception in the early going.

As we covered in the lead-up to the tournament, ticket sales were poor due, in part, to the high prices and lack of overall prestige. But the game times and venues have also been a major factor in this initial embarrassment.

For Monday's game between the Premier League's Chelsea and MLS' LAFC, kickoff was set for 3 p.m. local time at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium — a time when people are largely at work. So, the idea of filling a 71,000-seat stadium at 3 p.m. on a Monday was silly — especially for a match that didn't include a local team. Mind you: Atlanta United leads MLS in average attendance. It wasn't an ""Atlanta doesn't like soccer"" issue.

That led to a scene like this at kickoff.

That looks bad, sure. But the announced crowd was still 22,000, which actually isn't awful for a 3 p.m. Monday match. If you put that crowd in any soccer-specific MLS stadium, FIFA would have been looking at a sellout and a totally different conversation about the tournament.

The same went for Tuesday's match between Bundesliga giant Borussia Dortmund and Brazilian side Fluminense. FIFA decided to hold that match at noon on a Tuesday at 82,500-seat Metlife Stadium. So, you had a crowd that looked like this:

If FIFA had instead opted to hold the match at Sports Illustrated Stadium (formerly Red Bull Arena in New Jersey), that's a packed stadium. It's that simple.

And sure, some matches have been able to draw impressive crowds at NFL or college football stadiums. The PSG-Atletico Madrid match drew 80,000 at the Rose Bowl. Miami's Hard Rock Stadium has also seen some solid crowds. But those were either weekend matches or taking place at night.

FIFA really should have considered the time and venue. It's a new tournament. People have work, and international fans aren't clamoring to travel to America in this political climate. That's not the recipe for a successful tournament.

FIFA only has itself to blame.

FIFA claimed the Club World Cup would change football ‘for the better', but the tournament has endured an underwhelming start.

When the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 opened on Saturday, Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest footballer, weaved his magic on the field as a cluster of former stars – David Beckham, Ronaldo, Kaka, Bebeto, Roberto Baggio and Javier Zanetti – watched on from their VIP seats at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

While Messi was unable to score any goals in Inter Miami's 0-0 draw against Egyptian club Al Ahly, football fans turned up in their thousands to watch the Argentinian lead his team in what could have been a goal-fest for the home side.

The organisers, led by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, appeared pleased with the tournament opener and would have hoped for the goals, spectators and popularity to increase as the Club World Cup progressed.

Infantino has treated the tournament as his personal project and aimed to bring the biggest names in football to the United States, one of the co-hosts for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

From the unusual last-minute addition of Messi's Inter Miami to the main draw, to his attempts at luring Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo to sign for a participating club and increasing the winner's prize money by a whopping $35m, the FIFA chief has pulled out all the stops to support his grand proclamation that the Club World Cup is “the start of something historic that will change our sport for the better”.

However, three days in, the tournament, billed by FIFA as the most elite global club competition, has failed to match the hype created by the sport's governing body.

Here's what's gone wrong with the Club World Cup thus far:

Kickoffs scheduled at noon and 3pm local time on scorching hot summer days have led to players dealing with difficult conditions. Some of these teams have finished full league and cup competition seasons in their respective countries and confederations.

Others – from the US, South America and Oceania – have hit pause on their regular seasons and will return to their respective leagues after the Club World Cup.

The tournament has been subject to criticism from regional football bodies and players' unions long before the first kick of the opening game.

“The decision today to schedule the FIFA Club World Cup between June 15 and July 13 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives,” players' union FIFPRO said in a statement when the tournament schedule was released in 2024.

“The extreme mental and physical pressures at the pinnacle of the game is the principal concern of players with multiple club and national team competitions, leading to exhaustion, physical injuries, mental health issues, diminished performance, and risks to career longevity,” the statement added.

FIFPRO called for the consideration of player health and safety regulations as a “matter of urgency” but that failed to deter FIFA from tinkering with the schedule.

Auckland City, a club made up of amateur players with full-time day jobs, opened their campaign against six-time European champions Bayern Munich and were handed a 10-0 thumping.

The 34-time German champions, fielding a full-strength team, scored four goals in the first 21 minutes of the game in front of a hapless Auckland defence.

Add to it the fact that the fixture seemed more of a practice outing than a challenge for the Bundesliga side, with Bayern coach Vincent Kompany saying: “The next game against Boca Juniors will be the highlight of the group stage.”

While minnows and favourites are often pitted together in global tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, Oceania champions Auckland will also face Argentinian powerhouse Boca Juniors and Portuguese side Benfica in an incredibly tough draw for the team from New Zealand.

It seems unfair for the team rated 4,957th in the world in the Opta Power Rankings to take on opponents ranked sixth (Bayern Munich), 24th (Benfica) and 131st (Boca Juniors).

While Messi-mania brought the crowds in the tournament opener in Miami on June 14, and European champions PSG thrashed Atletico Madrid in front of 80,000 Los Angeles fans at the famous Rose Bowl a day later, the same cannot be said for some of the other fixtures.

Monday's Chelsea vs LAFC encounter at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta was played out in front of less than one-third of the stadium's capacity.

The US-based side are often able to draw close to full-capacity crowds at their home venue in Los Angeles, and Chelsea rarely play in front of so many empty seats, whether at home or away.

The stark contrast from the fervent fan support at their Stamford Bridge home in London prompted Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca to say the atmosphere in Atlanta was “a bit strange.”

The 71,000-capacity venue saw the 3pm kickoff match play out in front of 22,137 spectators.

“I think the environment was a bit strange,” Maresca said after the game.

Of the remaining 36 group-stage games, 13 will be afternoon kickoffs on a weekday and the low ticket sales for the first phase of the tournament could mean that organisers will struggle to fill up the venues.

Strict security measures, which include the presence of border patrol officials and presenting passports as proof of identity, may also deter fans from thronging the venues.

Boca Juniors fans get ready for the Club World Cup with chants and drums on Miami beach. (2:07)

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is off and running, with four strong days of fun and drama already in the books. So let's get you caught up with what you missed and what's ahead today and tomorrow.

Check in with ESPN as we bring you the latest news and analysis, all the way up to the tournament final at MetLife Stadium on July 13.

MIAMI GARDENS, Florida -- The press box at Hard Rock Stadium trembled as Boca Juniors fans celebrated the opening whistle of the team's inaugural Club World Cup match against Benfica. Argentine supporters traveled in their thousands to take over the 200- and 300-level sections behind one of the goals, hanging yellow-and-blue flags and banners on the railings to create a makeshift La Bombonera more than 4,400 miles away in Miami Gardens. It was no surprise after Boca Juniors supporters organized a massive gathering the day prior to the match to celebrate the beginning of the tournament, bringing instruments, flags, banners and an immense passion to Miami Beach. A sea of blue and yellow dominated as far as the eye could see while ""Boca, Boca, Boca"" resonated throughout. Families, from months-old babies to great grandparents, boasted the jerseys.

The Boca Juniors fan base completely took over the city and stadium, making the Argentine team locals away from home. And as the match progressed, the energy inside Hard Rock intensified and proved an integral part of Boca Juniors' success on the pitch.

Boca began Miguel Angel Russo's third term as head coach of the team with the opening goal against Benfica in the 21st minute. Miguel Merentiel shocked the Portuguese team to sneak a goal past goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin. Fans erupted in cheers, throwing drinks in the air, hugging the nearest neighbor before singing ""Dale Bo, Dale Bo"" in perfect unison. Benfica players seemed flustered on the field, overwhelmed by the intensity of the Argentines both on and off the pitch.

Boca Juniors fans and players jumped at any split call from the referee Cesar Ramos, leaving Benfica vulnerable to the pressure. Once Rodrigo Battaglia doubled the lead, the South Americans appeared unstoppable. But the feeling of power, superiority and intensity backfired, leading to a penalty scored by Angel Di Maria for a foul inside the box.

Tension continued to rise, eventually leading to a red card for Boca Juniors' Ander Herrera on the bench and Benfica player Andrea Belotti to leave the Portuguese side down to 10 men on the field.

And it only got worse for Boca Juniors in the second half, when Nicolas Otamendi, loyal fan of their eternal rivals River Plate, scored the equalizer for Benfica. When the announcer presented Otamendi at the beginning of the game, his name was drowned out by boos from Boca fans. This time, fans simply stood in silence and confusion at what just happened in front of their goal.

By the 87th minute, hostility on the pitch took an elevated form and a third, and final, red card was given to Boca Juniors' Jorge Figal to equalize the playing field to 10 each.

The 2-2 draw seemed like an appropriate ending to a tension-fueled match that saw drama on and off the field. And It's only the beginning of the Club World Cup for these two teams. -- Lizzy Becherano

ATLANTA -- Chelsea's 2-0 win over LAFC in Atlanta was FIFA's first significant embarrassment of the tournament to date. Despite spending a reported $50 million on marketing and insisting fans would be enthralled by the newly expanded tournament, Mercedes-Benz Stadium was a hollow shell on Monday.

There is mitigation, of course, given a weekday afternoon scheduling and a U.S.-based team playing more than 2,000 miles from their home having just qualified for this event a couple of weeks ago, but the sight of a wonderful 71,000-capacity stadium like this less than a third full -- 22,137 was the given attendance -- was a far cry from the enthusiasm FIFA had promised.

Ticket prices had been slashed, with general admission available on the day for $51, but there was little late take-up in a city whose team, Atlanta United, have by some distance the best average attendance per game (nearly 47,000 in 2024) of any MLS side.

The city itself is not exactly awash with marketing, either. One bar close to the stadium is the self-appointed ""Club World Cup Headquarters,"" but it did not show Sunday's game involving Bayern Munich and closed minutes after Botafogo vs. Seattle Sounders got underway. FIFA was quick to promote the high attendance at the Rose Bowl when Paris Saint-Germain beat Atlético Madrid and for the opening game in Miami, but they would do well to acknowledge and address the failings here given there is palpable still work to do. -- James Olley

James Olley reacts to Chelsea's 2-0 win over LAFC at the Club World Cup.

BOCA RATON, Florida -- Lots of Man City fans (and Liverpool, for that matter) are waiting to see how Pep Guardiola works with new assistant coach Pep Lijnders, who was such a crucial part of Jurgen Klopp's backroom team at Anfield. It's an interesting union given how fierce the rivalry was between Guardiola's City and Klopp's Liverpool between 2018 and 2024.

At training at Lynn University over the week, it was Lijnders taking centre stage. Guardiola strolled around in the middle of the drills, while Lijnders barked at the different groups to move the ball more quickly. He could he heard shouting ""speed"" again and again -- when he saw something he liked, he'd say ""that's the right tempo.""

Guardiola's City have occasionally been accused of being too slow with the ball, particularly around the opposition penalty area, but it looks like that might be about to change. A team containing the best bits from Guardiola and Klopp is certainly a frightening prospect. -- Rob Dawson

PHILADELPHIA -- Flamengo are talented and experienced. And on a night like this -- in an unseasonably chilly stadium, staring down a bank of Esperance fans intent on making their end of Lincoln Financial Field into some kind of perpetual noise and motion machine -- they needed both.

The Brazilian giants looked to be well on their way a first half which saw the double playmaker combo of Erick Pulgar and Jorginho turn the screws in possession with cult hero Giorgian de Arrascaeta side-footing Luiz Araujo's cutback home. They were 1-0 up at the break, and it could have been more. And it would have been more if Pedro hadn't squandered his chance early in the second half. For 15 minutes or so, the game got a bit scary for Filipe Luis' crew; Youcef Belaili raced down Guillermo Varela's wing as if he owned it, and twice forced saves that were a little too close for comfort. That's why Araujo's pretty diagonal 29 minutes from time to put Flamengo 2-0 up brought a palpable sigh of relief.

Flamengo can out-football almost anyone at this Club World Cup. And they have plenty of been there, done that experience. They just need to ensure they make it count for 90 minutes. -- Gab Marcotti

PASADENA, Calif. -- Just imagine a heat so intense, it makes your toenails hurt. And if you're thinking ""well, that sounds unlikely..."" well you didn't play 90 minutes against the world's best club team, Paris Saint-Germain, in the midday sun at the Rose Bowl on Sunday, did you?

Marcos Llorente's complaint about conditions in Pasadena during the 4-0 loss may have been unexpectedly specific -- ""it's impossible, a terrible heat. My toenails were hurting. I couldn't stop [running], or start,"" he told reporters in the mixed zone -- but the Atlético right-back is far from alone. Even PSG coach Luis Enrique, who was otherwise delighted with his team's comfortable win, said the game was ""clearly impacted"" by the heat. ""It's all very well to pick the kickoff times so that [games] are watched in Europe,"" he jibed, ""but the teams feel the effects of it.""

As for Atlético, it wasn't their last midday appearance at the Rose Bowl. They'll be back in Pasadena on June 23 for another lunchtime kickoff against Botafogo, in what's now a likely must-win game if they want to make the knockout stage.

Over in Florida, where Real Madrid have been training in Palm Beach Gardens, it's as much a question of humidity as heat. Madrid will make their tournament debut against Al Hilal at Hard Rock Stadium, with 60% humidity forecast and temperatures of 91 degrees Fahrenheit. ""It's very hot,"" Vinícius Júnior said on Sunday. ""The game is at 3pm. It's going to be tough.""

Just watch out for those toenails. -- Alex Kirkland

Steve Nicol explains the impact of high temperatures on players and managers at the Club World Cup.

Neto no doubt was the standout player for Enzo Marseca's side as Chelsea kicked off their Club World Cup campaign with a 2-0 win over LAFC on Monday.

Coming in hot after winning the UEFA Nations League with Portugal last week, the 25-year-old was able to score the Blues' first goal by getting the ball from Nicolas Jackson on the flank, before sending defender Ryan Hollingshead to the floor with his turn and slotting his shot into the bottom corner.

If Chelsea looks to win this title in the United States, they will need to rely on the depth of their team, especially in the attack -- now with the addition of new signing Liam Delap -- and players like Neto will be absolutely vital. -- Roberto Rojas

Odds (via ESPN BET): Fluminense (+450), Draw (+340), Dortmund (-190)

Like it or loathe it, the Club World Cup is full of intriguing games and Borussia Dortmund against Fluminense at MetLife Stadium is one of them. Fluminense were beaten Club World Cup finalists in 2023, while Dortmund reached the Champions League final as recently as 2024. One of the most interesting aspects of this tournaments is the ability to compare levels of teams and leagues and this pits Brazil against Germany. Dortmund are favourites after ending their domestic season strongly, but Fluminense -- in the middle of the domestic campaign -- will fancy their chances. -- Dawson

Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).

Odds: River Plate (-180), Draw (+310), Urawa RD (+450)

We'll be saying this a lot during this competition, but yes: this is the first time these two teams have ever met, and I must say that's a fun thing in a competition like this to have such wildly diverging sides and soccer cultures colliding. The odds are tilted quite far in River Plate's favor heading into their Group E opener, the Argentine side boasting several familiar faces -- including former MLS star Sebastian Driussi and midfielder Franco Mastantuono, who is joining Real Madrid following his 18th birthday in August -- and all the momentum. They're still alive in the Copa Libertadores, South America's top continental club competition, and finished second in the league's Apertura, with 10 wins from 16 matches.

Their opponents, meanwhile, are ranked between Raja Casablanca and English minnows Plymouth Argyle in the Opta rankings (298th), a decent approximation of team strength in the world game. Much of Urawa's hopes will fall on midfielder Ryoma Watanabe, who leads the team with six goals in the J.League so far this season, and former Brazil U20 star Matheus Savio, who has a team-high four assists. -- James Tyler

Odds: Ulsan HD (+200), Draw (+220), Sundowns (+140)

You can do a deeper dive on Mamelodi Sundowns and what they hope to get out of this Club World Cup here, but in the interim they are looking to bounce back from the disappointment of losing the African Champions League. Given the dynamics of the group, on paper this is a must-win for both sides, so look out for Sundowns' reliable striker Iqraam Rayners. Sundowns are nicknamed ""the Brazilians"" -- partly for the football they try to play, partly for their bright Selecao-inspired jerseys -- and they have a couple Brazilans that stand out too, like Lucas Ribeiro, who wears the No. 10 (as you'd expect).

Ulsan have been among the top-rated team in Asia for a while now and won the AFC Champions League in 2020. In addition to a strong core of national team players, they boast some imports to watch, above all veteran striker Erick Farias and midfield stalwart (and former Sweden international) Darijan Bojanic. -- Marcotti

Odds: Monterrey (+550), Draw (+360), Inter (-220)

Monterrey enters the Club World Cup with a new head coach and an immense set of expectations as one of just two Liga MX representatives in the tournament. Following a disappointing Clausura campaign, finishing seventh before falling to Toluca in the quarterfinals of the playoffs, formert New York City FC, Flamengo and Galatasaray boss Domenec Torrent took the helm as head coach. Fans now expect the Spaniard to lead Monterrey to glory at the Club World Cup despite the difficult opponents of Group E.

Internazionale, on the other hand, debuts in the Club World Cup after coming second in the 2024-25 Serie A season. There's a fresh face in the Inter dugout too, with Cristian Chivu taking the place of Simone Inzaghi, who left the role following the Italian side's Champions League final loss to Paris Saint-Germain. -- Becherano","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

A transfer from to Old Trafford from Brentford may seem full of glitz and glamour, but that would not be the reality for the Cameroon forward

By the time the 2025-26 Premier League season starts, Bryan Mbeumo will almost certainly be playing his football for a new club. The versatile forward is widely expected to leave Brentford this summer and is one of the top names to watch out for in the summer transfer window.

It has been reported that Mbeumo would favour a move to Manchester United, even though teams who finished much higher than the Red Devils in the table last season are also looking to acquire him. For a couple of weeks, it seemed a formality he would head to Old Trafford, but a spanner has been thrown in the works.

Tottenham's appointment of Bees boss Thomas Frank has coincided with them stepping up their own interest in Mbeumo, and there is hope in north London that the player could change his mind and prefer to join them instead. It would prove a remarkable piece of opportunism from Spurs, and it's actually a plan Mbeumo himself should hear out.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester City have been warned off a transfer gamble on free agent Paul Pogba, with the Premier League no longer a “good fit” for the Frenchman.

Pep Guardiola has been credited with interest in Pogba before, when the World Cup-winning midfielder was performing at the peak of his powers. It is, however, considered unlikely that their paths will cross at the Etihad Stadium in 2025.

Ex-Manchester United star Pogba remains without a club after serving a doping ban and seeing his contract at Serie A giants Juventus terminated. He has been linked with teams around the world, but no deal has been done.

There have been suggestions that Pogba could return to England for a third spell in the Premier League, with City busy bolstering their ranks after missing out on major honours in 2024-25. The 32-year-old has, however, not played a competitive game since September 2023.

With that in mind, former City defender Colin Hendry has told Coin Poker when asked about taking a punt on a proven performer that has lost his way: “What's Pogba been doing for the last few years? That's the thing, you know, there are so many doubts about his ability and where he is as a player because we haven't seen him.


“At his last club, Juventus, he wasn't brilliant, was he? I know he had a lot of issues away from the pitch, so maybe that was part of the reason why he didn't play at his best in Italy, but…there are more reasons not to sign him than to sign him if I'm Pep Guardiola.


“I think gone are the days where players are out of work and then managers look and think, well, he's not played for three months, he's not played for six months, he's not played for nine months, he's not played for a year, let's give him a chance. I don't think that is the case at the elite level regardless of what you've done in the game and what your name is, and maybe Paul Pogba has found that out because no one has taken him so far.


“I don't want to write him off; I hope he can come back and show everyone what he's made of because he's 32 and still could have a couple of good years in him, but I don't think Manchester City or the Premier League is a good fit for him to be honest.”

Pogba has been keeping himself fit while working on an individual training programme. He has spent plenty of time in the United States, alongside wife Zulay, amid talk of a club in MLS offering him a chance to rebuild his career.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Neymar's father has confirmed that transfer talks are planned with Champions League clubs, while an extended stay at Santos remains a possibility.

Brazil's all-time leading goalscorer returned to his roots in January after enduring an injury-ravaged spell at Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal. His lucrative contract in the Middle East was terminated, freeing him to head home.

A short-term deal was agreed at Santos, allowing Neymar to play his way back to form and fitness, and those terms are coming to a close. Speculation is rife regarding the 33-year-old's next move, with interest being mooted from around the world.

Neymar Senior claims leading clubs in Europe are eager to enter into discussions, with L'Equipe being told: “I see a market that's interested. This week, we're going to Miami to talk to clubs. We have to listen to them and decide what we're going to do. 


“Yes, there are European clubs. Some are competing in the Champions League. They know he's capable of having a great season because the lights are green. But the Brazilian market is also interesting.”

With Neymar feeling happy and settled again, with partner Bruna Biancardi by his side, Neymar Sr concedes that remaining with Santos through to the 2026 World Cup is an option being considered. He added: “We'll study all that. But there's a good chance he'll stay at Santos. I'm working for that. 


“That doesn't stop me from listening to other clubs. It's Neymar who will decide whether to stay or not.


“Now we're going to prepare again for an impossible dream: winning the World Cup. Carlo's [Ancelotti] arrival is good, but no matter who's in charge, we have to work. Everything is there to make it work. The team has style. And I can see Neymar with Vini, Rodrygo, Raphinha.”

Neymar is hoping to lead Brazil into the next World Cup as captain of his country. He already has 128 caps and 79 goals for the Selecao, but is determined to take in one more shot at global glory.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Chelsea picked up a positive start to their FIFA Club World Cup journey following a comfortable 2-0 victory over LAFC. The Blues dominated the tie but were not having it easy to break down their opponent, who battled hard for 90 minutes.

Enzo Maresca's side was determined to put on a strong performance in their FIFA CWC opening fixture against LAFC. However, it was far from an easy match for Chelsea as their opponent were set to defend their ground.

The Los Angeles-based outfit's resilience didn't last for 45 minutes, though, as the Blues broke it down in 34 minutes. Portuguese international winger, Pedro Neto, got Chelsea in front as they go into the half-time break.

In the second half, the North London outfit still maintains their domination but is struggling to extend their lead. However, on 79 minutes, Enzo Fernandez finally doubled Chelsea's advantage given them a more comfortable scoreline.

The Blues were not the only top European teams that started their Club World Cup campaign with a victory, as Bayern Munich and PSG also got the same results. Bayern destroyed amateur side, Auckland City 10-0, while the current Champions League winner beat Atletico Madrid 4-0.

Vincent Kompany's side put on a professional attitude as they crushed their opponent in such convincing fashion. Auckland didn't give too much problem, especially in the first 45 minutes which saw Bayern ending the half with a 6-0 advantage.

The Bavarians eventually ended the tie with a 10-0 victory as Jamal Musiala, who came in the second half, netted a hat-trick in that period. That victory gave Kompany's side a massive goal difference ahead of their next two group games.

Meanwhile, fresh from their Champions League glory, PSG continue their excellent form as they beat Atletico convincingly. It was a tricky and exciting encounter as the Spanish side were giving plenty of problems for Luis Enrique's side.

However, PSG were able to showcase their quality and netted four goals through goals from Fabian Ruiz, Vitinha, Senny Mayulu, and Lee Kang-In's spot kick. Atleti's resistance mostly ended after they got down to 10 men following Clement Lenglet's sending off on 78 minutes.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Alcaraz – Davidovich Fokina: 17.06.2025 16:00 CEST
H2H: 2-0

Carlos Alcaraz has won 13 straight matches. His last match was at the French Open when he made an epic comeback against Sinner in the final. His last grass court match was at Wimbledon last season when he defeated Djokovic in the final in straight sets.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has lost three of his last five matches. His last match was at the French Open when he lost in four sets against Lehecka in the second round. His last grass court match was last season in London when he lost in three sets against Tabilo in the opening round.

According to the bookies, Alcaraz is the big favourite in this matchup, and we partially agree. However, after winning the French Open title, Alcaraz partied in Ibiza and stayed away from the tennis courts. On the other hand, Davidovich Fokina is prepared for the upcoming tournaments, and we expect him to keep this match tight.

That said, Davidovich Fokina covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Alejandro Davidovich Fokina +5.5 games handicap @1.91 @bet365

Thompson – Munar: 17.06.2025 16:00 CEST
H2H: 1-1

Jordan Thompson has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Hertogenbosch, Thompson lost in the second round against Diallo in three tight sets. Last season in London, Thompson reached the semifinals at the Queen's Club, eventually losing to Musetti in three sets.

Jaume Munar has lost three of his last five matches. His last match was at the French Open when he lost against Fils in five tight sets. His last grass court match was at Wimbledon last season when he lost against de Minaur in straight sets in the second round.

According to the bookies, Thompson is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is a way better grass-court player than Munar. The Spaniard never succeeded on grass courts. We expect Thompson to dominate.

That being said, Thompson covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jordan Thompson -3.5 games handicap @1.80 @bet365

Diallo – Harris: 17.06.2025 17:30 CEST
H2H: 0-1

Gabriel Diallo has won five straight matches. Last week in Hertogenbosch, Diallo surprisingly won the title. He defeated Bergs in the final in straight sets and secured his maiden ATP title. With his recent solid performances, Diallo also secured a top 50 ranking.

Billy Harris has lost four of his last five matches. Last week in Ilkley, Harris lost against Pinnington Jones in the second round of the Challenger tournament. This week in London, Harris has been granted a wild card.

According to the bookies, Harris is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. Diallo has just won his maiden ATP title and will be emotionally exhausted coming into this match. On the other hand, Harris is a solid grass-court player, and we expect him to keep this match tight.

That being said, Harris covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Billy Harris +3.5 games handicap @1.61 @bet365

Ben Shelton's girlfriend, Trinity Rodman, and sister, Emma Shelton, were full of praise of the American tennis star as he broke into the top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time in his pro career. This progress has been made due to his consistent display of commendable performances, notably throughout this season.

Shelton is one of three Americans ranked in the top 10, alongside Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul. Andre Agassi, James Blake, and Andy Roddick were the last Americans to achieve this feat in April 2006.

Shelton even boasts a rich family history in the sport, being the son of the former World No. 55, Bryan Shelton, who now serves as his head coach.

His soccer star girlfriend, Trinity Rodman, who is the daughter of former Chicago Bulls star Dennis Rodman, showered the tennis star with love on his achievement as shared the news on Instagram stories and wrote:

Ben Shelton's sister Emma also shared the news on Instagram, accompanied by emoticons indicating her excitement in receiving the big news.

Ben Shelton, who is next set to compete at the Queen's Club Championships, expressed his elation on receiving the news.

Ben Shelton expressed his excitement at being able to be a part of the extraordinary group of tennis stars, as he climbed up the world ladder and snatched the 10th spot in the PIF ATP Rankings. It was only three years ago that Shelton had cracked into the top 500 and since then, his career has taken a leap.

However, speaking during his on-court interview at the Stuttgart Open on Friday (June 13), he expressed his excitement and how honored he was on being able to achieve this milestone, which marks a momentous moment in his career.

The tennis star will be looking to rise further up the table, hopeful of delivering some notable performances during the grass stint of the season. He will be in action against Arthur Rinderknech at the HSBC Championships on Tuesday, June 17.

Wimbledon is the next big tournament for the ATP stars to look forward to, and for many, it's the only Grand Slam that truly matters. 

The English major has a tradition like none of the others, and it won't be long before the players are donning the whites and taking to SW19 for a fortnight of tennis. 

Yesterday, Alejandro Tabilo was ruled out of Wimbledon, and that's opened the door for former finalist Marin Cilic to take a place in the main draw at this year's event. 

American tennis is on the rise, with Taylor Fritz up to world number four again after his win in the BOSS Open on Sunday against Alexander Zverev. 

However, for one of Fritz's compatriots, it's hard luck as he's been forced to pull out of Wimbledon amid an injury that has hampered his year. 

For Korda, it's proved a heartbreaking decision, but ultimately, as a young player, he has to do what is right for himself going forward. 

The 24-year-old lost to Frances Tiafoe at the recent French Open but hasn't played since and has now made the decision not to take part in Wimbledon this year. 

It's been confirmed today that Korda has now forfeited his place in the competition, with American player Christopher Eubanks now the fortunate one to benefit. 

The suggestion is that he's still struggling physically and having not played a match on grass, he's decided to pull out in agonising circumstances. 

🚨 OFFICIEL !!! Sebastian Korda 🇺🇸 déclare forfait pour Wimbledon 🇬🇧. ❌Toujours en délicatesse sur le plan physique, l'Américain n'aura pas disputé le moindre match sur gazon. 😢 pic.twitter.com/MVsqqzKxhW

The talented player isn't short of confidence and in 2023, he suggested that he was one of the players in the mix to claim the title. 

His confidence was somewhat blind as he lost in the first round to Czech player Jiri Vesely in four sets. 

Going into the tournament, Korda told Tennis TV: “I'm very confident in myself on a grass court. I'm an aggressive player, like to come to the net, I have good hands and I definitely feel as if I'm one of the favourites at Wimbledon.”

Korda has only ever had a run to the fourth round once at Wimbledon and that came all the way back in 2021. 

Now, he will have to wait another year to improve on that with the American world number 26 making the tough decision to withdraw from this year's Wimbledon. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The first Italian tennis player to reach the top of the ATP ranking and his doping controversy","https://tennishead.net/who-is-jannik-sinner-the-first-italian-tennis-player-to-reach-the-top-of-the-atp-ranking-and-his-doping-controversy/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 09:15:00 GMT","

Fresh from climbing to the historic world No. 1 ranking, Italian tennis sensation Jannik Sinner remains the sport's dominant force.

This emphatic right-hander has carved an impressive path on the ATP Tour, highlighted by three Grand Slam triumphs – including consecutive Australian Open titles – and a victory at the ATP Finals.

While his career has seen remarkable highs, it has also seen tough times, including a notable doping controversy.

Whilst his next appearance is due to be at the Halle Open next week, Tennis Head has everything you need to know about Sinner.

As of May 2025, Jannik Sinner confirmed that he is single. He was previously in a relationship with fellow tennis player Anna Kalinskaya.

Their romance, although kept private, became public in May 2024, when Sinner confirmed they were together during the French Open, and they were often seen supporting each other at tournaments.

However, they broke up in late 2024. There have been rumours linking him to Russian model Lara Leito, but Sinner has publicly said that he is not in a relationship.

As of June 10, 2024, Jannik Sinner holds the world No. 1 ranking in men's singles according to the ATP.

He achieved this career-high position on this date, making him the first Italian male tennis player to ever reach the top spot in the ATP rankings.

His ascent to world No. 1 follows a highly successful period, including winning major titles at the 2024 Australian Open and 2024 US Open, as well as the 2024 ATP Finals.

Jannik Sinner has an impressive Grand Slam record, having won three major singles titles and reached at least the semifinals of every Grand Slam.

Australian Open: Sinner has a strong record at the Australian Open, winning the title twice. In 2024, he secured his first Grand Slam championship by defeating Daniil Medvedev in a five-set final, coming back from two sets down. He continued his success in 2025, winning the Australian Open for the second consecutive year by defeating Alexander Zverev in straight sets in the final.

French Open: Sinner has always performed well at Roland Garros. In 2025, he reached the final, where he faced Carlos Alcaraz in a highly anticipated match. This marked his best performance at the French Open to date. He also reached the semifinals in 2024 and the quarterfinals in 2020.

Wimbledon: Sinner has shown significant improvement on grass, reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2023. This was a notable achievement, showing his adaptability across different surfaces. In 2024, he reached the quarterfinals.

US Open: Sinner claimed his second Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2024. He defeated Taylor Fritz in straight sets in the final to secure the championship. Before this victory, he had reached the quarterfinals in 2022 and the fourth round in 2021 and 2023.

A post shared by Lavazza (@lavazzaofficial)

Jannik Sinner is from Italy and was born in Innichen San Candido, a town in the South Tyrol province of northern Italy, near the Austrian border. He grew up in Sexten, another town in the Dolomites.

Sinner began playing tennis at the age of seven, but he also had a talent for skiing and football. It wasn't until around age 13 that he committed to tennis, moving away from home to train at the Piatti Tennis Center in Bordighera, on the Italian Riviera. This move, supported by his parents, was a key step in his development to becoming a professional tennis player.

Jannik Sinner was born on August 16, 2001, making him 23 years old as of June 13, 2025. He stands at a height of 1.91 meters (6 feet 3 inches). His career has been marked by a notable list of achievements for someone so young. He became the first male player born in the 2000s to reach the top 10 and, in 2024, won his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open at just 22. 

By 23, he had secured two more Grand Slams (2024 US Open, 2025 Australian Open), won the ATP Finals, and climbed to the world No. 1 ranking, making him the first Italian to achieve this feat.

Jannik Sinner's estimated net worth is between $26-$27 million. His wealth primarily derives from a mixture of his significant tennis prize money and lucrative endorsement deals.

By June 9, 2025, his career prize money stood at over $41.5 million, placing him among the top-earning players in ATP history. In 2024 alone, he earned a record-breaking $19.74 million in prize money.

Additionally, he has substantial earnings from sponsorships with major brands like Nike, Gucci, Rolex, and Lavazza, which contribute an estimated $15 million annually to his income.

A post shared by Jannik Sinner (@janniksin)

Jannik Sinner was involved in a doping controversy in 2024, which ended in early 2025, after twice testing positive for clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid.

The positive tests occurred in March 2024 during Indian Wells and an out-of-competition test. Sinner's defence centred on inadvertent contamination: his physiotherapist, who had a cut finger, used an over-the-counter clostebol-containing spray (Trofodermin) and then massaged Sinner without gloves, transferring the substance.

The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) initially cleared Sinner of “no fault or negligence.” However, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed, arguing strict liability and seeking a two-year ban. To avoid a lengthy legal battle, Sinner and WADA settled in February 2025.

Sinner accepted a three-month ban, retroactive from February 9 to May 4, 2025. This allowed him to play in the French Open, but he forfeited prize money and ranking points from Indian Wells.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

It's been a roller coaster past few years for Ben Shelton. From winning his first ATP tour title at 21 to making two Grand Slam semifinals, the young American has been on a roll. Shelton hit his latest milestone on Monday by cracking the ATP Top 10 for the first time in his career.

After making his first grass court semifinal at the BOSS OPEN last week, the 22-year-old rises from World No. 12 to No. 10. Shelton joins Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, and Roscoe Tanner as one of four American lefties to crack the Top 10 in the modern ATO rankings that have been in place since 1973.

He now joins compatriots Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul, World No. 4 and 8, respectively, at the top of the rankings, marking the first time in 19 years that three American men hold top ten positions. 

Andy Roddick, James Blake, and Andre Agassi were the last American trio to hold top ten spots during the week of April 17, 2006.

A post shared by ATP Tour (@atptour)

Shelton made his ATP Tour debut as a wildcard at the 2022 Atlanta Open, defeating Ramkumar Ramanathan in the first round before falling to John Isner in three sets in the second. 

He received a second wildcard to the Cincinnati Masters a few weeks later, where he recorded his first victory over a top-100 player after his win over World No. 56 Lorenzo Sonego. He went on to defeat World No. 5 Casper Rudd in a three-set battle for his first top-10 win. 

Shortly before the 2022 US Open, Shelton announced that he would be joining the professional tour, leaving his college team at the University of Florida. Shelton won two SEC Championships and the 2021 NCAA Championships, Florida's first national title, over the course of his college career. 

He finished the 2021-22 season as the top-ranked collegiate tennis player in the US as both the SEC and National Player of the Year.

Since the start of his professional career, Shelton played hard and fast, quickly rising through the rankings while defeating some notable opponents. 

Then, 2023 proved to be his breakout year with a run to his first Major semifinal at the 2023 US Open and claiming his maiden ATP title at the 2023 Japan Open Tennis Championships. He cracked the Top 20 with a spot at World No. 15 after winning his first title.

A second tour title came in 2024 in Houston on clay, and Shelton became the youngest American No. 1 since Andy Roddick in 2004. He reached a second Major semifinal at the 2025 Australian Open, falling to eventual champion Jannik Sinner in straight sets.

Perhaps the most notable aspect of the American's rise is his killer serve, one he can serve at up to 150 mph. 

As a lefty, his kick serve proves dangerous to top-ranked players, averaging at 126 mph in placements all around the service box. It's a serve that's helped him take advantage of key moments to avoid service breaks while relying on speed and net play to break others.

Shelton is back in action tomorrow morning at the Queen's Club in London as the sixth seed, where he looks to play for his first ATP 500 title.

Jack Draper laid down an impressive opening marker at the HSBC Championships on Tuesday, when he dispatched American Jenson Brooksby 6-3, 6-1 to reach the second round in west London.

The British No. 1 has earned victories against Jannik Sinner (2021) and Carlos Alcaraz (2024) at the ATP 500 grass-court event in the past and returned to The Queen's Club this week at No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Draper is just the fourth British player to be a top-two seed at the tournament but he did not let the pressure faze him in a dominant first-round performance against Brooksby. The 23-year-old won 93 per cent (27/29) of his first-serve points and did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

""My preparation has not been unbelievable. I have had a couple of niggles,"" Draper said. ""I was thinking I haven't played too much on grass either after a long clay-court season, trying to adapt to that surface and it is a challenge. I am enjoying being at home and staying in my own bed.""

Draper leads Brooksby 4-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having defeated the 24-year-old en route to the Indian Wells title in March. The lefty, who is 4-0 in opening rounds at The Queen's Club, will next play Alexei Popyrin. The Australian defeated countryman Aleksandar Vukic 6-2, 6-7(9), 7-3(3).

Draper is chasing his second tour-level title on grass, after winning in Stuttgart last season.

""The court is good, it has held up well. It is amazing that the girls got to play here in London,""Draper added when talking about the WTA event held at The Queen's Club. ""Queen's is one of the best tournaments in the world... I am really happy to be on the centre court again this year.""

World No 1 downplayed American's victory

Sabalenka says she did not intend to attack opponent

Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologise for the “unprofessional” comments she made after her loss to the American in the final of the French Open.

Speaking to Eurosport Germany, Sabalenka said her remarks after her defeat by Gauff at Roland Garros this month were a mistake. In her post-match press conference in Paris, Sabalenka had suggested that the result was more due to her own errors than to Gauff's performance.

“I think she won the match not because she played incredible,” Sabalenka said at the time. “Just because I made all of those mistakes, if you look from the outside, from kind of easy balls.”

However, Sabalenka now says she regrets those remarks. “That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka told Eurosport Germany. “I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then. You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward – not immediately, but recently.”

Sabalenka hit 37 winners but finished the final with 70 unforced errors. Gauff had 30 winners and 30 unforced errors. The Belarusian, the world No 1, said she wrote to Gauff to apologise and “make sure she knew she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her”.

“I never intended to attack her,” Sabalanka added. “I was super-emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I'm not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realised a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?”

Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff in the 2023 US Open final, where she also won the first set. “I kept getting so emotional,” Sabalenka said. “So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn't be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

The tennis calendar is so unforgiving that it almost forces players and fans to move on from what might have been the most exciting or crushing matches of their lives.

This month's French Open final marks the perfect example.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner played out the most extraordinary match in recent memory; a five-set epic where the former came from two sets to love down to claim the title.

The tennis world and beyond stopped to watch in awe history unfolding before their very eyes.

And yet, less than two weeks on, the grass-court season is in full swing, with clay a thing of the past.

Some, like Darren Cahill and his team, might find it harder than others to move on.

Speaking on the Served with Andy Roddick podcast, they could not get Cahill on without touching on that legendary showdown earlier this month.

Speaking about these two superstars, destined to dominate for the next decade and beyond, the Aussie claimed: 'And with that, they have great self-awareness. I think Carlos has it as well. I think he's very aware of his surroundings, very aware of his success and his popularity. And Jannik is as well, and all at the same time, he's able to keep his feet on the ground.

‘So what you see from the outside, you know, we were so damn proud of him, regardless of whether he won or lost that match. Obviously, we wanted him to win that match, we were heartbroken not to win it, but you send a player on the court, the one thing you ask for is for that player to give them everything you have. That's it as a coach, and he gave us more than that.

‘So, when you look at a tennis match, the way it was played, how good it was, how well those two guys competed, no toilet breaks, no physios, no trainers, no complaining, just pure five and a half hours of brilliant tennis, business-like tennis, great respect between the two players. You can't ask for anything more as a coach.

‘So, regardless of the result, I take my hat off to Carlos. He's an amazing young man, we have an incredible respect for him, but believe it or not, I've been with Jannik for over three years now. I have more respect for him now watching after that match in the Roland Garros final than I had before that, and that's hard to say because I know him pretty damn well. So, for me, that was the biggest takeaway from that French Open final.'

Carlos Alcaraz revealed what so many people have told him about the French Open final, which should offer some solace to Sinner.

Sinner has already proven his unflinching mentality throughout a sparkling short career thus far, and whilst this will surely be the most crushing defeat yet, there's no doubt that he'll bounce back from this too.

Fortunately, the French Open's finish offers little time for skulking around, as redemption is just around the corner.

Wimbledon starts in less than two weeks.

There, the 23-year-old will be handed the perfect opportunity for revenge, to exorcise the Philippe Chatrier demons that will haunt him for years to come.

Nobody ever really forgets these kinds of defeats, but the measure of an elite player is how they recover.

The world will be watching Sinner's response with eagerness, first at Halle this week, and then at Wimbledon later this month.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Patrick Mouratoglou has revealed the biggest factor in Carlos Alcaraz's win in their epic French Open final was their forehands, backhands or serves.

The sporting world was enthralled by the sensational Roland Garros showdown between Alcaraz and Sinner, with the Spaniard saving three match points before winning a decisive fifth set tie breaker.

Now Mouratoglou, who is the current coach of Naomi Osaka and former coach of Serena Williams, has given his verdict on the Paris epic, as he gave his views on a detailed LinkedIn post.

“That Roland-Garros final was the best we've ever seen,” declared Mouratoglou.”Not because of the scoreline, or the hype, but because of the level.

“Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner played the highest level of tennis you can expect from two players today.

“Physically, mentally, tactically; everything was there. For over five hours, the intensity never dropped.

“It took me some time to reflect on this final. I wanted to step back, absorb the emotions, and listen to what others had to say before sharing mine.

“Now, eight days later, one thing still stands out to me: the mental aspect of this final.”

Mouratoglou recently released a book looking at the mental side of tennis and sport in general and he suggested the final set was a triumph for both players, even though Alacarz eventually came out on top.

Sinner could have crumbled after he lost three match points at 5-3 in the fourth set, but he responded impressively and was close to victory again in the final game before the deciding tie-break.

“Every time one of them was close to losing, they found another gear. That happened again and again, from both sides,” said Mouratoglou.

“At two sets to one, Sinner was leading 5-3, 0-40. He had the match in hand. He didn't convert, got broken, and lost the set.

“But he didn't collapse. He came back in the fifth, still competing at the same intensity. That says a lot about who he is.

“As for Alcaraz, he knew exactly when it mattered most. In the super tiebreak, you could feel it: this is the moment. He went for it. And that's what made the difference.

“This wasn't just a final; it was a reminder of how far tennis has come. And how much of it is played in the mind.”

The two top players in men's tennis are back in action this week as they start their grass court campaigns ahead of Wimbledon, with Alcaraz admitting he has looked back on clips of his Roland Garros win against Sinner after he took a break from the game following his Paris heroics.

“I have seen a lot of videos from that match, that moment from match point down,” he said.

“I still watch it sometimes and can't believe I came back from that moment. Sometimes it is difficult to realise that I am in this position, that I won Roland Garros. I still watch the videos and am still in shock sometimes.

“To put it into words is really difficult honestly. To come from two sets down against the world No. 1, the level that he was playing, it is unbelievable.

“It was the first time that I have come back from 2-0 down and honestly I just put my heart into it. I just tried to keep it going, not thinking about the result.

“I think to say it was one of the best finals in the history of the Grand Slams is really high status. I have to say, there have been better finals.

“I am going to say one, Novak against Rafa in the final of the Australian Open. I think that level of final is pretty high, I am just really happy to put my name in one of the best finals.”

Coco Gauff reacts to Aryna Sabalenka's comments after winning the French Open, saying both faced the same conditions and hopes fans still show Sabalenka grace. (0:47)

BERLIN -- Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologize for the ""unprofessional"" comments she made following her loss to her American rival in the final of the French Open.

Speaking to Eurosport Germany, the top-ranked Sabalenka said her remarks after her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 loss to Gauff at Roland Garros this month were a mistake.

Wimbledon has been renowned for its class, history and prestige in tennis ever since it was established in 1877.

Traditions have been a mainstay at the All England Club in SW19, with strawberries and cream one of the delights amongst fans.

Pimm's is also a popular beverage for spectators, some of whom are famous faces that take their seats in the prestigious Royal Box.

But there's one piece of Wimbledon heritage that's strictly preserved by tournament officials - the official competitor dress code.

Whilst dark green and purple are the official championship colours, players have long been required to wear all-white outfits.

Regulations on attire were initially enforced in 1963 and called for all competitors in SW19 to dress 'predominantly in white'. 

This was changed 32 years later to 'almost entirely white', and covers both practice and official matches throughout the tournament.

Players must adhere to the rules and if they don't, they are likely to be asked to change into the accepted garments.

Anna Kournikova became familiar with this in 2002 when she fell foul of the Wimbledon regulations.

The former Russian player, who was once the world no.8, wore black shorts during a practice session.

Kournikova therefore needed to change but with no white shorts to hand, she had to resort to a different item of clothing.

In order to comply with the dress code, she borrowed a pair from her coach, the late and legendary Nick Bollettieri.

Kournikova wore an all-white outfit for her first round match against compatriot Tatiana Panova, who won 6-1 4-6 6-4.

But she's certainly not been the only player to have gone against the Wimbledon dress requirements.

Andre Agassi, who won the men's singles title in 1992, wrote about his dislike of the rules in his autobiography Open.

""I resent rules, but especially arbitrary rules. Why must I wear white? I don't want to wear white. 

""Why should it matter to these people what I wear? Above all, I took offence at being barred and blocked and made to feel unwanted.""

Agassi even decided not to play at Wimbledon from 1988 until 1990 due to the tradition, although he did return the year before his win.

More recently, Ons Jabeur seemed to forget the rules in 2023 ahead of her women's singles final clash against Marketa Vondrousova.

Jabeur wore a black top during practice and was told to return to the changing rooms.

Once she had changed into the requested white, she made her way back onto the court and then fell to a 6-4 6-4 defeat.

Although colourless clothes are mandatory, Wimbledon introduced a key change two years ago for the female players.

They are now able to wear mid or dark-coloured undershorts as long as they are not longer than their skirts or shorts.

Coco Gauff was one player who welcomed the change as she spoke on how she played at Wimbledon on her period in 2022.

""I was on my period last year at Wimbledon and it was very stressful,"" she said to Sky News.

""You have period underwear to help you but it's still in the back of your mind. 

""Sometimes when you go to the bathroom, you're supposed to use the bathroom but sometimes I would go to check nothing was showing.

""I think it's going to relieve a lot of stress for me and other girls in the locker room, for sure.""

*Exception provided for female players who are allowed to wear solid, mid/dark-coloured undershorts provided they are no longer than their shorts or skirt.

Jack Draper began his pursuit of grass-court glory with a dominant victory over Jenson Brooksby, claiming 10 of the last 11 games in a performance that had the fans gasping at his best shots.

This is Draper's first summer as the undisputed main man of British tennis, following Andy Murray's retirement last year, but he showed little sign of being burdened by expectation.

Well, actually, Draper might have been a little tight early on. In the opening game or three, he responded slowly to Brooksby's 110mph first serves – which are milk floats by the super-powered standards of the modern tour – and snatched at forehands too early in rallies.

But as soon as Draper became used to Brooksby's conservative positional tennis, and realised that there were no big surprises here to ambush him, he relaxed and began to show his class. Winner after winner zipped off the baseline and slammed into the backboard as Draper dashed to a 6-3, 6-1 victory in just 77 minutes.

There will be sterner tests ahead, but Draper looks ready to introduce himself to floating sports fans over the next few weeks. If he remains a well-kept secret within British sport, despite his recent ascent to the heady heights of No 6 in the world rankings, that is probably because he has never made a deep run at Wimbledon.

Drawn against defending champion Novak Djokovic on his SW19 debut in 2021, Draper lost to Alex de Minaur in the third round a year later, then missed 2023 entirely with a nasty shoulder injury.

He should have done better than the second round last summer, but then he came up against a regular practice partner in Cameron Norrie – another left-hander who knew his game inside out.

This year, the opportunity is there for Draper – who could earn a top-four seeding with a deep run this week – to show what he can do on this surface. A glorious first outing at Queen's, beneath a burning sun and a full set of stands, made for the ideal start.

Carlos Alcaraz ensured that, however, he spent the days after his Roland Garros epic against Jannik Sinner, there would be no upset at the start of the grass court season, with a straight sets win over lucky loser Adam Walton.

Having reacted to winning in Paris with an annual tradition excursion to Ibiza, Alcaraz was not faultless against Australian Walton ranked 86th in the world, despite winning 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).

Almost exactly a year ago, Alcaraz arrived at Queen's tired from his break in Ibiza, and his Queen's title defence did not go as planned when he was beaten in under 100 minutes by Jack Draper.

Against Walton, understandably, the tennis was not as smooth as it might have been two weeks ago, and there were a number of baseline exchanges that could have been won earlier.

After four exchanges of serve in the opener, Alcaraz broke. It might have been later than he should have; he had come to the net earlier in the game and missed what could have been a decisive drop shot.

But third time lucky, Alcaraz won the break point, when Walton fired a backhand into the net, with the Spaniard celebrating with a fist pump.

In the second set, Walton's serves might have lacked power but the 110-115mph efforts were well-placed and often wide which left Alcaraz reaching.

At one point trying to race back to get the ball, Alcaraz even tried a ‘tweener' a shot in between the legs to get the ball back over the net, it didn't come off, the shot was too low, but it entertained the mostly full Andy Murray Arena.

This close to one of the Points of the Year 🤏What a point from both players 👏#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/Cxu5TJRagX

Walton had two chances to take the game to a decider, but facing the danger brought out the best of world No. 1 Alcaraz, saving both with an ace and another strong serve.

For Alcaraz, it is very much: first hurdle of the grass court season down, many more to come as he targets a Wimbledon title defence.

... is the winner of Jordan Thompson and Jaume Munar, which is ongoing as we speak. 

I feel at home I feel loved so thank you. First match on grass never easy to get used to the competition, get used to the grass.

He has played a few matches already on grass so I think he's more experienced this year on grass. I'm really happy with the performance today, I feel great, a lot of things to improve and a lot of things to work on to feel more comfortable but in general I'm happy to get through.

Winning is a habit 🙌@carlosalcaraz wins his first match since his epic Roland-Garros final 6-4 7-6 over Walton!#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/md5Jkrm1lz

Walton return long, 4-3. Walton second serve but Alcaraz nets a forehand return, 4-4. Cat and mouse rally, Walton doesn't do enough with his volley and Alcaraz punishes him with a volley down the line, 5-4.

Walton backhand into the net, 6-4. Two match points...

Alcaraz gets Walton on the run, opens up the court and flicks a forehand winner into the space, 7-4.

GAME SET MATCH ALCARAZ!!!!

Alcaraz backhand into the net, 0-1. Alcaraz drop shot winner, 1-1. First serve into the body unreturned by Walton, 2-1. Wild forehand long by Alcaraz, 2-2. Alcaraz return into the net, 2-3. Walton return flies long, 3-3.

Facing those two set points seems to have sparked Alcaraz into life. 

On his next service game, he plays two exquisite drop shots including a feint, that Walton can only watch.

Into a tie-break we go as Alcaraz holds with an exquisite half volley winner. Shades of Roger Federer with that touch.

Courtside with Carlitos 🤩@QueensTennis | #HSBCChampionships | @carlosalcaraz pic.twitter.com/FYnOayOS2N

Problems for Walton after his backhand sits up nicely for Alcaraz to drill a backhand winner down the line, 15-30. Much needed first serve for Walton is unreturned, 30-30. 

Frustration for Alcaraz as he makes a surprising error on his backhand, pushing the ball long, 40-30. Walton books himself a tie-break when Alcaraz slices a defensive forehand into the net.

Loss of focus from Alcaraz as a third double fault of the match makes it 15-30. Deep return by Walton and Alcaraz nets, two set points for Walton. 

Alcaraz goes to his tried and trusty wide first serve, which is unreturned. Second break point... First serve in from Alcaraz and Walton's return is long. To deuce.

Two more first serves, two more unreturned balls and Alcaraz sees out the danger. Almost felt like Alcaraz wanted to feel a little danger.

You would expect the pressure to hit Walton but not yet. He holds with a blistering forehand winner down the line that catches the outside of the sideline.

Alcaraz will serve to stay in the set next.

WALT a hit 🚀@AdamWalton99 #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/mQXrJRB3yO

So reminiscent of Rafael Nadal when Alcaraz skips to his left to run around his backhand and whip a forehand down the line. It's a beautiful shot to see. 

And he finishes the love game with a deft drop volley winner. He's having fun out there in the sun.

High volley winner by Alcaraz makes it 30-30. Big point coming up. Walton finds his first serve and Alcaraz nets his return. Another backhand into the net by Alcaraz and Walton holds. 

On we go!

When Alcaraz injects more pace to his shots, he continues to earn cheap errors from Walton. Alcaraz holds again as we enter the business end of the set and you can be sure he will want to get a break soon.

Walton is clearly favouring his forehand side, which in turn is leaving him exposed by just how far he has run around the ball to take it on the forehand.

That being said, his serve might lack power by the standards of the majority of those in the top 30 on the tour, but his 110-115mph efforts are well-placed and difficult to return.

Lovely hands by Walton in the forecourt to react to Alcaraz's backhand down the line with an angled half volley winner. Not an easy finish, but he finished that like prime Pat Cash.

Serve continues to be king in this set as Alcaraz holds to love with a trademark forehand winner down the line. The best forehand in men's tennis?

Both players using the serve out wide very effectively to earn cheap points. Another strong hold by Walton to stay in the lead in this set. Can he make any inroads on Alcaraz's serve in this match?

Feels as though Alcaraz is using this as practice. Taking risks on serve, working on his slice and striking the ball early. He completes another service hold routinely.

Good response by Walton to losing the first set by holding here. Very unlikely he will win this match but the level he is showing is far above his current ranking and his game looks well suited to grass.

Alcaraz shakes off the rustiness to bring up two set points at 40-15. And he sees out the set with a second serve ace.

A very controlled and clinical display.

In typical British fashion, there is a strong contingent of support for Walton, the Australian underdog in his first-ever match against Alcaraz.

Alcaraz, on the other han,d has allowed him back into games that he should have wrapped up two or three points earlier. Maybe we are seeing a bit of rustiness in his first match on grass of the season.

Double fault by Walton makes it 0-30. Three first serves in a row rescue the Australian and move him to 40-30. Gorgeous footwork by Alcaraz to run around a Walton slice and blast a forehand winner down the line, deuce. Gasps from the crowd as he hit that.

Deep Alcaraz return and Walton's reply is into the net, set point. Wild forehand by Alcaraz after an extended rally, back to deuce. Blocked return down the line and into the net for a volley winner by Alcaraz, second set point. Walton survives again after Alcaraz nets.

Warm applause for Walton as he holds and asks Alcaraz to serve for the set.

Ferocious Forehand 🔥@carlosalcaraz #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/Pe38dlsnLH

Alcaraz's class is beginning to tell but Walton shows him that he's not going away with a forehand return winner, 30-15. Efficient service hold for Alcaraz completed when a swinging first serve is unreturned.

Refreshment break between the matches is well and truly over and the stands of the Andy Murray Arena are almost as full as they were for home favourite Jack Draper around 40 minutes previously.

Alcaraz has been in decent touch so far in these almost Spanish-like conditions that earlier caused one spectator to faint, leading to a brief pause in Draper's match.

Nice play by Walton to send Alcaraz the wrong way with a cross court flick, 30-15. He then whips a forehand into the corner that Alcaraz gives up running for, 40-15. The Aussie is playing some inspired stuff.

But a couple of errors keep Alcaraz in the game, and then a double fault coughs up a break point for the Spaniard. Relief for Walton as Alcaraz's return drifts long. 

Routine forehand into the net by Walton as Alcaraz ramps up the pressure. Break point. Alcaraz on the attack, Walton scrambles to stay in the point, Alcaraz comes into the net but pushes his volley long. Another chance for Alcaraz to break comes after his forehand return is too good for Walton.

Not enough first serves for Walton to give him cheap points and the pressure finally tells when he nets a backhand. Alcaraz breaks.

Alcaraz is looking equally comfortable on serve so far amd he holds to love with a vintage forehand winner down the line.

Emma Raducanu will team up with French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz in the mixed-doubles at the US Open, with a prize of $1 million for the winners.

The new doubles team – which can expect to be given a portmanteau nickname of either “Alcaranu” or “Raducaraz” – is one of several eye-catching partnerships that will make their debut in New York in August.

Read more here.

Walton is doing everything right at the moment. He is keeping Alcaraz on the move, pushing him left and right and making enough first serves to avoid pressure. A very shapr start for the Australian, who got a late call to play as a lucky loser.

This is the first meeting between the two players. Walton won't have faced a player of his calibre before but she's standing his ground so far and making things awkward for Alcaraz. 

Impressive athleticism by Alcaraz to stretch and hit a backhand overhead smash. Walton gets to the ball and his flick into play drifts wide.

So we join this match at 1-1 after both players held serve to start the match. It will be interesting to see how Alcaraz adapts, in what is his first match since that epic victory at the French Open, earlier this month.

The Spaniard partied in Ibiza last week so hopefully he's recovered and can put on a show. Walton holds here to maintain his lead.

... is top seed and world No 2 Carlos Alcaraz where he meet Australia's Adam Walton.

Feels amazing, no place I'd rather be. We travel the world playing tennis, never get to come home or spend much time with my family but to be on this court in front of you guys, my people, my family, thank you.

It's tricky coming onto the grass after clay, to adapt, I'm hitting the ball a bit late not on time. The more matches and time I have on practice courts I'll get better and better and it's definitely a surface I really enjoy playing on and obviously a win helped as well.

So proud, obviously coming back here a year later is a testament to the hard work from me and my team and all the people who have supported me to be a better player and person. I'm excited to see how I can get on this week I feel excited I feel ready and I want to do my best.

Sealed with an ACE ☄️@jackdraper0 storms through at the #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/AQF6LZhRrk

Draper can just explode on his shots when Brooksby pushes him out wide as he does when he moves out to his forehand and powers a forehand cross court that is too hot for his opponent, 30-15.

Rare serve and volley from Draper but he nets the volley on the stretch, 30-30. First serve unreturned brings up a match point. Boom! Ace down the T and it's GAME SET MATCH DRAPER!!!

Brooksby is caught out by a deep Draper return and flicks his backhand wide to give the Briton a break point. Draper's weight of shot proves too much for Brooksby again, who nets a forehand.

Draper breaks and will serve for the match.

Ever since Draper's opening service games, Brooksby has had little joy and his screams out in anger after another first serve from the Briton is too much for him.

After an eight minute stoppage, play resumes with Brooksby leading 30-0 but Draper gets on the board with a crushing backhand winner down the line. 

Draper continues to be all over the Brooksby second serve and he fires a forehand return winner down the line. Brooksby saves a break point with a much needed first serve. 

Draper finds the line with a dipping top spin forehand down the line. Gutsy play by Brooksby as he sneaks into the net and hits a cute a volley that Draper reaches but can't get over the net.

Big first serve by Brooksby and Draper's return drifts wide, allowing him to hold.

Delay in play due to an incident in the crowd. It's a warm day in west Kensington. The players are advised to take a seat which they do while treatment is administered. 

Sloppy start by Draper as he slips to 0-30 He responds with a perfect swinging ace. Ideal placement from him. Brooksby then lets him off the hook with a backhand into the tramlines.

Wide ace from Draper and he holds again.

Brooksby sees his forehand clip the net cord and fly wide and that gives Draper a break point. Draper gets a look at a second serve and his return is deep and puts Brooksby in trouble. The American gets the ball back in play but Draper steps in and whips a forehand into the corner to break.

Six games in a row for Draper.

Draper's maintain his momentum with another routine hold. With his serve clicking the way it is, Brooksby's hopes today look very slim.

Brooksby is an awkward customer and Draper looked anxious and short of feel in the early stages. Fortunately, he was able to fall back on his lethal leftie serve. During that set, he won 14 out of 15 points behind his first delivery.

Once Draper began to settle in, he reeled off the last four games in assured style. You could tell he was feeling comfortable when he went for a 100mph return winner down the line. He missed – but the very fact that he had the confidence to try it suggested a positive mental state.

As far as opening points go...@jackdraper0 starting as he means to go on 🚀#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/4S3YEoSCjo

Draper is taking the ball early and putting pressure on Brooksby's serve which has gone AWOL. Brooksby forehand long and Draper earns his first set point. 

Brooksby serve and volleys, then hits an overhead which Draper chases out to reach but can't get the ball into play, deuce. Another chance for Draper to close out the set when Brooksby nets a forehand. Too good from Draper. The depth on his shots means Brooksby is forced to hit half volleys on the baseline. After a series of big hits, Draper breaks through with a vicious forehand winner down the line.

Draper's first serve followed by his forehand is an unstoppable combo. Nothing Brooksby can do about in this game and Draper holds to love to consolidate the break. Draper is all business so far. There's an aura about him out on the court.

Brooksby handles what looked like an awkward volley very well and the ball spins away from Draper's reach. 30-15. Brooksby has missed three first serves in a row but Draper isn't doing enough to apply pressure on the second, the slowest being 69mph.

Good defence by Draper to retrieve a Brooksby overhead and the American nets a forehand, break point. Brooksby sees off the danger with a wide ace. Another chance to break comes Draper's way and this time he gets it when Brooksby dumps a backhand into the net.

Draper's serve is starting to fire up and Brooksby's frustration builds after a couple of missed returns. A fifth ace of the match for Draper and he holds again.

A few too many errors from Draper. He's just pushing it at the moment when a little more patience is required. Brooksby comes through another service game untroubled.

After two months grinding on the clay and needing to hit extra balls to finish points, Draper will be pleased to be on the grass again and see his shots fly away from opponents. His power is one of the big reasons why he is a major contender for Wimbledon and he holds here to 15 comfortably.

The reason for Brooksby's strange looking serve is the multitude of injuries he has had on his wrist and shoulder over the years. So fair play for finding something that works for him. Draper is yet to get to grips with it and Brooksby holds to love to take the lead.

Draper's forehand is fine fettle so far. He drills a forehand down the line that's too hot for the advancing Brooksby, 15-15. Andy Murray Arena is not completely full. Plenty of empty seats at this stage of the match. 

First double fault for Draper takes the game to deuce. But he holds with another powerful forehand down the line.

The American has the honour of serving first and we get a glimpse of his very unique service motion. He starts with the racket resting on the back of his neck and releases once the ball is tossed into the air. 

It is the type of service action that you'd see at the park or local club. But it is clearly working for him as he holds to 15.

It's not Wimbledon so players can play in whatever colour they want and Draper comes out in a red and burgundy number. 

The warm up has started and play should start very soon.

Daily sport newsletter

Hello and welcome to coverage from Queen's Club as Jack Draper gets his campaign under way.

The Briton arrives at Queen's as the second seed at an ATP 500 tournament for the first time and will undoubtedly be a leading contender to challenge for the title.

“I look back on my clay court season as a whole and as someone who hasn't done that well on the clay I thought I embraced the surface very well and I improved a lot on it,” Draper reflected in his press conference ahead of the HSBC Championships.

“I got home, had a couple of days off then got on the grass. I was happy to get on a faster surface to be honest. In tennis you have to have a short term memory, you have to understand why you lost certain matches.  

“I take it in my stride and obviously feel good coming into these next few tournaments.”

With Wimbledon less than two weeks away, Draper will want to have a strong week in west Kensington to boost his preparation.

“I think there's no secret I'd love to do amazingly well this week but Wimbledon would be a priority for me. I think it's always an interesting one, that first match or tournament on the grass, there's a lot of players who maybe aren't amazingly prepared.

“We've just come from a surface where we're grinding out points, having to win the point seven times on the trot to get one point. So, coming onto a fast surface, the margins are small but I'm feeling good and I'm ready to compete as hard as possible.

“It's a home tournament for me as well, so that's an added motivation for me to do well here as well.”

Emma Raducanu spotted the man in the crowd in Dubai before he was removed from the court

The man who was given a restraining order for stalking British tennis player Emma Raducanu earlier this year has been caught trying to apply for tickets for this month's Wimbledon Championships.

BBC Sport can reveal the All England Club's security system highlighted the man's name had been red-flagged, and blocked his attempt to enter the public ballot.

British number one Raducanu was left in tears after seeing a man who had followed her to four successive tournaments in the stands during a match at the Dubai Tennis Championships in February.

The man, who was removed, had given Raducanu, 22, a letter and asked for a photo in a coffee shop the previous day.

He was given a restraining order by Dubai police and his name was circulated around tennis authorities.

Raducanu was approached by the man near the player hotel in Dubai the day before her second-round match with Karolina Muchova.

He gave her a letter and took her photo, which unnerved Raducanu, who had been aware of his presence at tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha in preceding weeks.

Although she reported it to a member of her team, the information was not passed on to the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) or the tournament until the following day.

The Briton hid behind the umpire's chair two games into her defeat when she spotted him in the crowd.

The man who ""exhibited fixated behaviour"" was removed from the stands and detained by local police.

Speaking after the incident, Raducanu told reporters: ""I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, 'I don't know how I'm going to finish'.

""I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe.

""I was like, 'I need to just take a breather'.""



Raducanu shot to worldwide fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021.

She told BBC Sport soon after the incident in Dubai that it ""could have been dealt with better"" but that lessons have been learned.

""Since that incident I have definitely got increased attention and greater security,"" the 22-year-old said.

""I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more.

""I'm always with someone and always being watched.""

Raducanu has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home.

Sally Bolton, chief executive of All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) said they spend a lot of time on ensuring security measures are tight at Wimbledon.

""We're liaising with the tours, with the Met Police, with other security agencies right through the year to think about the types of risks we need to look at and adjusting what we put in place.

""I would say to them [players] they should have confidence when they're here and if they are concerned on any basis they should come and talk to us about that because we can put bespoke arrangements in place.""

While Wimbledon bosses have confidence in their security provisions, which are reviewed annually, the issue has come into sharper focus this year.

It is estimated that around 1,000 people work in the field of security to some extent across the Championships.

In addition to the screening around the ballot, there are also more checks and balances when it comes to those in the queue.

Anyone gaining entry to the Championships that way will have to be registered with Wimbledon - meaning they've had to provide personal information.

In the grounds, as well as police and military personnel, there are other discreet members of the security team.

A team of fixated threat specialists are hired in and can assist the player escort team.

There are also behavioural experts who are trained to spot people acting strangely.

There is significant CCTV coverage on site, and if there are concerns around a particular player then a specific CCTV sweep will be done of the seats near to the player and their box.

On court, protection officers are positioned near the players, with more on Centre Court and No.1 Court.

If something spontaneous happens on site, there are response teams walking round the grounds who can come and support staff.

Security teams are also in regular contact with the referees' office to discuss issues like scheduling.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Andy Roddick states what Coco Gauff is now the best player in the entire world at doing ahead of Wimbledon starting","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/andy-roddick-states-what-coco-gauff-is-now-the-best-player-in-the-entire-world-at-doing-ahead-of-wimbledon-starting/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Coco Gauff will have the eyes of the world on her at Wimbledon following her exploits at the French Open earlier this month. 

Gauff came from a set behind to beat Aryna Sabalenka and get her hands on a first Roland Garros title. 

It was the second time Gauff had won a Grand Slam and extinguished any consensus that she might be a one-hit wonder following her US Open triumph in 2023. 

Gauff's dad was extremely proud of her after the French Open, but given the rigorous demands of the schedule, the 21-year-old has no time to celebrate and heads straight into the grass-court season. 

Roddick has hailed Gauff in the aftermath of the French Open success, and clearly, he's a huge fan of the youngster. 

Now, ahead of Wimbledon, he's been singing her praises again and has admitted on the Tennis Channel Live podcast that there is one thing that Gauff doesn't get enough credit for. 

He said: “Here's the thing. Like, we always talk about if she plays a round of 16 or a quarter-final and even the final against Sabalenka, and everyone's talking about how they didn't play that well, and you know, maybe Coco didn't play that well and it wasn't…

“Sorry, making the other person play badly is absolutely a skill. And we always kind of refer to it as a negative.

“She is the best in the world at kind of dragging you into this game with her, where she can rely on different spins and play defence and kind of one more ball mentality, and that's exactly what she did in the final.

“The wind was great for her, right? Then she didn't have to go toe-to-toe on the forehand side.

“She could let the ball flutter up on Aryna Sabalenka, but that's not an accident. That's taking advantage of the situation. That's called strategy, and I don't know that we give her enough credit for it.”

Given that she's the world number two and is on the back of a Grand Slam win, it would be extremely foolish to discount Gauff from Wimbledon glory. 

However, she's not the best player in the world on grass, and other players will be fancied more than Gauff to win the third Grand Slam of the year. 

Of all the Grand Slams, this is Gauff's least successful, with three visits to the fourth round as good as it's got for the talented youngster. 

Gauff will have fond memories of the All England Club after knocking out Venus Williams in 2019 when she was just 15-years-old. 

This year, she will hope to call on the experience of those kind of displays and make a genuine play to win the SW19 event in 2025. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","How much will it cost you to go to Wimbledon?","https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/06/17/game-set-and-match-how-much-will-it-cost-you-to-get-to-wimbledon/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 04:01:09 GMT","

If you watched that iconic French Open final recently between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner – or at least some of its five hours and 29 minutes – you may be in the mood for more tennis.

Thankfully, then, Wimbledon is calling. Its famed lawns are set to welcome the stars of the sport on the 30th of this month. 

More than 30 years after seeing (on television) Andre Agassi win his only Wimbledon singles title and becoming hooked on the sport, this year I will finally – hopefully – make it to the hallowed grounds of SW19.

I won't be the only one trekking across the Irish Sea; Wimbledon organisers say Ireland is one of the leading international markets seeking tickets for the tennis fortnight this year. 

But while it is claimed that the price for a portion of the famed strawberries and cream at the event has remained the same since 2010, at just £2.50 (€3), the cost of watching the tennis continues to climb. 

So if you, like me, are keen to attend but wish to do so without breaking the bank, here are some options to consider.And while it might be too late to get there this time, there's always next year!

This is the route that many take to get tickets. To be in with a chance for the draw, you must sign up around September, with offers sent out in October. Only one application for a maximum of two tickets per account, per email address and per household is accepted. And you must use one of the tickets yourself.

Prices at this stage of the process range from just £30 for a grounds pass and £75 for a “cheap seat” on Centre Court on day one of the tournament to £315 for a Centre Court seat on either the men's or ladies' final day.

Buying a debenture seat, for either Centre Court or Court No 1, gives you a premium seat for life, provided you're prepared to stump up the cash

While these prices have increased in recent years – back in 2021, for example, tickets for finals day were £240 – they remain significantly cheaper than many other options, as you will see below.

If you have a UK address, you could also consider applying for the Lawn Tennis Association ballot – it will cost about £25 to become a member.

This is where I struck gold this year (or at least a kind colleague did!). Once you have entered the ballot, you are sent an email when the resale opens – typically about 100 days before the tournament. 

For example, on a recent day in May, there were two tickets available (rows U-Z) for Centre Court on Tuesday, day nine, for £220 each. 

Beware, however, that tickets sell out at lightning speed on the site, and it is difficult to be the one who gets them. So be prepared to spend a lot of time refreshing the resale page if you are keen to get tickets via this process.

For many, the famed queue is as much a part of the 14-day tournament as Henman Hill/Murray Mound or the plaque commemorating the longest ever Wimbledon match (John Isner against Nicolas Mahut back in 2010) on Court No 18.

This opens each day, and gives you the chance of getting a show court or a grounds pass ticket. Some people pitch tent overnight to give themselves the best chance – and is part of the experience for many.

If you get lucky in the queue, you will pay regular retail prices for your tickets.

Once you're in the gate, remember you have the possibility of upgrading your ticket. This year, there will be an on-site resale kiosk adjacent to Court No 1. If you have a grounds pass, you can apply for a Centre Court or Court No 1 ticket via the Wimbledon app. You will be sent a message and, if successful, can then head to the kiosk to buy your ticket. These are based on returns from show courts on the day, and come at a very attractive additional cost of £15 for Centre Court and £10 for Court No 1.

For those for whom cost is not an issue, why not try to buy a debenture seat? Buying one, for either Centre Court or Court No 1, gives you a premium seat for life, provided you're prepared to stump up the cash. These are the only types of Wimbledon tickets that can be legally transferred or sold on the open market.

While the “big four” of Federer, Nadal, Murray and Djokovic) might have mostly moved on, they are being replaced by the likes of Sinner and Alcaraz, which keeps interest keen

With a debenture, you get access to the hallowed grounds through your own exclusive entrance and each debenture offers a “premium seat” on Centre Court (rows A-N) or Court No 1 (rows A-Q) for five years. It also allows you to access certain restaurants and bars. 

There are 2,520 such seats on Centre Court, and 1,250 on Court No 1. While you get the same seat for the championship, you will be allocated a different seat each year.

With a Centre Court ticket, you can access your seat on all 14 days of the tournament while, on Court No 1, as play finishes earlier, you will get 11 days, “plus the right to buy face-value tickets for the last three days”.

Tim Webb is head of institutional trading with UK stockbroker Dowgate, which runs weekly auctions for debenture seats. He says there are a number of Irish debenture seat holders.

When we chat, he has “literally hung up the phone to a new Irish buyer” of debenture seats for Court No 1. So what's the price the Irish buyer paid for five years of pleasure in SW19?

Well, last month, Wimbledon opened its 2027-2031 debenture series for Court No 1 at £73,000 (€86,166) per debenture – up almost 60 per cent on the price of the last issue.

In the most recent sale of Centre Court tickets (2026-30), debentures were sold at £116,000 (or £1,657 for each day of tennis).

As with stocks, there is a secondary market for debentures, which are financial instruments though they are not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.

The aforementioned 2026-2030 Centre Court issuance for example, were selling for £156,000 as of April this year, according to Dowgate – even though one additional payment, the third and final instalment of £43,500, is to be paid on February 27th, 2026. And when buying, you have to buy two, so you can double that cost.

For Court No 1, Dowgate sold a 2022-2026 debenture for £35,000 back in February. This seat has two years to run.

Webb says traditional owners of such seats were British families, who passed them down. These days they are being joined by a younger cohort of international buyers.

“It's a good investment. The value of the ticket has gone up quite drastically,” says Webb, “Tickets are significantly more expensive than they used to be.”

But is there a better time of year to buy, when prices might be more muted?

“There isn't a good time, to be honest,” says Webb. “There are four grand slams a year, and debentures are often bought for Christmas or birthday presents!”

While some tennis lovers will buy a debenture for the love of the game, others may see it as a canny opportunity to make some money- or at least help defray the cost of their own tickets.

In addition to trading your debenture, you also have the opportunity to sell your seat for each day of the tournament through a platform such as Wimbledon Debenture Holders.

Canny resale of the tickets can mean a “free Wimbledon”, says Webb, as you can go yourself for a few days, and sell on the tickets for the others.

If, for example, you've paid £80,000 for a five-year debenture, then the annual cost of the ticket is £16,000. By selling access to your ticket on certain key days, you might make this back – and more. Last year, for example, you could buy a debenture ticket for the men's finals on resale site Viagogo for a staggering £23,602. 

This year, Wimbledon Debenture Holders was recently offering two tickets for Centre Court for men's semi-final day for £15,800. 

Tickets sell out at lightning speed on the site, and it is difficult to be the one who gets them. So be prepared to spend a lot of time refreshing the resale page

To some extent, prices are driven by the popularity of the game. So while the “big four” (Federer, Nadal, Murray and Djokovic) might have moved on – or will be doing so soon in the case of Djokovic, they are being replaced by the likes of Sinner and Alcaraz, which keeps interest keen.

“There is also a resurgence in American players, both men and women,” says Webb.

It is these debenture tickets that many will avail of if booking a package to Wimbledon. 

This year, Keith Prowse Travel is offering a package – including return flight from Ireland, three or four-star hotel for one night, and debenture seats for one day on either Court No 1 or Centre Court – from €3,019 for Centre Court, for day two, rising to €3,959 for the ladies' final and almost €11,000 for the men's final. 

You can save a bit by going to Court No 1, where prices start at €2,456 on day one and two. It's a steep price, but going this way means you can guarantee seats together with your travelling companion. 

You can also book debenture seats only through a resale broker such as Green and Purple.

...

BERLIN (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologize for the “unprofessional” comments she made following her loss to her American rival in the final of the French Open.

Speaking to Eurosport Germany, the top-ranked Sabalenka said her remarks after her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 loss to Gauff at Roland-Garros this month were a mistake. In her post-match press conference in Paris, Sabalenka had suggested that the result was more due to her own errors than to Gauff's performance.

“That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka said. “I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then. You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward — not immediately, but recently.”

Sabalenka hit 37 winners but finished the final with 70 unforced errors — compared to Gauff's 30.

She said she wrote to Gauff to apologize and “make sure she knew she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her.”

“I never intended to attack her,” Sabalanka added. “I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I'm not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realized a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?”

Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff in the 2023 U.S. Open final, where she also won the first set.

“I kept getting so emotional,” Sabalenka added. “So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn't be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Chris Evert puts Novak Djokovic's Grand Slam record into perspective","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/chris-evert-grand-slam-wins-novak-djokovic","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 08:30:45 GMT","

The measure of greatness in tennis is based around the number of Grand Slam titles a player has on their record, but Chris Evert believes that marker is not entirely accurate.

Novak Djokovic is widely hailed as the best male player of all-time after he secured more Grand Slam titles than his great rivals Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

Women's tennis great Margaret Court is currently tied with Djokovic with 24 Grand Slam titles and like Djokovic, a large percentage of her Grand Slam successes in singles at the Australian Open.

While the opening Grand Slam of the year in Melbourne is now a tournament that all the top players compete it, that was not the case in the 1970s, 1980s and even into the 1990s

Speaking exclusively to Tennis365, Evert has reflected on her own career and the number of times she didn't make the long trip to play at the Australian Open.

Chris Evert makes bold Emma Raducanu rankings claim as she expresses her fears

The absence of some of the biggest names in women's tennis opened the door for Court to build up her Grand Slam title haul, with Evert telling this website that the focus was on building the women's game rather than personal glory.

Driven by Evert's fellow tennis great Billie Jean King, the Women's Tennis Association was founded in 1973 and their drive to build a platform for the women's game centred around the promotion of their new Virginia Slims Tour.

So playing what was very much the fourth most important major in tennis was not a key part of the agenda for players of Evert's gravitas.

The great American won the Australian Open in 1982 and 1984 as she joined the ranks of players to win all four major titles, yet she told this website that the obsessive attention given to Grand Slam tournaments has shifted since her days at the top.

“Winning Grand Slams was not a priority for us at that time,” Evert told Tennis365 while she was working for TNT Sports at Roland Garros.

“We were trying to create a tour that could possibly allow 200-300 women to have a tour that would allow them to earn a living.

“I missed 12 Australian Opens and three French Opens because our priority was playing the Virginia Slims Tour and trying to build that into a platform that could sustain women's professional tennis. The men had people doing this for them, building their tour. We had to do that ourselves.

“It is to the credit of Billie Jean King and the women who led the way with her that they created a professional circuit that gave women a chance to earn a good living.

“There wasn't any other professional women's sports then, so what they did created a legacy that had an impact not just in tennis, but in so many sports to this day. Our sport paved the way, no doubt about that.

“In the early 1970s, when I was coming through in tennis, we got equal prize money with the men at the US Open for the first time. That was a big moment. Now we have it for all the Grand Slam tournaments and I don't hear too many people questioning it.

“Maybe you could ask whether the men should play best of three sets rather than five, but I'm not sure. Tennis has been there for a long time and you don't want to change too much.”

Evert was not alone in missing the Australian Open and that story continued into the 1990s, with Andre Agassi one of the big names who opted out of the January trip to Melbourne as he preferred to spend Christmas at home rather than play the opening major of the season.

“I didn't play the Australian Open because I wanted to do something normal and that's called Christmas and New Year's,” Agassi said on a recent edition of the Serve with Andy Roddick podcast.

They are comments that look out of place in a modern game, but it does put some perspective on the notion that tennis greatness can be measured by the number of Grand Slam titles on your record.

Carlos Alcaraz will face Australia's Adam Walton in the first round at the HSBC Championships on Tuesday after Alejandro Davidovich Fokina withdrew due to illness.

The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Alcaraz had just finished his 30-minute practice session with Jordan Thompson at noon when he found out the news. The Spaniard looked over at Thompson — Walton's countryman — to give a nod of appreciation and a wry smile before packing up and playing a spot of tennis golf with his team.



Davidovich Fokina got married on Saturday in Marbella, Spain, before travelling to London to compete at the ATP 500 event. Alcaraz's practise partner Thompson is also his potential second-round opponent: The Australian faces Jaume Munar in his opener.

Alcaraz owns a 6-1 record at Queen's Club, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, having triumphed on his debut in 2023 before falling to home favourite Jack Draper in the second round last year. Lucky loser Walton, who is making his main-draw debut, is yet to face Alcaraz in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Norris' costly error in Canada 

Radio Rewind: 2025 Canadian Grand Prix

Fernando Alonso, George Russell and Fred Vasseur pay tribute to former F1 star Robert Kubica in the wake of his Le Mans triumph.

Fernando Alonso and George Russell were quick to praise Robert Kubica's efforts in the wake of the Canadian Grand Prix, as the Polish driver and his fellow team mates took victory in the famous Le Mans 24 Hours while the F1 were stars were racing in Montreal.

Kubica, Phil Hanson and Yifei Ye won in the satellite #83 AF Corse Ferrari 499P LMH, with the former F1 star completing a mighty final stint to ensure victory for his team. He completed the final 59 laps without a functioning drinks bottle, and was behind the steering wheel for 43% of the race.

While Kubica's F1 career never reached the heights it once seemed destined to following a horrific 2011 rallying crash, winning the illustrious Le Mans is just reward for a driver once described by Fernando Alonso as “the best” he'd faced.

His win at Le Mans follows that of Alonso himself, who triumphed back in 2018 and 2019 when he took a hiatus from F1 racing. And the Spaniard was swift to congratulate his former rival on social media.

“Bravo Robert,” Alonso posted, with Russell – fresh from triumphing in Canada – adding his own praise.

“Congrats mate on winning Le Mans, so happy for you!!” Russell wrote on social media. The British star was Kubica's team mate at Williams when the Pole attempted an F1 comeback in 2019 following his rally crash, which severely injured his right arm.

Kubica's career has always been one of huge highs and crushing lows. He suffered a shocking crash in Canada in 2007 when driving for BMW, before going on to win that race the following season – which ended up being his only F1 victory.

So, it seemed apt that his Le Mans win coincided with the Canadian Grand Prix, and that his last team mate in F1 managed to take the win in Montreal.

Winning Le Mans in a Ferrari is especially poetic for Kubica, who reportedly had a contract to join the Scuderia in 2012 – only for his rallying crash to end put paid to his Ferrari F1 dreams.

“An all time moment for Robert Kubica,” F1 commentator Alex Jacques wrote, echoing the sentiments of many. “His dreams of racing for Ferrari in F1 were dashed by a horror crash which would have ended most careers, a lost LMP2 win on the last lap in '21 added more heartbreak, today a comeback for the ages is complete. Congrats to the whole #83 entry”.

Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur knows Kubica well from their time together at Alfa Romeo when Kubica was the team's reserve driver, and was another who wanted to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the popular racer.

“I have a close relationship with Robert, he stayed with me a couple of years at Alfa Romeo and before in F3 Formula Renault,” Vasseur explained after the Canadian Grand Prix.

“For me, he's an extra-terrestrial. What he's doing is mega and to win in Le Mans in this situation and to be the leader of the car, to [lead] the team, it's something that I can't imagine.

“I'm very, very pleased for Robert. He had a chaotic career in motorsport, and when you see the level of effort that he put into his career, I'm very, very pleased for him to have this kind of result today.”

The filmmaker and co-head of DC Studios admitted that they ""just killed a project"" because ""the screenplay's not good.""


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


James Gunn has a “number-one reason” why he believes the “movie industry is dying.”


	The filmmaker and co-head of DC Studios recently told Rolling Stone that a lot of the bad movies being released are due to production dates being set before scripts are completely finished.




	“I do believe that the reason why the movie industry is dying is not because of people not wanting to see movies. It's not because of home screens getting so good,” Gunn said. “The number-one reason is because people are making movies without a finished screenplay.”

	When Gunn took over at the helm of DC Studios with Peter Safran, he emphasized that superhero films under his guidance would not go into production until scripts were finalized. He even admitted that they “just killed a project” due to that very reason.


	“Everybody wanted to make the movie. It was greenlit, ready to go,” the Superman director said. “The screenplay wasn't ready. And I couldn't do a movie where the screenplay's not good.”


	Gunn added, “And we've been really lucky so far, because Supergirl's script was so fucking good off the bat. And then Lanterns came in, and the script was so fucking good. Clayface, same thing. So fucking good. So we have these scripts that we've been really lucky with or wise in our choices or whatever the combination is.”


	Not having a mandate from Warner Bros. to deliver a certain number of DC projects has also helped Gunn, as the Guardians of the Galaxy director believes Disney's previous mandate to increase Marvel films and TV shows “killed them.” Disney CEO Bob Iger has since refocused Marvel on quality over quantity.

	











	“We have to treat every project as if we're lucky,” Gunn explained. “We don't have the mandate [at DC Studios] to have a certain amount of movies and TV shows every year. So we're going to put out everything that we think is of the highest quality. We're obviously going to do some good things and some not-so-good things, but hopefully on average everything will be as high-quality as possible. Nothing goes before there's a screenplay that I personally am happy with.”

The private equity firm is investing in Rae's management and production firm, which works with diverse creators.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	ColorCreative, the management and production co-founded by actress and writer Issa Rae, is planning to significantly expand its business, backed by the investment firm HarbourView Equity Partners.


	Rae is set to announce the strategic partnership at the Cannes Lions Festival Tuesday.




	Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the companies say that ColorCreative has global ambitions, and will use the investment to “expand its talent representation and production capabilities while also accelerating the creation and ownership of original content.” ColorCreative also says that it doubled its revenue from 2023 to 2024 despite the ongoing industry headwinds.

	“We built ColorCreative to be a home for visionary talent and distinct, multifaceted stories,” said Issa Rae. “Partnering with HarbourView allows us to dream even bigger, while staying true to our mission of helming and supporting the kinds of projects that made us fall in love with storytelling.”

	ColorCreative was founded in 2014 by Issa Rae, Deniese Davis and Talitha Watkins, and seeks to provide opportunities for underrepresented creators across TV, film, digital and content and branded content. The first projects under the new structure will go into production early next year.


	“ColorCreative has proven that bold, creatively-driven content — especially stories rooted in Black culture — has the power to captivate audiences worldwide,” said Sherrese Clarke Soares, founder and CEO of HarbourView. “Issa, Deniese and Talitha have created a blueprint for global storytelling success, and we're excited to partner with them as they scale their next chapter.”

	











	“This partnership marks a defining moment in ColorCreative's journey,” said Talitha Watkins, co-founder and president of ColorCreative. “We've always believed that culturally driven content can also be commercially powerful. With HarbourView's partnership, we believe we have the resources and reach to take our vision to the global stage — without compromising the creative integrity that defines us.”


	HarbourView was launched in 2021 to pursue investments and acquisitions in the entertainment, sports, and media. The company has been active in the music space, acquiring catalogs and other assets from the likes of T-Pain, Pat Benatar, Kane Brown, Luis Fonsi, James Fauntleroy, and Wiz Khalifa. Last month it inked a deal for royalty rights to Grammy-winning producer-songwriter Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins.

The movie starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris hits theaters June 27.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Joseph Kosinski, who helmed F1: The Movie, is revealing why Simone Ashley‘s role was ultimately cut from the film.


	It was announced last year that the Bridgerton actress joined the Formula One racing drama, starring alongside Brad Pitt and Damson Idris. However, few details were released about her specific role at the time.




	“It happens on every film, where you have to shoot more than you can use,” Kosinski recently told People magazine about the decision to reduce Ashley's part in F1: The Movie. “There were two or three storylines that ultimately didn't make into the final cut.”

	The Top Gun: Maverick director added, “But Simone, she's an incredible talent, incredible actress, incredible singer, and I would love to work with her again.”


	Ashley reportedly appears briefly onscreen but has no lines of dialogue in the movie, which also stars Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem, Tobias Menzies and Kim Bodnia.


F1: The Movie follows Pitt's Sonny Hayes, a former F1 driver who comes out of retirement to mentor and team up with a younger driver, Idris' Joshua Pearce. Real-life F1 drivers also make cameos throughout the pic.


	While Ashley hasn't addressed her role being removed from the movie, she previously told Elle magazine earlier this month that making the film was a “crazy” experience, saying, “I have a very small part, but I'm grateful to be in that movie.”


	“I got to experience many Grands Prix,” she added. “I don't think I'll ever do anything like that again.”


F1: The Movie starts playing in theaters on June 27.

	As usual, there are a few eligibility caveats. Firstly, eligible songs are any tracks which were released prior to Jan. 19, 2025, and must feature a minimum 50% of Australian artists. As a result, New Zealand artists (who are often considered honorary Australians) are ineligible, though Crowded House are eligible, despite being formed by Neil Finn after the dissolution of Split Enz and his move from New Zealand to Australia.

	Notably, tracks recorded for triple j's long-running Like a Version cover series are not eligible either. Though perennial favorites of triple j's annual Hottest 100 countdown, the series received its own poll back in 2023, with DMA'S reigning supreme with their acoustic cover of Cher's “Believe.”


	triple j – which launched on Jan. 19, 1975 as the result of new policies by then-Prime minister Gough Whitlam – first kicked off their Hottest 100 countdown in 1989, with the first three years allowing listeners to vote for songs from any year.

	











	In 1994, the station rebooted the concept, this time opening the polls only to songs which had been released the year prior. It's since become known as – as triple j have labelled it – “the world's greatest music democracy,” with an average of almost 2.5 million votes being cast each year.


	In the ensuing decades, the list of winners has been plentiful, featuring Australian acts such as Spiderbait, The Wiggles, and two-time winners Powderfinger and Flume. Numerous international acts have also taken out the top spot, such as Oasis, Billie Eilish and Kendrick Lamar.


	The most recent poll was announced in January 2025, with Chappell Roan being crowned the victor with “Good Luck, Babe!” 


	Notably, the latest countdown also left a sour taste in the mouth of Australian music-lovers, with the full list featuring the lowest number of homegrown artists in almost three decades. With only 29 Australian artists appearing across the full list of songs, it was the worst showing for Aussies since the 1996 list. Only the debut poll in 1993 and its 1994 follow-up are worse, with 24 and 26 Australian artists, respectively.


	Alongside the annual poll, other one-off countdowns have been held over the years, with 1998 and 2009 seeing the release date restrictions lifted once again, 2011 focusing on Australian albums, 2013 allowing songs released in the past 20 years, and 2020 focusing on songs released in the 2010s. 


	The latter poll may give an indication of what may rank highly in the upcoming countdown, having been topped by Tame Impala‘s “The Less I Know the Better.”

	The collective hopes of fans longing for a collaboration between Nick Cave and Morrissey have been dashed, with the former revealing he turned down the opportunity to do so last year.

	Cave's revelation arrived by way of his Red Hand Files website, where he responded to a fan asking if he had ever met the former vocalist of The Smiths.

	Labelling Morrissey a “complex and divisive figure, someone who takes more than a little pleasure in p–sing people off” and “probably the best lyricist of his generation,” Cave admitted that he had not had the chance to cross paths with the singer, adding that may be why he remains a fan.


	However, Cave also added that Morrissey had approached him via email in 2024 to perform on a new song that he had written. “I would have been happy to do so, however, while the song he sent was quite lovely, it began with a lengthy and entirely irrelevant Greek bouzouki intro,” Cave explained. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“It also seemed that he didn't want me to actually sing on the song, but deliver, over the top of the bouzouki, an unnecessarily provocative and slightly silly anti-woke screed he had written.”


	While Cave did not share any specific details in regard to the lyrical content of Morrissey's track, he explained that it was enough for him to “politely decline” the offer.

	











	“Although I suppose I agreed with the sentiment on some level, it just wasn't my thing,” Cave explained “I try to keep politics, cultural or otherwise, out of the music I am involved with. I find that it has a diminishing effect and is antithetical to whatever it is I am trying to achieve.”


	Morrissey's most recent solo album, I Am Not a Dog on a Chain, arrived back in 2020. In November, the singer claimed that his as-yet-unreleased album, Bonfire of Teenagers, has been shelved so far because of his various controversial statements. 


	“As you know, nobody will release my music anymore,” Morrissey told a crowd in New Jersey. “As you know because I'm a chief exponent of free speech. In England at least, it's now criminalized.”

The singer and music producer joins the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Miley Cyrus and Dua Lipa in being sued for including allegedly unlicensed paparazzi pictures in social media posts.

	Rachel Scharf



Robin Thicke is the latest music industry figure to face a copyright infringement lawsuit for supposedly posting paparazzi pictures of himself on Instagram without paying to license the images.


	Thicke is the target of a federal lawsuit filed on Monday (June 16) by celebrity photo agency BackGrid USA Inc., which claims to own the rights to two paparazzi shots that the singer and music producer posted to Instagram in 2022.


	One of the images in question shows Thicke riding shotgun in a convertible, and the other depicts him leaving the restaurant Catch Steak with his now-wife, April Love Geary. These photos are no longer available on Thicke's Instagram page, but the lawsuit attaches screenshots of these seemingly deleted social media posts.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Defendants violated federal law by willfully infringing BackGrid's copyrights to at least two photographs,” write BackGrid's lawyers. “By uploading the Thicke photographs to the Instagram account, defendants encourage their fans to ‘share' the photograph, thus causing others to also willfully infringe and multiplying the harm to BackGrid.”


	BackGrid claims Thicke should have known better than to post these photos without proper licenses, since he's a “sophisticated creator of copyrighted works” who himself owns more than 100 copyright registrations. The photo agency also points out that Thicke is no stranger to intellectual property law, having faced lengthy copyright litigation over his 2013 hit “Blurred Lines.”


	The new lawsuit seeks a court injunction blocking Thicke from infringing BackGrid's copyrights again, as well as monetary damages for the alleged wrongdoing. The agency notes that it “made exhaustive efforts to resolve this lawsuit with defendants prior to filing this action.”


	A rep for Thicke did not immediately return a request for comment on the claims.


	The lawsuit comes a month after BackGrid brought a similar case against Jennifer Lopez for allegedly posting two paparazzi pictures of herself outside a Golden Globes pre-party this past January without licenses.


	Lopez and Thicke are far from the first celebrities to encounter this type of legal action over pictures of themselves on their own social media accounts. Artists including Miley Cyrus, Dua Lipa and Justin Bieber have all faced similar lawsuits in the last few years.


	As Billboard wrote in 2022, U.S. copyright law is on the side of photographers and image licensers. Though it may seem odd, celebrities do not automatically co-own images of themselves and therefore don't have the right to repost them for free.

""Every time I sing it I feel so honored,"" Beyoncé wrote.

Beyoncé closed out the final night of her Cowboy Carter tour's six-show run at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Monday (June 16) with a heartfelt message to fans and a tribute to one of England's most iconic songwriters.

	“Thank you, Sir Paul McCartney, for writing one of the best songs ever made.  Every time I sing it, I feel so honored. And it is a full circle moment to wear your beautiful daughter's design,” Beyoncé wrote in an Instagram post, referencing her Cowboy Carter rendition of the Beatles' 1968 classic “Blackbird.”

	“Thank you, London, for creating unforgettable memories for me and my family,” she continued. “Holla at ‘ya when I come on tour again!”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Her version of the song, stylized as “Blackbiird,” reimagines the original with string flourishes and vocal contributions from four rising Black female country artists: Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Reyna Roberts and Tiera Kennedy. The cover is one of two reinterpretations featured on Cowboy Carter, alongside her take on Dolly Parton's “Jolene.”

	











	McCartney praised Beyoncé's version earlier this year, calling it a “magnificent” interpretation that reinforces the civil rights message that inspired him to write it. “I think Beyoncé has done a fab version and would urge anyone who has not heard it yet to check it out,” he wrote on Instagram. “You are going to love it.”


	The Beatles' “Blackbird” was originally written in response to the Little Rock Nine, a group of Black students who faced violent resistance while integrating an Arkansas high school in 1957. McCartney has said the song was written as a message of hope and encouragement to Black women facing injustice.


	McCartney, whose original master recording is used in Beyoncé's version, according to Variety, also revealed that he had the chance to speak with the pop icon about her take on “Blackbird.”


	“I spoke to her on FaceTime and she thanked me for writing it and letting her do it,” wrote McCartney, who attended Beyoncé's record-breaking Renaissance World Tour last year. “I told her the pleasure was all mine and I thought she had done a killer version of the song. When I saw the footage on the television in the early 60s of the black girls being turned away from school, I found it shocking and I can't believe that still in these days there are places where this kind of thing is happening right now. Anything my song and Beyoncé's fabulous version can do to ease racial tension would be a great thing and makes me very proud.”


	Released in March 2024, Cowboy Carter debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and made Beyoncé the first Black woman to top the Top Country Albums chart. The project also won her the Grammy for album of the year and best country album earlier this year.

The April 8 incident at the Dominican Republic club resulted in 236 deaths and more than 180 injuries.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	The owner of the Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican Republic was arrested last week and charged with involuntary homicide over the tragic roof collapse on April 8 where 235 people died and nearly 200 more were injured. According to The New York Times, prosecutors arrested and charged club owner Antonio Espaillat on June 12 after a club employee provided authorities with evidence showing he'd warned the club's owners that they should cancel that night's show because of the poor condition of the club's roof.

	











	The deadly incident occurred during a show by merengue singer Rubby Pérez at the beloved music venue that was celebrating its 50th anniversary. The singer's manager said at the time that the roof collapsed about an hour after the show's midnight start time. In addition to killing many fans, the collapse also took the lives of Pérez's saxophone player, as well as former Major League Baseball players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera and Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northwestern province of Montecristi whose brother is seven-time MLB All-Star Nelson Cruz.


	The Times described Espaillat as a wealthy businessman whose family also owns a chain of radio stations; Espaillat's sister, who helped manage the club, was also charged with involuntary homicide. The attorney general's office said in a statement that the siblings “demonstrated immense irresponsibility and negligence by failing to do what was necessary to ensure that the Jet Set Club's roof was adequately and expertly repaired.” 

	











	In addition, the AG's office claimed the Espaillat's attempted to “manipulate or intimidate” employees who could be potential witnesses in the case, not offering any details on those alleged efforts. The club was owned by Espaillat and his mother and, the Times reported, its roof had undergone years of “repeated repairs.”


	In a local TV interview two weeks after the collapse, Espaillat said that the club's ceiling panels often got soaked from water leaks from the air conditioning units on the roof, with workers reportedly replacing ceiling panels on the day of the Pérez show. Though the owner said he wasn't aware the roof situation was so pressing, an employee shared information with investigators reportedly showing that Espaillat had been warned about the peril.


	The unnamed employee's lawyer said his client had turned their phone over to investigators, containing evidence of conversations in which “he gave an account of the situation at the nightclub in which he expressed his fears and apprehensions, and his suggestion that the event be suspended. And that was ignored.”


	The Times reported that a number of lawsuits have been filed over the incident and that an engineering report reviewing the collapse was completed last week, but that its contents have not yet been made public.

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Justin Kroll 


	When it came to casting the lead in DC Studios' next big movie Clayface, the studio went with a fresh face, that being Welsh actor Tom Rhys Harries.


	The actor from the Uma Thurman-starring Apple TV series Suspicion and such movies as Uberto Pasolini's The Return (starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche), the Gerard Butler action title Kandahar and Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen, landed the role from a competitive list of British thespians that included 28 Years Later‘s Jack O'Connell, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes‘ Tom Blyth and 1917‘s George MacKay.


	The movie, from Speak No Evil director James Watkins, is the next big project for James Gunn and Peter Safran's DC Studios after next summer's Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, scheduled for release on September 11, 2026. Clayface will be shooting at Warner Bros Leavesden studio in the UK.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Clayface is shape-shifting villain in the Batman comics and got his introduction as part of Detective Comics #40 in June 1940. The original Clayface was a moderately successful actor who adopted the identity of a character he'd portrayed in a horror pic after turning to crime. Clayface has a body seemingly made out of clay and has appeared over the years in various films, series, animated works, video games and other forms of media.


	Rhys Harries, repped by UTA, Curtis Brown Group and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher, was born in Cardiff, Wales and attended the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama. In theatre, he made his West End stage debut in 2013 in Jez Butterworth's Mojo opposite Colin Morgan, Rupert Grint and Ben Whishaw. The actor also starred in Netflix's Álex Pina-created series White Lines.

	











	Producing Clayface are Gunn and Safran as well as The Batman filmmaker Matt Reeves and Lynn Harris. Chantal Nong is executive producer. The Life of Chuck filmmaker Mike Flanagan wrote the first draft of Clayface, with additional drafts by Oscar-nominated The Wings of a Dove and Drive scribe Hossein Amini.


	DC Studios is expected to make a big splash with Gunn's Season 2 of Peacemaker at San Diego Comic-Con. DC's Superman from Gunn is opening July 11. The movie is currently projected to open to $100M+ at the domestic box office.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Donald Trump said that he will probably extend the deadline again for China‘s ByteDance to divest TikTok. 


	Asked about an extension, Trump told reporters on Air Force One, “Probably, yeah. Probably have to get China approval but think we'll get it. I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.”


	Last year, Congress overwhelmingly approved legislation to require the divestiture, or TikTok would face a ban on U.S. app stores. The Supreme Court upheld the law.


	The law went into effect on January 19, leading to a short blackout. When he took office, Trump extended the deadline into April. But he extended the enforcement of the law again, this time until Thursday.

	When the deadline extension was meant to give U.S. investors a deal to purchase TikTok, relations with China have chilled as Trump imposed tariffs, reaching 145% at one point, in the first months of his term. Among the investors working on a deal is Frank McCourt Jr., the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	In a recent interview with Entrepreneur, McCourt said that his plan does not require acuiring the TikTok algorithm. Rather, users and their data would be migrated to an open source platform, per the publication.


	“We're advocating for a new, better, advanced Internet where individuals own and control their identity and their data,” McCourt told the publication. “We're in charge, and our social information is ours to share with others as we see fit.”


	During his first term, Trump sought a divestiture of TikTok from its China owner. But Trump's actions via executive order got sidelined in the courts. This term, he has been praiseworthy of TikTok, crediting it for helping him win over young voters.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Amazon MGM Studios has confirmed what was reported last night: Twisters star Glen Powell is starring in a Ron Howard directed untitled firefighter film. 


	The pitch came from Christina Hodson. Imagine Entertainment and Powell's banner, Barnstorm, are producing. 


	Howard knows something about firefighter movies: He directed the classic Backdraft. Hodson's script follows disparate childhood friends, now elite firefighters, who must rekindle their fractured relationship when a series of deadly fires sweep across Texas.


	Producers are Imagine Entertainment's Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and Jeb Brody, and Barnstorm's Dan Cohen and Glen Powell. Christina Hodson will serve as EP. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Powell received a Golden Globe nom in Best Actor Musical/Comedy for the Netflix comedy Hit Man. He will next star in the highly anticipated series Chad Powers, which he also co-created and co-wrote, and will soon star in Edgar Wright's The Running Man for Paramount Pictures, which is slated to be released on Nov. 7. The Top Gun: Maverick star also recently wrapped production on the revenge thriller Huntington, and is currently in production in JJ Abrams' upcoming film for Warner Bros.

	











	Hodson first transitioned from development executive to screenwriter in 2012. Since then, her produced credits include being the sole screenwriter of Bumblebee for Paramount (2018) and both Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey (2020) and The Flash (2023) for Warner Bros. and DC Comics. Among various projects for the studios, Hodson's recent work includes co-writing a screenplay for the 11th installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise with Oren Uziel. In addition to writing, Hodson served as a co-producer on Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey, and is producing through her company, Hodson Exports, which she runs with executive Morgan Howell. 


	InSneider first had the news last night about this project.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


	As it prepares to unleash Danny Boyle's 28 Years Later around the globe later this week, Sony showed off the first 28 minutes of the zombie thriller for exhibitors here at the CineEurope conference in Barcelona.


	Boyle introduced the footage via video message, saying this “new journey” is the “start of something big.” The first trailer dropped back in December and is the third most-watched horror trailer ever with 60.2 million views in its first 24 hours, while Deadline reported earlier this month that in the first 24 hours of ticket sales domestically, 28 Years Later became the best horror pre-seller of the year to date.

	The second film in the newly revamped trilogy — 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple — will hit North American theaters on January 16, 2026. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	At the start of Sony's presentation, Steven O'Dell, President of International Marketing and Distribution, said to the assembled exhibitors, “I hope everyone is sitting here with a lot more confidence about the present and the future vs. the angst we have felt over the last five years… This year is the moment to make our bets and we all have big bets to make. On the movie side, our job is to create compelling content and market the heck out of it, to get people excited to go to a movie. While on the cinema side, it is your challenge to invest in, and modernize, the cinema experience to get people thinking every week about going to the cinema.”


	He continued, “When we are both operating at the top of our game, we create a shared experience that is a bedrock of entertainment all around the world.”

	











	Other footage that screened during Sony's presentation included two scenes from Darren Aronofsky's Caught Stealing starring Austin Butler, and which releases domestically on August 29 this year. Aronofsky sent a video message from New York where he said he's in the final stages of editing, and explained he'd wanted to make “a romp, caper, adventure” set in the East Village during a time of “peak humanity,” before 9/11, when “Y2K was the biggest threat.” 


	Also sending a message was Sam Mendes who mused on his epic four-picture project about The Beatles which he called “in every sense an entirely unique event.” The quartet of movies is due in April 2028.


	And, Scarlett Johannson, fresh off the Cannes unveiling of her feature directing debut, Eleanor the Great, sent a video message about the “personal” film, saying “every frame is etched in my DNA.” Sony is releasing internationally and Sony Pictures Classics domestically with a date TBD.


	Among other trailers and footage were a sizzle reel for Paul Rudd/Jack Black Christmas release, Anaconda, and a scene and new trailer for I Know What You Did Last Summer which releases in July.


	There are three big anime movies up ahead which each got a mention, Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle releasing September 12 in North America, followed by Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc which begins rollout on September 24 internationally and goes domestic on October 29, as well as Scarlet, a world-creation story of a brave princess who transcends time and space (U.S. release December 12).


	On the local-language front, Sony pointed to upcoming pics such as France's Forced Vacation, the Sisu sequel from Finland which releases in the U.S. on November 21 and the continuation of Spanish franchise Padre No Hay Mas Que Uno with the 5th installment. Director and star of the latter, Santiago Segura, sent a cheeky message to CineEurope urging the Spanish exhibitors in the audience to applaud so the non-Spaniards would know he is “huge in Spain.”

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


F1: The Movie starts, ominously enough, with the black Warner Bros logo, which suggests it's going the be The Dark Knight Rises of sports movies. But although it never really relaxes into the fun, '60s-style Paul Newman picture it might have been, F1 never takes itself too seriously. You might go to it with solemn images in mind of the old-school maverick driver classics — Grand Prix (1966) and Le Mans (1971) — which is a vibe director Joseph Kosinski does prize highly and a role that fits Brad Pitt quite snugly. But there's an amiable surrogate-family movie just vrooming to get out, and the strange thing is that the recent release it more strongly resembles, down to its weird, squishy logo, is the last Mission: Impossible, since, although it's definitely about the American way of winning, the emphasis is as much on high-tech teamwork as it is on traditional star wattage.

	











	There's a significant overlap with Once Upon a Time's Cliff Booth in Sonny Hayes, the driver Pitt plays. Unlike the recent M:I movie, his age is mentioned — and mentioned a lot, never in an admiring way. In fact, we start the movie at the 24 Hours of Daytona race, an endurance event that he is clearly doing for the money. His backstory involves a terrible crash at the Spanish Grand Prix in his 30s that still gives him nightmares (and explains the film's cryptic opening, in which calming ocean waves are interpolated with gritty video images of a high-speed race). Sonny, we learn, is the couldabeen that never was, his rock 'n' roll bona fides confirmed when Kosinski drops Led Zeppelin's “Whole Lotta Love” onto the soundtrack, making great use of its atonal midsection.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Everything is laid out here, from Sonny's contempt for authority to his capacity for superstition. He gambles; before every race he pockets a playing card (sight unseen); and whenever he wins, he refuses to handle the cup (“It's bad luck,” he believes). But like the gangster who's out of the game, his past comes calling when a face from the past shows up while he's doing his laundry. Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem) is an old adversary who now runs APXGP and is $350 million in the hole. “I need a new driver,” he says, flashing an old magazine cover touting their young selves as The Rising Stars of F1. Sonny says no, but Cervantes won't hear it. “What would he want you to do?” asks Cervantes, pointing to Sonny's younger, blonder self. “Join a boy band?” he shrugs.


	Inevitably, Sonny does join the team, led by star driver Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), who greets Sonny with horror and prompts a lot of talk about whether an oldie has ever won an F1 race (that will be Luigi Fagioli, who was 53 when he won the 1951 Grand Prix in France). Their sparring goes exactly the way you think it might, and Pearce soon begins to see and appreciate the long-gestating method in Sonny's madness (there's a lot of talk about cold and hot tires, and the judicious timing of pit stops). But then, Sonny wins over the whole team too, from company board director Peter Banning (Tobias Menzies) to team manager Kaspar Molinski (the great Kim Bodnia) and, most crucially, APXGP's technical director Kate McKenna (Kerry Condon), a science genius nursing a broken heart.


	The plot, such as it is, involves Sonny's unorthodox attempts to get APXGP back on track, and although you know which way the wind will blow in the end, there's a lot of enjoyable, self-deprecating bathos that you would probably never get from a Tom Cruise movie. Unfortunately, Sonny's hijinks don't exactly chime with the way Formula One is heading (to borrow Donald Trump's famous phrase on encountering a Tesla for the first time, “Everything's computer!”). As a result, the film seems to toggle between a nostalgia for the traditional iconography of the lone man at the wheel (Sonny's mantra is “put your head down and drive”) and a respect for the technicians that, through aerodynamic design and such, snatch all-important fractions of sections when racing at over 200 mph.


	Inevitably, F1 does somewhat sidestep criticisms of the Formula One community, but it does land some punches when it can, in terms of the organization's vice-like grip and the absurd proliferation of branding (Kosinski's film has it both ways, with much placement for Expensify and Tommy Hilfiger). It probably also romanticizes the sport's largely male skew, leavening Condon's role as the sole female (apart from Pearce's overly protective mum), who also serves as the film's sort of age-appropriate love interest.


	Where it will place in the summer-movie stakes, however, is hard to predict, given the fate of recent race movies such as James Mangold's Ford v Ferrari (a hit) and Michael Mann's Ferrari (very much not a hit). Awards prognostication is similarly fuzzy too, although technical noms will be its strongest play. But whether or not it finds it audience (and there are probably a lot of Easter eggs for viewers who know a hell of a lot more about Formula One than I do), F1 is proof that brand Pitt is still a viable option and, like Tom Cruise, can still hold a movie the old-fashioned way, putting pedal to the metal.

					By Zac Ntim 

International Reporter


	The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday said that it would not hear a lawsuit filed against musician Ed Sheeran that alleged his hit single Thinking Out Loud copied Marvin Gaye's classic Let's Get It On.


	The Supreme Court justices declined to hear an appeal filed by Structured Asset Sales, a company owned by investment banker David Pullman, that owns a partial stake in Gaye's 1973 song. 


	Structured Asset Sales first sued Sheeran, his record label Warner Music, and music publisher Sony Music Publishing in 2023, seeking monetary damages over alleged similarities between the two songs. A U.S. District Judge sided with Sheeran in the original case, concluding that the song's melody, harmony, and rhythm were too common to require copyright protection. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision last year.

	In a separate 2023 copyright lawsuit over the same issue filed by the heirs of Ed Townsend, Gaye's co-writer on the Motown classic, a jury in Manhattan federal court ruled in favor of Sheeran. Speaking outside the court at the time, Sheeran said: “We spent the past eight years talking about two songs with dramatically different lyrics, melodies and four chords which are also different and used by songwriters every day all over the world.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	He added: “These chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before “Let's Get It On” was written and will be used to make music long after we are all gone.  They are in a songwriter's alphabet, our toolkit, and should be there for all of us to use. No one owns them or the way they are played, in the same way nobody owns the color blue.”

	











	The Let's Get It On case followed another high-profile lawsuit by Gaye's estate, in which Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay more than $5 million in 2018 after a court found that Thicke's global smash Blurred Lines copied Gaye's 1977 hit Got to Give It Up.

Meghan Markle celebrated Father's Day with a rare glimpse into her private family life. On Sunday, June 15, the Duchess of Sussex shared a heartfelt Instagram video tribute to Prince Harry featuring never-before-seen footage of him with their two children, 6-year-old Prince Archie and 4-year-old Princess Lilibet.

A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan)

Set to Jason Mraz's song “Have It All,” the video captures moments of Harry laughing with his kids, following Archie on a bike ride, and holding both children during their younger years. The tribute marked one of Meghan's most personal posts since returning to social media earlier this year.

“The best,” she wrote in the caption. “Happy Father's Day to our favorite guy 💕.”

The post quickly drew attention, offering a rare look at the family's life in Montecito, California, where Harry and Meghan have lived since stepping back from their royal roles in 2020.

A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan)

Since their royal exit, Harry and Meghan have raised Archie and Lilibet away from the public eye. Both children share their father's red hair, which Harry has credited to his late mother's family.

“The Spencer gene is very, very strong,” Harry said during a 2023 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” He added, “I actually really, genuinely thought at the beginning of my relationship [with Meghan] that should this go the distance and we have kids, that there's no way the ginger gene will stand up to my wife's genes, but I was wrong! Go gingers.”

The Father's Day post also comes amid ongoing tension between Harry and his father, King Charles III. In a BBC interview on May 2, Harry said, “He won't speak to me because of this security stuff,” referring to his legal battle to reinstate U.K. protection for his family.

“I would love reconciliation with my family,” he continued. “There's no point in continuing to fight anymore. Life is precious. I don't know how much longer my father has.”

As reported by People, the palace has denied that King Charles has the power to restore the high-level security Harry is seeking. Since moving to the U.S., the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have returned to the U.K. only once with their children, for Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee in 2022.

As Meghan continues to use her Instagram handle @meghan to spotlight personal moments and professional projects, the Father's Day tribute stood out for its emotional tone and family-first focus.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beyoncé Posts Touching Tribute to Sir Paul McCartney","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/beyonce-paul-mccartney-song-cover/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 05:37:58 GMT","

Beyoncé wrote an admiring message to Beatles member Paul McCartney after the second London show of her “Cowboy Carter” tour.

On Monday, June 16, the songstress wrote on Instagram, “Thank you, Sir Paul McCartney, for writing one of the best songs ever made. Every time I sing it I feel so honored.”

The superstar may have been referring to a cover she included on her “Cowboy Carter” album, which she performs as part of her setlist for the tour.

Her message also shouted out the 82-year-old icon's fashion designer daughter, Stella McCartney. “And it is a full circle moment to wear your beautiful daughter's design,” said the “Halo” singer.

A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)

Beyoncé also acknowledged the city of London for giving her family “unforgettable moments,” before declaring she will definitely be back. “Holla at ‘ya when I come on tour again!” said the mom of three.

Beyoncé covered the Paul McCartney song “Blackbird” for her album “Cowboy Carter,” which was released in March 2024. The original version of the song, penned and performed by McCartney, is a track on the album “The Beatles,” alternatively called “The White Album.”

In April 2024, McCartney reacted positively to Beyoncé's cover of his song, saying he was “so happy” with her version.

“I spoke to her on FaceTime and she thanked me for writing it and letting her do it. I told her the pleasure was all mine and I thought she had done a killer version of the song,” he wrote in an Instagram post.

He also noted that his goal in the song was to ease racial tension, and said he was inspired to write it by the dismay he felt at seeing the injustices of school segregation play out in the early 1960s. 

The “Single Ladies” singer graced the stage at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a gorgeous design by McCartney's 53-year-old daughter, Stella. The Instagram page @fashionbombdaily posted footage of the A-lister twirling in the outfit.

A post shared by Fashion Bomb Daily (@fashionbombdaily)

The look consisted of an on-theme white short-sleeved bodysuit which was adorned with a pair of blackbird decals. On bottom, the singer wore denim shorts with a thin black belt. But the most eye-catching part of the ensemble was the magnificently detailed fringe rhinestone chaps.

The former “Destiny's Child” member previously donned another look by the designer for her “Renaissance” tour, according to label's official website.

“Beyoncé wore a custom Stella McCartney look during her Renaissance World Tour, on Thursday 8th June at Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium in Barcelona,” boasts a page on the site.

On June 15, Stella McCartney shared a sweet Father's Day message for her superstar father which read in part, “Dad… My love and admiration for you grows stronger every day… I am very blessed to have chosen you to be my father in this life and cherish every single piece of you deep in my soul.”

She accompanied the note with an adorable vintage video of herself joyfully dancing with her dad.

Alexis Bellino, known for her role on “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” is entering a new chapter both personally and financially. As she gears up to marry fiancé John Janssen, Bellino has listed her home in San Juan Capistrano for $2.95 million—about $1.65 million more than she originally paid for the property in 2018, per The Daily Dish.

According to Reality Blurb, the listing reflects Bellino's ongoing transition as she prepares to wed Janssen, whom she got engaged to in August 2024 after nine months of dating. The timing aligns with her recent public statements about “more changes” coming to her life.

A post shared by Alexis Bellino (@alexis_bellino)

According to the property listing, the four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom residence sits inside the exclusive Marbella Country Club, a guard-gated community known for its luxurious amenities. Spanning 3,952 square feet, the home boasts high-end features such as cathedral ceilings, a wine cellar, and a three-car garage. The in-law floor plan and open kitchen-living area add to the home's flexible layout.

Outside, the estate features a heated in-ground pool and spa, an outdoor bar with a built-in barbecue and refrigerator, and a cozy seating area with a fireplace.

A post shared by Alexis Bellino (@alexis_bellino)

Bellino, a mother of three, purchased the home during her divorce from ex-husband Jim Bellino. 

Although the Bravo star has not disclosed where she and Janssen plan to live after the sale, she previously hinted at their current arrangement in a 2024 interview with The Daily Dish. “I mean, we pretty much live together right now, anyway. We bounce back between both homes,” she said. “We decided we're going to keep both homes. I have twins (Mackenna Bellino and Miles Bellino) in high school still. We don't want to uproot anybody from their normal, so we're gonna keep both homes for a while.”

Bellino has also shared that she and Janssen plan to reassess their real estate situation once her twins graduate in 2026. “We'll decide then,” she added. “Of course, we're gonna buy a home together when we decide to not have both homes, but, until then, we're just back and forth.”

The upcoming wedding is expected to take place later this summer, and Bellino has revealed that it will be “very unconventional.” 

In an April interview with People, she teased ceremony and dress details, saying, “The gown is actually complementing exactly what we want the wedding to be. It is unconventional, head to toe.” She added, “I am this bride that did not want conventional and did not want an ordinary dress.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Justin Bieber's WILD & Luxurious First Father's Day with Baby Jack Blues","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/justin-biebers-fathers-day-with-baby/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 01:31:03 GMT","

Justin Bieber rang in his first Father's Day as a dad on Sunday, June 15, sharing glimpses of his celebration with wife Hailey and their 9-month-old son Jack Blues Bieber across social media. The 31-year-old singer documented the special day through Instagram posts that showcased everything from lavish presents to sweet family moments.

The “Baby” singer kicked off his Father's Day posts with his signature humor, sharing a selfie featuring a fake tiny hand giving the middle finger. “I'm a dad that's not to be [expletive] with,” Justin captioned the photo.

His celebration included an impressive haul of luxury gifts, including an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch valued at $38,000, two Prada backpacks, and a new Apple laptop. The singer playfully captioned his gift photo with “Happy daddy day to me u lil ho.” 

A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber)

Despite ongoing speculation about their relationship status, the Biebers spent the holiday together. Justin would document their romantic getaway on Instagram. “Made it home from a lil date night getaway 🛸,” he wrote alongside photos of Hailey walking into their home.

The couple's son, Jack Blues, joined the celebrations in an adorable way. Justin shared videos of the baby at the piano with his mom, Hailey. In one clip, the singer filmed from the ground as his wife and son enjoyed music time together. Little Jack even sported a gold bracelet featuring his initials “JBB,” adding a touch of baby bling to the festivities.

Some outlets claimed Hailey “snubbed” Justin by not posting on Instagram for Father's Day. However, the couple clearly celebrated together based on Justin's numerous posts showing their family time. Hailey's distinctive engagement ring was visible in the piano photos. She also shared one of the images on her own Instagram Story, further confirming their quality moments together.

A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber)

The couple welcomed Jack Blues in August 2024 after announcing their pregnancy in May of that year. A source close to the family told People shortly after the birth that Justin was already “great” at being a dad. They noted, “They're both overjoyed. The baby is such a miracle. He's adorable and doing well. The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for.”

Justin has already expressed enthusiasm about sharing his passions with his son. During a February 2025 charity hockey game, he told reporters he wanted to get Jack on the ice “as soon as possible,” joking, “It's never too early.” 

For her part, Hailey recently described motherhood as the “wildest, coolest thing I've ever done” in an Instagram post marking International Women's Day. The couple, who married in September 2018, continue to navigate parenthood together while sharing selective glimpses of their growing family with fans.

HGTV‘s Christina Haack is “feeling extra grateful” these days — and with good reason. “The Flip Off” star shared just some of the reasons everything is going her way.

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

On June 14, Haack took to her Instagram Stories to share a short but sweet post that summed up all of the great things she's got going on.

“Woke up feeling extra grateful,” she began.

Haack continued with her list: “Happy kids, Loving partner, United co-parenting, Amazing friendships, Healthy, Strong, Content, Clear head, Joy in my heart, Love my home, Love my job, Peace, Gratitude.”

Her list ended with prayer hands and heart emojis.

On June 10, the HGTV star took to Instagram to celebrate her daughter Taylor's 8th grade graduation. She posed with Taylor, her ex-husband Tarek El Moussa and his wife Heather Rae.

“Taylor we are so proud of you and so excited for you to head into the next stage of your life. Our beautiful, smart, incredible, bright light we all love and adore you,” she wrote in the caption.

Haack added, “We hope all the mistakes you've watched us make throughout your life help to guide you to a brighter future … 😜🤣🤣 love you baby. High school here we come!!!”

Fans applauded Haack and the El Moussas for their healthy blended family and successful co-parenting.

One fan noted, “Blended families are not easy to manage. We can tell you all must have put in a lot of work to get to this happy place. Congratulations on the next chapter for your daughter!”

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

Haack also celebrated her “loving partner” Christopher Larocca in her list of things she's grateful for.

On April 8, the HGTV star shared how she is approaching her relationship in a different way.

“As someone who recently discovered I have anxious-attachment (not sure what took me so long 🤪) and for sure a history of co-dependency issues … things can be challenging and by ‘things' I mean ‘me,'” she wrote in the caption.

Haack continued,  “Meeting an unexpected good man who has his own amazing career, life & hobbies (who also happens to have zero jealousy) can at times feel strange for someone who has had the opposite.”

“The Flip Off” star shared that she is “finally learning about safe communication, independence during commitment and a relationship that is NOT 0-100.”

She explained, “I am for sure guilty of putting pressure on others. Facing my own insecurities has forced me into doing the shadow work I've been avoiding … it's time to break the cycle.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Beyond the Gates' Tamara Tunie Reveals Her Reaction to Shocking Storyline","https://entertainmentnow.com/soap-operas/beyond-the-gates-tamara-tunie/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 03:06:29 GMT","

Tamara Tunie, who plays Anita Dupree on “Beyond the Gates”, recently discussed her reaction to the dramatic reveal of her character's new storyline. 

The actress has been balancing intense material on the CBS soap in recent months. 

A post shared by Beyond the Gates (@beyondthegatescbs)

[Trigger warning: Mentions of suicide]

In a June 5 interview with TV Insider, Tunie revealed her reaction to Anita's secrets coming to light in the recent episodes of “Beyond The Gates”. “Oh, I was thrilled. I was excited. We've been talking about this from the beginning,” Tunie said.

On “Beyond The Gates”, viewers were shocked to discover that Anita's group, “The Articulettes”, once had another member: Barbara, who was also responsible for creating the group.

In the June 3 episode, Anita read a letter she had kept from Barbara detailing the former member's feelings of hurt and betrayal after their falling out. At the end of the letter, Barbara blames Anita for her subsequent suicide, writing:

“I trusted you and you betrayed me. And I can't take it no more. So, if you're reading this, sista, I've left this world for what I hope is a better place. And that… that is on you.”

Tunie described her emotional response to the big reveal to TV Insider. “That was really emotional,” she said, “When I read the script, I cried, and then I didn't look at it until the night before we were shooting it, so that any emotion that might bubble up would be saved for the filming.”

Fans were equally moved by the shocking revelation of Anita's past.

“Anita almost took me out. What a burden to carry?!” one X user wrote. 

“Poor Anita. Poor Barbara,” another commented. 

Tunie went on to explain that she now feels as though a weight has been lifted off her character.

While Tamara Tunie originated the character Anita Dupree, this is not her first time on a daytime drama. 

Tunie made her daytime debut as Jessica Griffin on “As the World Turns”, a role she played on and off for over 20 years. 

In addition to her work in soaps, the actress and director is known for her portrayal of Dr. Melinda Warner on “Law & Order: SVU” and “Law & Order: Organized Crime”. 

What did you think of Anita's shocking reveal? Do you support her reuniting with the rest of the Articulettes? How do you think the rest of the Duprees will respond when they find out?

In a clever flex of corporate synergy, Apple promoted its first summer blockbuster with the release of a haptic trailer that imitates the purr of an F1 engine in the palms of your hands. The clip delivers such well-calibrated vibrations that watching it on an iPhone makes it seem like you're microdosing 4DX right on the subway, or the toilet, or wherever it is you choose to enjoy the film industry's latest breakthrough in vertical integration. 

But the real potency of this ad, and the real potential of the technology that it represents, can only be experienced by viewing the promo on mute — the haptic feedback is so nuanced and expressive that you can literally feel the basic plot and emotions of Joseph Kosinski's “F1” through your fingertips. It's the closest thing to “pure cinema” I've ever enjoyed on a device that I primarily use for playing Marvel Snap and Googling answers to my five-year-old son's trivia questions (yes, a rhino could outrun Usain Bolt).

How disappointing, then, that the film itself manages to offer so little of the same thrill, despite the benefit of booming Dolby speakers, the scale of an IMAX screen, and the sleekness of a director whose aesthetic naturally cleaves towards Apple commercials (see: “Oblivion”). That's certainly not for lack of trying. 

 










Determined to bring the same you are there verisimilitude to race cars that they did to fighter jets in “Top Gun: Maverick,” Kosinski, cinematographer Claudio Miranda, and superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer have gone to extraordinary lengths to capture the essence of F1 — lengths that include turning Brad Pitt and co-star Damson Idris into legit Grand Prix drivers, attaching hi-def micro-cameras to the frames of their vehicles as the actors whipped around the world's most famous tracks, and filming at the actual events that are depicted in the movie. 

Not only was the fictional APXGP team granted its own garage right between Scuderia Ferrari and Mercedes, but the pre-race party Idris' character attends before the tour's Las Vegas pitstop is even hosted by the real DJ Tiësto! “F1” is far too sincere in its crowd-pleasing ambitions to feel like a fully licensed piece of $200 million sponcon, but the movie's commitment to authenticity extends to every aspect of its titular sport, both on the track and off, as its mission to win over new converts is only outdone by its eagerness to satisfy diehard fans. 

Alas, Formula One has always been a testament to the difficulty of striking the right balance between power and precision, and “F1” embodies that aspect of the sport all too well. Always entertaining for how effectively it welds hyper-modern spectacle to the chassis of a classic underdog story (the latter part of that equation paving the way for Pitt's most Billy Bean-coded performance since “Moneyball”), Kosinski's film can be propulsive and exhilarating in spurts, but in working so hard to satisfy newbies and experts at the same time that it often struggles to seize on its simplest pleasures. Misfits becoming teammates. Losers finding redemption. Cars going really, really fast. 

 










All of these things are key parts of the mix, but for a movie so preoccupied with the difference between sound and noise (what's relevant to a racer at 200 M.P.H. vs. what they need to tune out), “F1” often fails to lock in on what really matters to its defining moments — a frustration that's reflected in everything from character arcs and backstories to shot selections and the incessant use of broadcast-like color commentaries. Your whole body will vibrate for the better part of this film's speedy 156-minute running time, and few other blockbusters this summer will be more fun to experience at a level of volume that you can't get at home, but loudness is a sad consolation prize for a movie whose own trailer didn't need any sound at all to better capture the flow state that its protagonist lives to chase.

Sonny Hayes (Pitt) hasn't enjoyed the most storied of professional racing careers, but you can tell from his name alone — a perfect movie name — that he was born to be in the driver's seat, and that he doesn't belong anywhere else. A future star of the F1 circuit until a devastating 1993 crash turned him from a “will be” to a “never was,” Sonny has spent the last 30 years as a wandering samurai who's taken any job that came attached to a pair of wheels, from a stock car racer to a New York City cab driver. 

 










Somewhere between a stoic Western archetype and a shit-eating myth, he lives in a van where he can suffer hotly in peace. The money never mattered to Sonny (he only needed enough to support his gambling addiction), and winning has always been little more than a means to an end — the shortest path to the self-actualization that he gets from being one with the road. Except, three decades of feeling like a loser seems to have taken its toll, and the first thing he tells his Daytona teammate in the film's opening scene is that he'll kill him if the guy blows their lead. 

This is as much insight as we'll ever get into the tao of Sonny, but it's enough to understand why he hesitates when his old racing buddy Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), now the desperate owner of the worst team on the F1 circuit, shows up with an unprecedented offer for a washed-up 60-year-old nobody: Become the not-so-new face of APXGP and save what's left of their season so that Ruben doesn't lose the company. It's a hail Mary, and Sonny isn't sure the risk of embarrassment is worth the paycheck that comes with it, but he can't turn down the chance at the glory that once got away from him and/or the chance to drive the world's fastest cars. 

And so, before we even get to the title card, Ehren Kruger's sleek and sturdy script has already put the story's foundation in place. All that's left is for Sonny to spar with APXGP's hotshot rookie driver (an instantly compelling Idris as cocky London native Joshua Pearce, all flash to Sonny's zen-like calm), make eyes at the sport's first female technical director (the ever-appealing Kerry Condon, squeezing worlds of personality out of a human plot device), and learn to get out of his own way as he comes to appreciate that F1 is a team sport. A few other bits take shape in the margins, including a garbled subplot involving Tobias Menzies as a techbro financier and some “Ted Lasso”-adjacent hijinks with APXGP's winsome pit crew (unrelated to “Lasso” alum Sarah Niles' performance as Joshua's mom), but “F1” is generally as straightforward and predictable as any of the nine different tracks that Sonny zooms around over the course of the film. 

 










In theory that should work to the benefit of this vintage Bruckheimer vehicle, and occasionally it does. The simplicity of the film's story makes it easier for Kosinski to accommodate the arcane nature of F1's rules, even if he never finds a satisfying way to incorporate them on the fly, and — similar to Kruger's script for “Maverick” — the lack of a clear villain for most of the movie allows the focus to remain squarely on the main characters, who are racing against each other and themselves to a much greater degree than they are any of the drivers from rival teams. 

But where “Maverick” was able to support that focus with decades of baked-in pathos, “F1” is forced to rely on the ample charms of its cast. While no one will ever get bored watching Pitt and Idris push each other's buttons, there isn't exactly a world of depth behind Sonny's leathered renegade schtick (it's a bit tiresome how many times he races outside the lines without alerting the rest of his team), just as the complexities of Joseph's arrogance are mostly hidden in the folds of Idris' performance. 

More frustrating is that the actual racing sequences are less expressive than the dialogue scenes. While the realism of the film's grand prix events is obviously second to none (silly as some of Sonny's rule-skirting gambits can be), and Kosinski has a proven track record of making speed look even cooler in the movies than it does in real life, “F1” makes the mistake of trying to reconcile the experience of driving Formula One with the experience of watching it on TV. 

 










The most obvious symptom of that is the aforementioned broadcast commentary, which narrates literally everything that happens during the races. In large part, that's a necessary evil of a film that has to explain how placing, safety cars, and tire grades work to an audience of neophytes in real-time. But in order to disguise the expository function of the commentary and affirm the authenticity of the average fan's F1 experience (which is to say: enjoying the races from their couch rather than the stands), the narration is also prone to saying things like “Sonny has fallen to last place! That's not going to make AXPGP happy.” On TV, that sort of color helps confer a narrative onto unconstructed reality. In the context of this movie, it crushes the reality out of a constructed narrative. 

The driver's seat of an F1 car is pretty small to begin with, and Kosinski's film — which constantly defaults to a “Star Wars”-like cockpit shot in order to show us Sonny's face while proving that Pitt is actually behind the wheel — leaves viewers precious little space to engage with the film's characters on their own terms. The emotional impact is so blunted that our only choice is to surrender to the booming spectacle of it all (Hans Zimmer, take the wheel), but even that proves difficult in a film that never quite solves how to handle the sameness of a 44-lap race. 

 










Kosinski is limited to 15 camera positions on each car, few of which capture anything more than wheel-to-wheel intensity, and he compensates for that lack of choice by restlessly cutting between them. It's as if the film is trying to reflect Sonny's agitated pursuit of clarity amid the chaos (a suspicion that's strengthened by subtle changes in the editing towards the end), and every merciful retreat to a top-down angle feels like a concession to the fact that Kosinski hasn't found a more satisfying way to shoot F1 than they do on TV. 

The action is hardly dull, but the sheer disconnect between the wowee zowee immediacy of the race footage and the mezzo mezzo excitement it inspires suggests that tuning out the noise isn't as easy as Sonny Hayes might seem to think. “Sometimes when you lose, you win,” Ruben tells his old friend. And sometimes when you win, this solid but underwhelming blockbuster contends, you still lose.  

Apple Original Films and Warner Bros. Studios will release “F1” in theaters on Friday, June 27.

Watching Elio, the title character of Pixar‘s latest film, it's difficult not to draw comparisons to another child hero underneath the Disney umbrella. Introduced as a shy child reeling from an unspecified accident that took his parents' life, the 11-year-old bursts out of his shell upon an encounter with an installation speculating of life beyond the stars and emerges as a hyperactive, alien-obsessed weirdo who runs around wearing a cape and metal colander helmet, speaks in a made-up language he calls “Elio-ese,” and drives his Air Force aunt Olga (Zoe Saldaña) crazy. 

 










From the tragic backstory to the misfit behavior to the tense relationship with his guardian, Elio might as well be the male version of Lilo from Disney's similarly sci-fi themed “Lilo & Stitch” — it doesn't help that plenty of people went to go see the remake just last month.

The crucial difference? In the original 2002 animated film that introduced her, Lilo won the hearts of viewers because she was such a specific, sharply written weirdo. She was rough around the edges, bratty and mean, and with eccentricities — a love of Elvis Presley, a belief that a fish on her nearby beach can control the weather — that were singular to her and her alone. Elio is a teddy bear in comparison: he's too instantly sympathetic to ever get properly annoyed at, and his obsession with aliens feels more banal and less personal, a way of acting out after the death of his parents rather than a real passion inside himself. He's easy to like, a sweet kid voiced winningly by spirited child actor Yonas Kibreab. But, like the movie that bears his name, he's a bit too forgettable to fall in love with. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Any Pixar film that's been released since roughly the mid-2010s invites a perhaps unfair game of comparison, measuring how it stacks up to the studio's golden period of the 2000s, when every other film they produced was an instant classic. “Elio” certainly is a fair sight better than much of the company's latest output, which has geared more toward regurgitating old ideas or sputtering around in shallow storylines. And yet watching it feels a slight bit depressing at the same time, a reminder that where Pixar's films once led the animation industry, taking out there concepts like rats that want to cook and robots that want to find love and bringing exquisite heart to them, they now feel imitative instead of innovative.

If there were ever a version of “Elio” that had the spark of an old Pixar classic, it got shuffled out of existence by a turbulent production process that saw original director Adrian Molina, who previously helmed the company's Oscar-winner “Coco,” replaced by the duo of Domee Shi — whose hilarious “Turning Red” remains the best Pixar film of the 2020s by a significant margin — and Madeline Sharafian, known for directing the short “Burrow.” Molina based the film's original story concept heavily on his own life, and the directorial transition occurred right around Pixar head Pete Docter admitting the studio would be pivoting away from “personal stories” driven by directors to films with universal mass appeal. Certain elements of the script directly based on Molina's life, such as Elio's mother working for the military, got rewritten entirely.

 










The directorial change-up feels readily apparent throughout “Elio's” 90-minute running time. That's not necessarily due to plot holes or pacing — the film clips along its standard beats at a steady pace, only lagging during one spaceship ride near the end that comes across as pure filler — but the overall feeling that it's only dipping its toes into the emotional and creative depths of this story.

Elio's desire to be abducted by aliens, a reaction to his miserable loneliness on Earth, leads him to send a message via a satellite at his aunt's base to the stars pleading for extraterrestrials to come abduct him. The message gets received not just by a spacecraft but by the Communiverse, a roaming planet-like spaceship holding an international committee of representatives from across several galaxies. Getting whisked away into this fantastically technicolor world is a dream come true for Elio, enough that he's willing to go along with it when the committee reveals their misread that he's the leader of Earth. To secure his place in their ranks, he bravely/insanely plunges himself into solving a diplomatic crisis between the alliance and Lord Grigon (a suitably hammy Brad Garrett), the “blood emperor” of a warlike race of alien worms from the planet Hylurg, who seeks revenge on the ambassadors for rejecting his bid to join them.

 










All of this looks fantastic — while on Earth, Elio suffers a bit from that squishy, rounded animation style that's recently become more or less Pixar's house look. In space, the movie experiments more, adding splashes of 2D graphic animation and gorgeous technicolor around the stately white spaces Elio inhabits. The alien designs are suitably weird and inspired, from the mind-reading floating manta ray Questa (Jameela Jamil) to the rock monster Tegmen (Matthias Schweighöfer). One can detect sci-fi inspirations from “E.T.” to “Star Wars” all over the film's DNA, and in its funniest and most memorable moments it takes cues from sci-fi horror of all things, including the introduction to Grigon's son Glordon (Remy Edgerly), which has a whiff of both H. R. Giger in the character design and Ridley Scott in the blocking.

But, as fun and creative as some of the individual parts of this spaceship are — from the chibi supercomputer sprite that gives Elio the ability to communicate with other aliens to the cloning goo he uses to explain away his absence on Earth — on a whole, the Communiverse is never as wondrous as you want it to be. None of the ambassadors get enough individuality for us to actually care about them, and their actual goals as an organization are too vague to grasp. Grigon is amusing as a warlord who, at heart, is really a beleaguered dad — he reminds one of Bowser in the Mario games more than any past Pixar character — but his softness is telegraphed a bit too early for him to ever be a convincing threat, even to children. This wondrous world up in the stars too frequently feels more like an amusement park for Elio to run and geek around in than a living, breathing universe.

 










The real problem, though, might be the material that's earth-bound. “Elio” draws clear parallels between Grigun's issues relating to Gideon and Elio's disconnect from his aunt Olga, and his desire for alien approval comes from a deeply wounded sense of pain that he no longer belongs on Earth after the passing of his parents. There's some great raw material here, and yet onscreen it never gets to compelling territory. Elio and Olga are simply too generic, stock types that can be found in plenty of modern animated films, for their friction to ever build into something as compelling as, say, Marlin and Nemo's strained father-son relationship. 

It doesn't help that Saldaña, whose character is meant to be the story's heart, sounds like she's phoning it in a bit in the voiceover booth. There's no specificity to Elio's circumstances on Earth — his trauma from his parents' deaths gets mostly brushed over, the isolation he feels from his peers is represented via a stock bully, even the town he lives in is a generic suburbia — which makes his yearning to escape to the stars ring hollow.

So, by the time Rob Simonsen's rather generic score begins to overdo the bombast and the film gears up for an emotional decision from Elio about where he belongs that it has to take more than a few logical leaps to arrive at, the pathos falls a tiny bit flat. It's difficult not to wonder what “Elio” could have been like, had the original concept from Molina made it onscreen, and whether or not the more “personal” version of this story had the sharp edges and specificity needed to elevate the film from a cute kids' film to something more meaningful. 

 










“Elio” isn't a bad time at the theaters — it's pretty to look at, charming enough, and frequently funny. But by shying away from investing in where its main character is coming from, the movie makes his galactic adventures feel a bit weightless.

Disney will release “Elio” in theaters on Friday, June 20.

Jason Isaacs is speaking out about his former co-star Mel Gibson. The “White Lotus” actor starred alongside Gibson in 2000 film “The Patriot” and later, 2022's “Agent Game.” However, Isaacs isn't standing by Gibson's actions, especially his infamous antisemitic rant in 2006 when being arrested for a DUI. 

Isaacs told Vulture that he actually confronted Gibson at a party after the incident. “I went, and Mel was there, and he called ‘Jace' across the room, very friendly. I went, ‘Rabbi Gibson, how are we?' He came up and he said, ‘I was really drunk, man. I was trying to get him to hit me or shoot me or something. I'm having a terrible time.' And he proceeded to unload some very personal things,” Isaacs said.

Isaacs later explained that while he doesn't quite “forgive” Gibson for his actions, he is still open to speaking with him. “[Mel] was very charming personally, and he's intelligent and self-deprecating. He's said and done some things that are unconscionable and unforgivable,” Isaacs said, adding that Gibson “was there making himself vulnerable.”

“No, you can't forgive everything from everyone. I'm not saying I forgive Mel. I've seen him once a decade for five minutes,” he added. “But if he knocked on my door tonight and said, ‘Look, my hotel's canceled. Can I stay?' I'd say, ‘Yes,' probably.”

Yet Isaacs clarified that Gibson is “not my friend” even though they “text each other once in a blue moon.” 

Gibson issued an apology after the 2006 arrest, saying that there was “no excuse” for his remarks. The “Lethal Weapon” actor also specifically apologized to the “Jewish community for the vitriolic and harmful words.” A decade after the incident, Gibson later said in 2016 while promoting “Hacksaw Ridge” that it was “annoying” and “unfair” to still be marred by his past comments.

Gibson's “Hacksaw Ridge” co-star Andrew Garfield said in 2024 that Gibson is a “real empathetic guy” who “deserves” a “second chance” in Hollywood. Garfield, who is Jewish, says that he had “deep, important conversations” with Gibson while making “Hacksaw Ridge,” adding, “He's done a lot of beautiful healing with himself. And thank God, because he's an amazing filmmaker, and I think he deserves to make films. He deserves to tell stories, because he has a very, very big, compassionate heart.”

 










Gibson is next directing “The Resurrection of the Christ,” a sequel to 2004's “Passion of the Christ,” for Lionsgate.

James Gunn is giving his version of a eulogy for Marvel. The Co-Chairman and CEO of DC Studios, who also helmed the MCU's “Guardians of the Galaxy” trilogy, told Rolling Stone that it was in part the “mandates” for more content on Disney+ that “killed” the MCU IP. Gunn pointed to how he is looking to lead WBD's DC Studios in an entirely different way. 

“That wasn't fair. It wasn't right. And it killed them,” Gunn said of the Disney studio demand for more Marvel projects, which led to a so-called MCU fatigue at the box office prior to “Thunderbolts.” “We don't have the mandate [at DC] to have a certain amount of movies and TV shows every year. So we're going to put out everything that we think is of the highest quality. We're obviously going to do some good things and some not-so-good things, but hopefully on average everything will be as high-quality as possible. Nothing goes before there's a screenplay that I personally am happy with.”

Indeed, Gunn would never more forward into filming without a completed screenplay, which is why “The Batman 2” has been delayed for so long. The sequel starring Robert Pattinson was announced in 2022.

“Batman's my biggest issue in all of DC right now, personally,” Gunn said. “And it's not — I'm not writing Batman, but I am working with the writer of Batman and trying to get it right, because he's incredibly important to DC, as is Wonder Woman. So outside of the stuff that I'm doing in the projects that are actively going, our two priorities are finishing our Wonder Woman and our Batman scripts.”

He continued, “Every single Batman story has been told. It seems like half the comics that have come out of DC over the past 30 years have Batman in them. He's the most famous superhero in the world and the most popular superhero in the world. And people love him because he's interesting, but also having so much of him out there can also make him boring. So how do you create that property that's fun to watch?”

Gunn cited how rushing into production has created a major problem in Hollywood as a whole. 

“I do believe that the reason why the movie industry is dying is not because of people not wanting to see movies,” Gunn said. “It's not because of home screens getting so good. The number-one reason is because people are making movies without a finished screenplay.”

Acclaimed actress Danielle Deadwyler (“Till,” “The Piano Lesson”) is back on the big screen this summer with the release of R.T. Thorne's “40 Acres.” The critically praised 2024 TIFF premiere — a survival action-thriller set after a plague has destroyed animal life on Earth — doesn't open nationally until July 2. But select audiences can see the movie for free on the upcoming Juneteenth holiday, June 19, courtesy of distributor Magnolia Pictures.

As IndieWire exclusively announces, Magnolia will partner with top radio stations, DJs, and affinity groups in select U.S. cities to bring the film directly to local communities in honor of the 160-year anniversary of the end of slavery in the United States. (Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021.)

Free screenings take place at select Regal, AMC, and Cinemark locations for respective cities, with Los Angeles' screening taking place at Cinemark. To get a free ticket, tune into those stations or follow other organizations' social and outreach platforms.

 










Led by executive producer Deadwyler, the film also stars Michael Greyeyes, Kataem O'Connor, Leenah Robinson, Jaeda LeBlanc, Haile Amare, Elizabeth Saunders, and Tyrone Benskin. Thorne (in his feature directing debut) wrote the film with Glenn Taylor.

Here's the synopsis of the film: “In ‘40 Acres,' after a plague eradicates all animal life, famine spreads across the globe, leaving society at war and in ruins, but the Freemans are surviving — even thriving — on their ancestral farm so long as they dispatch the occasional raiding party. But what good is surviving the end of the world if it means snuffing out your own humanity? Former soldier Hailey (Deadwyler) made that choice years ago, believing that isolation was the only way to protect her family. She and her partner, Galen (Michael Greyeyes), fled the collapse along with their children, fenced them off from the world and trained them to fight (and, yes, kill). But now, Hailey's eldest, Emanuel (Kataem O'Connor), is a young man, and when he meets a young woman (Milcania Diaz-Rojas) in the forest beyond the fence, his need for human contact could place the whole family in jeopardy.”

Other upcoming Magnolia Pictures releases include Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's hit Sundance doc “Folktales,” Amy Berg's music doc “It's Never Over: Jeff Buckley,” and Sundance-winning queer thriller “Plainclothes.” Back in 2023, Magnolia got the word out on its award-winning trans documentary “Kokomo City” by offering a pay-it-forward ticket model that allowed audiences to buy a ticket for someone else. The company saw breakout box-office success from Sundance last year with the release of June Squibb-starrer “Thelma.”

Annahstasia Enuke couldn't become the star her early handlers wanted her to be. As a teenager, the Los Angeles-raised model, guitarist, and folk singer signed to a label that pushed her toward pop and R&B, genres that fit her like a straitjacket. Her vocal coaches tried to change her voice into something it wasn't, she's said: “All of them wanted to craft my voice into something more acrobatic, something squeezed, tight and maneuverable.” Annahstasia eventually got out of her deal and started releasing songs that foregrounded her husky natural timbre.

When Annahstasia sings, she makes use of her full range, but her low end is where the magic happens. Her warm, resonant purr makes you acutely aware of the body shaping the air—as though her experiences, dreams, and fears lurked right there in her chest. That singular instrument guides her debut album, Tether, a self-possessed set that straddles folk, rock, and chamber pop. These songs hit like tractor beams, lifting you up and suspending you in their charged dramas.

The record is produced by Andrew Lappin (L'Rain, Cassandra Jenkins), Jason Lader (Julian Casablancas), and Aaron Liao (Raveena, Moses Sumney), who supply warm, largely acoustic arrangements that flutter and swell around Annahstasia's breathy croon. Drums appear sparingly; Liao's basslines and Annahstasia's cadences more often than not set the pace, which tends to be slow. The compositions flow like breath: Guitars, pianos, and other instruments flood the mix, fade out of it, then return. The flux makes the music feel lush and airy, lively but also poised.

Both modes suit Annahstasia's tales of relationships at the tipping point. “I'm porcelain/Sitting on your highest shelf/I'm gonna fall/I'm gonna fall without your help/Take care of me/Before anyone else,” Annahstasia pleads on “Take Care of Me,” teetering in her upper register. The delicacy of the imagery and her singing blunt the distrust behind the caveat, “before anyone else.” Romance is just as fraught on the yearning “Unrest,” where domestic bliss is undercut by the “unrest/Sitting in my chest.” Over fingerpicked guitars worthy of Nick Drake, she muses, “When we sit alone/We don't hear the alarms/'Cause when you love me/There can't be any harm.” Beneath the song's rapturous surface, doubts proliferate: When, she repeats, the bliss conditional.

Annahstasia's vocal repertoire is stunning. Her singing is expressive even when it is clipped, direct even when distant. With no further scene-setting, she can spin complicated tales out of the starkest couplet—“I still hear your voice inside my head/Say that I'm the villain of the story”—aided by nothing more than the nuances of her enunciation, her voice catching on every pained syllable. But Tether showcases her command of timing above all. “The longer that I stare/At this ghetto diamond/I find it rare and different/This pile of memories/That were always lying there,” she sings on opener “Be Kind,” her vibrato stretching “rare” and “there” into quivering little hearts. The pause between the last two lines draws out the ambivalence inscribed in her imagery.

But the steely song goes on to soften, a shift also marked by pregnant pauses. “You see…/I…/Never learned/…To be kind,” Annahstasia sings haltingly, the ellipses suggesting she is both scared and eager to be vulnerable. She is exactingly deliberate in both what she sings and how she sings it; the line breaks are as meaningful as the words.

Her precision never feels overly technical or stiff. Tether is as intuitive and loose as it is intentional. “Waiting,” one of the few tracks with a strong backbeat, is exuberant. Annahstasia's raspy runs grow in intensity as Mellotron and electric guitar swell around her, building to a rousing and relieving hook. “Silk and Velvet,” a track about the temptation to sell out, is just as fun. It begins with defeated lyrics (“Lately I'm not sure/If it really matters/If I make a sound”) and a plodding bassline, then speeds up and morphs into skronky chaos. Even when the music is calm, as on the Obongjayar duet “Slow,” tension looms. “What's the worst that can happen/If we just let it happen?” they sing suggestively.

On standout and closer “Believer,” Annahstasia and crew rally for six minutes of big emotions and tonal swings. There's anguish then calm; spirited electric guitar chords then soft piano melodies; growls, whispers, gospel harmonies. A middling lover is dressed down then asked, tenderly, “Can I be lonely here with you?” At the center of the storm is Annahstasia, composed but trembling. Connection, as she presents it across Tether, is dynamic, rattling in the bones, rumbling in the throat. Heartstrings, she insists in these restless and elegant songs, are meant to be tugged.

It's remarkable that it's taken this long for King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard to have their Cypress Hill at Hullabalooza moment. The absurdly prolific Australian sextet's psychedelic experiments have led it from blown-out garage rock and into some truly unexpected places: krautrock, dream pop, sludge, Middle Eastern-inspired microtonal riffs, bad-trip spoken word, a doom metal concept album about the climate apocalypse. On Phantom Island, their 27th studio album, they lavish their gently trippy compositions with orchestral contributions. The results are occasionally frustrating, sometimes beautiful, and almost always interesting if not entirely lovable.

Written and recorded alongside last year's fun and anarchic Flight b741, Phantom Island wasn't written or originally recorded with orchestral arrangements in mind. But, realizing first mixes felt unfinished, and having recently met members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic backstage after a show, the band saw an opportunity for yet another experiment. Inspired by the Philharmonic's sound, they sent mixdowns to the British conductor Chad Kelly, who wrote elaborate arrangements for the songs and assembled a group of musicians to dub over the original tracks in the studio.

That inbuilt incongruity sometimes makes for enjoyable tension. The louche horns on the title-track opener, for example, call back impressively to the golden age of Blaxploitation soundtracks—even if they're entirely at odds with the daydreamy verses and final-third freak-out. The violins and flutes on “Sea of Doubt” sound weightless and intoxicating at first, though eventually they distract from some of Stu Mackenzie and Joey Walker's best country-rock guitars. The lush strings on “Eternal Return” are reminiscent of Morcheeba's “The Sea”; the theatrical bass vocals and sax solos elsewhere on the song may as well be from another universe.

When the disparate worlds of psychedelia and orchestra do cohere, there are little sparks of magic. The bombastic rock ‘n' soul of “Deadstick” comes to gleefully chaotic life with a made-for-TV horn section, and “Panpsych” opens with a simple solo flute and a playful guitar before collapsing into a delicious groove. Lucas Harwood's bass coils itself around the orchestra so deftly on the Revolver-esque “Aerodynamic,” it's difficult to imagine one without the other. Kelly's arrangements seem designed to help Phantom Island take flight, like a series of carefully crafted propellers. “If I could have one wish, I'd turn my hands into wings,” Mackenzie sings on “Aerodynamic,” in what could easily be Phantom Island's guiding axiom.

Still, those moments are fleeting. Often the songs feel overstuffed, with great moments discarded in a hurry to get to something less worthwhile. “Lonely Cosmos” is gorgeous in its stripped-back form, with an acoustic guitar, a viola, and Mackenzie singing about drifting out into space on a potentially eternal mission; it did not need to become a jazz-funk odyssey. “Silent Spirit” has a great country-fried rock song buried under falsetto pronouncements that “time is eating its last meal.” King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard have earned a cult fanbase that's followed them through weirder territory than this while keeping weed dealers in business across the English-speaking world. Jumping from thought to thought and probing at squishy hallucinogenic ideas is a feature here, not a bug.

But at their best, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard can engage with enormous science-fiction concepts without drifting from the psychedelic into the obtuse. The best song on Phantom Island, “Spacesick,” is a five-minute mini-opus that takes flight mostly because it maintains its focus. It succeeds where perhaps only two other songs in history have before, expressing (and wielding as metaphor) the unique pathos of watching the earth rise from space. While it may not have the grand, balladic melodies of “Rocket Man” or “Space Oddity,” it does balance an intergalactic ambition with a wit and melody that less skilled songwriters would quickly discard. The crescendoing horns and graceful strings are integral, opening the song up into widescreen. If Mackenzie had been distracted by some nearby shooting star, he might never have come up with a line as poignant as his sign-off there: “To sit on chairs that touch the floor/For that, I'd give it all/Till then, dreaming's all I can do/I love you, over, Stu.” Phantom Island is freewheeling and ambitious, and mostly admirable for it. Pared back slightly, it might have been truly absorbing.

Asher White, the New York–via–Providence singer-songwriter with 15 albums in her back pocket, has announced another new album. 8 Tips for Catastrophe Living is out September 12 via Joyful Noise. Leading her debut LP on the label is the new song “Beers With My Name on Them.” Give it a listen below.

8 Tips for Catastrophe Living spans nine songs and follows 2024's Home Constellation Study. Describing the backstory of the album, White said, in a press statement, “The idea of tips for catastrophe is really funny to me. I was interested in making something that sounds like a self-help book, but it's actually about self-destruction. In full catastrophe living, you just have to do a bunch of whippets. This album is mostly about doing whippets. I'm not even kidding.”

When breaking the news of her signing to Joyful Noise in April, White released the standalone single “Kratom Headache Girls Night,” on which she serves as a musician, arranger, and producer. She also worked on a collaborative single with Caroline Rose and Eli Winter for Transa, the huge benefit compilation spearheaded by Red Hot Organization to represent a “spiritual journey celebrating trans people.”

Later this month, White will head out on a short tour of the Northeast. Beginning on June 25, she will open for Deerhoof in Hamden, Connecticut, as well as in Boston and Amherst, Massachusetts. On June 29, she then heads to Brooklyn, New York, to play a show with Grumpy. Find White's full list of tour dates below.

	David Fear



	The average Formula One vehicle averages about 130 mph, though with the right person behind the wheel, you can push it up to 250 mph. (Don't try this at home, kids.) You also need a great piece of machinery, of course, and a professional crew making sure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. It takes a virtual village to dominate the circuit. But the difference between a competition-level team and a championship one often comes down to who is sitting in the cockpit. 


	“Do we have the car?” someone asks late in F1, the Formula One drama that hopes to both sell the motorsport to those who don't know a McClaren from a McRib and ride in the wake of this globally popular, billion-dollar phenomenon. “WE HAVE THE DRIVER!” intones Javier Bardem, with a solemnity that would make Moses put down the 10 commandments and break into a slow clap. We'll second the Oscar-winner's assertion. A tale of a veteran taking one last shot at the checkered flag, a hotheaded youngster in need of a mentor, and an underdog team gunning for glory via a sports-film narrative that couldn't be more formulaic — please tip your waiters! — this throwback to old-school blockbusters is indeed a well-oiled, finely tuned operation. Most importantly, however, is that it definitely has the driver. Never mind the horse power. The fuel running this sleek, aerodynamic speedster of a movie is 100-percent pure star power.

	











	They call him Mr. Pitt — and even before you officially meet the man-above-the-title's character Sonny Hayes, a.k.a. “the best that never was,” you can feel the movie setting him up as a misfit legend rebel genius. Serene images of nature are interspersed with en media race footage, cars whizzing and whooshing around a first-person POV. This is what plays in Hayes' head before he exits the sacred space that is the van he lives in, and starts his slow trek to the track for a race. In this case, the event happens to be the 24 Hours of Daytona, which officially kicks off the racing season. He gets into car, runs his section his way, and thanks to Hayes' lead, the team walks away with the trophy. (Our hero won't touch the cup, however — he claims it's bad luck.) The fact that he manages all this in the time it takes to play Led Zeppelin's “Whole Lotta Love” only makes it, y'know, a 100 times cooler. Then Sonny walks away, “one and done,” ready to head whichever way the wind will blow him next. The off-road Baja 500 is coming up. Maybe he can nab a spot there.

	But who should walk into the Orlando laundromat that Hayes is killing time in than his old friend, Ruben (Bardem). Once upon a time, these two were fellow up-and-coming drivers, each pole-positioned to become Formula One's Next Big Thing. Then Hayes was involved in an accident during a big race against Ayrton Senna, and proceeded to spend the next 30 years drifting into obscurity. Ruben, meanwhile, has become the owner of APXGP, an F1 team languishing comfortably in perpetual last place. He's now 350 million in the hole, and about to lose the team. Someone needs to help them turn things around. Why not Sonny? The answer is a solid no. Until it isn't, and Hayes shows up at the team's practice track, sauntering in like he's already won.


	Because he already has — when you're a hot shot played by Brad Pitt, strolling through a film that has beautifully set you up to be the human equivalent of a racecar running on all cylinders yet blissfully defiant of anything resembling “the rules,” it's all over but the checkered-flag waving, right? Well, not quite. Hayes still has to win over Joshua Pearce (Snowfall‘s Damson Idris, leveling up in a massive way), the rookie who's got the right stuff but has to learn the ropes, etc.; he's wary of this dinosaur coming in and potentially stealing his thunder. The same goes for Kasper (Kim Bodnia), the Danish group principal, and Kate (Kerry Condon), the Irish technical director, neither of whom trust this geriatric newbie to pull off a miracle. We should note that, starting with a press conference announcing Hayes as the newest addition to APXGP, everyone from journalists to Pearce's mom (Sarah Niles) and manager (Samson Kayo) begin making cracks about Sonny's age. Shortly thereafter, F1 has the star dipping himself shirtless into an ice bath, as if to say: Yeah, the dude's old, but he's like Hot Sixtysomething Brad Pitt old.

	Hayes has also got to learn that Formula One is a team sport, not an individual one, even if you take into account that whole thing we said above about the MVP driver being the only one that matters. He will need to balance humility with experience and talent; understand that even his undeniably brilliant, eccentric tactical actions have IRL consequences; and battle not just professional setbacks but those pesky personal demons. No matter how “meetings” involving downing shots and impromptu poker games between Sonny and Joshua are co-ordinated by their peacemaking technical director, the trust between these two aces must be earned one lap at a time. If you believe that the flirty, flinty banter between Sonny and Kate earmarks the latter as Sassy Irish Romantic Interest — thankfully, Condon is way too graceful and instinctual an actor to let her character devolve into a stereotype — then you should trust your gut. (She comes off much better than the female crew member who keeps conspicuously fucking things up early on, and seemingly exists just to highlight Hayes' emotional largesse when she eventually becomes invaluable.) If you think that Tobias Menzies' corporate gladhander immediately gives off Big Judas Energy, congratulations: You know how movies work. 

	











	Former engineer-turned-filmmaker Joseph Kosinski knows how to make all of this work — he was the director responsible for Top Gun: Maverick, another gigantic epic that revolved around a major star, a lot of spectacle, the star as a spectacle unto themselves, and a need for speed. And like that industry-saving hit, this is a project that pushes the idea of collective effort in the forefront, yet still gleefully sells the idea that only a single superior, protocol-ignoring human being can get the job done. They practically feel like companion pieces. Kosinski could have called this Form' One: Maverick and no one would have blinked. 


	And like that Tom Cruise sequel, F1 plays up the fact that authenticity, verisimilitude and a you-are-there-feeling can often make the difference between a fun afternoon at the moving pictures and an immersive adrenaline rush. The marketing has been playing up the fact that the production embedded itself within the actual Formula One circuit for a season, the Pitt crew intermingled with actual pit crews, the actors are actually driving in a number of scenes, and a gaggle of real-life Formula One personalities lend their presences in the name of making this feel realer than real. It helps to get Lewis Hamilton to play Lewis Hamilton — yes, the “Through goes Hamilton!” moment is recreated here, complete with hyperventilating commentary — especially when you've brought on Lewis Hamilton as a producer. Kosinski and Maverick cinematographer Claudio Miranda also pulls out the technical stops, utilizing bleeding-edge cameras and continually busting out a swerving pan that seamlessly swings from driver's viewpoint to side profile, which somehow manages to feel awe-inspiring after the 100th use. Most of us had never flown a Boeing Super Hornet, and most of will never take a customized F1 car for a spin in Abu Dhabi. The gamble is that such first-rate second-hand thrills will make up for a 250mph ride through extremely familiar terrain.

	It does, for the most part, and certainly helps distinguish F1 from becoming nothing but this generation's Days of Thunder. Both films are courtesy of super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer's ability to sell the public what they want, only louder, faster and soundtracked by NASCAR-dad–friendly jock jams. His touch is evident throughout, though that's not what makes this feel like such a giddy throwback. It's the way that what's clearly designed as a star vehicle knows that the emphasis is on “star.”

	











	A-listers are still being minted in the 21st century, but few can truly carry a picture of this scope and magnitude and not play second fiddle to the sound and fury. The way that Pitt injects his presence, his physicality, his charm, his well-honed screen persona, his particular mix of discipline and DGAF effortlessness, and his backhanded way of making outdated, Golden Age Hollywood roguishness feel completely somehow timeless is what makes this a winner. He even manages to upstage the cars. It's a turn that reminds you of Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster, William Holden, and, notably Steve McQueen, no stranger to movies about racing. (It can't be a coincidence that one of Hayes' Zen-like pastimes is throwing a ball against a wall like McQueen in The Great Escape.) F1 couldn't feel more contemporary in its focus over a sport that's the current obsession of millions, yet couldn't feel more like a flashback to a bygone age where a larger-than-life movie star was the only necessary I.P. This what blockbusters used to look like. Come for the most impressive, lustrous car that a gajillion-dollar budget can buy. The reason to stay, however, is the driver.

	The Trump administration released three executive orders on nuclear energy on the Friday afternoon before the Memorial Day weekend — a time often used to dump bad news. And these orders were as disastrous as they come.


	With these orders, President Donald Trump has embraced a dangerous strategy to promote the most expensive power there is: nuclear. His plan for new nuclear plants would require hundreds if not thousands of reactors, cost the nation over $4 trillion, and raise electricity bills substantially.


	Worse, he is weakening design and safety oversight by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. And he's doing so just as the NRC is starting to get flooded with new experimental — and highly risky — applications for previously untested small modular reactor (SMR) designs that appear to cut costs by skimping on safety.


Scientific American warned in March that Trump's policies, which would weaken regulatory oversight of nuclear, “severely increase the risk of expensive, unexpected nuclear accidents.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Trump claims that the U.S. nuclear industry has been strangled by regulations. But if that were the case, why is it that no industrialized country is betting big on nuclear? A J.P. Morgan report in March cast doubt on the idea of a global “nuclear renaissance.”  


	“Wake me when we get there,” wrote Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management.


	The reason is cost. I have been involved with nuclear energy policy and analysis for over thirty years. When I first came to the Department of Energy in 1993, I spent two years as a special assistant for policy and planning for the deputy secretary, who oversaw all DOE energy programs. One of my duties was to review policy and analysis coming from the Office of Nuclear Energy.

	











	I ultimately ran the billion-dollar Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which supported many of the winning and emerging solutions we have today, including solar, wind, and geothermal power as well as advanced batteries, heat pumps, and electric vehicles. These solutions — as well as overhyped, costly, deeply flawed technologies like nuclear, direct air capture, fusion, and hydrogen — are the subject of my new book, The Hype About Hydrogen: False Promises and Real Solutions in the Race to Save the Climate.

	The truth is, nuclear power was overhyped from the start. It was predicted to quickly become “too cheap to meter” in 1954 by Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss — the Robert Downey Jr. character in Oppenheimer.


	In reality, new reactors have been steadily rising in price for over fifty years — and nuclear power's share of global power peaked at 17 percent in the mid-1990s but was down to 9.1 percent in 2024.


	So, Trump's plan would leave Americans with steadily rising electricity bills. That's doubly true when combined with his efforts to block or defund the winning clean energy technologies like wind, solar, and batteries, which have been declining in price for decades and now comprise a remarkable 93 percent of planned U.S. utility-scale electric-generating capacity additions this year, with natural gas providing the rest.


	One of Trump's orders makes it U.S. policy to “Facilitate the expansion of American nuclear energy capacity from approximately 100 gigawatts in 2024 to 400 gigawatts by 2050.” That would require hundreds of the current large reactors and perhaps thousands of the experimental SMRs.

	This policy would cost more than $4.5 trillion — at the price of the only U.S. nuclear plant built this century, the twin Vogtle reactors in Georgia. They cost over $35 billion for 2.2 gigawatts, which is over $15 million per megawatt. That's vastly higher than natural gas or renewables, so it would balloon electricity bills everywhere. 


	Indeed, Vogtle is “the most expensive power plant ever built on earth,” with an “astoundingly high” estimated electricity cost, notes Power magazine. Georgia ratepayers paid $1,000 before they got any power, and now their bills are rising over $200 annually.


	Even worse, the U.S. nuclear strategy is not about trying to reverse the negative learning curve of the big 1000+ megawatt plants everyone in the world uses. It's about placing a big bet on SMRs, which are 300 megawatts or less and have a multi-decade history of failure.

	











	Yet it would be unprecedented in the history of energy for smaller reactors to overcome the high cost per megawatt of large nuclear plants while simultaneously abandoning the economies of scale that have driven nuclear plants larger and larger everywhere in the world. Magical thinking is needed to believe SMRs would be substantially cheaper per megawatt and make a major contribution to either power generation or reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.


	Even a September report from the Department of Energy (DOE) — which funds SMR development — modeled a cost per megawatt over 50 percent higher for SMRs than large reactors. So, it's no surprise SMRs show every sign of the kind of cost escalation that has plagued larger nuclear reactors for decades. That's why a March Financial Times analysis labeled SMRs “the most expensive energy source.”


	Indeed, the first SMR the U.S. tried to build — by NuScale — was canceled in 2023 after its cost soared past $20 million per megawatt, higher than Vogtle. In 2024, Bill Gates told CBS the full cost of his 375 megawatt Natrium reactor would be “close to $10 billion,” making its cost per megawatt nearly $30 million — almost twice that of Vogtle.


	Significantly, a 2023 Columbia University analysis determined that “if the costs of new nuclear end up being much higher” than $6.2 million per megawatt, “new nuclear appears unlikely to play much of a role, if any, in the U.S. power sector.”


	Indeed, nuclear plants also have tariff risks since they need foreign sales, foreign uranium, and foreign components to succeed.


	The reality is that nuclear power in general and SMRs in particular are a dead end as a major energy or climate solution — with high risks of cost overruns, delays, and reliability/safety problems.


	We do know the cheapest, fastest, and most practical energy and climate solutions today — especially solar energy, wind power, and batteries. But the tragedy is that these are the very technologies that Trump and the Republicans in Congress are seeking to kill in the “Big Beautiful Bill” that recently passed the House.

	In the driving wind off the Gulf of Mexico, under the looming 480-foot-tall steel launch towers called “Mechazilla,” a group of local kids take turns whacking an Elon Musk-shaped piñata. 


	A crowd laughs as the youngest, a girl who looks about four, slaps at Musk's papier-mâché head with a thin stick. An older boy turns his stick into a spear and plunges it into Musk's stomach, which splits open revealing a trove of fruit snacks. Someone yells “Eat the rich,” and the kids rush in to scoop up handfuls of the billionaire's guts.


	Moments before, the election results had been announced. Starbase, the Cameron County development two miles down the road that houses the test facility for SpaceX rockets and is home to some 500 people, officially voted to become Texas's newest city. The final tally was a lopsided 212 to six — not a surprise since the vast majority of voters were SpaceX employees, and their boss, who now rests on the beach as a battered piñata, had publicly pushed for incorporation. Protesters, mostly from the neighboring city of Brownsville, Texas, gathered on Boca Chica Beach to express frustration that they weren't allowed to vote in an election which will surely impact them. 

	











	Since 2014, the $350 billion space-tech company has dramatically transformed this region in the deep south of Texas, known broadly as the Rio Grande Valley. New housing developments with names like Lunar Estates and Starship Landing are cropping up along the highway between Brownsville and Starbase. Local businesses have taken on rocket-themed branding — you can grab hot dogs at Space Dog Station or seafood at SpaceFish Mariscos. Musk stans have erected maybe not entirely ironic shrines to their hero throughout the region — including a 10-foot-tall deformed, gold-spray-painted plaster statue that guards the highway to Boca Chica.

	Every couple of months, rocket launches shake houses within a 15-mile radius with the force of a moderately powerful earthquake, and some have burned acres of wilderness, blown out windows, and showered the region in a drizzle of melted cement. SpaceX dumps hundreds of thousands of gallons of water used in launches into the neighboring south bay, and has destroyed nests of vulnerable shorebirds. Boca Chica, a popular local spot known as the “poor people's beach,” can now only be accessed via a highway controlled by SpaceX, and has begun frequently closing to the public to accommodate SpaceX launches.

	These changes have angered locals from Brownsville and the beach towns of Port Isabel and South Padre Island across the bay from the launch site, and brought opposition like this protest today. “These guys want to go to Mars. Let them go to Mars,” Rene Medrano, who owns a ranch along the highway from Brownsville to Starbase, tells the crowd. “The people here want to enjoy the beach. Let us enjoy the beach. This should be open forever.” 


	But SpaceX has also brought jobs and investment to the area, among the poorest in the country. A Cameron County release claims that the site employs more than 3,400 full-time SpaceX workers — many employees live in neighboring towns, while a couple hundred live in Starbase itself — and that it has created 21,400 indirect jobs, while generating $3 billion of local infrastructure investment. With that, along with tactfully deployed campaign contributions, Musk has gained support of Cameron County politicians. 


	The rockets have polarized the region and forced Cameron County residents to pick sides. It's one of the economic development debates that occur in so many local governments, only this one has been turbocharged by literal rockets shot off by the world's richest man, who doesn't seem concerned about making mistakes or enemies.

	With the incorporation vote, Musk's power and influence over the region will grow even less restrained, as he will control what is essentially a modern-day company town. With it, comes a new mayor and board of commissioners, most of whom are at-will SpaceX employees. The new municipality will be able to levy taxes on its residents, oversee permitting and zoning, initiate eminent domain, apply for municipal bonds, and charter a police department.

	











	It's a new development in company towns, according to Harvard researcher Brian Highsmith, who studies the impact of corporate power on local governments. The company towns of the Gilded Age were generally not officially incorporated so as to avoid the democratic mechanisms that could impede corporate power. “In fact the absence of those processes was in many ways the whole reason for their operation as a company town,” Highsmith says. But in the Rio Grande Valley, instead of opting out of the government, Musk has simply opted to become the government.


	As he steps away from his political project at the federal level, his power and influence over this rocket-fueled fiefdom on the Gulf continues to grow stronger, whether the locals like it or not. 


	HOMER POMPA IS A 75-YEAR-OLD Vietnam Veteran, with a weathered face and wispy white goatee, who lives in an RV three miles from the SpaceX launch site with several rheumy-eyed dobermans and two wild goats. He's retired on VA benefits, and in his free time, he watches YouTube on his phone and sings raucous blues songs at local bars. He bought this land in the early aughts, back when there were only a few dozen residents, in hopes of finding isolation at what felt like the end of the world.


	But two decades later, a small city has formed around him. As of May 3, he is a resident of the City of Starbase, though he chose not to vote in the election. “You can't stop progress,” Pompa tells me as we chat in a plywood shack behind his RV, underneath three massive wooden crosses and a 20-foot-tall watchtower he's erected to view the launches. “He has the money — he can do what he damn well pleases. Why vote if you know who's going to win?”


	Not long after Pompa bought his land, Musk, then still a liberal darling who was getting glowing press for sharing his electric car patents, set his sights on the neighborhood as a test site for SpaceX rockets. While the company already had been launching rockets from government-owned facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida, this would be a test site entirely operated by SpaceX. The spot was chosen for its latitude and relative seclusion — Musk described it as “an empty sandbar” in a recent post on X —  though, as Pompa will point out, there were people living there.


	Importantly, state and local politicians were willing to play ball. As Musk mulled other potential testing sites, Cameron County courted him by offering the company a 10-year break on property taxes. The Texas State Legislature was even more obsequious, approving a $15 million incentive package in 2013. They also passed a law that exempted space-flight entities from liability for nuisance damages caused by launches, and granted the company an exception to a provision in the Texas constitution guaranteeing residents unrestricted beach access. The latter provision allowed SpaceX to coordinate with a Cameron County commission to shut down access to Boca Chica Beach during tests.

	











	With the goodies lined up, Musk announced that SpaceX had officially chosen Boca Chica as its launch site in August 2014, and Pompa watched as the neighborhood began to grow around him. He and his handful of neighbors began receiving offers on their property, which he declined, but some accepted.


	By 2019, SpaceX had launched its first rocket from Boca Chica, the Starhopper —  a silo-shaped behemoth that was able to successfully lift off and land. The first launch so enthralled Pompa that it inspired him to write and perform a psychedelic blues song called “Half Moon Jam.” But after a while, the rockets became routine. “It's like sex,” he says. “Once you've had it, you've had it.” 


	Later tests have been less successful, though perhaps more exciting. Most dramatic was an April 20, 2023, test of the SpaceX Starship, which melted the launchpad and showered the region as far as Port Isabel in a fine cement powder. Pompa remembers a chunk of cement crashing through a windshield on his street. The two most recent tests this year were also spectacular failures, with rockets exploding over the Caribbean, scattering debris, and forcing nearby aircraft to scramble. 


	Despite the setbacks, the area has continued to grow. Work moved at a breakneck pace — buildings sprung up and were abruptly demolished when no longer needed. It's become a passion project for Musk, who keeps a house nearby, and often posts glowingly about the new city. “Starbase is so cool,” he tweeted last August. New neighbors — mostly SpaceX employees or fans — kept moving in near Pompa's land, which grew into a small subdivision. He doesn't know many of them, and they mostly keep to themselves. Pompa has never met the billionaire either, but he's developed a pretty negative opinion of him. “I'm not a cultist,” he says. “I fought for America. I didn't fight for some South African guy to come over here and tell everyone what to do.” 


	Like the piñata protesters, he is concerned about completely losing access to Boca Chica Beach, where he's gone fishing since he was a kid. Even more troubling is the possibility that the new town could use the power of eminent domain to legally seize his land for a project deemed to be in the public interest. “They can file it, and I'll wait,” Pompa tells me, his eyes darkening. “I was good at ambushes.”

	











	THE VIBES ARE OFF IN BOCA CHICA VILLAGE, the small neighborhood right next to the SpaceX facility about a mile away from Pompa's RV. It's made up of several rows of ranch homes, remnants of pre-SpaceX neighbors who have mostly moved out, along with clusters of storage container apartments and airstream trailers arranged on turf lawns. There are a couple of small parks and a restaurant called the Astropub, all of which are SpaceX property closed to the general public. I'm visiting the day before the election, and it's pretty quiet, with only a few people out and about.  


	The neighborhood features the highest concentration of Cybertrucks I've encountered, though there are plenty of pickups that belong to local Brownsville day laborers, as well. Two-thirds of people living here are men, with an average age of about 27, according to a New York Times analysis. It's a place for transplants — most residents have no history of voting in Texas.


	When former SpaceX employee Joshuah Gardner applied for housing in Boca Chica Village in 2023, he noticed a strange stipulation on his lease agreement. If they were fired from SpaceX, he remembers the lease reading, the renter would be required to vacate their property in 10 days. These firings, he calls them “purges,” were very frequent while he was working there and felt arbitrary. He remembers Musk once visiting the town while he was living there temporarily in 2021, where he interviewed supervisors and inspected the row of airstream trailers. Later that day, he says, dozens of workers were laid off. While the threat of job loss is always stressful, there's an added layer of stress here because, at Boca Chica Village, a firing also means an eviction. 


	According to Gardner, nondisclosure agreements keep workers from discussing details of their jobs with non-SpaceX employees. “It's really hard to have a social life outside of SpaceX,” he says. “Because you can't talk to anybody about anything.” Still, before he was caught up in a 2023 purge, he loved the work. “That's something about it you can't buy,” he tells me. “Being a part of a mission like that.”


	Glassdoor reviews show a similar attitude toward the site among workers who describe fulfilling work in a pressure cooker. “You are constantly in fear of being fired, and if you have uprooted your family to come to Brownsville to take the job, you cannot afford to lose it because there is nowhere else for an engineer to work,” writes one reviewer who identifies himself as a senior mechanical engineer, in a post titled “Don't Be Fooled by YouTube.” 

	











	While there aren't many residents outside, several private-security vehicles conduct a patrol along Memes Street, near Musk's house. If there's a crime in the village, these patrols are generally the first call, Gardner says, rather than the county police. When I wander off the main road through a row of Airstream trailers, on what I think is a public sidewalk, I'm quickly stopped by a burly security guard dressed in a military-grade tactical vest. He informs me that I've entered private property, and escorts me to the road 10 feet away, where he watches me from his car as I walk down the street.  


	I greet one guy wearing a black polo and a SpaceX employee badge, who is friendly, but tells me he isn't allowed to talk to me. The whole setup reminds me of what I've heard about historical company towns throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, where the threat of firing and eviction from company-owned housing kept people from speaking out about their bosses or organizing for better conditions. These towns were places where “workplace democracy and speech was almost always sharply regulated by the employer,” according to researcher Highsmith, who recently published a paper that discusses Musk's efforts to establish modern company towns in Texas. He defines a company town as a place with “an absence of friction between government and industry,” a definition which he found Starbase to meet both before and after incorporation.


	Following the May 3 vote, Starbase has moved quickly. According to documents recently filed with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, SpaceX plans to develop a $22 million community center, a $20 million school, a medical clinic, and a multifamily housing complex.


	But their broader plans have remained opaque. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on this article. One former Boca Chica resident tells me she's resorted to tweeting at Musk to try to figure out what's going on. Starbase released a statement on X on May 3 reading vaguely, “Becoming a city will help us continue building the best community possible for the men and women building the future of humanity's place in space.” The new government did not elaborate on what exactly this would entail in the lead-up to the election. New Mayor Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice president of Test and Launch, commissioner Jenna Petrzelka, a former SpaceX engineering manager and the wife of a SpaceX vice president, and Jordan Buss, the senior director of Environmental Health and Safety for SpaceX, have not spoken publicly about their plans for the city, and did not respond to our requests for comment. Campaign platforms weren't particularly necessary, since all three ran unopposed. 

	











	ACROSS THE BAY IN THE TOWN OF PORT ISABEL, at a space-themed restaurant called the Hopper Haus, barflies discuss last night's rocket-engine test as if it had been a football game or a must-watch Sunday night TV show. This one hadn't been so loud — it was conducted at Massey's Point, a new test site closer to Brownsville, not the facility directly across the bay — but it seems that something went wrong, pushing back the next launch to later in the month. Since SpaceX moved in, the community has become dramatically polarized.


	Retired surgical assistant and jazz singer Kim Zimmerman takes me through her house in the Long Island Village neighborhood of Port Isabel, a middle-class gated community along a canal that leads to the bay. They're about five miles from the main launch site. She and her partner Jim moved here in 2018, and have since seen their home more than double in value, as the neighborhood has become a target for SpaceX employees avoiding the company town environment in Boca Chica. 


	She shows me the several cracks that recently appeared in her popcorn ceiling, which she believes are caused by the launches. Out here, they feel like an earthquake — “a 4.5 or more,” she says, which spooks her cats. “I'm all for space exploration,” she says. “I just think it was built too close to civilization. What's going to happen when the big one blows up on the launchpad and rains shrapnel all over our houses?” Another neighbor shows me how he has glued down vases and photos so they aren't shaken off the wall during launches. He's not upset about SpaceX, though, in part because they allow him to make some extra cash AirBnB'ing a room to rocket fans.


	While Zimmerman is troubled by the launches, Doug Kinne, who lives down the street, sees them as a pretty unambiguous good. The 72-year-old retired ski instructor and restaurant owner's house is full of SpaceX-themed collectibles — a shovel from the Starbase groundbreaking, a model Cybertruck, and pieces of rocket that washed up in the bay. His place is the closest in Port Isabel to the launch site, and he gets a great view from his balcony, where he hosts watch parties for neighbors and traveling space enthusiasts. “I mean, you're at the future,” he says. “It's an amazing thing.” His late wife, who passed away in 2022, was an even bigger rocket fan than him, and her ashes rest in a three-foot-tall rocket-shaped urn. Kinne has noticed cracks in his ceiling as well, but he doesn't believe they could have come as a result of the launches. Hurricanes, he thinks, are the more likely culprit. When I ask if the cracks in other peoples' houses might be the result of launches, he responds firmly. “They're not,” he says. “That's the thing.”

	











	There seems to be a correlation between how people feel about Musk's recent actions in the Trump administration and how they feel about the rocket launches. Before his abrupt fallout with the president, Musk pursued an aggressive cost-cutting regime as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, purging federal employees and terminating government contracts — while leaving his own contracts, including those funding much of the work at SpaceX, untouched. Some anti-SpaceX protesters on the beach cited examples of how they had been personally harmed by Elon's DOGE'ing, including one who had been put on leave from her job at a Palo Alto Battlefield National Park earlier this year. Others in Cameron County — which supported Trump in the 2024 election — like Kinne, or Keith Reynolds, who lives within the boundaries of the new city, are fans of Musk's work in the Trump administration. Reynolds hasn't met him personally, but he has a lot of faith in the billionaire. “Will the formation of Starbase be good for me? I don't know the answer to that yet,” Reynolds tells me. “But I'm going to support Elon.”


	LETTING SOMEONE LAUNCH A 150-TON ROCKET in your backyard takes a lot of faith, or a lot of money. As SpaceX's expansion into the region has brought jobs and investment for some locals, it has also brought economic benefits to the pocketbooks of local politicians. A 2024 Reuters investigation found that in 2014, as he was accumulating his incentive package, Musk had showered state and local politicians from both parties with $150,000. In the ensuing decade, businesses associated with SpaceX and company lobbyists contributed more than $500,000 to the campaigns of two dozen elected officials from the region. One local politician bought and sold land around Starbase for a profit.


	More recently, as the SpaceX venture has spurred several environmental and public access lawsuits, Musk has set his sights on the Texas courts. In October 2024, he made a $2 million donation to the Judicial Fairness PAC, which backs Republicans in state judicial races. Notably, the PAC backed campaigns of Republican judges in the 13th Circuit Appellate Court, which covers Cameron County, and which had ruled against SpaceX in a case about public access to the Boca Chica beach in early 2024. After the election this November, the court became entirely Republican, likely more amenable to SpaceX and Musk. 

	











	Musk made another $1 million donation last year to Texans for Lawsuit Reform PAC, which funds pro-business conservative candidates in legislative and judicial races. They were the top benefactors to the two new Republican justices in the Cameron County appellate court, granting each $7,500. Two of Texans for Lawsuit Reform PAC's largest beneficiaries at the legislature were Rep. Janie Lopez and Sen. Adam Hinojosa, who received $854,849 and $700,000 from the PAC, respectively. 


	The PAC was the single largest donor to both politicians, who were the driving forces behind a State Legislature measure this year that would benefit SpaceX. A bill introduced by Lopez in the House and by Hinojosa in the Senate would transfer the right to control highway closures on the road leading to Boca Chica Beach from an independent commission to the new municipality of Starbase, essentially removing any level of public oversight from these decisions. (Lopez and Hinojosa did not respond to requests for comment.)


	The latter bill was a step too far even for generally pro-SpaceX Judge Eddie Treviño Jr., Cameron County's top executive, who spoke out against the move this March. “We think that has potential to create conflict going forward that we don't think is absolutely needed or necessary,” Treviño told local news. But the pushback was too little too late. After briefly appearing dead amid public pressure, the beach-access measure was revived in an amendment to an unrelated bill, and was passed by the legislature on June 1. 


	ON MAY 27, THE ROADS TO BOCA CHICA BEACH CLOSED for a launch. Homer Pompa perched in his tower and waited. In Port Isabel, Doug Kinne gathered a group of rocket enthusiasts on his front porch, while others in the neighborhood braced for impact.


	As the sun set over Boca Chica Beach, the 400-foot-tall Starship, the largest rocket ever built, was loaded into the Mechazilla launch tower. The rocket test was supposed to redeem the two recent failures. This time, SpaceX hoped the Starship would reach space and release several Starlink satellites before reentering the atmosphere and conducting a controlled landing in the Indian Ocean.


	On the live feed, SpaceX engineers began a countdown from 40. White smoke billowing, the 33 powerful Raptor engines activated, and the launch pad was deluged with tens of thousands of gallons of cooling water. With a massive blast and shockwave that rattled Pompa's tower, the engines pushed the rocket skyward. It wobbled slightly, before it shot up and out of sight.

	











	Fans watched on a stream as the Starship soared through the stratosphere, further than the past few missions had managed. But, at the edge of space, things started to go wrong. The bay door, which was supposed to open to release the satellites, was jammed shut. Then the spacecraft sprung a propellant leak. The rocket spiraled wildly out of control, tumbling back toward Earth. As it reentered the atmosphere, the ship broke apart, careening into the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, the booster rocket dropped into the Gulf of Mexico, debris washing up along the beach in the neighboring town of Matamoros, Mexico. Musk had announced on X that he would give a speech explaining “the Mars game plan in Starbase” following the launch, but it was canceled after the rocket was lost. The setback triggered an Federal Aviation Administration mishap investigation, the third of the year against the company.


	The following week, Musk's cushy relationship with the Trump administration suffered a similar disintegration. Musk stepped down from his role at DOGE on May 28, and quickly began criticizing Trump's flagship “Big Beautiful Bill” in a series of tweets on X. The pair of billionaires exchanged barbs on social media, and Musk's rockets were an important leverage point in the feud, with Trump threatening to cancel the billions of dollars in SpaceX's contracts, and Musk threatening to decommission the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft which had recently been used to return NASA astronauts from the International Space Station.


	But the failed launch and the squabbles with the President didn't slow the forward momentum of Starbase. Launches will be happening much more frequently after the FAA granted approval to increase the number of annual launches from 5 to 25 annually. Two days after the launch, Starbase held its first public meeting, where the town swore in city leaders, appointed a new city administrator and declared May 29th “Starbase Day.” The following day, they approved a request for a $1.5 million loan from SpaceX.


	That day, neighbors in Boca Chica Village received notices describing plans for a new Starbase zoning regime, which would establish what land in specific areas of Starbase can be used for, and which included a troubling line:


	THE CITY OF STARBASE IS HOLDING A HEARING THAT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER YOU MAY LOSE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE USING YOUR PROPERTY FOR ITS CURRENT USE, PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY.

	A meeting to discuss is set for June 23, though residents are yet to see the final proposal, which would define exactly which properties would be affected by the zoning changes. If politicians were attempting the same maneuver down the road in Brownsville, one non-SpaceX landowner who received the notice points out, the process would likely play out differently. “In Brownsville, if they pass something people are against, they'll be voted out of office,” he says. “But these guys have nothing to fear.”

	











	He's concerned that SpaceX, now armed with the powers of a local government, might be able to bulldoze the interests of the few remaining non-SpaceX neighbors, and requested to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution. “These guys have deep pockets,” he says, “and can make your life pretty miserable.”

	The last time Paul Simon played a full concert in New York it was July 22, 2018, and he was capping off his Homeward Bound Farewell Tour in front of roughly 30,000 fans at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens. On Monday evening, after seven extremely long and tumultuous years that saw Simon enter his eighth decade, lose nearly all hearing in his left ear, and record the sparse, meditative LP Seven Psalms, Simon returned to New York City for an intimate night of music, new and old, at the Beacon Theatre.


	Before playing a note, Simon told the crowd how the concert would unfold. “Tonight's show has two parts,” he said. “The first is Seven Psalms. It's a 33-minute piece. It's uninterrupted. There are no breaks between songs. The second half, we'll play a bunch of hits, some deep cuts songs that I've never played or seldom played. We hope you have a great time.”


	The news that a veteran artist is about to play their entire new album would typically elicit silent groans throughout a classic rock audience, or at least a stampede to the bathrooms or bar, but Seven Psalms is a remarkable achievement, and fans have had two years to process it. When he kicked into its opening segment, “The Lord,” the capacity crowd fell into a hushed, reverent silence.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Simon's hearing issues initially made him think he could never play live again. And it's likely true that the loud, electric show he brought to arenas and festival grounds back in 2018 is not something he'll be able to repeat. But Seven Psalms is a soft, acoustic work, and he recreated the chill vibe onstage with an ace band that included guitarists Mark Stewart, Gyan Riley, and Biodun Kuti, bassist Bakithi Kumalo, flute player Nancy Stagnita, and cellist Eugene Friesen.

	











	This tour is officially called “A Quiet Celebration,” and the quiet of Seven Psalms was only punctured by the occasional ringing cellphone or laughter at some of the funnier lines, like “I heard two cows in a conversation/One called the other one a name/In my professional opinion/All cows in the country must bear the blame,” in “My Professional Opinion.”

	As Simon explained, the seven parts of the album flow directly into one another, and some of the melodies and refrains are repeated throughout multiple segments. To help the audience follow along, a screen displayed the name of each chapter right as it began. And to help Simon with the harmonies on “The Sacred Harp” and “Wait,” Edie Brickell walked out to a microphone on the side of the stage and locked voices with her husband. Their musical partnership has largely existed outside of the public eye over the past three decades, and it was wonderful to finally witness their chemistry in person.


	After a brief intermission, Simon came back for the hits/deep cuts portion of the night. This was rockier territory since the songs on Seven Psalms were constructed specifically to accommodate Simon's weathered voice, which lacks some of the range and force it had in the past, and now he was going to attempt songs at age 83 that, in some cases, date back to his early twenties.


	In a bold move, he opened with “Graceland,” and briefly seemed overwhelmed, unable to hit the difficult notes. But things quickly evened out with a gentle, re-worked “Slip Slidin' Away,” and he never seemed lost again. “Here's a song from the Simon and Garfunkel days,” he said after a stellar “Train in the Distance,” one of three Hearts and Bones songs he slipped into the set. “Some of the early songs I wrote for us, I used to put a guitar figure on top the song.” He then teased bits of “I Am a Rock” and “The Sound of Silence” before kicking into “Homeward Bound.”


	Unlike the rendition on the Saturday Night Live 50 special earlier this year, he didn't alter the lyrics to remove the word “cigarettes.” He also didn't bring out Sabrina Carpenter or his old buddy Artie, even though they finally reconciled after years of bitter estrangement. It was instead the solo version, similar to the one on his 1974 concert LP Live Rhymin'. And it was majestic.

	The first true deep cut of the night came when he broke out “The Late Great Johnny Ace,” which he hadn't performed in a quarter century prior to this tour. It was inspired by R&B singer Johnny Ace, who died in 1954 while playing with a handgun backstage at a concert. The lyrics touch on John F. Kennedy and John Lennon in addition to Ace himself, and images of all three Johns flashed on the screen at the end.

	











	The Hearts and Bone tribute continued with a beautiful “Rene and Georgette Magritte With Their Dog After the War,” one of the many hidden gems on the vastly under-appreciated 1983 LP. (The common narrative that Simon was in a creative slump prior to Graceland simply isn't true. He just hadn't had a radio hit in a while.)


	Brickell came back onstage for “Under African Skies,” which Simon dedicated to Kumalo, noting he was the last surviving member of the Graceland band. And after a quick flashback to The Rhythm of the Saints with “Spirit Voices” and “The Cool, Cool River,” Brickell returned again for some impressive whistling on set-closer “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard.” This one required a bit more vocal power than Simon can muster, but the audience gladly helped him out.


	The encore began with a joyous “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,” and a stunning take on “The Boxer” where every person in the Beacon sang along to the “la la lie” chorus. This is such a pivotal New York City song that Lorne Michaels asked Simon to sing it on the first SNL after 9/11. It's a tale of perseverance and resilience, and it felt like the fighter who “carries the remainders of every glove that laid him down” is now Simon himself.


	The band took a bow after the final “la la lie,” but Simon remained onstage, and held up a single finger to signal that one more song was coming. It could only have been “The Sound of Silence.” Simon wrote the song over 60 years ago in the bathroom of his childhood home in Queens, and it became Simon and Garfunkel's breakthrough hit at the height of the folk rock movement. Hearing it with fresh ears can be difficult after infinite replays on classic rock radio, movie soundtracks, and Time Life Music informercials.

	But when he stood alone on the Beacon stage and sang “hello darkness my old friend,” the past 60 years collapsed into one divine moment. The words and melody felt as alive and vibrant as they must have sounded when Simon and Garfunkel first tested the song out before a Greenwich Village coffee house audience when they were still billing themselves as Kane and Garr.


	As we've seen over and over again, farewell tours rarely stick. But Paul Simon's A Quiet Celebration tour is nothing like some artists squeezing their fans for more money after promising to go away forever. It's a victory lap for one of the greatest songwriters of the past century. And if it winds up being the last time, he's taking a page from the Leonard Cohen playbook and going out on top.

	Among the weighty roles and responsibilities placed on the American president's shoulders, the least controversial is the practice of calling other politicians, in the face of personal or public tragedy, to make sure that they have everything they need. If a president wants to go above and beyond that lowest of bars, they offer condolences, and act like a human instead of a partisan hack. 


	This week, after a spree shooter killed former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, her husband, and severely injured state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, President Donald Trump hasn't bothered to pick up the phone to speak with Minnesota's head of state. 


	Shortly after 3 p.m. ET on Sunday, Rolling Stone asked Gov. Tim Walz's office if he had received a call from Trump yet. A spokesperson for the Democratic governor replied, “We haven't heard from him,” adding that former President Joe “Biden called yesterday midday shortly after all the news broke.”


	Asked if Trump had ever called Walz, who took office in 2019, in previous moments of crisis or emergency, to speak cordially or professionally, the governor's spokesperson said, flatly, “Yes.”

	











	On Monday, Walz told reporters that he had yet to hear from President Trump in the aftermath of Saturday's murders, which resulted in a state-wide, two day manhunt before the suspect — 56 year old Vance Boelter — was apprehended. 


	By Tuesday morning, it appeared the president was not just committed to giving Walz the silent treatment, but to openly spurning the governor, who ran against him and J.D. Vance as the vice presidential candidate on the 2024 Democratic ticketSpeaking to reporters Tuesday on Air Force One, Trump stated that he had no interest in calling the former vice presidential candidate. “I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I'm not calling,” Trump said. “The guy doesn't have a clue, he's a mess… so, you know, I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?”

	











	This wasn't a one-off moment of being loose-lipped with reporters. A source with direct knowledge of the matter says that Trump has been relentlessly trash-talking the Minnesota governor behind the scenes since the horrific news broke. “He's not letting up,” the source said.

	When Trump asserted to reporters on the presidential plane that he had no interest in speaking to Walz, he justified himself by claiming that the governor had “appointed this guy to a position,” seeming to suggest that Walz himself may bear some responsibility for the tragedy. Boelter — who allegedly had a hit list of over 45 local and state lawmakers, including Walz — previously served as a political appointee on the Minnesota governor's Workforce Development Board. The appointment did not originally take place under Walz, but under his predecessor — former Governor Mark Dayton, also a Democrat. Walz renewed Boelter's term in the low-profile political position in 2019. 


	The Trump administration has made a show of pursuing hardline policies against politically motivated violence. Attorney General Pam Bondi has charged individuals who vandalized Tesla cars and dealerships with terrorism, she is seeking the death penalty for alleged United Healthcare CEO assassin Luigi Mangione, and her department charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) with assaulting a federal agent after a chaotic incident at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center.But this public fixation on combating political violence has always been incredibly self-serving. Terrorism charges remain conspicuously absent from the federal indictment against Boelter, and Trump was not the only GOP lawmaker to downplay the assassination.

	Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) wrote on X that Boelter's actions are “what happens when Marxists don't get their way.” In another post, Lee joked that Bueter — who wore a halloween mask to commit the murders — was a “Nightmare on Waltz Street.” 


	Minnesota Senator Tina Smith, a Democrat, tracked down Lee in the U.S. Capitol and confronted him directly about the posts. “I wanted him to know how much pain that caused me and the other people in my state, and I think around the country, who think that this was a brutal attack,” Smith told reporters of their conversation. “I needed him to hear from me directly what impact I think his cruel statement had on me, his colleague.”

							By

	The first episode of Smoke, a new Apple TV+ miniseries about an arson investigator (Taron Egerton) and a cop (Jurnee Smollett) teaming up to catch two unrelated serial arsonists, opens with the dictionary definition of “creativity.” This is the sort of device that suggests anything but creativity is to be found. And for a couple of episodes, the show feels only slightly less hacky than the novel that Egerton's character, Dave Gudsen, is writing, inspired by his own experiences. 


	“Of all the elements,” he jots down at one point, “only fire retains a sense of mystery.” This is actually one of the less cliche-ridden lines of Dave's book. There are some early contrivances as well, including Michelle having a traumatic past that makes her particularly eager to catch their two mysterious arsonists: “Milk Jug,” so nicknamed because he fills them with gasoline to set his fires; and “D&C,” short for divide and conquer, who sets time-delayed fires in one area so he'll go unmolested when going after his real targets. 

	











	But then the show's creator, Dennis Lehane — reuniting with Egerton (and supporting actor Greg Kinnear, who plays Dave's boss) from their Apple miniseries Black Bird — reveals what's really going on with these investigations. And suddenly, the series' more trite elements become a feature, not a (fire)bug. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Will viewers have the patience to make their way through two episodes that are hiding what Smoke is really about, just to get to the actual show? Two hours out of nine isn't quite a full Surf Dracula situation, where a series wastes its entire first season before introducing its real premise. But it's still asking a lot from viewers with busy lives and long to-watch lists. If I wasn't planning to review it — and, frankly, if I hadn't enjoyed so many of Lehane's novels (like Gone, Baby, Gone, Mystic River, and Shutter Island), as well as his TV work on The Wire — I might not have even made it to the big turn that the story takes.

	Perhaps Lehane was simply following the lead of Fire Bug, the true crime podcast that he's fictionalizing, which also kept the true nature of what was happening a secret for a while. I can't speak to how it worked in that version, but it's not a coincidence that Smoke becomes vastly more entertaining and complex the second that it turns all of its cards face-up. The cat-and-mouse game between the investigators and the arsonists becomes more fraught. Smollett and Egerton are excellent and magnetic as we plumb the depths of their characters' damaged psyches. The supporting actors (including Rafe Spall, Anna Chlumsky, and John Leguizamo) give rich — and, in the case of Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine as a chicken joint fry cook whose only pleasure seems to come from watching things burn, terrifying — performances, that are all substantially better for knowing what's really motivating everyone. 


	Even answering the relatively small question of whether Lehane and company intend for Dave's book to be good goes a long way towards making Smoke work. At first, it's unclear if he's meant to be a bad writer, or if this the Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip problem in literary form, where a work-within-the-work that other characters insist is brilliant actually seems awful. Fortunately, Lehane is a great enough crime author to be able to imitate a terrible one(*), and being more overt about that helps to better establish who Dave is. 


(*) That said, there are occasional exchanges of dialogue that feel like Dave could have written them, like one character calling another, “The biggest joke I ever heard,” followed by their target replying, “Then why aren't you laughing?”

	The story spirals a bit too far out of Lehane and company's control in the final chapters, particularly with some choices that Michelle makes. But even they have some thrilling moments, and some thoughtful things to say about the lies we tell the world — and ourselves — about who we are.

	When Dave's book gets critiqued by his wife Ashley (Hannah Emily Anderson) and others, the complaints tend to be about the stilted dialogue or the poorly-written female characters. No one encourages him to get to the big idea sooner. But it's advice the people writing about Dave and his colleagues could have used, especially given how much better Smoke gets once that happens. 


The first two episodes of Smoke begin streaming June 27 on Apple TV+, with additional episodes releasing weekly. I've seen all nine episodes.

A strange jellyfish-like phenomenon was spotted streaking across the California sky Monday night.

While the unusual 'UFO' sighting baffled many locals from the Mojave desert to Los Angeles's South Bay, scientists say there were no extraterrestrials involved in creating the jellyfish - it was an Elon Musk rocket.

SpaceX's latest Falcon 9 rocket mission lifted off at 11:36pm ET Monday night from Vandenberg Space Force Station in California.

A few minutes into the flight, the rocket's exhaust interacted with the atmosphere, creating a visible cloud of condensed water vapor.

Since the launch took place right after sunset, around 8:36pm PT, the sun illuminated the crystalized exhaust plume, resulting in a spectacular sight for millions on the ground.

Californians posted images of the rocket soaring over the state on X, even as far south as Riverside, over 200 miles southeast of the Vandenberg launch site.

SpaceX's lead avionics systems engineer, Cameron Gable, captured the jellyfish phenomenon as the rocket traveled past Los Angeles County's South Bay.

The mission, dubbed Starlink 15-9, saw SpaceX launch its latest batch of Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit. 

Scientists said that the mysterious jellyfish seen over California Monday night was the exhaust trail of a Falcon 9 rocket

The Falcon 9 rocket's exhaust interacted with Earth's atmosphere, creating a visible cloud of condensed water vapor that became easier to see right after sunset

SpaceX's lead avionics engineer posted on X, showing the jellyfish effect as it passed over Los Angeles's South Bay

The jellyfish phenomenon, also known as a 'vapor cone' or 'shock collar,' occurs when the localized air pressure around the rocket drops, causing the air temperature to decrease and water vapor to condense into visible clouds.

Monday's giant jellyfish display started just a few minutes into the flight and was visible to anyone in the Southern California area.

It's not the first time a SpaceX rocket has produced the jellyfish effect. In October 2022, sky watchers caught another Falcon 9 rocket creating the same vapor trail during a similar mission to deploy new satellites.

Monday's Falcon 9 launch was the latest mission in SpaceX's ongoing efforts to expand its Starlink 'constellation,' aiming to enhance global internet coverage.

SpaceX has already conducted 75 launches in 2025, mainly for Starlink missions.

The mission also used a reusable first-stage engine, a hallmark of SpaceX's design philosophy aimed at reducing the cost of spaceflights.

SpaceX captured the moment on their live broadcast when the reusable engine safely landed back on Earth to be used again in future missions.

Monday's mission was the 200th from the company's Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg.

The SpaceX launch was part of the company's ongoing Starlink mission, which is deploying a network of new satellites that will boost global internet coverage

The jellyfish effect is a common occurrence during space rocket launches and can normally be seen from states hundreds of miles from the actual launch site

The remote-controlled reusable rocket engine made a perfect touchdown on SpaceX's droneship in the Pacific Ocean about eight minutes after launch, making it the 463rd engine returned to Earth.

While the jellyfish effect may seem like a bizarre UFO to the untrained eye, it's common among spaceflights.

Social media users regularly capture rockets giving off the jellyfish trail from hundreds of miles away.

One X user in Phoenix, Arizona, was able to spot a similar jellyfish during a June 2024 launch. That mission also involved a Falcon 9 launching from Vandenberg, which was over 500 miles away.

When a rocket launches, it expels a large amount of exhaust gases at high speeds. These gases, primarily composed of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other rocket launch byproducts, expand rapidly as they exit the rocket's nozzle.

As the exhaust plume expands, it encounters cooler, denser air in Earth's upper atmosphere. This can cause the water vapor in the exhaust to condense into visible clouds, forming a balloon-like shape around the rocket.

The high speed of the rocket can also create shock waves, further shaping the exhaust into distinctive patterns, creating the jellyfish effect. 

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, with their frequent launch schedule and reusable first stages, often trigger this effect due to their design and the typical launch times chosen for optimal visibility.

However, any rocket launch around the world can potentially give off a jellyfish trail, especially when the conditions are right for the exhaust to give off a dramatic display in the atmosphere.

Deep in the heart of East Texas, the small town of Palestine hides a chilling secret, a jailhouse where the echoes of the past refuse to rest. Built in 1931, the Anderson County Jail is now one of the most infamous haunted locations in Texas, attracting ghost hunters and thrill-seekers alike.

The Anderson County Jail served as the county's primary detention center for decades, holding prisoners accused of everything from petty theft to violent crimes. Its imposing brick structure and iron-barred windows were designed to keep criminals locked away, but many believe that some never truly left.

Legends claim that inmates who met tragic ends, whether by execution, illness, or suicide—left behind restless spirits. Visitors and paranormal investigators often report strange occurrences, from unexplained footsteps and eerie whispers to doors slamming shut on their own.

In recent years, the old jailhouse has become a hotspot for ghost tours and overnight investigations. Brave participants have experienced chilling encounters, including shadowy figures moving through cells and sudden drops in temperature. Some have even captured mysterious voices on audio recordings, adding to the jail's haunted reputation.

Paranormal experts point to the building's layered history of violence and despair as the reason for its spectral activity. Whether skeptics or believers, most who enter the jailhouse leave with stories they can't quite explain.

Today, the haunted Texas jailhouse is a must-visit for ghost hunters and history buffs. The property hosts scheduled tours, giving guests a chance to explore the building's dark past while keeping an eye, and ear, out for ghostly activity.

Whether you're searching for spirits or just looking for a spine-tingling adventure, the haunted jailhouse in Palestine offers an unforgettable experience. Just be warned, some visitors say the spirits have a way of following you home.

The Exynos 2500 is expected to be Samsung's next flagship processor, but so far, all the information available has come from rumors and leaks, except for the one time the company acknowledged its name. Surprisingly, a big feature of the next big Samsung chip has now been confirmed, not by Samsung but by a company called Skylo.

If the name sounds a bit familiar, that's because Skylo is the satellite connectivity provider for the Pixel 9 series and the Galaxy S25 series on Verizon.

“Today, we are excited to announce the certification of the Exynos 2500 mobile processor, offering better energy efficiency and higher performance,” Skylo noted in a press release, hinting at the chip's imminent launch and confirming its extraterrestrial capabilities.

The Exynos 2500 is expected to debut on the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Rumor has it that the chipset could power the new foldable in all markets, even the US. This is also the first time Samsung will introduce a flagship Exynos chip on a foldable phone instead of its latest Galaxy S series flagship.

“Samsung's partnership with Skylo is built upon 3GPP NTN standards to unlock connectivity everywhere,” Hui Won Je, VP of the Modem Development Team at Samsung Electronics, noted in Skylo's press release. “Through our collaboration on the Samsung Exynos Modem 5400 and the Exynos 2500 mobile processor, mainstream devices worldwide will now have the underlying technology to connect to satellites wherever cellular networks are unavailable, ushering in a new era of ubiquitous connectivity,” he added.

In addition to its collaboration with Samsung, Skylo also announced partnerships with OPPO and TECNO to bring NTN-compliant satellite connectivity to future devices from the respective brands.","{'href': 'https://www.androidauthority.com', 'title': 'Android Authority'}","other"

By the time Supernatural wrapped its 15-season run, The CW series had amassed an impressive lineup of guest stars, leading to pretty great moments both life-changing and storyline-changing. Guest-starring on SPN often means having a scene or two with stars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, which was definintely a boon for the mother of guest actor Aimee Garcia, who recalled her mom fliring with Ackles with a hilarious story.

Garcia is best known for her role on Lucifer and can currently be seen starring on Criminal Minds: Evolution (streaming with a Paramount+ subscription), but guest-starred on Supernatural back in 2008. She appeared as a secretary at a police station in Season 3 Episode 12, “Jus in Bello,” and despite it filming nearly 20 years ago, she still remembers it like it was yesterday. Speaking with TV Insider, the actress recalled her parents visiting the set and nd her mom shamelessly flirting with Ackles. (Not that I blame her). According to Garcia:

I had the best time with those guys. My parents came on set, and I do remember my mom flirting with Jensen shamelessly in front of my father, and she's like — She's Mexican, so English is her second language. She's like, ‘Oh, Jensen, you are chewing gum before they start the scene. And then they call action. And then where does the gum go? I [don't] see it while you shoot the scene.' I'm like, ‘Mom, you cannot flirt with Jensen!'

I don't know which is better: The fact that Garcia's mother flirted with Ackles in the first place, or that she did it in full view of her husband and daughter. Not even moms are able to resist the Ackles charm, and it is pretty funny to learn how this went down.

Luckily, the flirting didn't do any harm, and now Garcia has a funny story to tell for years to come. It just makes me wonder if Ackles remembers that, although there's a more-than-good chance that Garcia's mother was not the first or last parent to shamelessly flirt with him on set.

Meanwhile, even after all these years, Jensen Ackles is still keeping people on their toes. With his upcoming Prime Video series Countdown coming out later this month, fans have been thirsting quite a lot over his new role. The Supernatural family was bringing the heat with the comments about how good he looks, and even compared his new character to Dean Winchester. It's clear that no one can resist him.

Supernatural and Countdown are not the only places that fans are able to see Ackles. The actor will soon be appearing in the fifth and final season of The Boys, reprising his role as Soldier Boy. He will also be playing Soldier Boy in the new prequel series, Vought Rising. Ackles has been guest starring on Tracker as well, appearing as Russell Shaw, the brother of Justin Hartley's Colter. Since Season 3 of the CBS drama has been ordered, it's possible that Russell will return, assuming Ackles' busy schedule gives him time.

Even though fans won't see Aimee Garcia's mom shamelessly flirting with Ackles, they can always watch her episode and all 15 seasons of Supernatural with a Netflix subscription. It does make you look at the episode differently, knowing what was happening behind the scenes.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","The Supernatural Story Eric Kripke Wishes He Had Done (& the One He Wouldn't Touch with a 10-Foot Pole)","https://www.cbr.com/the-supernatural-eric-kripke-gremlins-jesus-storylines/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

Over fifteen seasons, Supernatural delved into urban legends, myths, and lore from all over the world. Sam and Dean Winchester hunted monsters across the country, saving people from things that go bump in the night. Armed with sawed-off shotguns, silver blades, and holy fire, Sam and Dean took on everything from angels and demons to faeries and dragons.

Five years after Supernatural ended, creator Eric Kripke talked about the story he never got to tell and the one he would never tell. Inspired by Roald Dahl's The Gremlins, Kripke wanted to do a story about mischievous creatures that messed with technology. But Kripke purposefully steered clear of one particular religious figure when writing Supernatural.

 Richard Speight Jr. asked Eric Kripke if there was any story he wanted to do but didn't get to. Kripke said, ""The one story that I always really wanted to do under my watch that I never got a chance to do was Gremlins. ‘Cause Gremlins are a real mythology that long predated the movie."" Gremlins are most famous from the 1984 film.

The furry creatures wreaked havoc on a small town, blowing up washing machines and movie theaters. While there are a few instances of gremlins affecting technology, those mischievous little creatures weren't based on the gremlins to which Kripke was referring. Gremlins are fictional creatures created to explain otherwise inexplicable malfunctions in aircrafts and other machinery. The idea of gremlins became popular among the Royal Air Force pilots and crew during World War II.

Both sides experienced unexplained accidents, so the gremlins were thought to be unbiased tricksters, causing mischief and mayhem wherever they liked. Posters warning of the invisible mischief-makers depicting gremlins greasing floors and throwing things in people's eyes were made during the war. Kripke's gremlins would be more machine-focused.

And so, the Impala is the bad guy of the episode.

When describing his idea for the episode, Kripke said, ""And so my notion was, okay, turns out gremlins are so small, you can't see them. So I don't have to make, like, a bunch of puppets. But they get into the Impala. And so, the Impala is the bad guy of the episode... But like all the other cars and electronics, and whatever, the rule was going to be: the only way to stop them was to destroy them totally."" With the love Dean has for Baby, that would definitely be a dilemma for the eldest Winchester.

The original premise of Supernatural lacked important elements, and the show wouldn't be the same if Kripke hadn't made some big changes.

""And so then, in the middle of the episode, it was going to infect the Impala,"" Kripke described. ""And so now Dean's like, ‘I can't destroy it. I can't like—how do I get the gremlins out of this thing? And it's like mowing over people and coming after me. But I can't destroy it. I have to save her.'"" How Dean saves Baby is still a mystery, but he discussed some of the visual gags he had in mind. ""But like that was a story I—like I always loved, and it was totally doable. Like it wasn't like an impossible story to pull off ... It—you know, the only monsters you ever saw would have been like the blender that someone's hand was in or the car.""

It's basically all car gags all day.

When thinking back to why Kripke never made an episode about gremlins, he couldn't quite pinpoint the reason, but he said, ""You know, I don't know why we never ended up doing it. Maybe, like the—I think it was, like—because they ended up doing like that great episode, ‘Baby,' that was [the one] Robbie wrote that was all within it. But I think at the time, the feeling was like we don't have enough days in the schedule to do, like, a real Impala-centric episode … It's basically all car gags all day.""

While Supernatural never had a gremlin episode, something similar did happen in ""Mannequin 3: The Reckoning."" While it wasn't about imperceptible creatures, Baby was possessed by a ghost, and the Winchesters had to fight their Impala. ""Baby"" is one of the series' highest-rated episodes, taking place entirely in the Impala. Kripke's gremlins episode would've probably fallen somewhere in between the two.

When on Supernatural Then and Now, Richard Speight Jr. asked Eric Kripke if he'd ever considered including Jesus in the Supernatural mythology. “I wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole, man,” Kripke responded. “Like I'm not getting, like, super specific about Jesus.” Kripke did mention that comic books like Preacher partly inspired Supernatural.

“You know, the, the comic book sources that a lot of that stuff came from, like Preacher, you know, and Garth Ennis. And they were all—I mean—yes, there is sort of like a whacked-out Jesus character in that. But to me, it was like the binary, like God versus Lucifer without getting, like, too specific. You know, so that there're a lot of religions it could play under rather than, you know, being with any one particular religion.”

I wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole, man.

As non-specific as he tried to keep the mythology of the arching plot line of Supernatural's early seasons, Kripke and the writers did eliminate several belief systems in the season five episode “Hammer of the Gods.” Sam and Dean roll up in their iconic Chevy Imapala to a five-star hotel in the middle of nowhere, called the Elysian Fields.

It turned out the hotel was magically renovated to welcome several gods and deities from other faiths. The gods met to discuss what, if anything, they were going to do about the impending apocalypse. It ended in a slaughter at the hands of Lucifer. There were figures from Greek, Norse, Chinese, and Egyptian mythology, and some Hinduism.

Supernatural's ""Swan Song"" is hailed as Eric Kripke's perfect finale to the series, but his ending is actually much darker and unsatisfying.

The episode was well-received, but inserting deities from belief systems currently being practiced by millions of people didn't go over well with some viewers—namely the representation of Ganesh and Kali. In addition to poorly portraying the gods and what they represent, they made them appear weak, like the pagan gods that are no longer worshiped—although there are over a billion practicing Hindus worldwide. The episode played very heavily into the idea of Christianity as the absolute religion, offending many fans of the series. 

We wanted to be provocative without being, you know, firebombed.

Kripke also joked about finding the line in their storytelling, saying, “And, you know, we wanted to be provocative without being, you know, firebombed, I think.” The decision not to portray the Christian messiah was probably a good call, as the mythology was already limited to Abrahamic religions. Considering how offended a portion of viewers felt by “Hammer of the Gods,” there's a decent chance they could've alienated even more of their audience.

In the hours after the weekend shooting spree targeting Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, information was still just trickling out. Most Americans were beginning to learn about the assassination of one lawmaker and the attempted assassination of another Saturday morning.

With the information vacuum online, conspiracy theories were already beginning to flood in.

Before authorities had even announced a suspect and just an hour after news of the shooting broke, right-wing pundits and agitators began to spread ideas about who they thought did it and why. And when the suspect's name was published, opportunists online baselessly asserted that he must have been a leftist activist whose alleged crimes were somehow tied to the issue of health care for illegal immigrants.

The claims weren't confined to the political fringe. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, two Republican U.S. senators and other high-profile figures shared rumors about the shooting on X, the app that Musk owns, and some conspiracy posts on X tallied millions of views.

“There was a lot of speculation going on, simply because there's a lack of information,” said Erik Nisbet, a professor of policy analysis and communication at Northwestern University.

It's now a pattern after tragic news events: Moments after a notable death or a crime, social media influencers accuse political rivals of guilt or complicity with little to no evidence, and when their theories turn out to be unfounded or false, neither the influencers nor the social media companies are held accountable.

Other recent examples of the pattern include the attempt to assassinate Donald Trump last July in Pennsylvania and the assumption by some people that every mass shooting suspect is transgender.

More information about the suspect in Minnesota has now come to light. Authorities arrested the suspect, Vance Boelter, late Sunday and have charged him with the murder of state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and the nonfatal shooting of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette.

Hortman was a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, as is Hoffman. Boelter's car had notebooks with the names of more than 45 state and federal elected officials, acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said Monday. The federal criminal complaint against him says officials named in the notebooks were “mostly or all Democrats,” and several Democrats said Monday they had been notified that their names were in the notebooks.

Boelter was a strong supporter of Trump and voted for Trump, his roommate David Carlson told NBC affiliate KARE of Minneapolis. 

But those statements stood in stark contrast to the narrative that had already developed online. 

The shootings happened early Saturday, and the facts came out slowly. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, posted on X at 7:35 a.m. local time that he'd been briefed on the shootings.

About an hour later, at 8:48 a.m. in Minnesota, the pro-Trump co-founder of a right-wing online publication floated the idea that the lawmakers were targeted from the left. Jason Robertson, whose X account often sides with Trump, noted that Hortman broke party lines recently to revoke Medicaid benefits for undocumented immigrants. “I'm sure its just a coincidence,” he wrote, along with a GIF of a winking Steve Carell. (He also falsely said Hoffman broke party lines on the same vote, although he didn't.)

His post had received 111,000 views as of Monday. In a direct message to NBC News, he defended it as a “factual statement.”

Over the next hour, other accounts on X chimed in with similar comments. A pseudonymous self-described MAGA supporter in Texas posted at 9:26 a.m., “Their own attacked them.” Another pseudonymous X user who identified as a Midwesterner described the shootings as “Blue on Blue violence” in a post at 9:59 a.m. 

Then, a photo posted by law enforcement caused confusion.

At 11:03 a.m., the Minnesota State Patrol shared a photo on X that it said showed the inside of the suspect's vehicle. The photo showed stacks of “NO KINGS” flyers on a seat, apparently referring to street protests that were planned for later Saturday. Authorities said at a news conference that they were sharing the photo to warn people that it might be unsafe to attend the protests in case the suspect was there intending harm. But some people on X had the opposite interpretation, taking the photo as evidence that the suspect was a sincere protester opposed to Trump. 

The suspect's name leaked shortly before 12 p.m. Minnesota time Saturday, giving amateur sleuths and conspiracy theorists additional fodder. Searching his name, some influencers seized upon a connection between Boelter and state government: In 2016, a previous Minnesota governor had appointed Boelter to a state advisory board about workforce development, and Walz had later reappointed him to the same board. But the connection was thin, according to Minnesota-based fact-checkers: The board has about 60 members, many of whom aren't politically connected and would have no meaningful access to the governor, The Minnesota Star Tribune reported. There are more than 130 such advisory councils in the state's government, the newspaper added.

Some people assumed that the advisory board seat was of great significance, using it as a basis to refer to Boelter as an “associate” of Walz.

At 12:02 p.m. CT, Mike Cernovich, a far-right agitator, posted a smear of Walz, the former vice presidential candidate, in the form of a question asking whether he had had a role in the death of a “political rival.” His post had 1.3 million views as of Monday. In a direct message on X, Cernovich defended his post to NBC News, writing: “I didn't accuse him of anything. I asked a question.”

At 12:19 p.m., Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, posted on X about the shootings that “the extreme left” had become “terrifying.” Moreno's office did not respond to a request for comment Monday.

Musk posted about the shootings at 1:11 p.m., writing, “The far left is murderously violent.” His post had more than 52 million views as of Monday. Musk did not respond to a request for comment Monday. 

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted several times about the shooting over the weekend, including three posts in which he blamed it on “Marxism” and one in which he tried to tie it to Walz. Lee's posts sparked a furious response from Democrats, who said he was making jokes about murder, and Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., said Monday that she personally confronted Lee about his “cruel” posts. Lee's office did not respond to a request for comment Monday.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who is from Minnesota, expressed fury at the rumors that spread mostly unchecked on social media.

“The pain that families, loved ones, and community members including myself are experiencing following the brutal attacks on our leaders — and friends — in Minnesota has only been compounded by the rampant disinformation campaign pushed by the far-right and uplifted by cynical politicians who prefer to weaponize a tragedy through shameful lies than call for unity and compassion,” Martin said in a statement. 

“This disgusting rhetoric plays no small part in how we have reached this dangerous political moment in our country, and instead of speaking truth, we have prominent far-right leaders and elected officials playing with matches around the tinderbox,” he said. 

Social media platforms have birthed viral rumors for more than a decade, but in recent years some online platforms have shifted radically away from content moderation and fact-checking while monetarily incentivizing viral posting. After Musk bought Twitter, which he renamed X, the service reinstated many previously banned users, stopped enforcing some rules about hateful content and began sharing revenue with users if they get engagement. This year, Instagram and Facebook's parent company, Meta, stopped fact-checking in the United States. Meta is rolling out a crowdsourced “community notes” system, like a system on X in which users submit their own addenda to other users' posts, which other users then vote on. Use of the system on X has plummeted since the beginning of this year, according to an NBC News analysis. X didn't respond to a request for comment on the conspiracy theories on its app.

Now, the apps are fertile ground for hoaxes and unconfirmed accusations to spread, experts said.

“The design of social media platforms facilitates and even incentivizes this kind of rumoring and political point-scoring in the wake of crisis events,” Kate Starbird, a professor and co-founder at the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington, said in an email.

“Some of the most prominent accounts on X gained their audiences by strategically posting breaking news content with a political angle for clicks and follows,” Starbird said.

Even though federal prosecutors filed a criminal complaint against Boelter, Republicans continued to spread the seemingly false narrative Monday.

Donald Trump Jr. told an interviewer with NewsNation that the Minnesota suspect “seems to be a leftist.” When the interviewer, Connell McShane, said, “He voted for your dad,” Trump didn't budge, responding, “I'll believe that when I see it.”

Experts said conspiracy theories like the ones about Minnesota serve two aims: to make the political opposition appear evil and to pre-empt claims about extremism on your own side.

“These types of conspiracy theories or disinformation campaigns — they serve political interests,” said Jeffrey Blevins, a professor at the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Cincinnati.

“Instead of, ‘Look how radicalized my side of the aisle has become' — oh, no, ‘it's their side of the aisle that is radicalized, and we don't have to deal with this now. It's their fault,'” he said.  

Nathan Walter, an associate professor of communications studies at Northwestern University, said online rumors are especially successful if they're established early in the news cycle, as appeared to happen in Minnesota's news vacuum.

“There's this rush to create the first narrative, and this is really crucial if you want to spread misinformation. And it's not very difficult, because it will always take more time for the real information to come out,” he said.

“Once the narrative takes hold, it's very, very difficult to debunk,” he said.

The actor used to point vaguely to the sky and suggest the government was watching when asked for a photo. Nowadays, that could lead to some very awkward conversations

Sarah Jessica Parker, the Sex and the City star and Booker prize judge, has a nifty trick for getting out of taking selfies with her fans. “I did this for a really, really long time and it worked for ever,” Parker said in an interview with Howard Stern. “I used to say, ‘I can't, because of the government,' and I'd do this,” Parker said, pointing up to the sky. “It really confused people. This was through different administrations, so it wasn't political.”

It is not entirely clear why Parker – who has said she refuses to take selfies and would rather “have a conversation” instead because “it's much more meaningful” – stopped using this brilliant excuse. But one does have to wonder whether it is because the US has become a nation of conspiracy theorists. Rather than backing away from the weird “the government is watching” woman, perhaps fans started to excitedly engage her with theories about how Bill Gates has implanted us all with mind-controlling microchips. Or maybe she just got tired of the joke. I don't know. But I'm sure someone out there (the government) does.

Conspiracy theories have become so mainstream that they are even prompting nonsensical legislation. Earlier this month, Louisiana lawmakers sent a bill to the state's governor seeking to ban “chemtrails” – which don't actually exist. They are a longstanding conspiracy which posits that the white lines sometimes left behind by aircraft aren't just due to condensed water vapour but are far more sinister. Some people believe that the government is spraying toxic metals to reduce populations; others believe they are evidence that dark forces are trying to control the weather or people's minds.

Lawmakers in at least 11 other states are trying to advance similar “chemtrail” bans. “Every bill like this is kind of symbolic, or is introduced to appease a very vocal group, but it can still cause real harm by signalling that these conspiracies deserve this level of legal attention,” a member of the National Association for Media Literacy Education told the Associated Press.

Also causing real harm in the US with his obsession with imaginary problems is health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. The vaccine sceptic recently fired every single member of a critical advisory committee on immunisation practices. He has replaced them with people who reportedly have very little vaccine expertise and are accused of spreading misinformation. The ousted members of the vaccine committee have said that the shake-up may “impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses.”

RFK Jr is also fixated on conspiracy theories about fluoride, which he calls “a dangerous neurotoxin”. There are, to be clear, valid concerns about ingesting too much fluoride, including its effects on IQ as well as potential tooth discoloration. But experts are pretty unanimous that fluoride in drinking water is a great public health achievement that has done wonders for preventing tooth decay. There are worries that RFK Jr's meddling will cause a significant increase in dental cavities, especially among children in lower-income groups.

Anyway, I've got a good idea for Parker. Since acting like a conspiracy theorist no longer seems to ward off unwanted attention, why not try engaging selfie-seeking fans with a rational fact-based discussion? Increasingly large numbers of Americans seem allergic to that; some fans will immediately run a mile. I have some other thoughts too but I'm afraid I can't elaborate any more on this issue for top secret reasons. But here's a hint: it's because of the government.

Microsoft's Aurora AI beat existing systems in predicting weather conditions over a 14-day period in 91% of cases, including hurricanes, sandstorms and ocean swells.

A new artificial intelligence (AI) model can predict major weather events faster and more accurately than some of the world's most widely used forecasting systems.

The model, called Aurora, is trained on more than 1 million hours of global atmospheric data, including weather station readings, satellite images and radar measurements. Scientists at Microsoft say it's likely the largest dataset ever used to train a weather AI model.

Aurora correctly forecast that Typhoon Doksuri would strike the northern Philippines four days before the storm made landfall in July 2023. At the time, official forecasts placed the storm's landfall over Taiwan — several hundred miles away.

It also outperformed standard forecasting tools used by agencies, including the U.S. National Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. It delivered more accurate five-day storm tracks and produced high-resolution forecasts up to 5,000 times faster than conventional weather models powered by supercomputers.

More broadly, Aurora beat existing systems in predicting weather conditions over a 14-day period in 91% of cases, the scientists said. They published their findings May 21 in the journal Nature.

Researchers hope Aurora and models like it could support a new approach to predicting environmental conditions called Earth system forecasting, where a single AI model simulates weather, air quality and ocean conditions together. This could help produce faster and more consistent forecasts, especially in places that lack access to high-end computing or comprehensive monitoring infrastructure.

Aurora belongs to a class of large-scale AI systems known as foundation models — the same category of AI models that power tools like ChatGPT.

Foundation models can be adapted to different tasks because they're designed to learn general patterns and relationships from large volumes of training data, rather than being built for a single, fixed task. In Aurora's case, the model learns to generate forecasts in a matter of seconds by analyzing weather patterns from sources like satellites, radar and weather stations, as well as simulated forecasts, the researchers said.

The model can then be fine-tuned for a wide range of scenarios with relatively little extra data — unlike traditional forecasting models, which are typically built for narrow, task-specific purposes and often need retraining to adapt.

The diverse dataset Aurora is trained on not only results in greater accuracy in general versus conventional methods, but also means the model is better at forecasting extreme events, researchers said.

In one example, Aurora successfully predicted a major sandstorm in Iraq in 2022, despite having limited air quality data. It also outperformed wave simulation models at forecasting ocean swell height and direction in 86% of tests, showing it could extract useful patterns from complex data even when specific inputs were missing or incomplete.

""It's got the potential to have [a] huge impact because people can really fine tune it to whatever task is relevant to them … particularly in countries which are underserved by other weather forecasting capabilities,"" study co-author Megan Stanley, a senior researcher at Microsoft, said in a statement.

Microsoft has made Aurora's code and training data publicly available for research and experimentation. The model has been integrated into services like MSN Weather, which itself is integrated into tools like the Windows Weather app and Microsoft's Bing search results.

A recent satellite photo captured a giant comma-shaped cloud of ""Saharan dust"" being blown above the Atlantic Ocean. The hazy mass hit North America a week later.

Where is it? Mid-Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of West Africa

What's in the photo? A giant, comma-shaped cloud of Saharan dust being blown out to sea

Which satellite took the photo? GOES-19

When was it taken? May 28, 2025

Satellites recently snapped a giant cloud of ""Saharan dust"" blowing out to sea from the world's largest hot desert. The hazy mass later traveled more than 4,000 miles (6,500 kilometers) to North America, where it polluted the skies of Florida and other states.

In the early hours of May 28, 2025, a large cloud of dust and sand began to blow out from the Sahara and over the Atlantic Ocean, according to a statement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Around a week later, on June 4, the cloud made landfall in Florida, with the plume also reaching Louisiana, Texas and other parts of the Gulf Coast. En route, it also briefly filled the skies of several Caribbean nations, including Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.

A photo captured by the GOES-19 satellite, which is co-run by NASA and NOAA, revealed the cloud as it first began its transatlantic journey. At the time, it covered an area of roughly 240,000 square miles (620,000 square km) between Cabo Verde — an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the mid-Atlantic — and the coast of West Africa, including the shorelines of Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau.

The dust cloud was a ""particularly robust, comma-shaped plume,"" representatives from the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University wrote on Bluesky. However, soon after the photo was taken, the cloud dispersed, making it ""appear larger in size.""

Astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS) also captured shots of the plume as it moved across the Atlantic, Live Science's sister site Space.com reported.

In Florida, the plume caused a brief reduction in air quality that may have impacted people with respiratory conditions. The state's skies remained hazy for around 48 hours before the majority of the dust settled — some of which was later visible on windows and cars.

A second, smaller plume reached the U.S. between June 13 and 15.

Saharan dust can have several other surprising effects. ""When it reaches the U.S., it can cause hazy skies as well as vivid sunrises and sunsets as the sun's rays scatter the dust in the atmosphere,"" NOAA representatives wrote. ""It can even suppress thunderstorm development over locations where the dust is especially thick.""

Saharan dust gets whipped up by strong gusts of wind, which occur much more frequently in deserts than other environments, and can reach several miles above Earth's surface, according to the U.K. Met Office. This mainly happens between late spring and early fall.

Once the dust is airborne, it hovers above the desert in a region known as the ""Saharan Air Layer"" — a roughly 2.5-mile-wide (4 km) band of very dry air that forms around 1 mile (1.6 km) above the Sahara desert. Every three to five days, the accumulated dust gets blown out to sea, and if there is enough of it, the particulates form large plumes that can travel across entire oceans, according to NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, which helps monitor the Saharan Air Layer.

Saharan dust plumes of various sizes reach the U.S. every year, usually peaking in intensity between June and August.

One of the most famous examples in recent years was the ""Godzilla"" plume, which hit large parts of the southern U.S. in June 2020. During this two-week-long event, the amount of dust reached the highest levels since satellites began tracking plumes 18 years previously, according to a 2021 study.

Top oil executives are sounding the alarm over the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.

The CEOs of TotalEnergies, Shell, and EnQuest told CNBC on Tuesday that further attacks on critical energy infrastructure could have serious consequences for global supply and prices.

Israel's surprise attack on Iran's military and nuclear infrastructure on Friday has been followed by four days of spiraling warfare between the regional foes. 

Some oil and gas facilities have been hit in both countries in recent days, although key energy infrastructure and crude flows have so far been spared.

The potential for major supply disruption remains a key concern, however, particularly worst-case scenarios such as Iran blocking the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz.

""The last 96 hours have been very concerning … both for the region but more broadly in terms of where the global energy system is going given the uncertainty and the backdrop that we see right now and the geopolitical volatility,"" Shell CEO Wael Sawan told CNBC's JP Ong on Tuesday.

Speaking at the Energy Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Shell's Sawan said the London-listed company has a ""significant footprint"" in the Middle East, both in terms of operated assets and shipments.

""How we navigate over the coming days and weeks, the situation is something that is particularly top of mind for myself, and the leadership team,"" Sawan said.

Oil prices traded higher on Tuesday, extending recent gains.

International benchmark Brent crude futures with August stood at $75.41 per barrel at 4:16 p.m. London time, up around 3%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with July delivery, meanwhile, was last seen up 2.7% at $73.74.

Oil traders see the Israel-Iran conflict as the most significant geopolitical event since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné said the French oil giant's primary concern amid Israel-Iran tensions is the security of its regional employees.

""We are the largest international oil company in the region. We were born 100 years ago in Iraq, and we still have operations in Iraq, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,"" Pouyanné told CNBC on the sidelines of the same event.

Pouyanné said he hoped further strikes would not concern oil installations ""because this could become a real problematic hit, not only in terms of safety and hazards and risks, but also in terms of global markets.""

As Israel and Iran continue to exchange strikes, some shipowners have started to steer clear from the Strait of Hormuz.

The waterway, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, is recognized as one of the world's most important oil chokepoints.

The inability of oil to traverse through the Strait of Hormuz, even temporarily, can ratchet up global energy prices, raise shipping costs and create significant supply delays.

Market watchers remain skeptical that Iran will seek to close the waterway, however, suggesting it might even be physically impossible.

Amjad Bseisu, CEO of U.K.-based EnQuest, described 2025 as ""the year of volatility.""

""It's almost like every day we see something different but obviously this war between Israel and Iran is another step up,"" Bseisu told CNBC on Tuesday.

""The quicker we can come to an end of this terrible conflict, the better for overall markets but I do think that the market is well supplied in the short to medium term,"" he added.

“We need the kind of visionary leadership that Zohran is providing in this campaign,” said Sanders.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) announced his endorsement of Zohran Mamdani in the race for New York City mayor on Tuesday, giving the progressive up-and-comer his backing in an ever-tightening election.

In a statement, Sanders said that New York City voters are being given the choice between the status quo, with billionaires and corporations dominating politics, or a movement that represents everyday people, focused on building momentum against growing “oligarchy, authoritarianism and kleptocracy.”

“The New York City Democratic primary presents a clear choice as to the path forward,” Sanders said. “We need a new politics and new leadership which is prepared to stand up to powerful corporate interests and fight for the working class.”

Mamdani represents a strong choice for this future, Sanders said, citing his “inspirational grassroots campaign” based on progressive policy proposals like affordable housing, public transportation, and groceries. The senator also praised Mamdani's grassroots campaign funding, powered by small donations from individuals — in sharp contrast to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mamdani's main competitor, and the army of billionaires and corporations backing him.

“At this pivotal and dangerous moment in American history, status quo politics is not good enough,” Sanders said. “We need the kind of visionary leadership that Zohran is providing in this campaign. In my view, Zohran Mamdani is the best choice for mayor of New York City.”

Mamdani welcomed the endorsement. “As for so many across this country, [Bernie Sanders] has been the single most influential political figure in my life,” he said. “As Mayor, I will strive to live up to his example by fighting for the working class every day and hopefully, make Brooklyn's own proud.”

The endorsement, from one of the most popular politicians in the U.S., may prove a crucial boost for the Mamdani campaign, just a week from the primary on June 24. Mamdani has also been endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), who has urged voters to rank the Democratic socialist as their first choice in the polls.

Recent polls have shown that the two candidates are neck-and-neck, with Mamdani trailing by just a few percentage points in final rounds of ranked choice voting. This is a major surge for Mamdani over polls from just months ago, when Cuomo had significant double digit leads over Mamdani. 

A rally for Mamdani on Saturday with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew a large crowd, with thousands of supporters packing New York's Terminal 5 cheering, holding signs and banners backing the candidate. 

As Mamdani's campaign has surged, however, corporate news outlets are consolidating their voices against him. Last week, The Atlantic published an article entitled “New York Is Not a Democracy” — a screed against ranked-choice voting, asking, ominously, “Could ranked-choice voting help Zohran Mamdani beat Andrew Cuomo?”

Meanwhile, the New York Times editorial board trotted out familiar arguments against Mamdani's progressive vision in a non-endorsement op-ed this week, which criticized Cuomo but also praised him even as the writers acknowledged the numerous sexual harassment allegations against him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Dozens killed by Israeli fire as they sought desperately needed aid in Gaza, Palestinian health ministry says","https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/17/middleeast/palestinians-killed-seeking-aid-gaza-intl","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 16:16:00 GMT","

Follow:


            At least 51 people were killed and more than 200 others injured by Israeli fire as they waited for aid trucks to arrive in Khan Younis in southern Gaza early Tuesday morning, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
    


            The incident marks the highest reported number of people killed while seeking aid over the past few weeks in the enclave. In total, nearly 400 Palestinians have been killed near aid centers since Israel lifted an 11-week total blockade on Gaza and allowed a trickle of aid to enter, according to the health ministry.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a Tuesday statement that “a gathering was identified adjacent to an aid distribution truck that got stuck in the area of Khan Younis, and in proximity to IDF troops operating in the area.”
    


            The IDF said it was “aware of reports regarding a number of injured individuals from IDF fire following the crowd's approach,” that “details of the incident are under review,” and that it “regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and operates to minimize harm as much as possible to them while maintaining the safety of our troops.”
    


            One eyewitness, Mohammed Abu Abed, said that a group of people was hit by an airstrike. He told CNN: “We were waiting for flour trucks. Suddenly, we were among the people and were hit by two missiles that tore apart people's bodies, remains, pieces of flesh everywhere. I don't know what to say; they killed the people, unarmed people who had nothing on them.”
    


            “They went to bring bread for their children, just bread or flour. They killed us in cold blood,” Abu Abed said.
    


            The IDF told CNN it was “unaware” of an airstrike in that area on Tuesday.
    


            Video from the scene in Khan Younis on Tuesday shows dozens of bodies lying on the ground, covered in blood.
    


            The latest scenes of death, violence and desperation underline a grim existence for over 2.1 million people living in Gaza – which the United Nations has warned is edging closer to famine.
    


            Humanitarian organizations say that aid currently entering the enclave is only a tiny fraction of what is needed, with the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – the main supplier of aid in Gaza – coming under global scrutiny since it opened its distribution points late last month.
    


            Palestinians en route to GHF distribution sites have repeatedly been fired upon since its inception, according to the health ministry, with some 3,000 people injured in addition to the fatalities. On Tuesday, eight people were also killed after coming under Israeli fire near an aid distribution site west of Rafah, the ministry said.
    


            The GHF, an Israeli-US backed private contractor, has been criticized by multiple international aid agencies for setting up its distribution centers amid active combat zones. The organization has repeatedly said there has been no violence at their sites. But the GHF acknowledged earlier this month that there have been Palestinian casualties in the surrounding areas, which the organization described as “well beyond our secure distribution site.” A spokesman referred further questions to the Israeli military.
    


            The IDF has not yet responded to CNN's comment on Tuesday's incident in Rafah.
    


            On Tuesday, Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said on X: “Israel has weaponized food and blocked lifesaving aid. I urge immediate, impartial investigations into deadly attacks on desperate civilians trying to reach food distribution centres.”
    


            One of those killed in Khan Younis on Tuesday was a 20-year-old man, who had traveled there in hope of returning with food for his family.
    


            Speaking through tears, his mother said: “He didn't go for a picnic. He went to bring food for his siblings and father.”
    


            Nearby, at Nasser Medical Complex, hospital staff said that the entire ward was crowded with casualties. Video from the hospital showed dozens of people arriving with wounds, with others inside the hospital waiting for treatment as they laid on the floor.
    


            One intensive care doctor told Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), an aid organization based in the United Kingdom, that the hospital had received on Tuesday “a large number of injured and killed from the Israeli army's targeting of aid distribution points in Khan Younis.”
    


            “The situation here is catastrophic beyond imagination,” the doctor said, adding that the morgue was completely full and that additional bodies had been placed outside the building.
    


            “We are trying our best, but the numbers are overwhelming,” he said.

OpenAI, the developer of the ChatGPT language model, has received a $200 million contract from the US Department of Defense, the Pentagon announced Monday. The company says it is part of a drive to “defend democracy” against rising Chinese competition.

The contract tasks OpenAI with developing “prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains,” according to the announcement. The work is expected to be performed in the National Capital Region, which includes Washington DC, and is scheduled for completion by July 2026.

Though this marks OpenAI's first publicly disclosed agreement with the DoD, the company has previously been involved in national security initiatives. In December, OpenAI partnered with military contractor Anduril Industries to develop artificial intelligence systems for counter-drone operations. At the time, Anduril said the collaboration aimed at applying AI to “rapidly synthesize time-sensitive data, reduce the burden on human operators, and improve situational awareness.”

In January, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined other Silicon Valley executives and President Donald Trump in announcing Project Stargate, a $500 billion investment in US computing infrastructure intended to support future AI development.

That same month, OpenAI introduced a version of ChatGPT tailored specifically for the US government. The company said the software would run on specialized hardware, such as Microsoft Azure's cloud services, allowing government agencies to “manage their own security, privacy, and compliance requirements.”

In late January, Western tech developers and investors were rocked by the introduction of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which claimed its product was superior to ChatGPT in key operational cost metrics. The next month, Altman said at a gathering in Washington that OpenAI was committed to helping the US government safeguard “America's lead in AI” for the sake of protecting “democratic values.”

In April, trade publications reported that OpenAI was developing a new social media platform similar to Elon Musk's X. Musk, once a close Trump ally, has been working to integrate his own AI assistant, Grok, into X.

The billionaire co-founded OpenAI but parted ways with the company in 2018. Musk and Altman are now reportedly engaged in a “bitter rivalry.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","‘If Iran falls, we all lose'","https://www.rt.com/news/619530-if-iran-falls-we-all-lose/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:47:00 GMT","

In his first public address since the beginning of Operation Rising Lion, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to strip Iran of the ability to develop nuclear weapons, eliminate its ballistic missile capabilities, and remove what he called an existential threat to the State of Israel.

“This is a battle for survival,” Netanyahu told reporters in a Zoom press conference on Monday. “We will continue this operation until the Islamic Republic of Iran is no longer a nuclear threat – not to Israel, not to the region, not to the world.”

Netanyahu's bold declaration came as Israeli jets continued a fourth day of coordinated strikes deep into Iranian territory. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), over 370 missiles and hundreds of UAVs have been launched from Iran since Friday, prompting swift Israeli retaliation. The IDF claims to have struck more than 90 strategic targets across Iran, including suspected missile depots, radar installations, and command centers near Tehran, Esfahan, and along the Persian Gulf coast.

The operation has already resulted in more than 200 casualties in Iran, though precise numbers remain unverified due to restricted access for international media. Satellite imagery reviewed by analysts at the Institute for Science and International Security showed significant damage to facilities near Natanz and Parchin, long suspected of being part of Iran's nuclear infrastructure.

But critics of the Israeli campaign – and its justification – are raising serious concerns about the underlying motives of Netanyahu and his allies.

Mohammad Marandi, a prominent Iranian academic and political analyst, and advisor to Iran's nuclear negotiating team, rejects Netanyahu's claims outright.

“The regime is lying about nuclear programs just to justify aggression and murder,” Marandi told RT. “Tulsi Gabbard, who is the Director of US National Intelligence, just recently said Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. So it's clear that the issue is Netanyahu, neat escalation, and the Zionist lobby in the United States is behind him.”

Iran's nuclear program has long been a subject of contention. While Tehran has enriched uranium and developed advanced centrifuge technology, it has consistently denied seeking nuclear weapons. Iranian officials argue that their nuclear program is designed solely for peaceful energy production and medical research – a position grounded, they say, in religious doctrine that prohibits weapons of mass destruction.

To prove its intentions, Iran signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015, an international accord with the United States and European powers that limited uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. However, in 2018, then President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the deal, reigniting tensions. Since then, Tehran has allowed international inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) limited access to its facilities, but Israel remains unconvinced.

According to Marandi, Israel's true objective lies far beyond neutralizing a nuclear threat.

“It's always been so-called regime change,” he said. “Whether it's the Israeli regime or the Americans or the Europeans. That's how they are. They don't want independent countries, and especially countries like Iran, which support the Palestinian cause.”

Marandi is not alone in his assessment. Syrian analyst Taleb Ibrahim, a longtime commentator on Iranian affairs and an author of several books on the Islamic Republic, agrees that Western powers – particularly the United States – are pursuing a broader geopolitical agenda.

“If the United States will put its hands on Iran again [like it was before 1979],” Ibrahim told RT, “they will block the Russian southern wall. This means that Russia will not be able to expand its influence beyond the Caspian Sea. And it will be restricted to a very narrow place between Central Asia and the Arctic.”

Ibrahim warns that China, too, would suffer consequences from a weakened Iran. “China will not be able to reach the Middle East. Because if Iran becomes part of the Western bloc, it will sever China's access. And the most important thing of all – a new world order will emerge. It will be a new American world order.”

Ibrahim believes this is not a regional conflict, but part of a sweeping strategy to restore American hegemony.

“To make America great again is to regain American control across the globe. The war in Iran is just a chapter in that plan.”

President Donald Trump has thus far distanced himself from the Israeli operation, saying that American goals are purely defensive and promising he will not be starting any wars.

But Ibrahim is unconvinced.

“In strategy, if you want to make war, talk about peace,” he said. “The United States is preparing for a very big war – first against China, then Russia. After this, they will try to build an American century. One government for the world, headquartered in the White House. That's the final goal.”

Both Marandi and Ibrahim agree that forced regime change in Iran would unleash chaos across the region.

The fall of Tehran's current government could lead to the fragmentation of Iran – a multi-ethnic nation with Kurds, Azeris, Arabs, and Baloch who may pursue autonomy or independence in the power vacuum. It could ignite sectarian warfare akin to what unfolded in Iraq after the 2003 US invasion, and destabilize fragile neighbors like Iraq, Afghanistan, and even Turkey.

Moreover, Iran's alliances with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and various Shia militias across Iraq and Syria mean that a collapse in Tehran could trigger cascading violence across the Middle East. Global oil markets, already rattled, could see disruptions on a historic scale.

Yet, both experts maintain that such an outcome is unlikely.

“Regime change is more likely in Israel and across Europe than anywhere near Iran,” Marandi said. “These Western governments failed with Russia, failed with China, and they'll fail with Iran too.”

Ibrahim agrees: “It is impossible to make regime change in Iran by force. The Iran-Iraq war was designed to do exactly that – to overthrow the Islamic Republic established by Ayatollah Khomeini. But after eight years of war, billions of dollars, and support from the US, France, and Gulf states, Iran survived – and emerged stronger. The only way to change the regime is through the Iranian people. And right now, the Iranian people are standing with their leaders. They believe they are fighting the Satan – the US, the bigger Satan, and Israel, the smaller one. And that gives them unity and strength.”

As Israel continues its campaign and the international community watches nervously, the implications of the current conflict are far from limited to the Middle East.

“This war,” Ibrahim concluded, “will be the starting point of reshaping the world. If Iran wins – and I believe it will, eventually – the world will shift to a multipolar order. That is the shared vision of Iran, Russia, and China. But if Iran loses, we will all live under an American empire. The White House will rule from Washington to Beijing. This is a decisive battle – not just for Iran, but for the destiny of the world.”

As missiles fly and rhetoric intensifies, what began as a regional standoff may ultimately determine the balance of power in the 21st century.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated as new details emerge.

At least 14 people have been killed and 117 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17.

Ukraine's National Police initially reported 15 dead and 124 injured in the attack, but Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later revised the death toll to 10. The State Emergency Service subsequently updated the figure to 14. 

Klymenko said operational data may change, as body parts found during rescue efforts can sometimes be mistakenly counted as multiple victims.

According to the State Emergency Service, one body has been recovered from the rubble of the nine-story building, and rescue operations are still ongoing.

The almost nine-hour-long attack saw Moscow's forces launch large numbers of kamikaze attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine's capital.

Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported the sounds of drones, missiles, and multiple rounds of explosions throughout the night.

The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia launched 472 aerial weapons overnight, including nearly 280 Shahed-type attack drones and two Kinzhal ballistic missiles. The strike primarily targeted Kyiv.

Ukraine's air defense forces reportedly destroyed 428 air targets, including 239 Shahed drones and 15 Kh-101 cruise missiles. Air defenses also intercepted one Kinzhal missile, while another was reportedly lost from radar tracking.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault ""one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv,"" saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. 

""Such attacks are pure terrorism,"" he said in a statement on social media. ""And the whole world, the U.S., and Europe must finally respond as civilized societies respond to terrorists.""

Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block.

In a video posted on Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said cluster munitions had been found in one area of the city. He later added that June 18 would be an official day of mourning in Kyiv.

Many of the deaths and injuries occurred when a Russian missile hit a nine-storey residential building in the Solomianskyi district, ""completely destroying"" one section, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said.

""I saw the missile because it was low,"" Olena Kushnirova, a 46-year-old  nurse who lives in a neighboring building to the one that was hit, told the Kyiv Independent.

""I grabbed my daughter by the hand and shouted 'run!' It was literally 15 seconds. We ran to the toilet, and then there was a very powerful explosion.""

During the attack on the capital, a 62-year-old U.S. citizen died in the Solomianskyi district in a building across from where medics were assisting the injured, Klitschko reported. Medical personnel confirmed biological death.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a ""massive and brutal strike"" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit.

""Putin does this on purpose... He sends a signal of total disrespect to the United States and other partners who have called for an end to the killing,"" Sybiha said. ""Only strong steps and real pressure on Moscow can prove him wrong.""

A Russian drone also hit a multi-storey building Darnytskyi District.

""At first there was shock,"" Tatiana Bratus, a 50-year-old resident of the building told the Kyiv Independent.

""People started running outside, shouting, some in panic, because the attack wasn't over yet. They said there were still rockets flying. People ran to the bomb shelter.

A kindergarten in the Darnytskyi district was also damaged, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration said. No casualties were reported at the site. 

The upper floors of residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts were also damaged.  

A dormitory at the Kyiv Aviation Institute was hit by drones during the attack, the news outlet Suspilne reported. Drones struck the institute's 10th floor and broke windows on three other floors.

Outside the capital, the attacks also caused damage and injured civilians in Kyiv Oblast towns. At least one woman was injured and multiple homes were damaged, according to the regional administration. 

The Russian strike damaged the production facility of Fahrenheit, a Ukrainian clothing manufacturer that supplies apparel and undergarments for both civilians and the military. The company announced it was forced to cancel all current orders and suspend new ones indefinitely following the destruction of its Kyiv site.

Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) freight train carrying grain. Several railcars overturned, temporarily halting operations and spilling grain from the damaged wagons. Ukrzaliznytsia said the damage would be ""promptly repaired"" and train traffic would not be affected.

Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, reported the destruction of two of its branches in Kyiv during the attack, according to CEO Ihor Smiliansky. The company's team is working to ""quickly restore services,"" he said. 

The attack followed a series of drone strikes overnight on June 16 targeting Kyiv Oblast, including both the capital and surrounding settlements. In the Obukhiv district, a 60-year-old man was injured, according to regional authorities.  

Russian attacks against Ukraine have intensified in May and June, with Moscow launching several record-breaking mass strikes against Kyiv and other cities. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Donald Trump seemed to be in a good mood. 

“It's beautiful. It's so beautiful,” Mr. Trump said Monday as he walked through Kananaskis greenery to shake Prime Minister Mark Carney's hand for the official welcome to the G7 summit. He was wearing a Canada-U.S. pin that, according to the Prime Minister's Office, didn't come from the Canadian hosts. 

It sounded like he was making an effort. Even when he decided to leave a day early to deal with the Middle East, he said he had a “great relationship” with everybody. 

But in this group, he still stuck out like a brightly-coloured cartoon character in a black-and-white photo.

President Donald Trump met Prime Minister Mark Carney on Monday and said that a trade deal with Canada is 'achievable.'

Many of the other leaders came into this summit with diplomatic phrases about addressing the U.S.'s economic concerns, talking about “imbalances,” for example – but stressing the need to keep open trade going. Mr. Trump said, “I'm a tariff person.”

The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy are adamant about backing Ukraine, seeing it as the key to their security since Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion brought war back to Europe. Mr. Trump showed up complaining that they'd kicked Mr. Putin out of the then-G8 in 2014, that Mr. Putin was insulted by it, and that if he hadn't been excluded, there never would have been a war.

Carney accelerates talks with Trump to reach economic-security deal within 30 days

It's hard to overstate just how out of whack Mr. Trump's talk about Mr. Putin is with the zeitgeist of the other six – seven, really, because European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has an uncounted permanent seat at the G7. On Sunday, Ms. Von der Leyen had said Mr. Putin should never have been in the group.

Certainly, in 2025, it's hard to be surprised that Mr. Trump has differences with Western allies. But it's still jarring when they are side-by-side. He has seemed upbeat at the G7 summit in Alberta, but he just approaches everything in a completely different way. 

That made the agreement between Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump to try to complete a potential, undefined deal on trade in the next 30 days sound like smashing a square peg into a round hole. 

“I think we have different concepts. I have a tariff concept. Mark has a different concept, which is something that some people like,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he met Mr. Carney for a one-on-one meeting on Monday. “I'm a tariff person. I've always been a tariff person. It's easy. It's precise.”

“And I think Mark has a more complex idea but also a very good one.” 

There are indeed different concepts. Mr. Trump is for tariffs. Mr. Carney is against them.

Canada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told reporters Monday that having the tariffs lifted is still the Canadian goal in all these talks.

Mr. Carney's complex idea hasn't been shared with the public, but it is not going to be getting Mr. Trump to suddenly agree tariffs are a bad idea. It will have to give Mr. Trump something he wants. 

For G7 leaders, immense global challenges weigh on agenda overshadowed by Trump

Former prime minister Justin Trudeau developed a border-policing package when Mr. Trump invoked fentanyl smuggling to impose one set of tariffs. Mr. Carney just increased defence spending and has raised a number of other issues, such as developing critical minerals, that might be points of negotiation. The U.S. wants to see Canada scrap its digital service tax.

But those things won't be the basis of a comprehensive trade agreement. They're more likely to be elements of a slim framework agreement that Mr. Carney might offer in return for a suspension of current tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos – a first-phase truce until a broader agreement is negotiated.

Deals are, after all, what Mr. Trump wants now. He promised countries around the world would be begging to make a deal to get relief from his tariffs. So far, he has struck a limited deal with Britain – finalized Monday – that lifts tariffs on British steel but retains a 10-per-cent tariff on many other British goods.

Perhaps Mr. Carney's complex concept will be enough to get Mr. Trump to make a first-phase deal soon. But Mr. Trump is still a tariff person. When it comes time to negotiate broader trade agreements, he will want some level of tariffs to apply to Canada.

“The new definition of free trade is a free-trade agreement with a tariff,” said Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada.

That's still the nature of dealing with Mr. Trump. He approaches things in an entirely different way from the other leaders of the Western world – even when he's smiling.

The Sûreté du Québec has appealed for the public's help as it searches for Claire Bell, 3, in several locations around Montreal.Supplied

Quebec police continued their search on Tuesday west of Montreal for a missing three-year-old girl after her mother was charged with child abandonment.

Rachel-Ella Todd, 34, has been charged with one count of unlawful abandonment of a child. Claire Bell, 3, was last seen Sunday morning in Montreal's LaSalle borough, and was reported missing at around 3 p.m. that day in Coteau-du-Lac, Que., about 50 kilometres to the west.

Ms. Todd appeared briefly in court by video conference on Tuesday morning and is scheduled to return in person on Wednesday in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Que., west of Montreal. According to the charging document, the alleged offence is to have taken place on Sunday in Quebec or Ontario.

Wearing a maroon T-shirt and wrapped in a grey blanket, the accused appeared from a provincial police station in Vaudreuil, Que. Ms. Todd didn't speak as a court-appointed attorney asked Quebec court Judge Bertrand St-Arnaud to scheduled the next court date on Wednesday. The accused does not have a criminal record.

Outside the courtroom, Crown prosecutor Lili Prévost-Gravel said, “the investigation is ongoing,” adding that the Crown opposes bail due to the gravity of the alleged crime. Ms. Todd will be taken to Leclerc detention centre for women in Laval, Que., Ms. Prévost-Gravel said.

Meanwhile, police searched on Tuesday for the child in several locations in the Montérégie region, including the Coteau-du-Lac area and near Highway 30 in nearby Vaudreuil-Dorion, where a dog that may have belonged to the girl was found on Monday.

Provincial police spokesman Jean-Raphaël Drolet said in a social media video that searchers were going to focus on the Vaudreuil-Dorion area, located about 35 kilometres from the boundary with Ontario. Police have been looking for the girl since Sunday.

“It's possible there are other areas that will be searched as well,” Mr. Drolet said. “We will move based on the information we have.”

Police released a video of Ms. Todd's 2007 grey Ford Escape with Quebec licence plate K50 FVE and a 'Baby on Board' sticker on the right passenger side corner of the back window. They asked anyone who might have spotted the vehicle between 9:45 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Sunday to come forward.

Provincial police say Claire Bell is three feet tall, has brown hair and brown eyes and was last seen wearing a white long-sleeve shirt with a pink collar, grey pants, and no shoes. Anyone who sees the girl or has information about her whereabouts is asked to contact police.

Two oil tankers collided in the Strait of Hormuz, an important shipping gateway in the Gulf of Oman. British maritime security firm Ambrey said  the incident wasn't security related.

The crew from an oil tanker was rescued on Tuesday following a collision involving two such vessels near the Strait of Hormuz.

The United Arab Emirates National Guard said the evacuation took place on Tuesday after the crude oil tanker, Adalynn, struck another ship — understood to be the Front Eagle oil tanker — managed by the Anglo Eastern shipping firm which is headquartered in Hong Kong.

The Adalynn was bound for Egypt's Suez Canal at the time of the incident in the Gulf of Oman.

""The ship's crew was evacuated from the incident site, located 24 nautical miles off the country's coast, to the Port of Khor Fakkan using search and rescue boats,"" the Emirati National Guard said in a post on X. 

British maritime security firm Ambrey said the cause of an incident, 22 nautical miles east of Khor Fakkan, was not security-related.

Shipping company Frontline said its oil tanker Front Eagle had been involved in a collision and described the event as a navigational incident that was not related to the ongoing regional conflict between Israel and Iran.

""Following the incident immediate action was taken to extinguish a fire on deck of the Front Eagle. We are aware of reports of a fire onboard the Adalynn following the collision,""  a Frontline statement said.

The company went on to say that it was ""closely monitoring the situation and is cooperating fully with the relevant authorities as emergency response efforts continue.""

The strait is a vital maritime entry point to the Persian Gulf, accounting for the passage of around a fifth of the world's oil, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

Since the escalation in hostilities between Israel and Iran, there has been growing concern the waterway could be blocked.

On Friday, the Financial Times reported that Frontline would turn down new contracts to sail into the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz due to the deteriorating situation in the region.

US spies have assessed that Iran has not been pursuing a nuclear weapon for over 20 years.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he doesn't care that his own Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has said that according to the assessment of U.S. intelligence sources, Iran has not been pursuing the development of a nuclear weapon for over two decades — an assessment that undercuts the U.S. and Israel's stated reason for the current attack on Iran.

In March, Gabbard testified that U.S. spy agencies “continu[e] to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon.” She added that “Supreme Leader [Ayatollah Ali] Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.”

However, in an eerie echo of the U.S. propaganda around the Iraq War, on Tuesday, Trump outright dismissed his own government's assessments of Iran's nuclear capabilities. The statement is seemingly made in service of his quest to continue fueling Israel's aggression and ramp up the campaign to pressure Iran to capitulate in talks for a nuclear deal, like the deal Trump himself withdrew from during his first term. 

“I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having one,” Trump said. 

This is, at best, a complete mischaracterization of what intelligence assessments have said and is designed to stoke further violence. 

Officials have found that not only is Iran not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it is also up to three years away from creating a functional one, per CNN. However, that has not stopped U.S. and Israeli officials, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, from warning that Iran is just months away from a nuclear weapon — which they have done for decades now to push for a war with Iran.

In fact, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the U.S. was also unconvinced when Israeli officials, as a justification for the war, recently provided the U.S. with its own supposed intelligence that Iran is conducting research related to building a nuclear bomb.

Trump's dismissal of Gabbard's statements undercuts the idea that the core purpose of Israel's current aggression against Iran is to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, as Netanyahu has dubiously claimed. Notably, Israel is the only country in the Middle East to actually possess nuclear weapons. 

In posts on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump further dispensed with the pretense of negotiations with Iran.

“UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” he posted, shortly after sending another post where he outright threatened to assassinate Khomeini if Iran doesn't capitulate to the U.S.'s demands.

“We don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin,” he said.

Analysts like Iranian writer Trita Parsi have said that the Trump administration's demands in nuclear deal negotiations have always been about laying the groundwork for war. Last month, Parsi pointed out that the U.S.'s demand that Iran completely stop enriching uranium is “unrealistic” and a “fantasy” that, ironically, only allows Iran to take more steps toward obtaining a nuclear weapon in the absence of a deal.

“Over the past two decades, the persistent demand for zero enrichment — an unachievable goal — has only resulted in a larger and more advanced Iranian nuclear program by postponing realistic, enforceable limits on enrichment,” Parsi wrote.

Trump and Netanyahu's fear mongering over Iran's nuclear capabilities is heavily reminiscent of the Bush administration's now infamous lie about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction as a pretense for the U.S.'s disastrous invasion of Iraq.

Nearly 447,000 US kids under 3 were unhoused at last count. Trump's budget bill threatens to make that number skyrocket.

Homelessness among newborns, infants, and toddlers skyrocketed from 2022 to 2023, impacting 446,996 newborns, infants, and toddlers, according to a new report.

SchoolHouse Connection, in partnership with Poverty Solutions at the University of Michigan, found a 23 percent increase in the number of unhoused children under the age of 3 since 2021. Their situations were varied. The report, “Infant and Toddler Homelessness Across 50 States: 2022-2023,” found that some families were staying in temporary shelters or short-term transitional housing, while others were living doubled up with friends or family, camping, or sleeping in cars, abandoned buildings, or bus or train stations.

But as horrendous as these numbers are, unhoused people and their advocates fear that if Donald Trump's big, brutal budget bill gets Senate approval, the situation for unhoused families and those teetering on the edge of economic precarity will soon get significantly worse.

Senior director of Strategic Initiatives and Partnerships at SchoolHouse Connection, Erin Patterson, was one of the authors of the report. She told Truthout that several factors contributed to the 2022-23 spike in unhoused children. “The reason for the increase is no mystery given the lack of affordable housing throughout the country,” Patterson said. “Add in the expiration of the COVID eviction moratorium and the lasting impact of the virus, and a perfect storm of factors impacting low-income families with young children unfolded.”

That perfect storm can have dire consequences.

“Between birth and the age of 3, a child's brain develops faster than at any other time in life,” the report states. “Tragically, an increasing number of infants and toddlers move through these critical years without a safe and stable home, an experience that jeopardizes their healthy development and future.”

Moreover, when pregnancy and homelessness intersect, prenatal care can become inaccessible. According to the National League of Cities, a lack of transportation to see health care providers, coupled with overt and covert discrimination against the unhoused, can mean that treatable pregnancy complications go unnoticed. Unsurprisingly, this increases the odds of preterm deliveries, lower newborn birth weights, and more frequent hospitalizations in neonatal intensive care units. Pervasive respiratory infections and asthma, frequent fevers, learning disabilities, and developmental delays are also commonly diagnosed as babies become toddlers.

“Any period of homelessness can have negative health impacts on fetuses and children,” the Loma Linda University Institute for Health Policy and Leadership warns.

In addition, being unhoused can exact an emotional toll.

Carol L. Hornbeck is a Minnesota-based family therapist who frequently works with people experiencing homelessness. “Babies need routines,” she told Truthout. “These are hard to establish when a family does not have a permanent home. The lack of routine, the lack of structure, causes anxiety. Babies pick up the anxiety of the adults who are caring for them.”

This disquiet, she explains, can become apparent when a child begins school or preschool. “It's hard for unhoused kids to pay attention, concentrate, and receive new information when they're anxious,” she said. What's more, Hornbeck says that children experiencing homelessness are often diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. “They usually don't have it,” she said. “What they have is hypervigilance due to fear and worry.”

This can also be expressed outside of school. “Kids who've been unhoused come into a new place and immediately look around to see if any food is available,” she said. “The first thing I notice when I meet these kids for the first time is that they quickly check out their surroundings to see if they're safe and if they'll find something to eat if they get hungry.”

Diane Nilan, president and founder of HEAR US, Inc: Giving Voice and Visibility to Homeless Children and Youth, agrees with Hornbeck and adds that the long-term impact of being unhoused as a child can last into adulthood. “People I met in a shelter I worked in 30 or 40 years ago are now showing the aftereffects of the trauma they experienced decades ago as kids,” she told Truthout. “The trauma of instability, of having no place to stay, and of being raised by parents who were constantly worried about where they'd sleep and what they'd eat can cause fears that never go away. This can cause physical and mental health problems later in life.”

Alice Jeffrey, a once-unhoused mother who is now living in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, hopes to avoid this outcome.

Although Jeffrey's daughter, Harmony, was taken by child protective services when she was days old in May 2022, the pair are now reunited and are doing well. In fact, Jeffery has become something of a model for other unhoused women and recovering drug users. Now 38, Jeffrey was appointed to the Parent Partnership Board of the Oklahoma Commission on Children and Youth earlier this year and is attending Oklahoma State University to pursue a degree in substance abuse counseling. But despite these achievements, she's found the experience of homelessness hard to shake off and describes being homeless while pregnant and in recovery from meth use, as “dehumanizing.”

“Not having a bathroom of your own when you're pregnant is awful,” she told Truthout. “You want to take a bath. You want privacy to deal with what is happening to your body, and it does not exist.”

Jeffrey says that she got clean while pregnant, but the fact that she was living in a van with someone who was still using led to Harmony's removal. “I thought that since I was clean and the baby was born clean, it would be OK, but apparently, this was not enough, so Harmony was placed. At the time, I was broken, hurt, but I got lucky. Harmony was given to an amazing family. They sent me photos of her every single day. At first, I had to submit to supervised visitations, but I slowly got myself together, stayed clean, and five months after Harmony was born, she was returned to me.”

That this story has a happy ending is heartening; nonetheless, Jeffrey says that Harmony's removal still bothers her. That said, she told Truthout that she is grateful to have an ongoing and loving relationship with Harmony's foster siblings and parents. “We go to church with them and have Sunday dinner together every week,” she said. “I thank the Lord every moment or every day for these people because so far, Harmony seems to be doing fine. I believe this is because the foster family and I bridged, but there is always a huge risk of trauma manifesting later.”

But Jeffrey is not letting her fears stop her and says that she is stoked to speak about what she's been through. “Telling my story gives my life meaning,” she said. “If I can be brave, if I can be vulnerable and put a face to homelessness and addiction, I want to do it.” Jeffrey also wants to promote a “co-parenting model” like the one she and Harmony's foster family have developed. At the same time, she is paying close attention to the news and worrying that looming budget cuts will undermine the already tattered social safety net that has allowed her to return to school and receive public benefits.

The stakes have rarely been higher.

“Children Under Attack: How Congressional Assaults on Health and Food Programs are Endangering the Youngest Americans,” a report compiled by First Focus on Children, the AFL-CIO, and UnidosUS lays out the scope of the proposed retrenchment for the 33.8 million children under 18 who rely on Medicaid, SNAP, or both for food and medical care. Trump's budget is poised to boot millions off both programs, decimate clean energy efforts, slash federal spending on housing and child care assistance, defund climate resiliency work, eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood and other health centers, and eviscerating public pre-K to college education programs — all while simultaneously hiking the budgets of the Pentagon, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Patrol, and increasing the domestic surveillance and prosecution of dissent. The resulting “savings” will provide a 10-year $3.8 trillion tax cut to those earning $800,000 or more annually.

What's more, approximately 11 million people — about a quarter of those who rely on SNAP to eat, including 4 million kids, and 500,000 adults aged 65 or older or living with a disability — will lose some or all of their food assistance.

Patricia Cole, a senior policy officer at Zero to Three, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group that focuses on the early childhood needs of infants, toddlers, and their families, told Truthout that the budgetary threat has put advocacy organizations into “defensive mode since the threats are coming from every direction.”

Along with other advocates, Zero to Three is “raising up” impacted individuals and encouraging them to tell their elected officials about the importance of Medicaid, SNAP, the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, Head Start, and other safety net entitlements in their lives. “Congress members and this administration seem to have a lack of identification with, and understanding of, what the vast majority of families' lives are like,” Cole said. “There seems to be the idea that the government has no responsibility for supporting families. Instead, Congress seems hellbent on cutting spending, advancing defense, and reducing immigration. But even if they wipe out every social safety net program, it will not wipe out the national debt. It will, however, leave families with infants and toddlers who live at or under 200 percent of the federal poverty line, in dire straits.”

Unions and anti-poverty, child welfare, education and legal advocates — as well as impacted people like Alice Jeffrey — are working overtime to push back on the House-approved budget as the reconciliation process takes shape. Some are also urging states to pick up the slack if federal cutbacks are enacted.

The need is obvious.

“The reality of unhoused families bouncing between shitty hotels, cars, and couches is horrific,” Diane Nilan told Truthout. “As a society, we tend to ignore kids who are suffering, and any attention that goes to the unhoused tends to focus exclusively on adults. We seem to forget that children grow up. If Trump's budget is passed, it will destroy the shred of a safety net that now exists. We're looking at overt cruelty.”

 Robert A. Pape

Over the past week, Israel has engaged in a protracted air campaign in Iran to achieve something no other country has ever done before: topple a government and eliminate its major military capability using airpower alone. Israel's attempt to achieve these highly ambitious goals with an air campaign and sophisticated intelligence networks, but without the deployment of a ground army, has no modern precedent. The United States never succeeded in achieving such goals just through airstrikes during the massive strategic bombing campaigns of World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the wars in the Balkans, or the Iraq war. Nor did the Soviet Union and Russia in Afghanistan, Chechnya, or Ukraine. And Israel itself has never attempted such a campaign in previous conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, or even in its most recent operation in Gaza.

Israel, the strongest military power in the Middle East, has scored numerous tactical successes using precision airpower and exquisite intelligence since Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023. The Israel Defense Forces have assassinated senior leaders in Iran's proxy organizations, including much of Hezbollah's mid- and high-level leadership. In a previous exchange of missile fire in April, the IDF destroyed a variety of Iran's air defenses and missile capabilities. And its most recent attacks on Iran have killed senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leaders, destroyed important regime communication systems, damaged important economic targets, and degraded some of Iran's nuclear program.

But even as it continues to score individual victories, Israel appears to be falling into the “smart-bomb trap,” in which overconfidence in precision weapons and intelligence not only allows the country's leaders to believe that they can stop an Iranian nuclear breakout and even topple the regime of the Islamic Republic but also leaves Israel less secure than before. Airpower, no matter how targeted and intense, is not certain to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in its entirety, nor will it clear a path for regime change in Tehran. In fact, if the historical record is any indication, Israel's overconfidence in what its technologically advanced weapons can do is likely to harden Iran's resolve and produce the opposite of its intended results: a more dangerous Iran, now armed with nuclear weapons. Without a ground invasion (highly improbable) or direct U.S. support (which the Trump administration may be wary to provide), Israel's military successes in Iran and beyond could very well be short-lived.

Israel's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities are motivated not by the fear that Iran is capable of assembling a nuclear weapon—in 2025, Iran can certainly master the 80-year-old technology used for building crude nuclear weapons such as those the United States dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki—but rather that Iran may already be on the verge of acquiring the crucial fissile material for the weapon. Iran can develop this material in two ways: enriching uranium ore to achieve the purity of isotopes necessary for bomb grade, at Iran's uranium ore mines, uranium gasification plant at Estefan, and enrichment facilities at Fordow and Natanz (which was somewhat damaged by Israeli strikes); and stripping off the plutonium that is a natural byproduct of any nuclear reactor, such as Iran's operational reactor at Bushehr.

Israel faces three impediments to knocking out these facilities altogether. First, much of Iran's nuclear program, including its uranium enrichment facilities, is buried deep underground. The well-developed facility at Fordow is burrowed hundreds of feet under a mountain, and a new underground facility at Natanz, at depths similar to Fordow, has been under construction for several years. Thus far, Israel has not targeted Fordow at all and has limited its attacks on Natanz to its power generation facilities rather than attempting to destroy the centrifuges and stockpiles of enriched uranium buried 75 feet under the surface. No available evidence suggests that Israel has the airpower payload capacity to carry the 30,000-pound large earth-penetrating bombs developed by the United States that would be necessary to carry out an attack to totally destroy Fordow. The fact that it has not already attempted to attack the shallower underground chambers at Natanz suggests it faces constraints, either from the United States or from its own limited firepower, against even these more vulnerable facilities. Israeli military leaders seem to acknowledge the fact that a decisive operation against Fordow would be impossible without U.S. support: former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant stressed that the United States has “an obligation” to join Israel's military campaign against Iran's nuclear program.

What if the United States, with its bunker-busting bombs, joins the attack? Could Israel actually knock out Iran's weapons program with such support? Even if President Donald Trump were to take up Gallant's request to bomb Fordow, and even if the United States' large bunker-buster bombs could burrow all the way into Fordow's most deeply buried chambers, the United States and Israel would still face more challenges to eliminating Iran's ability to acquire nuclear weapons. There would be no “mission accomplished” moment in which both countries could conclude with absolute confidence that Iran could not proceed covertly. If anything, a U.S.-assisted attack on Iranian facilities would only put the United States directly in Iran's nuclear cross hairs rather than solve the problem for good.

Second, aside from Iran's enrichment facilities, the Bushehr reactor, which is approximately 11 miles southeast of the city of Bushehr, presents a significant challenge. The reactor can be modified to generate plutonium that could be used for nuclear weapons. This risk cannot be eliminated as long as the reactor exists. But if Israel were to destroy the Bushehr reactor, it could risk the release of a Chernobyl-like radiological plume over the city, which is home to roughly 200,000 people, as well as over population centers across the Persian Gulf. It would also invite Iranian ballistic missile retaliation against Israel's nuclear reactor complex at Dimona.

Last, and most important, even following extensive airstrikes against the nuclear facilities, significant uncertainty about the condition of surviving elements and their ability to be reconstituted would remain. Without onsite inspections, Israel would not be able to conduct reliable assessments of the damage done to Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities and existing stocks of enriched uranium. Iran is not likely to allow international inspectors, much less U.S. or Israeli teams, to assess the exact degree of damage to its enriched uranium stocks, determine whether usable equipment or material has been removed before or after strikes, or pinpoint the manufacturing locations for the components for Iran's significant domestic centrifuge production. Commando teams could attempt onsite reconnaissance but would face obvious risks of attack by Iranian forces. This lack of knowledge means that Israel—even with the United States' help—would never be confident that Iran no longer has a path to the bomb. Concerns about Iran nuclearizing in secret would fester, mirroring the fears that drove the United States in 2003 to launch a ground war to conquer Iraq in search of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction.

The statistics available on Iran's enriched uranium stockpile make clear the impossibility of Israel's stated goal of completely and permanently dismantling the nuclear program. Even if one assumes that Israeli strikes have effectively destroyed all the enriched material at Natanz, Iran's 60 percent enriched stockpile remains at Fordow. According to an International Atomic Energy Agency report from May, that stockpile stands at 408 kilograms, up from 275 kilograms in February—enough material to produce ten nuclear weapons after a few weeks of further enrichment (40 kilograms are needed for one weapon). Unless airstrikes could guarantee that a strike would destroy over 90 percent of all of the 60 percent enriched uranium at Fordow—a daunting task even if the United States were to join the mission—Iran would have remaining fissile material for at least one and possibly more nuclear bombs, to say nothing of the 276 kilogram supply of 20 percent enriched uranium, which would be enough for two additional bombs.

Because Iran has been increasing its rate of uranium enrichment so dramatically, to completely prevent the possibility of reconstitution of the nuclear program, Israel would also need to knock out a substantial portion of its centrifuges, as well as centrifuge manufacturing facilities, the locations of which have never been disclosed. And as Iran scrambles to hide its remaining capabilities, Israeli intelligence will be left to rely on loose estimates that will only grow more uncertain over time, at the precise moment that Iran has every incentive to refit its still-standing facilities in a desperate bid to speedily develop a weapon. 

The tactical limitations preventing Israel from completely eliminating Iran's nuclear weapons capacity likely explain why Israel wants to induce regime change. If military strikes are unlikely to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons capability, replacing Iran's regime with a new government would seem like an attractive solution to Israel's strategic conundrum. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indeed suggested that Israel's bombing campaign has left the Iranian regime perilously “weak” and susceptible to a popular revolt.

But regime change is an overambitious goal. Such a gambit would demand not just the decapitation of Iran's entire senior leadership and the removal of hard-liners throughout the operational areas of the administrative government; it would require the installation of a friendly government willing to abandon the remnants of Iran's existing nuclear program and guarantee that it would never pursue nuclear weapons in the future. Put differently, Israel would need to achieve a version of what the United States and the United Kingdom achieved when they inspired a military coup in 1953 to topple the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mohammad Mosaddegh, and replaced him with the Western-backed puppet regime of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

But unlike the United States and Britain during Mosaddegh's overthrow or in other successfully orchestrated foreign-sponsored coups, Israel would be attempting to use airpower as the main tool through which it would overthrow the existing regime rather than a local group of Iranian military or civilian leaders. That strategy would likely stir great opposition to foreign military intervention without seriously dislodging the government of the Islamic Republic.

Airpower, even when paired with intelligence networks, has never toppled a government. Since the dawn of strategic bombing doctrines in World War I, early airpower theorists were captivated by the idea that, if organized correctly, bombing campaigns could encourage populations to revolt against their own governments. Since then, militaries have attempted a wide variety of schemes, including the intense bombing of cities to compel civilians to rise up and demand that their government make whatever concessions necessary to halt the assault. In over 40 instances of strategic bombing from World War I to the first Gulf War in 1991, such barrages, whether concentrated and heavy or light and dispersed, never compelled civilians to take to the streets in any meaningful numbers to oppose their governments.



The invention of precision weaponry over 30 years ago has not changed this fact. Even with highly accurate “smart bombs,” killing leaders from the air often depends as much on luck as on accuracy and intelligence. In 1986, the United States attempted the first precision decapitation, targeting Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi. The strike hit Qaddafi's tent, but not before he had stepped out. Qaddafi claimed that his daughter was killed, leading to Libya's revenge bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, which killed hundreds of civilians. The United States unsuccessfully tried to kill Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with precision airstrikes in 1991, 1998, and 2003, each time hoping superior intelligence would do the trick. Only the U.S. ground invasion ended Saddam's reign.

Even when airpower does kill a leader, the outcome is rarely straightforward. In 1996, Russia killed the Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev with antiradiation missiles after pinpointing Dudayev's phone signal during a call with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. A new, more radical leader soon took over, kicking Russian forces out of Chechnya and precipitating a brutal ground war to restore pro-Moscow rule in the region three years later. Airpower has successfully led to regime change during the precision age only when it is employed alongside local ground forces in a “hammer and anvil” model, as the United States did to topple the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001 and Qaddafi in 2011. Unlike the United States in Afghanistan and Libya, however, Israel does not appear to be willing or able to conduct the kind of major ground operations in Iran that could bring about the collapse of the Iranian regime.

Finally, the biggest stumbling block to installing friendly governments is popular sentiment, or nationalism, in the targeted country. Nationalism tends to grow rapidly when local populations are confronted by the prospect of rule by foreigners and especially rule as the object of a foreign military intervention. It is the principal reason that the United States' efforts to install ostensibly democratic regimes in Iraq and Afghanistan were met with terrorism—and why Israel's current military conquest of Gaza has faced similar difficulties. Airstrikes targeting local leaders only exacerbate this tendency. Local dissatisfaction with leadership, however intense, does not mean a population wants to be governed, directly or indirectly, by a foreign master willing to kill any leader with whom they disagree. Israel might have learned from its own experience to this effect: every time it has decapitated a terrorist leader, their successor has never been friendlier to the Israeli government. Iran would be no exception.

Israeli airpower cannot decisively knock out Iran's nuclear program; Iran could reassemble its program from the remnants covertly, with even less Western oversight and intelligence about weapons development. If Israel had a plan to launch a military coup against the Iranian government, it likely would already have pursued it. Without U.S. intervention on Israel's behalf, Israel will be alone, with no good options, facing a more dangerous Iran than it ever has. As the situation stands now, the conflict is escalating into a “war of the cities” between Tel Aviv and Tehran, as Israel and Iran assail densely populated urban areas. As civilian casualties mount, both countries are likely to grow more defiant, with increasingly disastrous consequences.

The Trump administration, for its part, has emboldened Israel in its war in Gaza and threatened military strikes of its own against Iran in the lead-up to nuclear negotiations, which now seem to be entirely off the table. More than 20 years after launching its own preemptive war in Iraq, the United States may yet join Israel's in Iran.

But U.S. intervention is not inevitable. If Iran acts with restraint, Trump may be persuaded not to join what could become another forever war. It took the 9/11 attacks to motivate Washington to wage a preventive war against Iraq. In the absence of a major provocation, few U.S. leaders, especially one as image conscious as Trump, would relish another such misadventure. In that case, Israel would remain on its own to face the possibility of Iranian covert nuclear acquisition. Ultimately, there may be no way for Israel to escape its smart-bomb delusion—or another quagmire in the Middle East.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Investigators in India are studying the black boxes of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner after recovering them from the aircraft wreckage to ascertain the cause of last week's plane crash that left at least 270 people dead.

The black boxes will provide cockpit conversations and data related to the plane's engine and control settings to investigators and help them in determining the cause of the crash.

The London-bound Air India aircraft, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, crashed on a medical college hostel soon after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad. Only one passenger survived the crash, while 241 people on board and 29 on the ground were killed in one of India's worst aviation disaster in decades.

Experts from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau are probing the crash with assistance from the U.K., the U.S. and officials from Boeing.

Amit Singh, a former pilot and an aviation expert, said the recovery of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, or black boxes, are crucial to piece together the sequence of events.

The cockpit voice recorder records pilots' conversation, emergency alarms and any distress signal made before a crash. The plane's digital flight data recorder stores information related to engine and control settings. Both devices are designed to survive a crash.

“The data will reveal everything,” Singh said, adding that the technical details could be corroborated by the cockpit voice recorder that would help investigators know of any communication between air traffic control and the pilots.

India's aviation regulatory body has said the aircraft made a mayday call before the crash.




Singh said the investigating authorities will scan CCTV footage of the nearby area and speak with witnesses to get to the root cause of the crash.

Additionally, Singh said, the investigators will also study the pilot training records, total load of the aircraft, thrust issues related to the plane's engine, as well as its worthiness in terms of past performances and any previously reported issues.

Aurobindo Handa, former director general of India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, said the investigators across the world follow a standard UN-prescribed Manual of Accident Investigation, also called “DOC 9756,” which outlines detailed procedures to arrive at the most probable cause of a crash. 

Handa said the investigation into last week's crash would likely be a long process as the aircraft was badly charred. He added that ascertaining the condition of the black boxes recovered from the crash site was vital as the heat generated from the crash could be possibly higher than the bearable threshold of the device.

The Indian government has set up a separate, high-level committee to examine the causes leading to the crash and formulate procedures to prevent and handle aircraft emergencies in the future. The committee is expected to file a preliminary report within three months.

Authorities have also begun inspecting and carrying out additional maintenance and checks of Air India's entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners to prevent any future incident. Air India has 33 Dreamliners in its fleet.

The plane that crashed was 12 years old. Boeing planes have been plagued by safety issues on other types of aircraft. There are currently around 1,200 of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft worldwide and this was the first deadly crash in 16 years of operation, according to experts.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was looking for something “better than a ceasefire” in the escalating Iran-Israel conflict. Asked by a reporter aboard Air Force One what specifically he hoped to achieve, Trump responded: “An end. A real end. Not a ceasefire. An end.”

Long lines could be seen at gas stations, and traffic stood bumper to bumper on roads heading out of the city. Many people appeared to be heading to the Caspian Sea area, with local reports suggesting there were some diversions.

Smoke could be seen over the Tel Aviv skyline on Tuesday, amid reports of more Iranian strikes.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel claimed Tuesday to have killed a top Iranian general as it traded more strikes with its longtime foe, and U.S. President Donald Trump warned residents of Tehran to evacuate while demanding that Iran surrender without conditions.

Trump left the Group of Seven summit in Canada a day early to deal with the conflict between Israel and Iran, telling reporters on Air Force One during the flight back to Washington: “I'm not looking at a ceasefire. We're looking at better than a ceasefire.”

When asked to explain, he said the U.S. wanted to see “a real end” to the conflict that could involve Iran “giving up entirely.” He added: “I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.”

Later, he warned Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that the U.S. knows where he is hiding and called for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.”

Iran offered no immediate response to the president's posts, but the country's military leaders vowed that Israel would soon see more attacks.

“The operations carried out so far have been solely for the purpose of warning and deterrence,” Gen. Abdul Rahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said in a video. “The punishment operation will be carried out soon.”

Trump's hard line added to the uncertainty roiling the region on the fifth day of Israel's air campaign aimed at Iran's military and nuclear program. Residents of Tehran fled their homes in droves, and the U.N. nuclear watchdog for the first time said Israeli strikes on Iran's main uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz had also damaged its main underground section, not just an above-ground facility, as previously acknowledged.




Israel says its sweeping assault is necessary to prevent its adversary from getting any closer to building an atomic weapon. The strikes have killed at least 224 people in Iran.

Iran has retaliated by launching some 400 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel.



The Israeli military claimed to have killed another top Iranian general in a strike on Tehran.

Iran did not immediately comment on the reported killing of Gen. Ali Shadmani, whom Israel described as the most senior military commander in Iran.

Shadmani was little-known in the country before being appointed last week to a chief-of-staff-like role as head of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters. That appointment followed the killing of his predecessor, Gen. Gholam Ali Rashid, in an Israeli strike.

The Israeli military warned the population to stay close to shelters as Iran fired new salvos of missiles, but officials said most were intercepted. Sirens blared in southern Israel, including in the desert town of Dimona, the heart of Israel's never-acknowledged nuclear arms program.

Iran has fired fewer missiles in each of its barrages, with just a handful launched late Tuesday. It has not explained the drop in missiles fired, but the decline comes after Israel targeted many Iranian launchers.

Israeli military spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin announced a new wave of strikes on Iran on Tuesday evening as explosions and anti-aircraft fire boomed throughout Tehran, shaking buildings across the capital. The Israeli military said its warplanes had targeted 12 missile launch sites and storage facilities.

Echoing an earlier Israeli military call for some 330,000 residents of a neighborhood in downtown Tehran to evacuate, Trump warned on social media that “everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran.”

Tehran is one of the largest cities in the Middle East, with around 10 million people, roughly equivalent to the entire population of Israel. People have been fleeing since hostilities began.

Asked why he had urged the evacuation of Tehran, Trump said: “I just want people to be safe.”

Downtown Tehran emptied out early Tuesday, with many shops shuttered, even the ancient Grand Bazaar, which has closed only in times of crisis, such as during the 2022 anti-government protests and the coronavirus pandemic.

On the roads out of Tehran to the west, traffic stood bumper to bumper. Many middle- and upper-class Iranians were headed to the Caspian Sea, a popular getaway spot. Long lines snaked from Tehran's gas stations.



Iranian authorities appeared to be curbing the public's access to the outside world. Phone and internet service was disrupted, with landline phones unable to receive or dial international calls. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group, reported that it had detected a significant drop in internet traffic from the country.

Iran, which has crippled important communications tools in past nationwide protests and during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, did not acknowledge any restrictions.

International websites appeared to be blocked, but local websites were functioning, likely signaling that Iran had turned on the so-called “halal net,” its own locally controlled version of the internet aimed at restricting what the public can see.

Iran's state TV on Tuesday urged the public to remove the messaging app WhatsApp from their cellphones, alleging without evidence that the app gathered user information to send to Israel.

In a statement, WhatsApp said it was concerned that “these false reports will be an excuse for our services to be blocked at a time when people need them the most.”








The International Atomic Energy Agency said Tuesday that it believed that Israel's first aerial attacks on Iran's Natanz enrichment site had directly affected the facility's underground centrifuge facility.

Satellite imagery collected after Friday's attacks showed “additional elements that indicate direct impacts on the underground enrichment halls,” the watchdog said.

Located 220 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of Tehran, the Natanz facility was fortified by anti-aircraft batteries, fencing and Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.

The IAEA earlier reported that Israeli strikes had destroyed an above-ground enrichment hall at Natanz and knocked out electrical equipment that powered the facility.

However, most of Iran's enrichment takes place underground to protect from airstrikes.

Israel has struck Natanz repeatedly and claims to have hurt its underground facilities, which experts assess contain 10,000 centrifuges that enrich uranium up to 60%. But Tuesday's IAEA statement marked the first time the agency has acknowledged damage there.

Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful, and the U.S. and others have assessed that Tehran has not had an organized effort to pursue a nuclear weapon since 2003. But the IAEA has repeatedly warned that the country has enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs should it choose to do so.

While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Monday that Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear sites have set the country's nuclear program back a “very, very long time,” Israel has not been able to reach Iran's Fordo uranium enrichment facility, which is built deep into a mountainside.

Hitting Fordo would require the U.S. to get involved militarily and deploy B-2 stealth bombers to drop its bunker-busting bomb. The 30,000-pound (14,000-kilogram) GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator uses its weight and sheer kinetic force to reach deeply buried targets.








Before leaving the summit in Canada, Trump joined the other leaders in a joint statement saying that Iran “can never have a nuclear weapon” and calling for a “de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza.”

French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that discussions were underway on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but Trump shot that down in his comments on social media. 

Macron “mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a ‘cease fire' between Israel and Iran,” Trump wrote. “Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.” 

Trump posted that there were no plans to kill Khamenei “at least not for now.” Despite warning that U.S. “patience is wearing thin,” he indicated that diplomatic talks remained an option. 

He said he could send Vice President JD Vance and special envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with the Iranians.

LIV Golf is a league in their own, exploding in popularity around the world. Trying to prove, that golf is for everyone. 

PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan announced on Tuesday that he is leaving the tour, and Tiger Woods seems excited about the future.

Monahan will leave the tour next year, and top NFL executive Brian Rolapp was announced as the PGA Tour's CEO.

""I'm honored to step into the role of CEO of the PGA Tour. Golf has one of the deepest histories and many of the most timeless traditions in all of sports,"" Rolapp said in an open letter posted on social media. ""That history and those traditions have inspired generations of players and fans, creating both a game and a Tour that millions around the world love. At the same time, professional golf is evolving, as are the ways fans consume sports. My goal as CEO is to honor golf's traditions but not be overly bound by them.""

Monahan will shift his day-to-day responsibilities to Rolapp and focus more on his position on the PGA Tour board, along with the commercial PGA Tour Enterprises board, through 2026.

""Over the past few years, the TOUR has made meaningful progress in addressing these changes - from creating more opportunities for players to improving the competitive structure and enhancing the fan experience. But there's still significant work to do and incredible opportunity remains ahead. From creating the highest quality golf product that includes the best players in the world, to strengthening commercial partnerships - as I spoke to players, board member, and fans in recent months, I felt drawn to this potential,"" Rolapp said.

Constitutional law attorney Jonathan Turley discusses President Donald Trump's directive for ICE to ramp up deportations and prioritize sanctuary cities. 

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom appeared to take a personal affront to the Trump administration considering the rescission of national monument status from two natural areas in the Golden State enshrined into protection by former President Joe Biden.

""This is just getting petty. Grow up,"" Newsom said in response to news that Trump might abolish the Chuckwalla and Sattitla Highlands National Monuments, the former of which is close to the extant Joshua Tree National Monument.

""If it's a day ending in Y, it's another day of Trump's war on California,"" Newsom's office said in a separate X post.

The Trump Justice Department issued a memo ruling that the president's power is reversible by future administrations and offered examples of similar actions.

That decision nullified former Attorney General Homer Cummings' 1938 assertion that presidents could not abolish such areas of protection.

The administration expressed concern that enshrining such large areas of land under federal control would prevent them from being able to be developed for economically beneficial purposes in the future – a claim conversely derided by environmentalists.

The Justice Department opined that ""revocation of prior monument designations"" can be found to either never have been or no longer deserving of protection under the Antiquities Act of 1906, according to the Washington Post.

Previously, Chief Justice John Roberts gave his blessing to cases challenging the usage of the Antiquities Act in prohibiting economic activities on federal lands and seabeds, the Post reported. 

On Monday, Newsom further mocked the Trumps, presenting a faux advertisement tagline for podcaster Benny Arthur Johnson's interview with Donald Trump Jr. on the idea that border czar Tom Homan could arrest the governor for ""working against ICE and [its] deportations.""

""Promo code ARREST for 15% off your Trump Phone,"" Newsom quipped on X.

The governor also claimed a social media post by Trump expressed the notion of seeking to incite violence in Democrat-run states and use it as a proxy to ""militarize our cities.""

He also slammed House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., for telling him to focus on ""lawlessness and crime"" in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The governor retorted that the Show-Me State purportedly has a 117% higher homicide rate than California.

""California's Green New Scam energy policies are a disaster for the state. Their energy shortages, outrageous energy prices, and continued assault on American energy have hurt Californians and enriched the Democrats' donors while selling out the citizens of the Golden State,"" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said of Newsom's barbs.

""Freeing up federal lands in an effort to secure American energy dominance is not petty. We wouldn't expect Gavin to understand adult decisions that help his state, considering his legacy of failure.""

Joy Taylor shares her take on the biggest winner of Aaron Rodgers' signing, explaining why she believes Rodgers himself came out on top—because he still gets to play.

Aaron Rodgers answered the last remaining question of the NFL offseason earlier this month when he finally agreed to a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The reaction was a bit more mixed than supportive. The Steelers have had five different quarterbacks start games for them since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season, and Rodgers was not exactly in MVP form when he signed with the New York Jets in 2023.

While one former general manager claimed Rodgers would be ""irrelevant"" by Thanksgiving, Super Bowl champion Joe Theismann took a more optimistic approach when he spoke to Fox News Digital as he prepared for the American Century Championship golf tournament next month.

He said Rodgers had the ""potential to be successful"" because of his ability to throw the ball along with another key factor -- he does not have to play GM in addition to quarterback.

""Remember the offenses Aaron has been in up until this year he basically controlled,"" Theismann said. ""He was familiar with the systems, he had his coordinators, his input into the people he wanted. Now, this is why I think he is going to be successful, now he just gets to play quarterback. 

""He doesn't have to be assistant general manager. He doesn't have to worry about personnel. The only thing he needs to worry about is being able to run this offense, nothing else. So, from my perspective, I think it takes a burden off him to be honest with you. And instead of trying to make a team better, just be part of a team and do your part to make it better.""

Additionally, the Mike Tomlin-led Steelers have always been well-coached.

""You're a part of the football team, you know, the way you earn respect is you go out and do your job, and you study hard, and you work hard,"" Theismann added. ""And, of course, Aaron is saying all the right things right now, and I believe he is going to do the right things.""

Rodgers had 3,897 passing yards, 28 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions in his first season coming off of his Achilles tear.

The Jets suffered some tough losses throughout the year. After starting 2-1, New York fell five straight times. Of those five losses, four of them were within one score.

Pittsburgh did make the playoffs at 10-7, and it will certainly be interesting to see how they do with Rodgers under center.

Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson breaks down the Trump administration's quest to end 'politicized science' on 'Special Report.'

A federal judge declared the Trump administration's move to nix some National Institutes of Health grants as illegal, describing the cuts as discriminatory during remarks on Monday, according to reports.

""I am hesitant to draw this conclusion — but I have an unflinching obligation to draw it — that this represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America's LGBTQ community,"" Judge William Young said, according to Politico. ""That's what this is. I would be blind not to call it out. My duty is to call it out.""

Young, who serves on the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, was nominated by then-President Ronald Reagan in 1985, according to the court's website.

""Any discrimination by our government is so wrong that it requires the court to enjoin it and at an appropriate time, I'm going to do it,"" the judge said, according to Reuters.

HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon noted in a statement that the department ""is exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal and moving to stay the order.""

""HHS stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people,"" Nixon declared in the statement the department provided to Fox News Digital. 

""Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy and the Trump administration, HHS is committed to ensuring that taxpayer dollars support programs rooted in evidence-based practices and gold standard science – not driven by divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology,"" Nixon said.

White House Spokesman Kush Desai accused the judge of airing his own view.

""It is appalling that a federal judge would use court proceedings to express his political views and preferences. How is a judge going to deliver an impartial decision when he explicitly stated his biased opinion that the Administration's retraction of illegal DEI funding is racist and anti-LGBTQ? Justice ceases to be administered when a judge clearly rules on the basis of his political ideologies,"" Desai declared in a statement he provided to Fox News Digital.

The White House deputy press secretary asserted, ""DEI is based on the premise that an individual's competence and abilities are tied to his or her racial background, and Americans have resoundingly rejected this flawed and racist logic.""

""The Trump administration is committed to restoring the Gold Standard of Science, and that starts with recognizing the biological reality of the male and female sexes. The NIH is focusing on Making America Healthy Again by realigning our research spending to address our chronic disease crisis instead, not to validate ideological activism,"" he noted.

President Donald Trump confirmed he will not call Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) in light of the shooting in Walz's state that killed the state speaker of the House and her husband.

Four days have passed since Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot. Minnesota Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also seriously injured by the same suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, who was taken into police custody on Sunday. The president had yet to call Walz about the matter, and he said he had no plans to.

“I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I'm not calling him. Why would I call him?” Trump told a gaggle of press as he boarded Air Force One Tuesday to leave the G7 summit. “I could call him and say, ‘How are you doing?' The guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. So I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?”

Trump also made reference to Walz's appointment of the suspect, Boelter, to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce in 2019. This was a reappointment from former Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016 and was not a political appointment.

“Governor Walz wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans, but this tragedy isn't about Trump or Walz. It's about the Hortman family, the Hoffman family, and the State of Minnesota, and the Governor remains focused on helping all three heal,” a spokesperson from Walz's office told the Washington Examiner.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate in her campaign against Trump last November. Walz has continued to criticize Trump and is seeking reelection in Minnesota next year.

KLOBUCHAR URGES COLLEAGUES TO TONE DOWN ‘HATEFUL RHETORIC' AFTER LAWMAKER SHOOTINGS

Authorities suspected that Boelter had more targets in his planned attack after police found a list in his car of potential targets, including other politicians and abortion providers. Also in the car, officials found flyers for the anti-Trump “No Kings” protests happening that day.

The FBI called the event a “political assassination” while announcing the federal charges against him Monday. The murder charges against Boelter make him eligible for the death penalty, but the FBI didn't announce if it would seek that punishment. He did not enter a plea during his first court appearance Monday.

Walz has since called on Minnesotans to move forward with “humility, and grace, and compassion” to honor Hortman's memory.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

I finally understand my past neurotic behavior—and wonder how much to disclose to friends and family.

Dear James,

After a series of unsettling events, including what I (falsely) believed was a hit-and-run—a belief that had me Googling “hit and run” and sent me into a tailspin, convinced that the police were after me—I was diagnosed with a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder characterized by mostly mental (rather than physical) compulsions.

Now, with medication and therapy, I've started revisiting the neurotic behaviors I've lived with for most of my life, like the year I was convinced I had HIV until a friend, tired of hearing about it, dragged me to get tested, or the time I was sure a swollen lymph node was cancer but my doctor refused to biopsy it.

Now that I have some clarity, I wonder: Do I need to explain all of this to my friends, family, and colleagues? Or should I just keep moving forward armed with my new sense of understanding?

Dear Reader,

First of all: congratulations. I, too, have committed crimes that never happened and almost died of illnesses I didn't have. Once, in a bar in London, I groped in my pocket for some cash, felt a lump in my thigh, and immediately blacked out. Clang, onto the floor, full length. I came around gazing into the neutrally concerned face of an EMT. As Morrissey says: “Oh, I can smile about it now, but at the time it was terrible.”

And it's not like I can't still feel it, right next to me, right under me, that whipping, lashing realm of contingency, all the ghastly possibilities blah blah. But somehow, it's no longer at the center of my awareness. I'm not sure what happened—maybe I displaced it with alcohol and pro wrestling. Or maybe it was the 10 years of therapy. Or maybe I finally figured out what D. H. Lawrence meant when he wrote “If only, most lovely of all, I yield myself and am borrowed / By the fine, fine wind that takes its course through the chaos of the world.”

The point is: We made it. We can look back on these crises with rue and wonderment. I don't think you need to explain anything to anybody. To those who accompanied you through it (like your friend who insisted you get tested), the change in you, the strengthening in you, will be self-evident. The time to use your new understanding will come when you encounter someone in similar difficulties. At that moment, you'll be able to plug right into the regenerative power of the universe—the countercurrent to all of the fear and destruction—and help somebody out.

On the mend,

James

Dear James,

I'm 61, and I retired from full-time work four years ago—not to move toward anything in particular but to find relief from a lifestyle that was no longer physically or mentally healthy. I was well compensated for work, but the toll it was taking on my body, mind, and psyche resulted in a risk-benefit imbalance.

Four years later, I'm still figuring out how to live in retirement. Mental-health professionals and well-meaning advice dispensers all seem to encourage a retired life filled with service to others, and devoted to maintaining or strengthening social contacts. I'm all for those activities, and some of them are and will be part of my retired life.

However, I'm on the far end of introvert on the introvert-extrovert continuum. And I'm perfectly happy in my little corner of the world, minding my own business, enjoying the sights and sounds of my environment, and appreciating still being alive. I'm never bored and rarely lonely. Do you see anything wrong with a small, quiet, do-no-harm existence, or must I force myself out into the world more often than I wish to?

Dear Reader,

Bollocks to service, and bollocks to strengthening social contacts. Be untroubled by these buzzwords. By cultivating so exquisitely your own portion of consciousness, you're doing more for the collective than any number of noisy humanitarians. Relish your solitary days!

Strewing petals,

James

Once a suspect COVID treatment, now a cure for everything

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Remember ivermectin? The animal-deworming medication was used so avidly as an off-label COVID treatment during the pandemic that some feed stores ended up going out of stock. (MUST SHOW A PIC OF YOU AND YOUR HORSE, a sign at one demanded of would-be customers in 2021.) If you haven't heard about it since, then you've existed blissfully outside the gyre of misinformation and conspiracies that have come to define the MAGA world's outlook on medicine. In the past few years, ivermectin's popularity has only grown, and the drug has become a go-to treatment for almost any ailment whatsoever. Once a suspect COVID cure, now a right-wing aspirin.

In fact, ivermectin never really worked for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections. Many of the initial studies that hinted at a benefit turned out to be flawed and unreliable. By 2023, a series of clinical trials had already proved beyond a doubt that ivermectin won't reduce COVID symptoms or mortality. But these findings mattered little to its fans, who saw the drug as having earned the status of dissident antiviral—a treatment that they believed had been suppressed by the medical establishment. And if ivermectin was good enough to be rejected by mainstream doctors as a cure for COVID, health-care skeptics seemed to reason, then surely it must have a host of other uses too.

As a physician who diagnoses cancer, I have come across this line of thinking in my patients, and found that some were using ivermectin to treat their life-threatening tumors. Nicholas Hornstein, a medical oncologist in New York City, told me that he's had the same experience: About one in 20 of his patients ask about the drug, he said. He remembers one woman who came into his office with a tumor that was visibly protruding from her abdomen, having swapped her chemotherapy for some ivermectin that she'd picked up at a veterinary-supply store. “It's going to work any day now,” he says she told him when he tried to intervene.

The idea that ivermectin could be a cancer-fighting agent does have some modest basis in reality: Preliminary studies have suggested that antiparasitic medications might inhibit tumor growth, and at least one ongoing clinical trial is evaluating ivermectin's role as an adjunct to cancer treatment. That study has enrolled only nine patients, however, and the results so far show that just one patient's tumor actually shrank, according to a recent scientific abstract. But these meager grounds for hope now support a towering pile of expectations.

Cancer is just one of many illnesses that ivermectin is supposed to heal. According to All Family Pharmacy, a Florida-based company that promotes the compound to fans of Donald Trump Jr., Dan Bongino, Matt Gaetz, and Laura Ingraham on their podcasts and shows, the drug has “anti-inflammatory properties that could help keep the immune system balanced in fighting infection.” (The company did not respond to a request for comment.) In sprawling Facebook groups devoted to ivermectin's healing powers, the claims are more extreme: The drug can combat a long list of conditions, members say, including Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, diabetes, autism, carpal tunnel syndrome, crow's feet, brain fog, and bee stings.

As a medication that supposedly was censored by elites—if not canceled outright by woke medicine and Big Pharma—ivermectin has become a symbol of medical freedom. It's also a MAGA shibboleth: Republican-leaning parts of the country helped drive an astounding 964 percent increase in prescriptions for the drug early in the pandemic, and GOP members of Congress have used their official posts to advocate for its benefits. Ivermectin can now be purchased without a prescription in Arkansas and Idaho, and other states are considering similar measures.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been a particularly strong proponent. In his 2021 book about the pandemic, Kennedy referred to the “massive and overwhelming evidence” in ivermectin's favor, and invoked its “staggering, life-saving efficacy.” He also argued at great length that the pharmaceutical industry—with the support of Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates—had engaged in a historic crime by attempting to discourage its use. Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, has similarly backed the conspiracy theory that the use of ivermectin was dismissed by “the powers that be” in an apparent ploy to ease the approval of COVID vaccines. (Not everyone in the current administration is a fan: Before he became the FDA's vaccine czar, the oncologist Vinay Prasad publicly disputed Kennedy's views on ivermectin, and earlier this year he called its use for cancer “the right's version of masking on the airplane and praying to Lord Fauci.”) In response to questions about Kennedy's and Bhattacharya's current views on ivermectin, the HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard told me that they “continue to follow the latest scientific research regarding therapeutic options for COVID-19 and other illnesses.” She did not respond to questions about Prasad.

The idea of using antiparasitic drugs as cancer treatments was already taking hold by the late 2010s, Skyler Johnson, a Utah radiation oncologist who studies medical misinformation, told me. In January 2017, a man with lung cancer named Joe Tippens started on a dewormer called fenbendazole, which had been suggested to him by a veterinarian. Daniel Lemoi, who had Lyme disease, had started taking ivermectin in 2012 after reading a paper on the genetic similarities between humans and horses. Tippens would go on to achieve global fame among desperate cancer patients, and Lemoi became an ivermectin influencer during the pandemic.

Read: How ivermectin became a belief system

Since then, a gaggle of dubious doctors has worked to bolster the credibility of deworming drugs within alternative medicine and anti-vaccine circles. Their underlying pitch has become familiar in the past few years: Health experts can't be trusted; the pharmaceutical industry is suppressing cheap cures; and patients deserve the liberty to choose their own medical interventions. For the rest of the medical establishment, the worldview this entails is straining doctor-patient relationships. Johnson told me that many of his patients are now skeptical of his advice, if not openly combative. One cancer patient accused Johnson of bias when he failed to recommend ivermectin. The drug is so cheap and effective, this patient had concluded, that Johnson would be out of a job if everyone knew about it. (Johnson told me that he offers patients “the best possible treatment, no matter the financial incentive.”) Ivermectin has become a big business in its own right. Online pharmacies and wellness shops are cashing in on the deworming craze, with one offering parasite cleanses for $200 a month. Meanwhile, fringe doctors can charge patients who have cancer and other diseases thousands of dollars to prescribe such treatments.

Johnson's own experience suggests that the cult of ivermectin is growing larger. He told me that he's seen his patients' interest in the drug explode since January, when the actor Mel Gibson went on Joe Rogan's podcast and claimed that three of his friends had beat back their advanced tumors with ivermectin and fenbendazole, among various other potions. “This stuff works, man,” Gibson said. Meanwhile, in the ivermectin Facebook groups—including one with close to 300,000 members—the public can read posts from a woman with breast cancer considering using ivermectin in lieu of hormone treatments; a leukemia patient who has given up on chemotherapy to “see what happens” with antiparasitic drugs; or a concerned aunt wondering if the drugs might help her little niece with Stage 4 cancer.

But ivermectin advocacy is most disturbing in its totalizing form, wherein parasites—which is to say, the pathogens against which the drug truly is effective—are reimagined as the secret cause of many other unrelated problems. In the Facebook groups, members will share images of what they say are worms that have been expelled from their bodies by treatment. (This phenomenon brings to mind a different disease entirely: delusional parasitosis.) One recent post from the daughter of a Stage 4 lung-cancer patient showed a bloody glob that had “dropped down into her mouth.” Commenters debated whether this might be a worm or something else. “Blood clot from Covid vax?” one suggested. A few days later, the daughter gave an update: Her mom had gone to see the doctor, who informed her that she'd likely coughed up a piece of her own lung.

The whole exchange provides a sad illustration of this delirious and desperate time. Before it turned into a conservative cure-all, ivermectin was legitimately a wonder drug for the poorest people on Earth. Since its discovery in 1973, it has become a leading weapon in the fight against horrific infections such as river blindness and elephantiasis. Yet now that substantial success seems to have given birth to a self-destructive fantasy.

A decade ago, the co-discoverers of ivermectin—William Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura—were awarded a Nobel Prize in recognition of their contribution to reducing human suffering. In his formal lecture to the Academy, Campbell offered some reflections on the simple science that gave rise to the treatment, and to its wide array of applications. But his speech contained a warning, too, that any medicine that works so broadly and so well runs the risk of being handed out too often. The more benefits that such a drug provides, he told the audience in Stockholm, “the more we must guard against the hazards of indiscriminate use.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Israel-Iran War:

President Donald Trump was meeting with his national security team in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the escalating Middle East conflict, according to people familiar with the matter, fueling fresh speculation that the US is on the verge of joining Israel's attack on Iran. 

Before gathering his advisers in the White House Situation Room, Trump posted a demand for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” and warned of a possible strike against the country's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump posted on social media.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Two family-owned toy companies are asking the US Supreme Court to consider striking down many of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, putting a high-stakes fight with worldwide economic implications before the justices for the first time.

The request filed Tuesday seeks to put the case on an expedited track with the possibility of a definitive Supreme Court ruling by the end of the year.

New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested Tuesday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as he was escorting a defendant out of immigration court, his wife said in a statement.

""While escorting a defendant out of immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza, Brad was taken by masked agents and detained by ICE,"" Lander's wife, Meg Barnette, wrote on X.

""This is still developing, and our team is monitoring the situation closely,"" Barnette wrote.

Video of the incident posted online shows Lander standing outside a courtroom at the city's main immigration court when he is approached by officers, including some wearing masks.

Lander repeatedly asks the officers to show him a judicial warrant before he is handcuffed, per the video posted by Barnette.

The Department of Homeland Security said Lander was arrested for ""assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer,"" but it was not immediately clear whether those were the formal charges. 

Lander is still in custody as of early Tuesday afternoon, Barnette said during a press conference after the incident. Lander has a personal lawyer and counsel from the city, she also said.

""I am just very aware of how I feel right now watching Brad being taken away and that it's going to be ok, and for all of those other families in there, they can't say that,"" she said.

Lander, a candidate in next week's Democratic primary for New York City mayor, has observed court proceedings at the immigration courthouse at least two other times, Barnette said.

The incident comes days after police handcuffed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., after he was forcibly removed from a press conference that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was holding in Los Angeles.

""If that is what the administration is going to do to a United States senator for having the authority to simply ask a question, imagine what they will do to any American who dares to speak up,"" Padilla said during remarks from the Senate floor on Tuesday.

New York Attorney General Letitia James condemned Lander's detention as a ""profoundly unacceptable"" event. 

""Arresting Comptroller Lander for the simple act of standing up for immigrants and their civil rights is a shocking abuse of power,"" James said in a statement.

She also said it was a ""grotesque escalation of tensions,"" and that the Trump administration's ""rampant targeting of New Yorkers only makes our communities less safe.""

This is a developing story and will be updated.

A new savings account for children with a one-time deposit of $1,000 from the federal government remained in the U.S. Senate's version of President Donald Trump's budget bill.

Under the proposal, so-called ""Trump accounts,"" a type of tax-advantaged saving accounts, would be available to all children under the age of eight years old who are U.S. citizens. In earlier versions of the proposal, Trump accounts were termed ""Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement"" or ""MAGA accounts.""

If the bill passes as drafted, parents will be able to contribute up to $5,000 a year and the balance will be invested in a diversified fund that tracks a U.S.-stock index. This part of the Senate Republicans' version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was largely unchanged from the House plan advanced in May.

Not unlike a 529 college savings plan, Trump accounts come with a tax incentive. Earnings grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are taxed as long-term capital gains.

Under both the House and Senate versions of the bill, withdrawals could begin at age 18, at which point account holders can tap up to half of the funds for education expenses or credentials, the down payment on a first home or as capital to start a small business.

At 25, account holders can use the full balance for expenses that fall under those same guidelines and at 30, they can use the money for any reason. Distributions taken for qualified purposes are taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate, while distributions for any other purpose are taxed as ordinary income.

For children born between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2028, the federal government will deposit $1,000 into the Trump account, funded by the Department of the Treasury, as part of a ""newborn pilot program,"" according to the Senate Finance Committee's proposed text released on Monday.

To be eligible to receive the initial seed money, a child must be a U.S. citizen at birth and both parents must have Social Security numbers.

If a parent or guardian does not open an account, the Secretary of Treasury will establish an account on the child's behalf. Parents may also opt out.

The White House and Republican lawmakers have said these accounts will introduce more Americans to wealth-building opportunities and the benefits of compound growth. But some experts say the Trump accounts are also overly complicated, making it harder to reach lower-income families.

Universal savings accounts, with fewer strings attached, would be a simpler alternative proposal at a lower price tag, according to Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a public policy think tank.

""I'm disappointed the Senate did not take the opportunity to improve these accounts,"" Michel said. Still, ""provisions that remain in both the House and Senate text, we should expect them to become law, and this provision fits that criteria."" 

Mark Higgins, senior vice president at Index Fund Advisors and author of ""Investing in U.S. Financial History: Understanding the Past to Forecast the Future,"" said the key is ""if the benefits comfortably exceed the cost.""

According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump accounts would add $17 billion to the deficit over the next decade.

Crude oil futures rose more than 4% on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump demanded Iran's unconditional surrender and threatened its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The U.S. crude oil contract for July delivery gained $3.07, or 4.28%, to close at $74.84 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent for August rose $3.22, or 4.4%, to settle at $76.45. Prices continued to rise after Tuesday's settlement with U.S. crude and Brent both up nearly 5%.

Trump threatened Khamenei as ""an easy target,"" warning Iran's leader that U.S. ""patience is wearing thin."" The president then called for Iran's unconditional surrender on his social media platform Truth Social.

""We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding,"" Trump said in a social media post Tuesday. ""He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.""

Trump met Tuesday afternoon with his national security team in the White House Situation Room. At the same time, the Pentagon moved assets to the Middle East Tuesday, increasing U.S. military capabilities for defensive positions and expanding Trump's options.

Oil prices had closed lower Monday on reports that Iran was seeking a ceasefire with Israel, but those hopes faded as the conflict went on for a fifth day with Trump taking a harder line against Iran. Trump left the Group of Seven summit in Canada early and demanded that everyone evacuate Iran's capital city.

""Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,"" the president said in a social media post late Monday. ""I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!""

Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was looking for ""a real end"" to the conflict, ""not a ceasefire"" agreement. The president said he was ""not too much in the mood to negotiate"" with Iran. Trump said there was no specific threat that led to his call for people in Tehran to evacuate.

The impact of the conflict on the oil futures market has been modest so far, with prices rising about 10% since Israel launched its air campaign against Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs on Friday.

The oil market has been relatively calm in the face of the conflict because the world is well supplied with crude, said Amos Hochstein, former President Joe Biden's senior energy advisor. OPEC+ is increasing supply to the market and U.S. production remains at record levels, Hochstein said.

Oil traders initially feared that Israel might strike Iran's oil infrastructure in an effort to cripple the Islamic Republic's economy. Israel has hit domestic energy facilities in Iran but has spared installations that export to the global market.

""What the market is seeing is this confidence that Israel is able to continue this escalation with Iran and the war against Iran without the Iranians being able to do very much in response,"" Hochstein told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday.

Iran is the third-largest oil producer in OPEC and exports about 1.6 million barrels per day mostly to China, according to data from OPEC and the Energy Information Administration. The market is overlooking the risk that Israel could hit Iran's export facilities and take barrels off the market, Hochstein said.

""The market believes it is able to handle it,"" Hochstein said of a potential supply disruption.

The worst case-scenario for the oil market would be an attempt by Iran to block the Strait of Hormuz in response to such an Israeli strike. The strait is a narrow waterway between Iran and Oman through which about 20% of the world's oil passes.

Goldman Sachs has warned that such an event could push oil prices above $100 per barrel. But Tehran would likely think twice before making such a move because it could draw the U.S. into the conflict, Hochstein said.

Bitcoin has swung wildly over the last week as traders brace for a massive bitcoin and crypto market shock.

The bitcoin price plummeted toward $100,000 per bitcoin at the beginning of the latest Israel-Iran conflict, with a serious Coinbase warning further weighing on the bitcoin price.

Now, after a bitcoin price rebound fails to hold despite a surprise crypto market prediction by U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, analysts are warning that the rising risk of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz key global oil market passage could spark a fresh round of crypto volatility.

“There's still one big risk to watch out for: the Strait of Hormuz,” Tracy Jin, the chief operating officer of crypto exchange MEXC, said in emailed comments.

""About 20% of the world's oil (20 million barrels) goes through this narrow stretch of land, and any kind of conflict could lead to a sharp rise in energy prices. Experts are saying that the price of Brent could go above $115, which might add 70-90 basis points to inflation by the end of the year. That sort of supply shock would probably lead to a risk-off move, which would put pressure on both crypto and equities. As crypto trades become more and more linked to macro assets, bitcoin, which is often seen as ‘macro beta' these days, is likely to see some fresh volatility.""

Jin added that rising energy prices could also have a knock on effect to energy-hungry bitcoin miners who have to power and cool their computers to maintain the bitcoin network in exchange for freshly-minted bitcoin.

The odds of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz have spiked to around 40% on the crypto-powered prediction platform Polymarket over the last 24 hours as U.S. president Donald Trump plays down the chance of a peace deal between Israel and Iran.

However, while the bitcoin price has swung along with stock markets over the last week, bitcoin and crypto analysts have said they believe it will continue to hold up if the fighting spirals into a wider regional conflict.

“Bitcoin will be resilient and any dips will be very shallow,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of 10x Research, said in emailed comments.

“There is no indication that anybody would be willing to liquidate their bitcoin … even the long term holders are accumulating while normally we would see them to sell at this point.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Ukraine Introduces Bill To Allow Bitcoin In National Reserves","https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/ukraine-introduces-bill-to-allow-bitcoin-in-national-reserves","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:09:29 GMT","

A new bill in Ukraine's parliament would allow the National Bank of Ukraine to hold Bitcoin in its reserves, potentially signaling a shift in the country's finances during economic stress. 

Ukraine has introduced a bill that would give its central bank the legal right to hold Bitcoin and other assets as part of its national reserves. The draft law, submitted to the Verkhovna Rada on June 10, 2025, proposes updates to existing legislation to include “virtual assets” in the foreign exchange and gold reserves of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). 

NEW: Ukraine introduces bill for Bitcoin Reserve in Parliament 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/bYIiCNF13D

This doesn't mean Ukraine is officially adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet just yet, but it would give the central bank the green light to do so in the future.  

One of the bill's co-sponsors, Member of Parliament Yaroslav Zhelezniak, emphasized that the legislation is about granting permission, not making it a requirement. “Whether and to what extent they actually do so,” he said, “is up to the institution itself.” 

Zhelezniak recently discussed with Binance's regional head Kyrylo Khomiakov, that he believes Bitcoin could help Ukraine strengthen its economic position and contribute to long term digital innovation. 

The timing of the bill is vital as Ukraine has been under enormous financial pressure since Russia's invasion in 2022. Inflation remains high, the hryvnia has lost significant value, and the country is heavily reliant on international aid and loans. The NBU has managed to hold roughly $44.5 billion in reserves, mostly in U.S. dollars and government securities, but its room to maneuver is limited.  



Back in 2022, the Ukrainian government was actively raising donations for the war effort through Bitcoin. They had an official wallet set up for donations, and their politicians were publicly tweeting out the addresses asking for support. On the first day alone, Ukraine's official Bitcoin wallet raised over $3.5 million. By leaning into Bitcoin during their time of crisis, the government showed their belief and commitment in it, and this new bill shows that that commitment has not faded.  

NEW 💥 Ukraine government #Bitcoin wallet raises OVER $3.5 MILLION in 1st day of donations 🇺🇦

If this bill is adopted, it could position Ukraine as one of the first countries to give its central bank the legal ability to hold Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Ethereum is dead. Ethereum will be fine. The social media takes are flying on the state of the world's second most valuable blockchain. Conceived in 2013, Ethereum has experienced a series of dramatic ups and downs, including an existential hack in 2016 and a remarkable technological upgrade in 2022. But this year has brought unprecedented scrutiny of the current and future direction of the project.

A big part of this is due to the price of Ethereum, which is badly lagging Bitcoin. The world's most valuable cryptocurrency has notched a series of all-time highs and a flurry of interest from Wall Street investors. Meanwhile, as of Tuesday, Ethereum was trading around $2,500, about 50% lower than its all-time high, according to data from crypto exchange Binance. 





Ether's lackluster price movement has prompted some to proclaim Ethereum's end. “Ethereum died,” wrote Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin booster, on X. “It just hasn't been buried yet.”





This is an overstatement. But questions remain on whether Ethereum's price slump reflects a temporary stumble, or whether the blockchain—long hailed by boosters as the computer of the future—will never grow into its promise.





“Bitcoin has died many times… Ethereum has died several times,” Joseph Lubin, CEO of the blockchain technology firm Consensys and cofounder of Ethereum, told Fortune. “When there are challenges, we learn from them.”




Those challenges have been present since 2013, when a wiry 19-year-old from Canada named Vitalik Buterin had an idea for a new type of computer. Fearing that Big Tech firms had an unhealthy monopoly over cloud computing that could stifle developers, Buterin looked to blockchains instead. He and others came up with Ethereum—a decentralized blockchain-based computing platform where programmers' code was immune to the whims of corporate behemoths.





Developers soon flocked to Ethereum, but the increase in activity brought a rise in “gas fees.” Every time users send one another assets on Ethereum, they need to pay with cryptocurrency—in the same way Amazon requires users to pay dollars to use its cloud computing network. The only difference is that Ethereum's gas fees are distributed to the decentralized cohort of computers supporting the blockchain, instead of one corporate entity. In 2021, sending a few dollars of cryptocurrency to other users on Ethereum resulted in charges of sometimes hundreds of dollars, and developers looked for a solution.





That solution is what Ethereum's critics say has sapped the network of some of its financial value. Instead of immediately working to speed up Ethereum's core network, developers fostered a system of layer 2 blockchains, or L2s, built on top of Ethereum. These L2s—including Arbitrum, Optmism, and Polygon—package user data into one bundle and post that onto Ethereum, rather than ask the blockchain to process each transaction individually. 





If gas fees are any indication, that strategy has worked. Since a peak in mid-2020, transaction costs have plummeted more than 99% on Ethereum, according to data from Glassnode. 





But Kyle Samani, managing partner at crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital, believes this approach has made the core network of Ethereum less valuable. “It's my fundamental view that a network is not sustainable or valuable without direct user activity,” he told Fortune.




Users have moved to L2s and drained Ethereum of some of the activity that propped up its cryptocurrency's price, Samani, a noted supporter of the competing Solana blockchain, argued. 





However, Paul Brody, chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an advocacy group for the blockchain, said fixation on the price of Ether in the short term is missing the point. “Ethereum is the amazing world computer,” he told Fortune. “I don't think it can or should try to be all things, all people, and, especially, I don't think Ethereum should also try to be the best, most deflationary cryptocurrency.”





Ethereum's upgrades, not any explicit work to buoy Ether's price, should prompt a rise in demand for the cryptocurrency, said Brody. And that's what developers are working on, said Danny Ryan and Vivek Raman, cofounders of the Ethereum advocacy group Ethrealize—one of many wings of a robust technical and cultural community based around the blockchain that convenes at large annual get-togethers like ETHDenver in Colorado.





Programmers are now optimizing the speed of the layer 1 network, not just its ecosystem of layer 2 chains, say Ryan and Raman. Plus, the duo believe that the flood of Wall Street and Big Tech firms exploring blockchain technology will spur a rush to buy the cryptocurrency. “I don't think that we should pretend like the asset doesn't need to be valuable,” added Danny Ryan. His cofounder Raman even equated Ethereum to “digital oil.”





“When you ask institutions, when we go have our meetings and say, ‘Which is a civilizational infrastructure, which is the global, neutral infrastructure that you can actually deploy real assets with real trust?'” Raman added. “Ethereum is the obvious choice.”




But whether Wall Street titans decide to go with Ethereum, rather than competitors like Solana, remains to be seen. Still, proponents are hopeful. “If we do our job, and we become the first place for everybody to do business,” said Brody, “then the asset price is just something that takes care of itself.”

Eigen Labs has announced the launch of EigenCloud, a platform designed to extend blockchain-grade trust guarantees to any Web2 or Web3 application.

The alpha version launch this week coincides with a fresh $70 million token purchase by a16z crypto, deepening its commitment following the firm's $100 million Series B investment in February 2024.

The venture firm's direct purchase of EIGEN tokens indicates alignment with EigenLayer's token-centric economic model as EigenCloud usage will create new fee flows that can support staking rewards.

The structure introduces a potential yield incentive for restakers, creating a feedback loop between application usage and network participation.

EigenCloud is built atop EigenLayer's restaking protocol and integrates data availability (EigenDA), general-purpose compute (EigenCompute), and dispute resolution (EigenVerify) into a single developer-facing platform.

These tools allow developers to cryptographically prove what happened off-chain, with the same trust guarantees traditionally reserved for on-chain activity.

Restaking has emerged as a popular model for bootstrapping decentralized infrastructure. EigenLayer allows Ethereum stakers to “restake” their ETH to secure third-party services, known as autonomous verifiable services.

Over $12 billion in restaked assets are securing more than 200 AVSs across oracles, rollups, AI workflows, and decentralized middleware.

EigenCloud's alpha rollout aligns with a performance upgrade for EigenDA, achieving throughput of 50 MB per second on Ethereum testnets. It also launches a gated preview of EigenVerify, designed to adjudicate disputes in off-chain systems like AI agents or prediction markets.

Later this year, EigenCompute will provide verifiable general-purpose compute, enabling developers to anchor computation results with cryptoeconomic guarantees.

The April activation of slashing marked a key step for EigenLayer, empowering AVSs to penalize misbehaving node operators. This capability allows EigenCloud to extend L1-like guarantees beyond traditional blockchains into areas like medical records, machine learning inference, and Web2 marketplaces, domains where trust and correctness are paramount.

EigenCloud reframes the blockchain from a transaction ledger into a programmable trust engine. By packaging verifiability as modular primitives, Eigen Labs aims to offer an on-chain alternative to cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud, but with built-in accountability.

This concept, dubbed “verifiability-as-a-service,” introduces a new economic flywheel for the EIGEN token. As applications consume services like EigenVerify or EigenCompute, they generate usage fees payable in EIGEN, which will be used to support stakers, fund incentives and develop other innovations. While pricing and metering models for EigenCompute have yet to be disclosed, the structure positions verifiability itself as a billable digital resource.

While EigenLayer dominates the restaking narrative, competitors like Celestia (modular data availability), Story Protocol (on-chain IP verification), and Optimism's Cannon (fraud-proof generation) are also pushing toward verifiable infrastructure.

EigenCloud's differentiation lies in its unification of data, compute, and dispute resolution into a single trust layer, which is an approach more akin to cloud-native full-stack development than blockchain tooling.

That said, key questions remain as slashing is still optional for AVSs, raising concerns about enforcement consistency. Meanwhile, regulatory guidance on verifiability protocols, especially in AI, healthcare, and finance, remains sparse.

Sreeram Kannan, CEO of Eigen Labs, forsees EigenCloud as a key piece in the puzzle for bringing blockchain into traditional app development. Kannan commented,

Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, added that verifiability is “becoming a foundational building block of the internet,” and praised EigenCloud as a meaningful leap toward a more trustworthy digital stack.

Ali Yahya, General Partner at a16z crypto, echoed the sentiment, commenting, “EigenLayer is surmounting the technical bottlenecks of blockchains to enable a new category of applications built on verifiable solutions.”

Access to EigenCloud is currently being rolled out to select developers, with broader availability planned for late 2025. An ambitious roadmap includes extended developer tooling, additional slashing mechanisms, and streamlined deployment flows for AVSs.

As crypto enters what many call its “app era,” Eigen Labs is betting that verifiability will be the feature that unlocks mass developer engagement, and a new generation of use cases beyond tokens and DeFi.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin was down by nearly 4% over the past 24 hours as President Donald Trump suggested in a social media post that the U.S. might assassinate Iran's supreme leader, escalating already inflamed tensions in the Middle East.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $103,630, its lowest level in five days, according to market data provider CoinGecko, though it has ticked back up above $104,000 as of this writing. BTC started edging down last Thursday as Iran and Israel began exchanging missile attacks.

Ethereum was recently changing hands at about $2,470, down nearly 6.5% over the past 24 hours. Smart contract platforms Solana and Cardano were both off about 7%, while the leading meme coin Dogecoin had dropped 6.7%.

With the full outbreak of the digital economy today, the threshold for traditional cryptocurrency mining is being continuously lowered. Mining machines that used to require high investment and complex operation and maintenance have now been replaced by smarter methods – you can easily participate in the mining process of mainstream currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum with just a smartphone. All this is due to the leapfrog development of cloud mining technology.

The so-called cloud mining refers to renting computing power resources from remote data centers, and the platform completes the mining process on behalf of the platform, and users receive daily currency dividends in the form of contracts. You don't need to buy expensive mining machines or bear high electricity bills. You only need to choose a suitable computing power package on the platform to automatically start mining and enjoy daily income.

In layman's terms, it's like you entrust a professional company to mine for you, and you can receive mining income on time without doing it yourself. This “worry-free, labor-saving, zero-maintenance” model is becoming the mainstream choice for global crypto investors to obtain passive income.Blockchain Cloud Mining Advantages

The complete list of new stable income contracts can be found .

You can get earnings the day after purchasing the contract. When the account funds reach $100, you can choose to withdraw to your wallet or continue to purchase other contracts.Security and Sustainability

In the field of mining, trust and security are crucial. BlockchainCloudMining knows this and puts user safety first.

BlockchainCloudMining is committed to transparency and legality, ensuring that your investment is protected and allowing you to focus on profitability.

sheridian, wyoming, June 17th, 2025, Chainwire



R0AR has launched its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that integrates token staking, liquidity provision, and NFT-based rewards into a single user interface. Designed to support long-term engagement, the platform streamlines participation while incorporating embedded security measures and time-based reward models.



Streamlined Staking and Liquidity Solutions

The R0AR Platform enables users to interact with three primary mechanisms:

All services are accessible via a unified dashboard compatible with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, and additional login methods.

Time-Based APY and Smart Engagement Logic

The SmartAPY system employed by R0AR replaces static returns and fixed lock-up models with a time-sensitive structure that increases rewards proportionally with the length of the stake. All liquidity and staking positions are subject to an 11-day minimum engagement window, enforced on-chain, with real-time visibility into countdowns for penalty-free withdrawal. (After 11 days their is no required lock periods letting you unstake at anytime while hitting APY tiers)



Security Infrastructure and Direct Token Access

The platform operates without reliance on third-party routing or aggregator services, reducing exposure to slippage and MEV-related risks. Smart contracts include embedded protections against unauthorized interactions and manipulation. Additionally, users can purchase $1R0R directly using ETH, Weth, USDC, or USDT via the platform, bypassing the need for centralized exchanges.

Practical Applications for NFTs

Beyond aesthetic or collectible use, ERS NFTs serve functional roles within the platform. When locked, they deliver increasing monthly payouts and can boost staking rewards when held alongside $1R0R in the same wallet. Bonus incentives are also available for verified users.

The NFTs include metadata designed to integrate with R0AR's upcoming AI tools, allowing the system to adjust experiences based on behavioral patterns without requiring active user input.

Ecosystem Integration and Technical Foundation

Each of the platform's core functions—staking, liquidity, and NFT utilities—contributes to a cohesive ecosystem. Built on the Optimism OP Stack, the R0AR Platform benefits from reduced transaction costs and scalability for future integrations, including real-world asset support and AI-enhanced personalization features.

Public Launch and Availability

The R0AR Platform is scheduled for public release on 6-16-2025 . Users will be able to access all staking, liquidity, and NFT functionalities (NFT staking to follow on the r0ar platform in the coming weeks after launch) at https://www.r0ar.io/platform.

About R0AR

R0AR is a decentralized finance platform offering token staking, liquidity solutions, and NFT-based engagement tools. Operating on the Ethereum Blockchain & R0AR's custom OP Stack Layer 2 chain, the platform emphasizes time-based rewards, user protection, and simplified participation across DeFi protocols.

Between April and September 2023, a hacker carried out a credential stuffing attack on 23andMe's platform, exploiting reused login credentials that were stolen from previous unrelated data breaches.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has fined genetic testing company 23andMe £2.31 million for failing to implement appropriate security measures to protect the personal information of UK users, following a large-scale cyber attack in 2023.

The penalty follows a joint investigation conducted by the ICO and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.

What happened

Between April and September 2023, a hacker carried out a credential stuffing attack on 23andMe's platform, exploiting reused login credentials that were stolen from previous unrelated data breaches.

This resulted in the unauthorised access to personal information belonging to 155,592 UK residents, potentially revealing names, birth years, self-reported city or postcode-level location, profile images, race, ethnicity, family trees and health reports. The type and amount of personal information accessed varied depending on the information included in a customer's account.

The ICO investigation found that 23andMe did not have additional verification steps for users to access and download their raw genetic data.

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said: “This was a profoundly damaging breach that exposed sensitive personal information, family histories, and even health conditions of thousands of people in the UK. As one of those impacted told us: once this information is out there, it cannot be changed or reissued like a password or credit card number.

“23andMe failed to take basic steps to protect this information. Their security systems were inadequate, the warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond. This left people's most sensitive data vulnerable to exploitation and harm.

“We carried out this investigation in collaboration with our Canadian counterparts, and it highlights the power of international cooperation in holding global companies to account. Data protection doesn't stop at borders, and neither do we when it comes to protecting the rights of UK residents.”

Philippe Dufresne, Privacy Commissioner of Canada, said: “Strong data protection must be a priority for organisations, especially those that are holding sensitive personal information. With data breaches growing in severity and complexity, and ransomware and malware attacks rising sharply, any organisation that is not taking steps to prioritise data protection and address these threats is increasingly vulnerable.

“Joint investigations like this one demonstrate how regulatory collaboration can more effectively address issues of global significance. By leveraging our combined powers, resources, and expertise, we are able to maximise our impact and better protect and promote the fundamental right to privacy of individuals across jurisdictions.”

Summary of the contraventions

The ICO found that 23andMe breached UK data protection law by:

Additionally, 23andMe's response to the incident was inadequate and they missed many opportunities to act, including:

Despite all this activity, the company did not start a full investigation until October 2023, when a 23andMe employee discovered that the stolen data had been advertised for sale on Reddit. Only then did 23andMe confirm that a breach had occurred.

The ICO states that by the end of 2024, the security improvements made by 23andMe were sufficient to bring an end to the breaches identified in the regulator's provisional decision.

Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the dollar.

Stablecoins—a form of cryptocurrency backed by traditional assets—are gaining traction, with the US Senate set to vote Tuesday on a bill to regulate such digital tokens.

But as stablecoins move closer to the financial mainstream, experts warn that weak regulation could leave investors and the financial system vulnerable.

Stablecoins play a key role in crypto markets, enabling users to trade digital assets without relying on traditional banks, instead using a decentralized register known as blockchain.

Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, stablecoins track the value of traditional assets—such as the US dollar or gold—enabling greater stability.

Tether and USDC, for example, are pegged to the dollar, backed by reserves held by their issuing companies.

They are useful internationally because they enable ""fast, low-cost cross-border payments"", Dessislava Aubert, analyst at crypto insights firm Kaiko, told AFP.

This is ""especially valuable in emerging markets where access to hard currency and traditional banking services is often limited"", Aubert added.

Examples include Argentina, Nigeria and Turkey.

The market value of stablecoins soared to $246 billion in May, up from $20 billion in 2020, according to Deutsche Bank.

And the total number of transactions in 2024 surpassed those of Visa and Mastercard.

USDC's issuer, Circle, made a splash this month when it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

To ensure the stability of stablecoins, the United States is pushing for issuers to hold sufficient low-risk, liquid assets—such as dollars and Treasury bills.

This could also boost demand for US debt and the greenback.

The proposed legislation would require major stablecoin issuers to undergo regular audits and make it tougher to launch new tokens.

These safeguards became more urgent after the collapse of the Terra stablecoin in 2022, which showed how these tokens can ""depeg"", or lose the link to the asset they are meant to track.

There's a risk that an organization may not be trustworthy or could be hacked, making audits and checks vital, explained Murat Kantarcioglu, a computer science professor at Virginia Tech University in the United States.

Another possibility is that a loss of trust in the stablecoin may ripple beyond the crypto world, hitting the assets that back these tokens.

""The new rules could make it harder for start-ups to issue stablecoins, creating a risk that a few big companies—such as tech giants—could dominate the market,"" Aubert told AFP over email.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Amazon and Walmart are considering issuing their own stablecoin, which their customers could use for purchases.

Democrats opposing the bill say risks of speculation, money laundering and political conflicts of interest associated with stablecoins are not sufficiently addressed.

Notably, President Donald Trump's family has helped launch a stablecoin called USD1, used by Emirati fund MGX.

And even with new regulations, in the event of issuer bankruptcy, stablecoin losses ""are not explicitly covered by government insurance programs"", unlike ""bank deposits, which are insured up to $250,000"", Aubert pointed out.

In Europe, regulation on cryptocurrencies (MiCA), effective since the end of December, provides a framework for issuing stablecoins.

The UK, South Korea and Brazil are moving forward with regulations.

China banned cryptocurrencies in 2021 and is instead developing its own central bank digital currency, the e-yuan.

Russia is considering a stablecoin backed by the ruble or friendly currencies such as the yuan.

                    Traditional DevOps tools won't be able to meet the demands of Web3. Our expert explains why crypto-native tools are necessary instead.
                

Not too long ago, blockchain was a fringe technology, but now it is firmly in the mainstream, powering Web3 and actively reshaping industries like finance and logistics. For developers, blockchain's explosive growth brings both opportunities and challenges, as traditional tools simply can't keep up.

As blockchain technology gains momentum, a new wave of DevOps practices must arise to meet the demands of a decentralized future: crypto-native DevOps. It's an exciting frontier where blockchain, cryptocurrency and open-source collaboration converge to drive a new level of transformation.

More on Web3Decentralized Apps (DApps): 16 Examples to Know

 

In the transition from Web2 to Web3, where decentralization rules, developers are no longer just building apps but crafting ecosystems. This responsibility comes with complex requirements that demand new solutions, however. Tools created specifically for blockchain enable developers to keep pace with the demands of these decentralized systems.

Blockchain operates on fundamentally different principles from centralized systems because it is distributed, immutable and governed by consensus. These attributes introduce technical challenges that standard development tools weren't designed to handle.

For example, blockchain apps must manage transactions across decentralized networks. When bottlenecks arise, traditional tools like legacy databases or performance monitoring solutions often struggle to address them. Developers need tools that can optimize workloads for distributed environments.

These new tools must also be able to debug complex smart contracts. Unlike traditional apps, smart contract failures can have irreversible consequences, including locked funds or compromised functionality. Debugging tools for blockchain must be built to handle the unique complexities of decentralized protocols.

Additionally, Web3 tools must be equipped to handle security risks across multiple chains. Blockchain is all about transparency, but this transparency creates vulnerabilities. Developers need blockchain-native security tools that can handle everything from real-time threat detection to cryptographic auditing.

 

Crypto-native DevOps is a new field that refers to developing operational practices and tools specifically for the challenges in blockchain ecosystems. Blockchain-specific tools are not just upgrades from traditional systems but represent entirely new approaches to development that help developers navigate the intricate nature of decentralized architectures and unlock the true potential of Web3.

These tools equip developers with optimized DevOps pipelines. In other words, next-gen DevOps approaches tailored for blockchain make it easy to deploy, scale, and manage decentralized applications (dApps). Tools designed for these ecosystems prioritize automation, providing developers the agility required for continuous integration and deployment.

Take Moralis, for example, which is essentially a backend-as-a-service for Web3. Instead of spending weeks setting up servers, syncing blockchains, and dealing with complicated infrastructure, developers can plug into Moralis and instantly launch their decentralized applications. Think of it as Shopify for Web3. It provides developers with all the tools to build quickly and scale easily, so they can use it to manage users, wallets, and even NFTs without getting bogged down in technical setup. It dramatically shortens the path from idea to execution, and that's gold for lean teams and startups.

Crypto-native tools also provide real-time analytics and monitoring. Distributed systems can experience fluctuations in transaction speeds, consensus mechanisms and node reliability. Blockchain-specific tools equipped with real-time analytics empower developers to maintain performance and anticipate issues before they escalate.

Tenderly is an example of a tool for real-time analytics and performance monitoring. It gives developers a real-time dashboard showing how their smart contracts behave on the blockchain, like a live EKG for their code. It helps them spot issues like failing transactions, high gas usage or unusual user behavior before they become expensive problems. For developers and founders, it's like having a 24/seven blockchain performance assistant — helping them sleep better at night.

Third, blockchain-specific tools give developers cross-chain compatibility. With the rise of multichain ecosystems, interoperability is a must. Blockchain-native tools simplify cross-chain API integrations, enabling developers to navigate the differences between platforms like Ethereum, Solana and Polkadot.

LayerZero is a good example of a tool for cross-chain compatibility. This tool acts like a universal translator for blockchains. Instead of building an app to work on just Ethereum or Solana, LayerZero allows developers to connect to these and many others seamlessly. As a result, users can interact with their dApp using assets and data from multiple blockchains without even realizing it. For businesses, this means more reach, less friction, and one unified experience across the fragmented blockchain world.

Finally, crypto-native tools offer user-friendly smart contract management. They allow developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts without worrying about introducing catastrophic bugs. Many blockchain suites integrate testing environments that simulate real-world deployment scenarios to ensure smooth execution. 

Foundry is an example of a developer toolkit that helps developers write smart contracts in Ethereum's programming language, Solidity. Best of all, it makes the process remarkably safe and efficient. It's like a sandbox where developers can stress-test their code, simulate edge cases and catch bugs before anything goes live. This capacity is crucial because even a minor mistake in smart contract code can result in substantial financial losses.

 

In traditional DevOps environments, collaboration can sometimes be hindered by proprietary constraints or organizational silos. On the other hand, crypto-native DevOps thrives on open-source principles, powered by transparent and trustless systems.

Cryptocurrency incentivizes many DevOps professionals for their contributions to open-source projects. These incentives reward individual effort and promote a culture of shared knowledge and collective innovation. Tokens and smart contracts can dynamically reassign rewards based on contribution metrics, enabling a self-regulating system that continuously drives open-source collaboration forward.

Platforms like Gitcoin and SourceCred are already leading the way. They use blockchain technology to allocate funding and recognition to contributors who consistently add value to open-source repositories. This alignment of economic incentives with collaborative development accelerates innovation and makes it likelier that the best ideas rise to the top.

Tools created for the new realm of blockchain lower the barrier to entry. User-friendly tools enable developers of all skill levels to contribute meaningfully to Web3 ecosystems. They offer plug-and-play integrations and simplified front-end access points critical for driving innovation forward.

Of course, blockchain development doesn't exist in a vacuum. It remains tied to the broader vision of enabling decentralized systems that empower individuals and businesses. With tools purpose-built for these tasks, developers are no longer hindered by the constraints of traditional systems. Instead, they're free to innovate, experiment and ultimately redefine what's possible.

In the near future, decentralization will reshape everything from our data sharing to trust mechanisms. Developers will be the architects of this transformation, but will need tools that do more than adapt to the blockchain to rise to this challenge. They need tools that were born for it.","{'href': 'https://builtin.com', 'title': 'Built In'}","cryptocurrency"

Ether (ETH) ETH$2,539.62 traded at $2,555.77 on Tuesday, down 3.7% over the past 24 hours after a sharp rejection near the $2,673 level triggered a wave of selling. The downturn follows several sessions of declining momentum and increasing volatility, culminating in a major sell-off late Monday that broke through initial support and left prices trending downward for most of the day.

Despite this weakness in price action, on-chain data suggests that larger market participants continue to treat the pullback as an opportunity to accumulate. According to Glassnode, daily net whale accumulation has exceeded 800,000 ETH for nearly a week, with total holdings in 1,000 to 10,000 ETH wallets rising above 14.3 million. The largest single-day inflow occurred on June 12, when whale wallets added more than 871,000 ETH — the biggest net inflow of 2025 so far.

This accumulation trend mirrors behavior last seen in 2017, underscoring the scale and intensity of recent large-holder buying. The whale buying spree has coincided with Ethereum's retreat from $2,700 levels and may reflect strategic positioning ahead of further developments in institutional flows or ETF-related catalysts.

While technicals remain under pressure in the short term, the magnitude of this buying activity signals growing conviction among large entities. With prices hovering just above key support, traders and analysts are watching closely to see whether this whale-driven accumulation translates into a near-term reversal or simply cushions further downside.

The U.S. may soon go to war against Iran, and crypto markets aren't liking the prospect.

Bitcoin BTC$105,141.22 is down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, trading under $104,000 yet again. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, exchange coins and memecoins — lost 6.1% in the same period of time, with ether ETH$2,539.62 and solana SOL$150.21 both slumping 7% and sui SUI$2.90 dipping almost 10%.

Crypto stocks are also taking a hit, with Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and Circle (CRLC) all down 2%-3%, and bitcoin miners such as Bitdeer (BTDR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK), HIVE (HIVE) and Hut 8 (HUT) losing 6%-7%.

The market move came as President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. could soon get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump posted on social media, referring to Iranian head of state Ali Khamenei. “He is an easy target, but he is safe there - we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”

Trump also called for Iran to surrender unconditionally, and for residents of Tehran to evacuate the city. The national security council was convened, according to the White House, and Trump himself cut short a G7 summit to focus on the issue.

Odds of U.S. military action against Iran before July have soared to 65% on Polymarket.

“The sudden and severe escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict introduced a significant geopolitical risk premium, prompting an immediate flight from risk assets across the board, to which crypto has not proven immune,” said Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, Chief Investment Officer at XBTO.

“The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard; any credible de-escalation in the Middle East could serve as a significant risk-on catalyst, while a further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets,” he added.

Matteo Greco, senior analyst at Finequia, shared the same sentiment, adding that the war could end up having significant consequences on the U.S. economic outlook. “Should Israeli military actions impact Iran's oil production, a spike in oil prices could follow, fueling renewed inflationary pressures,” Greco said.

A trader on decentralized derivatives exchange HyperLiquid has turned an unrealized $10 million profit into a $2.5 million loss, seemingly caught by the same trap that tripped up a person using the alias James Wynn, who blew up a $100 million account in May, after bitcoin BTC$105,141.22 fell 4% from Monday's high.

The trader, known as AguilaTrades on X, entered a bitcoin long position at $106,000, and sat through at Monday's high of $108,800 before the largest cryptocurrency took a tumble to trade recently around $104,000.

Bitcoin volatility has been relatively low for months, with the price ranging between the $100,000 level of support and record highs around $110,000. That hasn't perturbed derivatives traders, who are continually betting on upside with leverage, subsequently getting chopped in a tight range.

It's not the first time AguilaTrades has recorded a losing trade at these levels. Last week they were up $5.8 million on a BTC long before losing $12.5 million, according to Lookonchain.

On paper the trade has credentials because BTC has managed to remain above $100,000 despite escalating conflict in the Middle East, which is typically a catalyst for downside in risk assets.

However, remaining agnostic to price action in this range and simply buying support and selling resistance would have yielded far greater results. Bitcoin has been trading in this range since May 9 with numerous attempts at breaking support and resistance along the way.

 The question of RWA backing is not primarily a technology question but is subject to other considerations, industry executives say. 

The real-world asset (RWA) market has emerged as one of the key trends in the cryptocurrency industry in 2025, with companies increasingly jumping on the tokenization bandwagon.

Although some studies pointed to a massive 260% increase of RWAs this year, some industry executives have questioned the magnitude of the reported market size, arguing that the sector is still too nascent and relatively small.

Industry executives told Cointelegraph that slow adoption may stem from outdated regulations, limited access and widespread misunderstandings of how tokenized assets are backed.  

However, the question of RWA backing is not just one of technology, but is subject to other considerations.

The question of backing in RWAs is important since crypto tokens are often driven by hype, marketing or memes rather than real fundamentals, Adam Levi, co-founder of the tokenization platform Backed, told Cointelegraph.

“For real-world assets like tokenized equities, trust depends entirely on how the product is structured and how transparent and regulated the issuer is,” Levi said.

When evaluating financial RWA tokens like those issued by Backed's xStocks, it's important to understand that their backing is more than a technology question, according to Levi.

“It's a legal and financial one,” he said, adding that the guarantee is the issuer's binding legal obligation to maintain full backing and transparent issuance and redemption mechanisms, governed by clear regulations:

TZero's executive vice president, Alan Konevsky, said tokenization of RWAs, particularly those based on physical objects like real estate or collectibles, cannot be a fully automated process just yet.

“Financial instruments, arguably in particular if it's also tokenized, can be fully automated,” he said, adding that tokenization of physical assets requires intermediation by traditional market participants.

RWA backing is a real issue for the industry, but it's not unique to crypto, as similar challenges exist in traditional investments like real estate, Stobox co-founder Ross Shemeliak told Cointelegraph.

“Tokenization is just an investment method here,” Shemeliak said, agreeing that responsibility currently falls on tokenization providers, who conduct enhanced due diligence and review the offering memorandum, underlying assets and legal restrictions.

“Still, this isn't a 100% safety guarantee: Verification complexities sometimes lead providers to launch scam projects,” he noted, suggesting a solution in the form of data-rich RWA tokens, where the smart contract holds repository data and asset details directly on the blockchain.

According to Shemeliak, data-rich RWA tokens don't just represent ownership, but embed or link to structured, dynamic data about the asset, such as valuation, legal status and other data.

“This creates a new level of transparency, interoperability, and investor trust, something traditional securities and early-stage tokens often lacked,” he said.

Among industry examples of data-rich RWA token technology, Shemeliak mentioned Chainlink's proof-of-reserves and crosschain Interoperability protocol, implemented by platforms like Backed Finance, Maple Finance and Centrifuge.

Additionally, Stobox found that the top five jurisdictions for running a tokenization deal are the British Virgin Islands, the US State of Wyoming, Liechtenstein, Singapore and the Marshall Islands.

“Despite being among the top five in terms of regulatory quality and efficiency, Singapore and Luxembourg remain underutilized as special purpose vehicle destinations for tokenization deals: They account for less than 2% of global deals,” Stobox said in its Tokenization Jurisdiction Report shared with Cointelegraph.

What Greenland's Ancient Past Reveals about Its Fragile Future

The collapse of the world's second-largest ice sheet would drown cities worldwide. Is that ice more vulnerable than we know?

By Jeffery DelViscio edited by Jen Schwartz & Seth Fletcher

Expedition members Caleb Walcott-George and Arnar Pall Gíslason use a hand drill to pull rock cores out of an outcropping, called a nunatak on the Greenland ice sheet in May 2024. The samples they extract could help solve a much larger climate puzzle: When was the last time that Greenland was green?

Inside a tent fastened to the surface of Greenland's ice sheet, the members of the GreenDrill expedition huddled around a drilling rig. The machine whined and shook as it spun. For days the drillers had been inching through ancient, solid ice to reach the rock below.

Outside, the sun burned down through a cloudless sky. The wind, having tumbled down 4,000 feet of elevation from the domed summit of the ice sheet hundreds of miles to the west, charged over the surface in wavelike pulses. The tent shuddered like some mad bouncy house at the end of the world. The nine members of the expedition—ice and rock engineers, scientists, polar-survival specialists—knew they should be close to bedrock. But Forest Harmon, the driller working the handwheel, said he still couldn't feel the core break—the moment when the metal catcher inside the drill head separates the bedrock core from its earthly tomb.

The GreenDrill site sat on the frozen edge of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, or NEGIS, a massive, moving tongue of ice that drains 12 to 16 percent of the ice sheet into the ocean. Upended and laid atop the contiguous U.S., it would look like a flowing mountain range more than a mile and half tall at its highest point and 20 to 30 miles across, extending from Boston to Washington, D.C. If the entire Greenland ice sheet melted, global sea levels would rise by about 24 feet. The NEGIS is how a good deal of that planet-altering flood would enter the sea.

The sheet won't melt all at once, of course, but scientists are increasingly concerned by signs of accelerating ice-sheet retreat. A recent report showed that it has been losing mass every year for the past 27 years. Another study found that nearly every Greenlandic glacier has thinned or retreated in the past few decades. The NEGIS itself has extensively sped up and thinned over the past decade.

Elliot Moravec, the mechanical engineer monitoring the drill-fluid pressure gauge, smiled, but only slightly. It seemed like something was about to go right, finally—in an expedition where almost nothing had before the team made it to the ice. So much in the weeks leading up to this moment had been uncertain. There were logistical delays and failed landings by military cargo planes. A more ambitious plan, which included a much larger drill and two different sample sites, had been scrapped. The project's two principal investigators were both forced to forfeit the field season at the last minute. One of them had come all the way to Greenland only to have to turn around. The other made the painful decision to not even try to make it to the ice. The rest of the team was marooned for weeks in Kangerlussuaq, a staging location on Greenland's southwestern coast, about 850 miles from the drill site. Then it had taken more than 10 flights over seven days to get them and tens of thousands of pounds of gear onto the ice.

But at this moment, with just two weeks remaining in the expedition, their bit sat at the edge of discovery. The zone below was thought to hold within it a revelation: frozen in stone was a picture of this place but ice-free. Knowing the last time this area was actually green would help scientists answer a question of enormous consequence: Is the Greenland ice sheet even more fragile than we know?

Since President Donald Trump announced his administration's desire to “get” the world's largest island, Greenland has been the subject of sudden global attention. Climate change is exposing land formerly covered by ice, heightening political tensions on the island nation—and in the waters surrounding it as sea ice also disappears. But although the administration's plan to extract Greenland's natural resources is new, the American desire to occupy it, and pull value from underneath its frozen heart, is not.

In 1956 and 1957 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment, or SIPRE, recovered the first long ice cores from Greenland. Europeans and Americans alike had been trying to cross and dig into the ice sheet for decades before then. The “father of continental drift” himself, Alfred Wegener, is still entombed there. Wegener made four expeditions to study Greenland's ice in his lifetime. During his final expedition, in 1930, he died out on the ice. Just before he became a part of the ice record, he wrote: “We are approaching a new era of polar exploration characterized by the successful utilization of new technologies in a rational manner. Everything that we want to and can measure must be measured on the ground.”

In 1956 American scientists were doing exactly that, but the reason they were there at all had as much to do with the cold war as it did with the cold ice. The government's real mission was to build Arctic capabilities so it could both operate and listen from somewhere much closer to the Soviet Union. The location where SIPRE pulled those first deep ice cores from was called Site 2, and despite its public science mission, it was also a top-secret radar installation watching 24-7 for Soviet threats. But the tense geopolitics allowed a scientific discovery that, until then, had seemed impossible: the recovery of deep ice cores that kicked off an international race to recover and interrogate deeper and deeper ice. Those ice cores, and all that would be collected after them, became a kind of high-resolution climatological bedrock on which much of our understanding of rapid climate change rests.

Daniel P. Huffman

Although it is difficult to count the number of ice cores in existence, adding up the length of ice in just the freezers owned by Denmark (Greenland is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark) and the U.S. gives you more than 21 miles of ancient ice. Researchers have dated them, measured the pressure of their enclosed air bubbles, characterized the structure of their snow, detected ancient volcanic cataclysms in their particulate content, and more. The results have given us an indirect way to track the timing of large and abrupt shifts in climate as far back as 123,000 years ago in the case of Greenland and 1.2 million years ago for ice extracted from Antarctica. “They are basically a backbone of climate science in terms of giving us these continuous, high-resolution climate records,” says Joerg Schaefer, GreenDrill's co-principal investigator.

I have a personal 25-year history with one of these backbones. As an undergraduate researcher, I lived for a month on an oceanographic research vessel off Baja California. The mission was to collect sediment cores from the ocean floor. I spent hours and hours taking measurements—more than 30,000 of them—with my face pressed close to stinking, methane-rich mud.

Like ice cores, the sediment cores had visible horizontal bands. Ice cores' bands come from seasonal variations in snowfall; in this marine mud, the winter sediment from above showed up one color, the summer sediment another. I used a measurement technique that allowed me to pull a climate signal out of the alternating light and dark bands. But to confirm that those climate wiggles were real, I had to try to match what I saw with other records that climatologists were really sure showed a strong connection to the hot and cold climate swings of the past; enter Greenland's ice cores.

In 1999, when I was doing my research, the gold standards for such climate-record wiggle matching were ice cores from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) or from the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP). These two projects were a kind of friendly arms race between two different teams—one led by scientists in the U.S. (GISP2), the other by researchers in Europe (GRIP)—but without all the cold war skulduggery. Starting at nearly the same time (the Americans got a one-field-season jump on the Europeans), the two projects, less than 20 miles from each other near the summit of the Greenland ice sheet, raced to the bottom of the ice.

In July 1992 Europe won. That team reached the bed nearly 10,000 feet below the surface and stopped at the end of the ice. When the U.S. group finished a year later, not only did its core reach deeper than 10,000 feet, but the scientists were also able to collect a five-foot-long core of some of the rarest rock in the world—rock from under an ice sheet.

These two deep climatic records became standards to benchmark other records against. My mud record stretched from the present back to about 52,000 years ago. I could take that record of wiggles from dark (cold world above) to light (warmer world above) and see whether the same temperature-related wiggles pulled from the ice core matched up. They did.

Many other climate researchers saw the same thing. In the three decades since these two cores were pulled from the ice sheet, tree rings, coral, cave deposits, other sediments and ice cores from across the world have all been successfully wiggle-matched to the records.

But in all the years researchers spent hunting for ice and finding out all they could about its nature, they mostly neglected to interrogate the stuff the ice is sitting on. That is a critical gap in our knowledge that is just waiting to be closed. “Those bed materials, whether it's sediment or hard bedrock contained within it, are the words, the stories of the history of the ice sheet—it's a book of information down there that we want to read,” says Jason Briner of the University at Buffalo, the other co-principal investigator of GreenDrill. “The bedrock under ice sheets is the least explored remaining zone on Earth's surface,” Schaefer says. “These are moon rocks for us—the most rare and the most hard-to-drill surface rocks anywhere on Earth—and we have practically no direct observations.”

Schaefer and Briner have spent more than a decade fixated on this deep gap in climate science. What they have already found is sobering. “I have, for the first time ever in my career, datasets that take my sleep away at night,” Schaefer says. “They are so direct and tell me this ice sheet is in so much trouble.”

The data that terrify him come from the rock collected in 1993 under the GISP2 ice core. The ice core went off to be immortalized in thousands of research papers as a centerpiece of climate science. The bedrock went into cold storage in the U.S. ice-core repository in Colorado. There it sat for almost two decades. In 2016 Schaefer, Briner and their collaborators exhumed the rock core and read it like a buried history book. They published a research paper in Nature entitled “Greenland Was Nearly Ice-Free for Extended Periods during the Pleistocene.”

The Pleistocene, a period that includes the last ice age, stretched from around 2.6 million to 11,000 years ago, when woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats and the first modern humans roamed over earth and ice. From that one sub-ice rock core, the researchers learned that during that epoch there were periods—at least one, possibly many—when the ice sheet was completely gone or nearly so. “You do one data point, bedrock underneath the thickest part of the Greenland ice sheet, so you basically have to melt the entire ice sheet to make that spot ice-free,” Schaefer says. “Even there the bedrock was telling us, ‘Hell, yes, I was ice-free a lot over the last geological period.'”

“It started what some people like to call the fragile Greenland hypothesis,” says Paul Bierman, an author and geoscientist at the University of Vermont. Bierman and others have found additional evidence to support the worrying idea. In 2023 he and his colleagues published a study that showed “multiple lines of evidence” indicating much of northwestern Greenland was ice-free around 400,000 years ago. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere then was less than 300 parts per million. Today we're at 428 parts per million.

The GreenDrill team is preparing to publish new findings that are even more unnerving for humanity. Caleb Walcott-George, soon to be an assistant professor in the department of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Kentucky, was a graduate student during the first two field seasons of the project. At a recent academic conference, he presented solid evidence that an area in northwestern Greenland three times the size of New York City and currently covered by ice a third of a mile thick was either completely or nearly completely ice-free as recently as about 7,000 years ago. That corresponds with a time called the Holocene Thermal Maximum, when temperatures were just a few degrees warmer on average than they are now. Walcott-George says that's within the range of warming we might experience by 2100.

Not long after Moravec sensed that the drilling rig was on the verge of core break, the team pulled its first sample of the season up from 165 feet below. Minutes later the core sat inside the capped inner core barrel, ready for inspection.

Walcott-George and Allie Balter-Kennedy of Tufts University stood shoulder to shoulder in a small, blacked-out tent originally designed for spearfishing pike over a frozen lake. The only light was a dim tangerine glow coming from a single LED strip taped to the ceiling. Balter-Kennedy and Walcott-George screwed off the drill head at the end of the barrel, tipped the tube up at an angle and gently shook it to get the material inside to slide out into the tray. This rock could tell them when it last saw the light of day. It also “remembered” how long it had been buried. But that memory was delicate, and even a flash of sunlight could throw it off.

Certain minerals in the rock act like batteries by “charging” when they are buried. Radioactive decay in elements surrounding the grains strips their electrons, causing the grains to luminesce, although the rocks don't visibly glow. “We can determine essentially the charge rate, and by doing this we can figure out how long these quartz and feldspar grains have been buried,” Walcott-George says. But even seconds of sunshine can reset this signal, so every time a piece of rock is unearthed from below the ice sheet, they return to the blacked-out tent.

There is another source of stored memory in a subglacial stone, and it originates inside the hearts of dying stars. The cataclysmic explosions that mark the death of a star throw cosmic rays across the galaxy. Those rays blast their way to Earth, creating a cascade of elementary particles that buffet the planet's surface. “When they interact with rocks, they create these nuclear reactions that create isotopes or nuclides that we don't otherwise find on Earth,” Balter-Kennedy explains. “We know the rate at which those nuclides are produced. If we can measure them, we can figure out how long that rock has been exposed to these cosmic rays—or, in our field, how long that rock has been ice-free.”

It's called surface exposure dating, and it works by revealing the total amount of rare isotopes in the rock sample. Over time, periods of sun exposure and burial create on/off spikes in the total amount of nuclides in the rock, with exposed being “on” and covered being “off.”

Allie Balter-Kennedy, now at Tufts University, and Walcott-George, soon to be at the University of Kentucky, measure and package a core sample in a blacked-out fishing tent. The samples have to be protected from contaminating sunlight, which would throw off the climate signal the researchers are trying to extract.

Jeffery DelViscio

If researchers take two of these nuclides—say, beryllium-10 and aluminum-26—and measure their relative levels along many feet of a rock core, they get what's called the decay clock. This clock runs down as each isotope decays at a different, predictable rate. When scientists see parts of the rock record where the clock has gained time, they know that the surface saw the sun. When the sample is buried, the clock slowly loses time in a countdown to zero cosmogenic nuclides.

The two methods allow the scientists to interview the bedrock, so to speak. “You ask: When have you been ice-free? For how long? And how many times have you been ice-free in the recent geological past?” Schaefer says. But that day in the tent it appeared that there might be no bedrock to interview. The core they had pulled up wasn't quite right.

“Where's that smooth bed?” Walcott-George asked, referring to the solid bedrock pay dirt they were looking for.

“I feel like it's gravelly ice, and then ...” Balter-Kennedy trailed off.

“Dirty ice,” Walcott-George said, completing the thought.

They decided they'd try again tomorrow.

Approximately 5,500,000,000,000 tons. That is how much water weight the Greenland ice sheet has lost to the ocean since just 2002. Sequentially dumped into Olympic-size natatoriums, it would provide a personal 660,000-gallon lap pool for every person living in Africa and Europe—all 2.2 billion of them.

But how, exactly, future melt will bring more green to Greenland is one of the biggest questions that science has yet to answer. “The scientific community right now does not know how the Greenland ice sheet disintegrates,” Briner says. “We don't know what the mechanisms are and how long it takes for the ice sheet to get to its teeny-tiny state.”

In discussions of Antarctica, the word “collapse” is now often associated with the loss of ice through ice shelves such as the Thwaites, a floating extension of the Antarctic ice sheet. Nearly 75 percent of Antarctica's coastal ice is in ice shelves floating in water. But the fate of Greenland is believed to be tied to that of its ice streams, which are more like small tongues that ring the island and are confined by deeply carved fjords.

Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, a Danish ice-core climatologist, first came to the Greenland ice sheet in 1981. Back then, “no one was talking about global warming,” she says. When she told people she was drilling ice cores for climate research, they assumed she was investigating when the next ice age would arrive. In her four decades of working on this ice sheet, Dahl-Jensen has seen changes happen in real time. One day in 2012 she was on the ice—and it rained. “I saw it as a very pure sign of global warming that we actually got rain on the center of the Greenland ice sheet,” she says.

Some of the displayed drill bits for the Winkie Drill system are best for drilling through ice; some are for cutting through bedrock.

More recently Dahl-Jensen led research for the East Greenland Ice-Core Project, which in 2023 managed to pull a 1.5-mile-long ice core (and some subglacial mud and stone) from close to where the NEGIS begins. The entire process had taken eight years. “When you look at the balance of the ice sheet and how much it has lost, half of the extra loss is from melt along the coast of Greenland, but the other half is from acceleration of the ice in the streams,” she says. Dahl-Jensen knows that ice streams are a big factor in sea-level rise, but she's also aware that we don't yet know how they behave. “We are not capable of modeling them properly into our ice-sheet models,” she explains.

That is why the GreenDrill team wanted to get bedrock underneath the NEGIS from a site much closer to where it meets the coast. Measurements from each of these projects will feed into the mathematical models, which attempt to simulate how the real world works. “We have so many gaps in our physical understanding of how an ice sheet actually responds,” Schaefer says, noting that current models have big error margins.

Ice-sheet models work much like the climate models we use all the time—the ones that predict tomorrow's weather. They use mathematics to simulate the interactions among real atmospheric phenomena: wind, pressure, moisture, thermodynamics, and lots more. They are reasonably trustworthy over hours to days because they are loaded with real data: historical data; measurements from weather satellites and balloons; and observations from land, sea and commercial aircraft.

Improving the ability of ice-sheet models to accurately predict how the sheet will respond to the warming it is experiencing now—and that yet to come—is no different. The models need data-based gut checks to make sure their predictions are informed and constrained by as much reality as we can feed into them.

Schaefer believes reducing the error will make ice-sheet models better tools for adapting to climate change. “If you are a politician and you want to make New York City—or any city that is close to the ocean—sea-level safe, you need precise predictions of what is going to happen,” he says. And those predictions will become increasingly vital as the world moves deeper and deeper into its climate-warmed future—a future that those who study Greenland fear will be societally altering.

“Think about the mass migration that will happen if we melt all of the Greenland ice sheet,” Bierman says. “That's not tomorrow—that's centuries from now and even millennia from now—but when that happens, that will be the biggest movement of humans ever because they'll lose their farms, they'll lose their cities, they'll lose their homes,” he says. “It will be creeping and slow, but it will happen.”

The day after the heartbreak in the fishing tent, the team hit solid rock. It was what they had come for, and they found it just in time. A blizzard blew through camp hours later, shutting down drilling for the next two days.

When the work resumed, the team decided to try for a second core. This one would be half as deep as the first, so, the researchers reasoned, maybe they could get even more precious rock from under the ice to interrogate in half the time it took to get the first sample. All work had to be wrapped up within a week to leave them enough time to pack up for extraction. With good-enough weather, the twin-engine ski plane would be landing at the site, and it wasn't going to wait for anything.

Over the next two days they made good progress. Rather than setting up the drill tent all over again, they decided to chance a mostly unprotected drill hole. A small wind break was all that separated them from the wind and blowing ice. While Moravec, Harmon and Tanner Kuhl, the third and most experienced ice-drilling engineer, started again, the others fanned out onto the nunataks, dark peaks that broke through the ice-bound oblivion like the heads of whales surfacing through the ocean of ice. There Walcott-George, Balter-Kennedy and Arnar Pall Gíslason, the team's survival guide, used backpack-size rock drills to take a core from the surface of a nunatak. The rock was constantly exposed to sun and cosmic rays, and the luminescence signal and cosmogenic nuclides pulled from it would provide the baseline against which the under-the-ice-sheet rock cores would be compared. Just as it started to look like they might have this victory-lap sampling in the bag, a second blizzard blasted through the site.

“Let's get the hell out of here,” yelled Matt Anfinson, the camp mechanic. He emerged from the drill tent into a whiteout. The storm was still picking up. The drill tent, the only refuge aside from the mess and sleeping tents, was bowing ominously in the 50-mile-per-hour winds. It was time for the team to grope its way back to camp with only a line of red flags to guide it through the nearly zero-visibility conditions.

For the past three hours the group had been involved in a kind of mechanical open-heart surgery. The patients were two backpack drills that had stopped working during sampling on the nearby nunatak. The team had brought two to be safe; both had died. The drills lay on the worktable, guts exposed. After fiddling with the ignition coils, Anfinson ripped on the starter pulls. As one drill spun into high gear through smoke and sputter, he looked like an ice-field Dr. Frankenstein, gleefully and maniacally gazing on his reincarnation. It was a rare victory amid a “weather daze,” as Harmon, the driller, called it.

Balter-Kennedy breaks a bedrock core into pieces for packaging and shipment. This core was the last one the team collected before being extracted from the GreenDrill camp.

Living through blizzards like these feels like what you'd expect inside a sensory-deprivation white-noise machine. This latitude sees no darkness in May and June, but without a break in the gale-force winds, the conditions outside are both bright and blinding. Wind-sculpted snowdrifts grow through the field camp like giant, icy fingers. They block the doors of sleeping tents and make walking treacherous; you either trip on a three-foot-tall snow wall that wasn't there hours before or fall off one into three feet of powder.

There was a cruel monotony to the continuous winds. They forced the crew into smaller and smaller circles of living—sleep tent to mess tent to bathroom tent and back. Barbara Olga Hild, the polar bear guard, fought through the long, bright nights to keep the electrified wire fence around the camp from being covered by drifting snow. Walcott-George sat in the mess tent brewing carafe after carafe of strong coffee and engaging in Arctic self-care, using superglue to seal his dry, cracked fingers against drilling fluid. Balter-Kennedy patched punctures and tears in her favorite polar bib and pored over her core-sample logbooks. Moravec and Harmon played cribbage for hours. Everyone skulked outside into the whiteout on rotation to fill an orange five-gallon cooler with snow to be melted on a camp stove for water (it is ironic how much effort it takes to make drinkable water when we are surrounded by ice).

Perversely, it was during the weather's harshest moments that people used to working on the ice opened up about why they seek out the cold and the isolation of polar work. “The reason people go to the Arctic is [that] you can hear the silence,” Hild said. Dahl-Jensen, the Danish ice-core scientist, told me that the months of near-complete isolation from the rest of the world have become a prized part of the experience, worth any amount of cold and discomfort. “We live in our camp and do our research, and the time where you can only focus on one thing is really wonderful,” she said. That feeling—of slowing down, of concentration—is something many on the team told me they miss when they're off the ice. “I always dread the end of a field season,” Balter-Kennedy said. On the other side is the stark return to normal life, the avalanche of unanswered e-mails, the fact that things are different than when you left them.

When the storm finally cleared after three days, the team practically launched through the tent opening to get back to work. Because of the blizzard, they had just two full days to complete the new drill hole. The first core took a week to get, and that was without any weather delays. Everything had to go right now.

Just one day later the entire team was standing around the drill and taking in the last sample before packing up. The drill had burned through almost 70 feet of ice. The weather was sunny. The day felt unseasonably warm—about 15 degrees Fahrenheit above freezing—and the team easily cranked through the last drilling run. As the last rock core entered the bottom of the barrel, the sounds of the rock band Ween floated out onto the open ice.

The core came up clean. The team closed the hole with a cheer and a small pour of the Danish liqueur Gammel Dansk, or, as it was better known here, “driller's fluid.” It wasn't for the crew. “You were a good hole,” Harmon said as Moravec poured booze down to the bedrock.

Walcott-George hoisted the final rock core like a prize striped bass. Then, as they had done all season, he and Balter-Kennedy noted its lengths and features and stored it for transport, not yet knowing what story of Greenland's ice-free past, and our flooded future, it might tell.

Why iNaturalist Users Freaked Out over a Google AI Grant

The nonprofit iNaturalist announced that it received a $1.5-million grant from Google's philanthropic arm to develop generative AI tools for species identification. The news didn't go over well

Can artificial intelligence help people learn about nature? And if so, is using this technology worth the environmental toll and other consequences? On June 10 the nonprofit organization iNaturalist, which runs a popular online platform for nature observers, announced in a blog post that it had received a $1.5-million grant from Google.org Accelerator: Generative AI—an initiative of Google's philanthropic arm—to “help build tools to improve the identification experience for the iNaturalist community.” More than 3.7 million people around the world—from weekend naturalists to professional taxonomists—use the platform to record observations of wild organisms and get help with identifying the species. To date, the iNaturalist community has logged upward of 250 million observations of more than half a million species, with some 430,000 members working to identify species from photographs, audio and text uploaded to the database. The announcement did not go over well with iNaturalist users, who took to the comments section of the blog post and a related forum, as well as Bluesky, in droves to voice their concerns.

Users submit “observations” of an individual organism they have encountered in the wild to the iNaturalist app on their phone or to the organization's website. Observations typically include one or more photographs of the organism and may include notes and audio. An AI-powered feature called “computer vision” then suggests possible species identifications based on photographs. Users can choose one of these IDs to assign to their observation or use a broader category such as “Plants” or “Fungi” if they prefer. The app automatically records the date, time and location of the observation. Once the user saves the observation, it is shared to the community, and members can weigh in on the identification of the organism, building consensus as the discussion grows. Once the community has identified an organism to the species level, the observation is considered “research grade,” meaning it can be shared with scientists who are carrying out a study of that species, for example.

In its blog post announcing the grant, iNaturalist noted, “By using generative AI (GenAI), we hope to synthesize information about how to distinguish different species and accurately convey that to iNaturalist users. Instead of just offering AI species suggestions of what you saw, we want to offer a why as well.” In the post, the organization said that it intends to develop a prototype of a tool to extend its computer vision identification capability to provide explanations of why this function suggests particular species and how to tell similar-looking species apart. Although iNaturalist did not provide details about how the GenAI tool would work, the post implied that it would synthesize existing information about identification from text comments that were provided by members of the community to generate identification tips. In the post, iNaturalist said it was aiming to produce a working demonstration of this new tool by the end of 2025.

The grant announcement met with backlash from community members. Many critics objected to the use of GenAI on environmental grounds—the technology uses vast amounts of energy and water, creates e-waste and drives demand for rare-earth metals, the mining of which contributes to habitat degradation. Detractors also worried that such a tool based on GenAI, which is notorious for “hallucinating,” would produce misinformation about species identifications. Others expressed concern about the possibility that their iNaturalist data could be used to devalue the work of professional taxonomists if the AI identification were presented as authoritative. Some said they would delete their accounts.

In response to the outcry from its users, iNaturalist has since made some clarifications: it has apologized for poor communication about the development and has offered assurances that it does not intend to replace the human-curated system of species identifications and that it will not give Google special access to user-contributed data. In a June 11 update to the blog post that announced the grant award, the organization wrote, “If the demo we create is not helpful, compromises data quality, has outsized environmental impacts, or is overall too flawed, we will not keep it.” And in a forum post, iNaturalist's executive director Scott Loarie wrote, “There's no way we're going to unleash AI generated slop onto the site. iNaturalist is about human connection and expertise and using technology to help elevate and support that.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Most of us know kryptonite as the mineral weakness of the otherwise invulnerable Superman. But geologists are also familiar with its real-world counterpart, known as Jadarite. Initially discovered in Serbia's Jadar Basin—the only place in the world where it's been found—in 2004, the mineral is actually sodium lithium borosilicate hydroxide, which is remarkably similar in chemical composition to the fictional kryptonite. (Additionally,  krypton is an unrelated chemical element, so jadarite is the most scientifically acceptable name.) 

Now, scientists at the Natural History Museum in the U.K. have discovered why the white mineral is so rare on Earth—producing the stuff requires a series of very specific geologic events. The results of this study were published this week in the journal Nature Geoscience.

“Similar to baking a cake, everything needs to be measured and exact for this rare mineral to form,” Natural History Museum scientist Francesco Putzolu, lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “For instance, if the mineral ingredients are not just right, if the conditions are too acidic or too cold, jadarite will not form.”

In jadarite's case, those ingredients include a precise interplay among an alkaline-rich terminal (or endorheic) lake, lithium-rich volcanic glass, and crystalline structures formed from clay minerals. A previous paper, published last month in Economic Geology (on which Putzolu was also the lead author), goes into more specifics. 

Arguably the most intriguing thing about jadarite is that it's immensely rich in lithium, which has become immensely valuable in the past few decades as humanity tries to transition away from fossil fuels. Lithium can be found in everything from EV batteries to the reactors that will (hopefully) eventually breed the necessary hydrogen isotopes for fusion energy. There's a reason many refer to lithium as “white gold.”

The Jadar (pronounced “Yadar”) deposit is one of the 10 largest lithium deposits in the world, and the authors estimate that if it was effectively mined, it could supply Europe with 90 percent of the lithium required for its electric vehicles. Understanding the exact geologic conditions under which jadarite can form should help scientists target other areas of the world that mean similar conditions, and thus could house more of the mineral. 

This is a similar approach to geologic efforts to hunt down potential sources of naturally occurring hydrogen and helium, which are used for green energy and advanced technologies like superconducting magnets. First, find the geologic recipe, then hunt for those conditions around the world. Finding other jadarite deposits could be particularly lucrative, as they have both a higher lithium content and lower energy route for extraction than other mineral lithium sources, such as spodumene.

“As the demand for lithium continues in the race toward renewable energy, if mined, jadarite can offer huge potential,” Natural History Museum geologist Robin Armstrong, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “This process brings us closer to identifying other possible deposits by unravelling the formation conditions in the lab.”

Kryptonite might've been Superman's greatest weakness, but as the world tries to break its fossil fuel addiction, it just might by humanity's greatest strength.

We might miss our shot at observing the first stars to ever exist. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Mega-constellations of satellites are connecting more and more of the world to the internet, beaming it down to Earth on an unprecedented scale. Unfortunately, in that process, they seem to be putting other scientific efforts at risk. 

With over 7,600 small satellites hovering in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and a total of 12,000 (with an extension to a possible 36,000) planned, SpaceX's Starlink is without a doubt the largest satellite mega-constellation bringing internet to the masses. But it comes at a cost—while Starlink is in compliance with regulations intended to keep it from interfering with scientific observations, unintentional leakage of radio waves from thousands of its satellites has reached a level that could severely interfere with observations of faint radio sources going back to the early days of the universe. 

SpaceX has managed to prevent some interference by switching off beams that transmit internet when their satellites pass over telescopes, but that hasn't cancelled out the entire problem.

Astronomer Steven Tingay of Curtin University's International Center for Radio Astronomy Research in Australia is concerned. He and colleagues Dylan Grigg and Marcin Sokolowski investigated the types of emissions that were leaking from Starlink satellites, how much of these emissions were being released, and in what ways the mega-constellation could have a negative impact on Earth-based radio observations. He previously used the SKA-Low prototype station to analyze satellite constellation impacts on radio astronomy.

“A small fraction of the radio spectrum across the SKA-Low's bandwidth has protection for radio astronomy,” Tingay, Grigg, and Sokolowski said in a study recently posted to the preprint server arXiv. “Although these protections exist, a succession of research has shown that an increasing number of satellites are being detected transmitting unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR) outside their designated downlink frequencies, and sometimes at these protected frequencies.”

Some of SKA-Low's bandwidth—3.7 percent, to be exact—is protected by the International Telecommunications Union's Radiocommunication. But 3.7 percent is proving not to be enough. Starlink launches were already problematic when Tingay and his team conducted the study, with 477 satellites being sent to space during the four months they were collecting data. The two frequencies being released by many of the satellites in the constellation were 137.5 MHz and 159.4 MHz, which are two of the same radio frequencies at which astronomical observations are made.

Tingay's team conducted the largest survey of Starlink satellites at SKA-Low frequencies. While there are there different models of satellite producing varying emissions, most of the ones that were leaking the problematic radio waves were type v2-mini-Ku (though, some v2-mini DTC and v1.5 models were also emitting waves at these frequencies). Starlink owns 75% of the v2-mini-Ku satellites in orbit, meaning that the company has the greatest responsibility when it comes to leakage from from these particular models.

Leakage may go beyond interference in certain domains, even going so far as to potentially block observations that go all the way back to the Epoch of Reionizaiton—about a billion years after the Big Bang. This was when most of the electrically neutral hydrogen in the universe was charged by rising levels of radiation from the most ancient massive stars, known as Population III or Pop III stars (no Pop III stars have been detected yet). If left unchecked, radio emissions from Starlink satellites could get in the way of monumental discoveries.

“Future mitigation of the UEMR from Starlink satellites will be key for ultra-sensitive experiments with the SKA,” the researchers said. “SpaceX has made significant progress liaising with astronomers in the optical domain, and we hope to keep this dialogue open in the radio domain.”

Missile attacks have damaged laboratories and hampered scientists' ability to do research in both Israel and Iran, as the conflict between the two countries enters its fifth day. In Iran, at least 224 people have been killed; in Israel, 24 have been killed, according to media reports.

Israel launched strikes against several Iranian cities early on 13 June, targeting nuclear facilities and killing several Iranian commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran — which is in talks with the United States about its nuclear programme — retaliated later that day, launching drone and missile attacks at sites across Israel. Both countries have since continued strikes. 

Biologist Jacob Hanna was about to give a talk on a new technique for developing stem-cell-based mouse embryos at a conference in Hong Kong when his phone pinged with the news that Israel had attacked Iran.

“That threw me off balance a little,” says Hanna. Hours earlier, he had been informed by his university, the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, to evacuate all facilities, while his students scrambled to finish an experiment requested during the review process for a paper.

Flights to Israel had been canceled, so Hanna travelled to London to stay with a friend until he could work out how to get home. On that flight, he learnt from students that his lab had been damaged by a missile strike in retaliatory attacks launched by Iran. The Weizmann Institute is considered by Iran to be a military target.

In the immediate aftermath of the strike, there was shattered glass everywhere, the computers weren't turning on, incubators fell and the power went out. In one lab, the ceiling had collapsed, and the staircase had detached, Hanna was told. His students managed to save hundreds of frozen mouse and human cell lines by transferring them to back-up liquid-nitrogen tanks that Hanna had stored in the basement. “I was always worried that if a war actually happens, I don't want to lose these.”

He now plans to fly to Jordan and then drive to Israel from there. The damage to the lab has probably set his research back about six months, he says.

In a message to researchers seen by Nature, the Weizmann Institute said the strike had caused “substantial damage” and affected most buildings. It advised that only authorized people are allowed on campus until further notice.

A spokesperson for the institute says that it is “in contact with the relevant security and emergency agencies, and is taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety of employees and the campus”.

Researchers in Iran have also been affected by the escalating conflict. They are avoiding in-person meetings at universities and have taken their work online, out of fear that their universities and research institutes could become military targets, says Abbas Edalat, a British–Iranian computer scientist and mathematician at Imperial College London. “It is a serious restriction” because researchers won't be able to continue their lab experiments, he says. The disruption comes on the back of years of on-and-off international economic sanctions that have hindered academics' ability to do research and travel to conferences, says Edalat. Iranian science is “paying a high price”, says Encieh Erfani, an Iranian cosmologist now at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada.

Metrics details

Over recent decades the Amazon region has been exposed to large-scale land-use changes and global warming. How these changes affect Amazonia's hydrological cycle remains unclear as meteorological data are scarce. We use tree ring oxygen isotope records to confirm that the Amazon hydrological cycle has intensified since 1980. Diverging isotopic trends from terra firme and floodplain trees from distinct sites (approximately 1000 km apart) in Western Amazon indicate rainfall amounts increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season at large-scale. Using the Rayleigh distillation model, we estimate that wet season rainfall increased by 15–22%, and dry season rainfall decreased by 8–13%. These diverging trends provide evidence, independent from existing climate records, that the seasonality of the hydrological cycle in the Amazon is increasing. Continuation of the observed trends will have a pervasive impact on Amazon forests and floodplain ecosystems, and strongly affect the livelihoods of the regional riverine communities.

There is growing concern about the future of the Amazon forests with several recent reports1,2 suggesting the system could be close to a ‘critical transition', interpreted as irreversible large-scale forest loss due to the interactive impacts of deforestation, heat and drought on local climate. Given Amazonia's importance for global biodiversity3, terrestrial carbon stocks4 and livelihoods5 it is important to evaluate these concerns. Large-scale deforestation could cause reductions in precipitation6 and land surface temperature increases7 which are further affected by fossil fuel burning induced climate change8 and by reductions in precipitation recycling due to vegetation responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations9,10. Early estimates by General Circulation Models (GCMs) studying the combined effects of deforestation and climate indicated a severe drying of the Amazon, resulting in widespread dieback of the Amazon forests11. While more recent modelling predictions suggest such an extreme scenario may be unlikely, there is still considerable variation in rainfall projections for the Amazon varying from drying to wetting, and critical transitions could result12.

Rainfall changes are thought to be a central component for potentially causing an irreversible transition of Amazonia's forests2,6,11. Obtaining more reliable data on changes in rainfall over recent time is thus a pre-requisite to understand in what direction the system is heading, and to determine which global climate model predictions are consistent with observations and thus more likely to be realistic. Observational evidence indicates that the hydrological cycle of the Amazon has been changing in the past few decades with trends varying between regions and seasons. Some studies suggest that the south of the Amazon is getting dryer13,14,15,16, while others show wetting in large parts of the basin15,17,18, with increased frequency of severe droughts and floods19,20. A reliable quantification of these changes is needed to understand contributions of anthropogenic drivers (i.e. deforestation and climate change) versus natural climate variability and to assess risks for the future21. However, these efforts are hampered by a lack of meteorological data. Rain gauge stations are sparsely distributed across the basin (only one station per 150,000 km2), their operation is often discontinuous, and methodologies are changing over time22,23. Remote sensing and data assimilation are becoming increasingly more accurate and reliable, but time series are relatively short and there is still disagreement between these products18,23,24. River level data may offer a more reliable, long-term record, but the varying seasonality of river levels of the many tributaries of the Amazon River may mask the timing and strength of the changes, especially for the dry season25. Thus, more information to evaluate the response of the Amazon basin to climate change is needed.

New information to aid our understanding of past variability of the hydrological cycle can be obtained from natural climate proxies. Different archives can be used for this purpose including ice cores26, lake sediments27, speleothems28, and tree rings29. In forested regions, tree rings can provide climate proxies with annual resolution, but finding suitable tropical species that form reliable annual rings can be difficult. In addition, growth of tropical trees in moist and warm climates is generally not very sensitive to inter-annual climate variation29. An approach that partly overcomes these challenges is the analysis of stable oxygen isotopes in the cellulose of tree rings. This approach results in excellent signal strength, thus allowing more reliable reconstructions with fewer samples compared to standard ring-width chronologies30,31. Oxygen isotopes in tree rings (δ18OTR) to a large degree reflect the δ18O of source water (mostly rainfall)32,33, which for the Amazon basin is controlled by the depletion of heavier isotopes in water vapor due to rainout of heavier water molecules (H218O) during moisture transport over land (i.e. Rayleigh distillation of water in the atmosphere)34,35,36. Due to this mechanism, δ18OTR from western locations in the Amazon have been found to closely reflect the amount of rainfall over large regions of the Amazon basin and provide data representative of climate variability at large scale30,31,37,38.

Annual ring formation in tropical trees is generally triggered by the annual cessation of cambial growth during a distinct dry season, restricting growth to the wet season39. An exception to this is trees from Amazon floodplains, where annually recurring multi-month floods create anoxic soil conditions, that impede cambial activity and restrict the growth of floodplain trees to the terrestrial (i.e. non-flooded) phase40. For many regions in the Amazon, the terrestrial phase of floodplain forests coincides with the local and Amazon-wide dry season (Supplementary Fig. 1). As a result, growth of floodplain and terra firme trees (i.e. non-flooded) are out of sync, occurring during the dry and wet seasons respectively (Fig. 1). These differences should allow for a seasonal reconstruction of the regional hydrological cycle at large-scale. Here, we pioneer this approach to reconstruct changes in rainfall seasonality from 1980 to 2010 by comparing tree ring oxygen isotope series (δ18OTR) from a floodplain species (Macrolobium acaciifolium) and terra firme species (Cedrela odorata) from the western and south-western Amazon, with a climatic footprint that largely coincides with the Amazon-wide region and climate (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3).

Color shading indicate the upwind regions of moisture transport from each site, derived from the HYSPLIT back trajectories (see Supplementary Fig 3 and Methods section). b Schematic diagram showing the seasonal phenological differences between terra firme and floodplain environments. c Seasonal variation of the local river level at the floodplain site, rainfall for the Amazon Basin, and local rainfall at the terra firme site. d Images of the annual growth rings of Macrolobium acaciifolium and Cedrela odorata tree species used in this study, with red arrows indicating ring boundaries. In (c), Arrows indicate the growing seasons of the trees, and vertical lines indicate the seasonal boundaries defined by rainfall and river levels. Vertical dotted lines extends the boundaries of the Amazon-wide seasons (bottom panel) for a visual comparison of how they overlap with the local growing seasons at each of the sites. Note that for calculations using rainfall data, we disregarded the shoulder months of those seasons, i.e. the months immediately next to the black vertical lines (details in Methods).

The interannual variation of δ18OTR of both species is negatively related to the interannual variation in Amazon-wide precipitation during their respective growing seasons (Fig. 2). Peak rainfall correlations for the floodplain δ18OTR chronology occurred from August to November, within the growing season for M. acaciifolium which extends from July to November (Fig. 2a-c), while the terra firme δ18OTR chronology correlations peak from January to May, almost entirely within the growth season for C. odorata which extends from November to April (Fig. 2e–g). Correlations that extend outside the trees'growing seasons are generally weaker, which could be due to interannual variation in the growing season length of the trees.

Bars indicate the Pearson's r between δ18OTR and 3-monthly means of rainfall or river levels. Filled bars indicate significant correlations with 95% confidence interval. Shaded areas show seasonal variation in precipitation in the Amazon region (a,b,c,e,f,g) or Amazon river levels at Obidos (d,h). Dotted lines and arrows indicate the growing season of the floodplain and terra firme trees. The x-axis spans the full hydrological year, and therefore extends across two calendar years. Months January to May in the three-month periods on the right-hand side of the x-axis correspond to the year after the onset of the ring formation.

Climate correlations for the record of M. acaciifolium are for a shorter seasonal window. This could reflect the short, non-flooded period during which this species mainly grows40, or be due to differences in methodology as we only used the middle portion of the rings for this species to avoid interference of river water δ18O and capture climate signals of the peak growing season41. Correlations for the C. odorata record cover a longer period coinciding with the longer growing season of this species30. The correlations for this record lag the onset of the species' growing season by one month probably due to a lag between leaf flush, the start of cambial activity and xylogenesis42.

The two δ18OTR records also show close correlations with Amazon River level records measured at Obidos (Fig. 2d, h). The periods of significant correlations correspond very well with the months of low river levels for M. acaciifolium, and with the months of high river levels for C. odorata. Because of lag times between Amazon precipitation and river level43, these correlations are ca. 3-5 months later than the rainfall-δ18OTR correlations. All correlations with climate were very similar when we averaged rainfall over the Amazon region or over the estimated regions of moisture transport (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). This large scale climatic footprint of the δ18OTR records is further evidenced by spatial correlation analyses of δ18OTR with gridded precipitation datasets (Supplementary Fig. 6).

The two δ18OTR chronologies show diverging long-term patterns, with a positive trend (p < 0.05) in the M. acaciifolium record and a negative trend (p < 0.1) in the C. odorata since the mid 1970s. The divergence between the two records since mid 1970s is greater than at any other time in the period covered (Supplementary Fig. 7). The trend in the M. acaciifolium record starts a few years earlier than the trend in the C. odorata record. To estimate the magnitude of changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, or moisture influx required to explain the trends in the δ18OTR records, we used a Rayleigh distillation model (Eq. 3, Fig. 3, see Methods for details). For these estimates we calculate changes for the period of 1980-2010, when there was an increase of 1.14‰ in the dry season record for M. acaciifolium and a decrease of 0.90‰ in the wet season record of C. odorata (Fig. 3c).

[1]), with green and blue lines indicating the expected effects of increasing evapotranspiration (E) and precipitation (P), respectively. c δ18OTR chronologies, with blue lines showing the wet season record obtained from C. odorata trees from terra firme forests, and red line showing the dry season record obtained from M. acaciifolium trees from floodplain forests. Straight lines indicate significant trends at 90% confidence interval. d, e Inferred changes in rainfall since 1980, calculated from a Rayleigh distillation framework based on the Δδ18OTR trends (see methods). Lighter vertical stippled lines indicate an evapotranspiration change scenario corresponding to 0% and ±5% over the entire analysed period, and shading indicates possible variations arising from uncertainties in estimates of evapotranspiration, moisture flux and vapor δ18O (see also Table 1). Note that in (c), the δ18O axis is inverted.

In the simplest version of this model, we assumed that there were no changes in moisture influx into the basin, or evapotranspiration along air parcel paths, and thus attributed all observed changes in δ18OTR to changes in precipitation along the water vapour path. This results in an estimated increase in wet season precipitation of 5% per decade (i.e. ΔP/ΔPi, 15.5% since 1980 C.E.) (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig 8b, Table 1) and an estimated decrease in dry season precipitation of 4.4% per decade (−13.5% from 1980–2010 C.E.) (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig 8a, Table 1).

These estimates however are sensitive to various assumptions. Firstly, this model version assumes no trend in the coastal (i.e., initial) air column water vapour content (Ni). However, observed sea surface temperatures have increased by approximately 0.5oC since 1980 C.E. over the tropical North Atlantic, which would result in an 4% increase in air water holding capacity according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for saturated vapour pressure (i.e., 7% for each oC44). Assuming the change in mass of water in atmospheric inflow is linearly proportional to the ratio of saturated vapor pressures in 2010 and in 1980, accounting for this increase in water vapour in the Rayleigh model (i.e., changing Nf - Ni, or ΔN, see Eqs. 2, 3) results in larger estimates for increases in wet season precipitation (i.e. 5.9% instead of 5% per decade) and weaker drying trends for the dry season (i.e., −3.6% instead of −4.4% per decade, Case 1 in Table 1). Independent records from ERA5 indicate that wet season (Nov-March) water vapour inflow increased by 8%, but show no support for dry season changes in vapour inflow (Supplementary Fig. 3ef). Using the changes from ERA5 would result in a larger difference between wet and dry season trends.

We further assumed there are no changes in the total evapotranspiration of the forest. In our estimates, we considered that evapotranspiration recycles 40% of total dry season rainfall and 32.5% of total wet season rainfall45. Deforestation or CO2-induced stomatal closure may result in decreases in evapotranspiration6,46, while warming induced vapour pressure deficit may increase evaporative demand47. These opposing effects may offset each other48, which could explain why no changes in evapotranspiration are evident within a variety of dataset types and sources for the Amazon49. While the extent of shifts in evapotranspiration at large-scale in the Amazon remains uncertain47, recent evidence suggests that Amazon evapotranspiration may have decreased by approximately 6% in the past 30 years50. The contribution of total evapotranspiration to rainfall can influence the degree of Rayleigh distillation effect during moisture transport (Fig. 3b) and thereby add uncertainty to our estimates (Eqs. 3 and 4). We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess variations in our estimates under different scenarios of changes in evapotranspiration during the analysed period. This sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates of precipitation changes are not very sensitive to the effects of changes in evapotranspiration on the Rayleigh distillation: the Rayleigh model shows that a 1-1.5% change in evapotranspiration per decade has only a minor (±0.5 to 0.8% per decade) effect on our estimates of precipitation changes for the two seasons (Fig. 3, Table 1, case 5). Our analysis further shows that these estimates are insensitive to assumed condensation temperature of water vapour in the clouds (Table 1, case 6).

Additional smaller uncertainties in our estimates arise from possible changes in the contribution of leaf water enrichment to δ18OTR, evaporative enrichment of soil water, in the isotopic composition of water vapor entering the basin, in rainfall type or intensity, and from uncertainties related to the magnitude of the continental difference of δ18Ocoast to δ18Osite, and the assumed recycling ratio of evapotranspiration over precipitation, \({r}_{E:P}\). See Table 1 for all quantified uncertainties arising from these factors, and supplementary materials for a full discussion of how these factors may affect our estimates.

Our results show that floodplain and terra firme trees record the climate for different seasons at large-scale (Fig. 2). When analysed together these records provide more detailed, seasonally resolved climate reconstructions for the Amazon compared to using one single species. To the degree that δ18OTR accurately reflects rainfall δ18O, these trends are due to long-term changes in the rainout of heavy water (H218O) along the air parcel trajectory from the tropical north Atlantic to the site of precipitation34,35. Previous analysis for C. odorata from the terra firme site has shown that the total cumulated precipitation over the air parcel path over land is a very strong predictor of inter-annual variation in δ18OTR31 giving confidence that the signal is governed by Rayleigh distillation during moisture transport over land. Analysis of atmospheric back trajectories of moisture transport for the two study sites show that they have similar paths that cover a large portion (60-70%) of the Amazon basin, with a climatic footprint that is highly representative of Amazon-wide rainfall (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. 2-5). This large-scale spatial footprint is further confirmed by spatial correlation analyses of these records with gridded precipitation datasets (Supplementary Fig. 6). The diverging long-term trends in δ18OTR are therefore interpreted to reflect diverging seasonal trends in precipitation for the same central region of the Amazon basin.

Taking identified uncertainties into account (see Table 1, Fig. 3, Supplementary Discussion), we estimate wet season rainfall to have increased by between 5 to 7.1% per decade (15.5-22% since 1980) and dry season rainfall to have decreased by 1.9 to 4.4% per decade (5.8-13.5% since 1980, Fig. 3c). This provides evidence for increases in precipitation seasonality using a record that is independent from current climate records, and that integrates variability in rainfall over a large area within the Amazon basin. Our analysis is based on a mechanistic understanding of the association between climate and δ18OTR and overcomes some of the limitations of spatial and temporal scarcity of meteorological data in the Amazon22.

To what degree are tree ring estimates of Amazon precipitation changes consistent with observations? To evaluate this question, we compared our δ18OTR to rainfall and river stage records for the two seasons (Fig. 4). Interannual variation and long-term trends in δ18OTR are well correlated with variation in precipitation and with river level (see Fig. 4, please note the inverted scale for oxygen isotopes). Our estimates from tree ring oxygen isotopes suggest rainfall reductions in the dry season (−1.9 to −4.4% per decade) are largely within the range of those derived from the different gridded precipitation datasets used here (CRU: −0.3%, CHIRPS: −6.3%, MSWEP: −1.6% per decade), but imply stronger rainfall increases during the wet season ( + 5 to +7.1% per decade) than estimated from all three datasets (CRU: +1.6%, CHIRPS: +1.6% and MSWEP: +0.3%, per decade). This discrepancy in the estimates of rainfall changes may possibly be caused by differences between the footprint of the tree ring isotope series (i.e. the region of moisture transport from coast to sampling sites, Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) and the spatial distribution of the stations that these climate records relied on. The difference in the estimates from different gridded datasets also highlight the uncertainties arising from their use to assess long-term climate trends in the Amazon region. Despite this difference, our estimates of rainfall changes largely agree with the few published estimates of precipitation changes in Amazonia, which consider different datasets. Few studies report similar magnitudes to what we found here, with a reduction of up to 4.4% per decade in the dry season and an increase of up to 10% per decade in the wet season depending on region17,19,51, and one recent study (based on observations and reanalyses) reports an increase of 6% per decade in rainfall seasonality, given by the difference between maximum and minimum rainfall amounts per year, since 197952. Diverging seasonal trends have also been detected regionally, with up to ~5% (per decade) dry season drying in the south and similar wet season wetting in the north portion of the basin53,54. Interestingly, these results seem to go in the same direction of ours, even though the spatial footprint of our records does not capture all of the southern Amazon during the dry season. Here we cannot make any inference regarding spatial heterogeneity of the trends, but it is possible that to some extent our integrated measure of the regional hydrological cycle reflects spatially heterogeneous climate changes in the region.

(c–f) hydrological variables for the peak of the dry season (left panels) and wet seasons (right panels) since 1975 C.E shwing (c, d) Amazon River levels and (e, f) Amazon-wide rainfall from CRU, MSWEP (scale on left axis) and CHIRPS (scale on right axis). Solid and dotted straight lines indicate trends that are significant within confidence intervals of 95% and 90%, respectively. The significance of trends was tested by means of linear regression, with p values shown at each graph. The Pearson's correlation coefficient of the hydrological variable with oxygen isotopes from tree rings is also shown on (d, e, rδ18O). Note that in (c), the δ18O axis is inverted.

In all, our tree ring trends provide strong support for a substantial increase in the seasonality of Amazon rainfall, with the wet season becoming wetter and the dry season drier. We find no support for previous GCM predictions for a general drying of the Amazon basin11,55,56,57, or for a general wetting58. Instead, our results point to an increased seasonal cycle, as observed before in both precipitation and river level records13,17,19,52,53,59. These latter authors have analysed possible drivers for these trends, and find changes are related to differences between the tropical north Atlantic and Pacific SST anomalies, in part associated with natural variability, but a more rapid warming in the Atlantic is likely to continue due to anthropogenic forcing59. These large-scale changes have led to an increase in the upwelling of the Walker cell branch over Amazonia59,60.

Existing tree ring records from the Amazon provide some support for the increase in wet season precipitation suggested by our records. An extended δ18OTR record (1980 to 2020) from Cedrela odorata located in the nearby Brazilian southwest Amazon61 shows a similar upward trend in precipitation up to 2020, despite the strong 2015 El Niño (i.e. dry anomaly). Tree ring-widths from south-west Amazon-Andes also capture this wetting trend locally62, and one study from eastern Amazon points out that climate signals in the tree rings became weaker after 1990's63, which can be an indication that growth limitation by rainfall is decreasing, even in the absence of trends. Other ring-width studies from different parts of the Amazon don't seem to capture this change64,65,66,67. The reasons why tree ring-width do not capture these changes may vary. Firstly, trees growing in humid conditions during the wet season may not be limited by the precipitation ammounts, and thus don't benefit from the increase in rainfall. Secondly, tree ring studies often focus on the high-frequency variability, and may not reproduce multidecadal trends. In addition, detecting trends in ring-width series requires consideration of several ontogeny and other biases due to demography or field sampling strategies, which are often not considered39,68,69. In comparison to tree ring widths, δ18OTR records are superior proxies for hydroclimate as the signal in these two sites arises predominantly from variation in precipitation δ18O and is thus relatively independent of plant physiological effects30,41 and do not require detrending to correct for ontogenetic effects.

Though the climate changes inferred from the δ18OTR chronologies may seem large, the severity of recent climate extremes is consistent with expected consequences of climate change21, and trends have persisted over time. Our records only extended to 2010 and 2014, but extreme floods of the Amazon River have continued to happen with high frequency. The four highest flood-season river levels (2021, 2012, 2009 and 2022) and three lowest dry-season river levels (2024, 2023, 2010) all occurred during the last 15 years70. Of those, the most extreme levels for the entire 122-year record at the port of Manaus were recorded in the past 3 years, indicating that the intensification of the hydrological cycle is persistent, with increased rainfall seasonality leading to more frequent droughts and floods19,20. As a result, the maximum flood area of the Amazon River has extended by 26% since 198071, while intensified dry seasons have facilitated the spread of wildfires72,73. These changes cause extensive social, economic and health impacts74, including damages to agriculture5, hydropower generation75, and respiratory health76. For the forests, floods, droughts and fires may lead to widespread tree mortality, both in floodplains and non-flooded areas77,78, and impact on forest biodiversity79, structure80, and resilience1.

Our support for the existence of diverging long-term changes in rainfall amounts during the wet and dry seasons has important implications for proxy-based studies in this region. Commonly used proxy records such as ice-cores rarely contain seasonal climate information26, while cave speleothems28 usually integrate signals over periods of three or more years. Such records will conceal diverging seasonal patterns as detected here, and thus fail to provide an accurate picture of the full climate response. Tree rings do provide information about seasonal climate variability, but in the tropics such information is often restricted to the wet season39. The approach we used here overcomes such limitations, and exploits differences in growing seasons between species to permit seasonally explicit climate reconstructions. This approach is limited only by the maximum age of tropical trees, which may reach up to few hundred years in these ecosystems81.

To conclude, we find diverging time trends in these two δ18OTR records since ca. 1980, with increasing δ18OTR in the species growing during the dry season and decreasing δ18OTR for the species growing during the wet season. These diverging trends are indicative of approximately 5 to 7.1% per decade (15.5–22% since 1980) increase in wet season rainfall and by 1.9 to 4.4% per decade (6–13.5% since 1980) decrease in dry season rainfall at large-scale in the Amazon. Our analysis highlights that traditional climate proxies may hide seasonally diverging trends as observed here. We find no support for a general drying or general wetting of the Amazon basin and instead find an increase in the seasonal cycle. Our conclusions are largely independent from any climate data, relying only on the well-known relationship between rainfall and the δ18O signals in rainfall as recorded by tree rings. The results provide a benchmark for testing the realism of climate predictions for this region and confirm a trend in seasonality that is larger than assumed so far. These changes have severe and widespread implications for human livelihoods and ecosystems in the Amazon.

To reconstruct seasonally resolved δ18O from the Amazon basin, we used tree ring records from Cedrela odorata from terra firme forests in the Southwestern Amazon31,82 (10°5′S, 66°18′W), and from Macrolobium acaciifolium from floodplain forests in the Western Amazon37 (74°05′ W, 4°29′ S, Fig. 1). C. odorata grows during the local wet season, defined as the period of the year with rainfall exceeding 100 mm month-1 (which is October to April at this site)31, and the δ18OTR chronology (i.e. the average of δ18O records obtained from trees belonging to the same local population of trees) of this species thus reflects past variability of wet season rainfall in the Amazon. The inter-annual and decadal scale variation is in close agreement with similar chronologies obtained from trees of the same species growing at other locations in the western Amazon basin82. Macrolobium acaciifolium is a typical floodplain species, that grows only during the non-flooded (terrestrial) period40, which is between July and November for this site. As this period coincides with the Amazon-wide dry season, the chronology reflects rainfall variability for the dry season. Though the two sites are distant from each other, the large-scale atmospheric processes associated with Rayleigh distillation during moisture transport result in wide spatial coherence of tree ring δ18O even at distant locations38. This can be illustrated by the large overlap of the regions of moisture transport to each of our sampling sites (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3).

Both chronologies consist of oxygen isotope ratios in the cellulose extracted chemically from the tree rings using the procedure described in ref. 83. For C. odorata, 890 rings from 9 trees were separated prior to cellulose extraction, while for the M. acaciifolium trees we first extracted cellulose from cross-section laths and then separated 384 rings from 6 trees84. As these species grow in tropical warm climates which favour rapid drying of the soils and constant recharging with new rainfall85,86, long soil water residence times are generally not expected87,88, and we consider that trees use mostly recent rainfall as their main source water. Still, for M. acaciifolium trees only the middle section (of three segments) for each ring was used to avoid using wood produced at the start and end of the growing season, when river water (which has longer residence times) are close to trees' rooting zones. After extraction, tree ring cellulose samples were homogenized, freeze dried, packed into silver capsules and pyrolyzed with an Element Analyzer coupled to a Sercon 20/20 IRMS for analysis of their stable oxygen isotope ratios, with a precision of 0.2‰. All isotope ratios are expressed relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), in permille (‰) units. The mean δ18OTR chronologies for each species were produced by taking the mean δ18OTR of all trees for each calendar year. The average of Pearson's correlation coefficients of all pairwise combinations of trees in each chronology was 0.58 for M. acaciifolium and 0.63 for C. odorata.

We use the following Rayleigh distillation model89

to relate changes in the oxygen isotope values to changes in precipitation, moisture content in air entering the basin and evapotranspiration in Amazonia. Here, \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}\) and \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) (‰) are relative deviations of isotope ratios from a standard ratio at the site and coast respectively, P and E (dimensions of mass per area) are the cumulated rainfall and evapotranspiration along an air parcel trajectory from the coast to the site, respectively, N (mass per area) is the total amount of water of the air column when air enters the basin, and Nsite is the water mass left in the air column at the end of the trajectory, α = 1.010744 the water-vapor equilibrium fractionation factor for a condensation temperature of 10 °C90 corresponding approximately to 700hPa altitude91, and f is the fraction of water vapour in the air column at the site relative to water vapor in air entering the basin, or ‘remaining fraction'.

Our Rayleigh model assumes that (a) there have been no changes in the type of precipitation (i.e. convective vs stratiform) and intensity of precipitation, and (b) that temperature does not affect δ18O strongly at these locations, and (c) that the isotopic ratio of vapor entering the basin does not change over time.

Using Eq. 1, the long-term change over time in δ18O as a result of long-term changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration and changes in water content of air entering the basin is then given by

Here the subscript ‘i' stands for initial and the subscript ‘f' for final in time (in our case 1980 and 2010). Equation 2 can be rewritten as a function of relative changes \(\Delta P\equiv \frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}-{P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{{P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}\), \(\Delta E\equiv \frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}-{E}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{{E}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}},\,\Delta N\equiv \frac{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}-{N}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}\) using the identities \({P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}=\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{\left(1+\Delta P/{P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}\right)}\) for P and similar for E and N to obtain

Equation 3 permits, in principle, to determine which combinations of relative changes in precipitation and evaporation are compatible with the observed difference of the heavy isotope ratio in precipitation between 2010 and 1980 inferred from our tree ring records. Nonetheless, to use Eq. 3 for this purpose we need (i) an estimate of present \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) and (ii) estimates of the ratios \(\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}},\,\frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}\) and their uncertainties. We estimate the former using the observations at Belém from Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), for which rainfall δ18O data is available for the years of 2014 and 2015. From these years, we used the months from August to October for the peak dry season and from November to March for the peak wet season. These periods disregard the shoulder months from the growing season of the trees, to avoid an effect of year-to-year variability in the growing season length on our results.

To estimate the latter we express them as functions of remaining water vapor fraction, f, in an air parcel arriving at the site at the end of the period considered (here 2010) and a recycling ratio \({r}_{E:P}\equiv \frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}\), the ratio of cumulated evaporation to cumulated precipitation along the air parcel path from the coast to the site. The ratios \(\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}},\,\frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}\) expressed as functions of f and \({r}_{E:P}\) are \(\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}=\frac{1-f}{1-{r}_{E:P}},\,\frac{{E}_{f}}{{N}_{f}}=\frac{f-1}{1-\frac{1}{{r}_{E:P}}}\). f we estimate from observed \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}-{\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) at the end of the period considered, inverting Eq. 1:

For our best estimate we used \({r}_{E:P}=0.325\) for the wet season and \({r}_{E:P}=0.4\) for the dry season45. To estimate \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}-{\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) we used measurements made at the GNIP stations Iquitos (Peru) for \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}\) and Belém (Brazil) for \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\), and data for Riberalta (Bolivia), from a monitoring led by the authors of this study (Brienen and Gloor). For details see Supplementary Table 1 in supplemental information.

In order to obtain plausible ranges of relative changes of Pf and Ef we vary estimates of using two different estimates of \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}-{\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) (one based on observations from GNIP, and one based on a isotope enabled version of the Hadley Climate model HadAM392, and by varying α over a plausible condensation temperature range. Separately we also vary \({r}_{E:{P}}\) by ±10%.

As we know that tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature increased by 0.5 °C (80−15 W, 8−22 N, HadSST data from ref. 93) we also examined the sensitivity of our best estimate of the attribution of the observed isotopic time trends to these changes. We did this by varying the water vapor content and the isotopic ratio of incoming air (see Supplementary Discussion for details).

We related the δ18OTR chronologies to large-scale precipitation obtained from three different gridded datasets, Climate Research Unit (CRU TS 4.07)94, from CHIRPS95 and from MSWEP96. We used CRU as it is based on station data. CHIRPS and MSWEP are more recent products that combine both station and satellite data and might provide better spatial representation. Large-scale rainfall was obtained by averaging rainfall over the Amazon Basin region during the trees' respective growing seasons (Fig. 1a, gray outline97). To assess the regions of influence of trends in both chronologies, we calculated for both sites the daily air mass trajectories using HYSPLIT98,99 (Supplementary Fig. 3ab) and then calculated the latitudinal range covered by >95% of all trajectories for every 0.25 degrees longitude, using a smoothing spline to remove noise. This provided the northern and southern limits of the regions of moisture transport to each sampling site (Fig. 1a). We then averaged rainfall within this region (upwind region rainfall). The rainfall series obtained by doing so is highly correlated with the rainfall time series obtained for the Amazon Basin region (Supplementary Fig 2).

We also correlated the δ18OTR with Amazon River level recorded at Obidos, approximately 600 km from the Amazon delta. River levels at this location corresponds to nearly 80% of the water drained within the Basin100, thus providing a second measure of large-scale hydrology within the Basin. The presence of trends in the δ18O chronologies and climate data over the past 30 years was assessed using linear regression analyses and t-tests.

Metrics details

A critical consideration of the dominant vocabulary on home energy injustices around the world is overdue. We briefly unpack terms such as ‘energy poor', ‘fuel poor', ‘energy vulnerable' and ‘hard to reach', question their utility and argue that they may do more harm than good. While acknowledging our own positionality and past use of such terminology, we argue that future debates on the inability to secure needed energy in the home should focus on the structural challenges imposed by wider societal and political choices. We contend that changing the ways in which energy injustices in the home are framed in scientific and policy phraseologies is a key step towards bold and equitable global action, in the face of mounting socio-environmental crises.

Postgraduate students are vulnerable in academic settings. Roughly 6% of 160 PhD-level respondents to a 2023 survey in England reported having experienced unwanted behaviours of a sexual nature in the previous year (see go.nature.com/4ke6pv9). One-third of those were not sure how to report their experience to the university, or where to seek support. Similar, or higher, rates were found in studies in Australia (some 30,000 participants) and the United States (more than 180,000 participants).

As a scholar and activist working to address sexual harassment in higher education, I have seen how devastating it is for students when faculty members abuse their power. In 2016, the resignation of feminist scholar Sara Ahmed from Goldsmiths College, University of London, in protest at the lack of action against sexual harassment rocked the UK higher-education community. I co-founded a campaigning organization, The 1752 Group, dedicated to redressing the situation. The group's name reflects the meagre amount of money that Goldsmiths invested in our first conference on tackling the issue — £1,752 (US$2,380). This stopgap approach is emblematic of academia's reluctance to engage with the problem.

The huge toll of PhDs on mental health: data reveal stark effects

The huge toll of PhDs on mental health: data reveal stark effects

At last, nearly ten years on, England is taking action. From 1 August, England's national regulator for higher education, the Office for Students, will require institutions to protect students from harassment or sexual misconduct.

This is a welcome step. But the guidelines must include specific protective measures for PhD students. As researchers, they work in environments distinct from those of students in taught programmes. They are more likely to be targeted by staff members, both at their institution and outside it. This is partly because of their close relationship with advisers and mentors, and partly because of academia's deeply hierarchical, gender-unequal culture.

Any form of harassment can disrupt people's lives, careers, professional networks, and physical and mental health. Some people report experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder or a loss of confidence. Those targeted sometimes change fields or leave academia altogether.

My research has shown that the main reason students report sexual harassment by a member of staff is to keep themselves and others safe. But too often, they receive little to no commitment from universities that they and others will be shielded from perpetrators.

How PhD students and other academics are fighting the mental-health crisis in science

Many institutions are still building systems and expertise to address sexual harassment. A change in attitude is crucial. Even now, I hear that such misconduct is rare, or not that serious. Other barriers persist. In Europe, data privacy regulations can hinder efforts to keep people safe. Distinct disclosures about the same alleged perpetrator, for example, aren't usually linked.

In her new book, Bad Company: Private Equity and the Death of the American Dream, journalist and WIRED alum Megan Greenwell chronicles the devastating impacts of one of the most powerful yet poorly understood forces in modern American capitalism. Flush with cash, largely unregulated, and relentlessly focused on profit, private equity firms have quietly reshaped the US economy, taking over large chunks of industries ranging from health care to retail—often leaving financial ruin in their wake.

Twelve million people in the US now work for companies owned by private equity, Greenwell writes, or about 8 percent of the total employed population. Her book focuses on the stories of four of these individuals, including a Toys “R” Us supervisor who loses the best job she ever had and a Wyoming doctor who watches his rural hospital cut essential services. Their collective experiences are a damning account of how innovation is being replaced by financial engineering and the ways that shift is being paid for by everyone except those at the top.

In a review of Bad Company for Bloomberg, a longtime private equity executive accused Greenwell of seeking out sad stories with inevitably “sad endings.” But the characters Greenwell selected don't just sit back and watch as private equity devastates their communities. The book is a portrait of not only how the American dream is being eroded but also the creative tactics people are using to fight back.

Greenwell spoke to WIRED late last month about what private equity is and isn't, how it has transformed different industries, and what workers are doing to reclaim their power.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

WIRED: What is private equity? How is the business model different from, say, venture capital?

Megan Greenwell: People confuse private equity and venture capital all the time, but it's totally reasonable that normal people don't understand the difference. Basically, the easiest way to explain the difference is that venture capital firms invest money, usually in startups. They're essentially taking a stake in the company and expecting some sort of returns over time. They're also generally playing a significantly longer game than private equity.

But the way private equity works, especially with leveraged buyouts, which is what I focus on in the book, is they're buying companies outright. In venture capital, you put your money in, you're entrusting it to a CEO, and you probably have a board seat. But in the leveraged buyout model, the private equity firm really is the owner and controlling decider of the portfolio company.

How do private equity firms define success? What kinds of companies or businesses are attractive to them?

In venture capital, VCs are evaluating whether to make a deal based solely on whether they think that company is going to become successful. They are looking for unicorns. Is this company going to be the next Uber? Private equity is looking to make money off of companies in ways that don't actually require the company itself to make money. That is like the biggest thing.

So it's less of a gamble.

It is very hard for private equity firms to lose money on deals. They're getting a 2 percent management fee, even if they're running the company into the ground. They're also able to pull off all these tricks, like selling off the company's real estate and then charging the company rent on the same land it used to own. When private equity firms take out loans to buy companies, the debt from those loans is assigned not to the private equity firm but to the portfolio company.

And so what you end up getting is that private equity is really attracted to companies where you don't have to play the long game. In fact, you don't want to play the long game, which means that you have no interest in doing the hard, slow work of improving a company's fundamentals. It is just not about improving the company at all. It is about, how do we extract money?

How did we get to this point where private equity is now taking over relatively large and diverse swaths of the economy, including veterinary clinics, brick-and-mortar retail stores, and all sorts of other businesses. What was the promise of this model?

Private equity started pretty small in the 1960s with what were then called “bootstrap deals,” essentially acquisitions of small, family-run companies that maybe showed promise for expansion but didn't have the capital necessary to grow. So in some ways it was more like venture capital, although it targeted established companies and not brand-new startups. This idea of growth at all costs then just expanded and expanded and expanded and started swallowing more and more and more things.

When did private equity start to peak?

There was a huge expansion of private equity in the 2010s for the same reason that venture capital exploded: There was a lot of cheap money out there, and cheap money is great for investors. We've seen private equity explore more industries over time, and usually that's because some policy change or broader economic trend all of a sudden makes a certain sector look like fertile ground for them.

What are some of the strategies that workers have used to fight back against private equity firms? Have they been successful?

What was interesting to me was not prescribing solutions but talking about what people are doing. The four characters in my book are all trying to do something about this in very different ways, and those range from fighting for regulation, to just going head-to-head directly with the private equity firm that upended their own life, to really trying to reinvent their industries from the ground up, which is something that is especially inspiring to me.

Do you have one that has stuck with you more than the others?

One example that I'll talk about from the book is from the Toys “R” Us section. Public pension funds are a huge source of capital for private equity firms, and they typically have worker representatives on their boards. So if they're representing teachers and nurses and firefighters, there will be one or more people working in those professions serving on the pension fund board.

Toys “R” Us workers had this very smart idea that those folks would be more likely to be sympathetic to their cause than a bunch of billionaires would. So they started going around the country, standing in front of these pension fund boards and saying “here is how these private equity firms that you invest in have blown up our lives,” talking in really specific detail about things like how they couldn't find jobs and were worried about feeding their families. The protagonist of that section of my book tells a story about how the members of one board just started peppering her with questions after she spoke in front of them.

Some people claim that private equity firms are the primary culprit behind broad economic problems such as income inequality and the housing crisis. Are they putting the blame in the right place?

I think by putting all of the blame on them, you end up undermining the criticisms about private equity firms that are more truthful. This is something that I thought really hard about how to do in the book, because I do think it's a mistake actually, but also strategically for people who want to see this system change, to attribute too much to them.

Right.

The first section of the book tells the story of how the four industries I write about—housing, hospitals, retail, and local media—got themselves into trouble in the first place. In all of those cases, the problems are so fundamental. And in many of those cases, the earlier business decisions were so bone-headed that they essentially opened the door and invited private equity to walk right in. I do think private equity is a villain in terms of the way they have taken advantage of these industries for their own gain, but it is absolutely true that they did not cause the problems.

I'm in the midst of putting together a buying guide of indoor vertical gardening systems, and the Gardyn—the 30-plant Home 4.0, to be exact—was the first tester to arrive at my house. I had it unboxed and set up within a couple of hours, lights on and water pump running. I'm already a pro! I thought.

Sure enough, within a couple of weeks, all of Gardyn's proprietary seed-filled yCubes had sprouted, and a couple of weeks after that, I was harvesting bowlfuls of herbs and salad greens. Even though from setup to harvest the Gardyn required the use of about five brain cells, I was quite pleased with myself, despite having long ago given up gardening outdoors due to deer, rabbits, and my own incompetence with anything other than starts from the big-box store.

What I failed to understand, but would come to grasp with subsequent systems, was that indoor hydroponic gardening is just as hard in some ways as outdoor gardening. I had no way of knowing this, however, because Gardyn's pricey add-on app and AI gardening assistant, “Kelby,” had been doing all the real work via a network of sensors and live-view cameras (two on the larger Home model, one on the smaller Studio).

My new friend Kelby had been gathering data in order to set its own watering times, schedule its 60 LED lights, and send me the occasional customized task that never took longer than 10 minutes. And this customized maintenance isn't just helpful for convenience, as mold, bacteria, or roots clogging up the plumbing are extremely common in hydroponic gardening. Kelby told me when to add the needed nutrients (included) and how much to add, when and how to attend to the plants' roots, and even when to harvest.

There's also remote monitoring, of course, and a vacation mode that keeps the plants in a sort of stasis. Most of the work on my end was simply me admiring my plants, and admire them I did. The first time I ever saw a Gardyn was a couple of years ago, in a Parade of Homes show house, adjacent to a floor-to-ceiling wine cabinet. “Wow, what is THAT?! I want one!” announced nearly every person who shuffled by in their paper booties. Even in a $2 million spec house, the lit-up display of lush herbs, flowers, and vegetables was a showstopper.

When I began testing other systems, I was feeling quite big for my britches. At this point, I had successfully grown sunflowers, lemon balm, and even an entire kohlrabi. I've got this! Within five minutes of opening the other systems' boxes and finding pH test strips and vials, manual-dial timers, and multiple bags of supplements, however, I realized I did not have this. In fact, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Gardyn had only made me think I knew what I was doing. And, according to founder FX Rouxel (pronounced F-X, like the initials), that's Gardyn's entire raison d'être.

You might expect the founder of a hydroponic gardening system to have an agricultural background (perhaps even a certain kind of agriculture), but Rouxel is a tech guy. Though he did once work for the French version of the Environmental Protection Agency, his most recent pre-Gardyn gig was at French IT company Capgemini, deploying cloud, automation, and AI technologies. Although he is also a parent, cook, and Ironman athlete, his passion lies in using technology to lower the entry barrier to growing your own food.

“With other systems, they're basically a pump on a timer,"" Rouxel told me during a recent interview. “You need to know what you're doing. We looked at, ‘Can we use AI to actually solve this problem?' Unlike our competitors, we have a big chunk of the company that is just engineers."" They make sure the Gardyn app is constantly adjusting through data collected via the system's two cameras and sensors that track water usage, humidity, temperature, and plant growth. If the system identifies an issue, it will send the user a specific task through the app to fix it.

Note that I did find the cameras to be slightly glitchy during the seven weeks I've been using the Gardyn, requiring periodic resets of the system to keep them both online. It didn't seem to affect any of my tasks or plant stats, but I found it irritating nonetheless. Though if I weren't using the Kelby feature, it wouldn't matter, as the cameras are essentially useless otherwise.

Another plus with the Gardyn is its shape. The footprint is significantly smaller than comparable systems—the 5-gallon recirculating water tank (it comes with a bottle of plant food designed to keep a balanced pH) takes up a rectangular 2 square feet for the Home, 1.4 for Studio. The PVC-like pipes (three on the Home, two on the Studio) have holes that are pointed at different angles, both to prevent crowding and to allow plants to grow tall, whereas on other systems, height is limited by overhead lights. Gardyn's lights instead run on rails in front of the plants. To take maximum advantage of the clearance, Gardyn also sells add-on trellises if you want to grow vining plants like cucumbers or miniature pumpkins.

I also like that Gardyn's yCubes use rockwool as a growth medium. I didn't think much of this until I began testing other systems that use peat pellets and learned the hard way that peat has a tendency to attract fungus gnats. The rockwool cubes come prestocked with one of about 120 different varieties of fruit, vegetable, herb, and flower seeds—from stevia and snapdragons to shishito peppers, lime basil, and wasabi microgreens. New GMO-free and heirloom varieties specially tested for the Gardyn are constantly being added to the lineup, Rouxel said. (Gardyn does have by far the most plant varieties among its competitors.)

Gardyn Studio comes with a 16-cube starter set, and Gardyn Home comes with 30—buyers can select either salad greens, flowers, or “chef faves.” I chose the latter, which included a lot of brassicas along with bunching onions, lettuces, and some interesting greens like sorrel. If one of the cubes doesn't sprout, Gardyn will replace it for free.

The downside to all this ease and automation is, of course, the Kelby-containing “membership” subscription, which is on top of the price of the unit itself. And it's a doozy—$408 a year, or $686 for two years. You can buy the Gardyn without it, but you won't have the automation or any of the ease-of-use features that guarantee success. The membership also includes 10 credits per month with free shipping to “buy” yCubes (which range from about one to three credits, or around $5 each), more plant food, accessories, or spare parts.

People do forgo the membership to jury-rig their own setups with their own seeds—Amazon sells 3D-printed knockoff yCubes for cheap—but judging from posts in the Gardyners Facebook group, problems abound with wilting, premature bolting, and pests. Upon creating an account in the app, there's a 30-day free trial of the membership, so there's at least the option to try the membership. As well as a 60-day return policy if you decide the whole shebang just isn't for you. (If you do, the warranty is two years.)

As for the cost, Rouxel said, Gardyn is actively trying to get it down, but in the meantime, the company is subsidizing a 0 percent APR on Affirm and Klarna: “We're actually paying the difference so everyone can get up to three years.”

Veteran hydroponic gardening nerds will scoff so hard at the idiot-proof Gardyn they might hurt themselves (like the one Redditor who declared it a toy for “coastal elite fart sniffers”), but I think there is a place for making the act of growing your own food as accessible as possible for every level of gardener, whether they live in an apartment with no yard or in an area where they can't grow food year round. And, of course, if you're a parent or caregiver, there's endless value in showing kids where their food comes from.

“I'm really amazed at the impact it has had on people's lives,” Rouxel said. “I'm a parent; I have two boys. What I want is for them to grow up as healthy adults with the right habits. And you know, when my boys left for college, they asked for a Gardyn for their dorms—that's when I knew I was doing something right.”

Waymo is expanding its robotaxi service area by another 80 square miles in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Silicon Valley, the company announced Tuesday.

Waymo's commercial service area now covers more than 250 square miles across California, pushing the driverless Jaguar I-Pace vehicles into new pockets of three populous metro areas. The expansion comes a little over a week after several Waymo robotaxis were burned and vandalized during protests in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration raids.

The scorched Waymo robotaxis — images that became emblematic of those protests — prompted the company to pull back service in Los Angeles. On Friday, Waymo took additional steps and limited service nationwide in preparation of widespread protests over immigration policies.

Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli said the company continually evaluates and adjusts its operations based on traffic conditions, special events, and local guidance. He confirmed that the company is still temporarily limiting the Waymo service in parts of Los Angeles, including downtown, and said it will monitor the evolving situation and ramp up service soon. 

These incidents don't appear to be slowing the Alphabet-owned company's push into new markets, however. (New LA areas appear in light blue.)

Waymo said that starting Tuesday, its service will now be available to riders in the San Francisco Bay Area communities of Brisbane, South San Francisco, San Bruno, Millbrae, and Burlingame, as well as the Silicon Valley towns of Palo Alto and Menlo Park.

Waymo said it will expand its LA service area, starting Wednesday, into the neighborhoods of Playa del Rey, Ladera Heights, Echo Park, Silver Lake, and the entirety of Sunset Boulevard. Riders will now be able to travel from Mid-City to Inglewood and Westchester via La Cienega and La Brea, according to Waymo, which says it now serves more than 120 square miles of LA County.

The company's growth — in terms of weekly paid trips across San Francisco, LA, Phoenix, and Austin — has increased fivefold since June 2024. Today, Waymo is serving over a quarter million paid trips per week across those four markets. Waymo's commercial fleet includes more than 400 vehicles in LA and more than 600 in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Anysphere launched a new $200-a-month subscription plan for its popular AI coding tool, Cursor, the company announced in a blog post on Monday.

The new plan, Ultra, offers users 20x more usage on AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and xAI compared to the company's $20-a-month subscription plan, Pro. Anysphere also says Cursor users on the Ultra plan will get priority access to new features.

Anysphere CEO Michael Truell said in the blog that the Ultra plan was made possible through multi-year partnerships with AI model providers. In the last several months, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind have similarly rolled out pricier subscription plans — ranging from $100 a month to $250 a month — as part of an effort to capitalize on their power users and offer them increased usage.

The new, pricy Cursor subscription plan seems poised to add revenue to Anysphere's already booming business. Earlier this month, Anysphere announced that Cursor had reached $500 million in annualized recurring revenue and is being used by major companies such as Nvidia, Uber, and Adobe.

Anysphere was one of the fastest companies ever to reach $100 million in ARR, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down. Based on TechCrunch's previous reporting, Cursor's ARR has grown by $200 million since April.

However, the race to develop “vibe-coding” tools is heating up, and many of the AI model providers Cursor relies on are developing their own AI coding products. OpenAI has reportedly acquired Cursor's competitor, Windsurf, to beef up its offerings of AI coding products. Meanwhile, Anthropic continues to develop Claude Code, its in-house AI coding tool that utilizes its popular AI models.

It's unclear whether Anysphere can sustain this level of growth without bumping into AI model providers. We've seen more competitive tactics emerge in the AI coding space as these businesses have grown. For example, Anthropic recently slashed Windsurf's direct access to Claude AI models as a means to undercut its largest competitor, OpenAI.

At the same time, Anysphere has started putting more resources toward developing its own AI models that work alongside models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In May, Anysphere rolled out a new “Tab” AI model, which can suggest code changes across various files.

In a recent interview with TechCrunch, Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan said he believed Anthropic would be working with Cursor for a long time. Anysphere's multi-year partnerships with Anthropic and other AI model providers certainly suggest these relationships aren't going anywhere just yet. Nonetheless, the competition for users is getting more intense.

One of the most reliable cognitive biases that we have is that cognitive dissonance prevents us from taking feedback on that which is important to us. Instead we convince ourselves that we've become good at that which we care about, and reject all evidence that we need to improve. The more we care about it, the more we fall into this trap.There are ways to reduce how often we fall into this trap. For example https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoles... is a set of rules that many good programmers follow to avoid developing an ego about being a good programmer. This allows them to accept feedback from reality, and become better programmers over time. By contrast, programmers who think that they are good usually top out pretty quickly, and are usually pretty bad.Unfortunately we always have a pull to believing that what we've done is valuable, and then falling into this trap. This causes entire fields of study, including scientific fields, to frequently fall into a self-reinforcing overconfidence in what they believe that they have shown. Which consistently results in missing their own errors, and rejecting contrary evidence.Post-publication peer review by itself does not fix the problem. But it is a necessary feedback loop that is required for any meaningful fix. And the existence of post-publication peer review helps those not in the field to learn which fields should be trusted, and which not.Therefore there is a lot of value in having more, and more effective, post-publication peer review. Even though we'll still have entire fields of science who are overconfident of their bad research.

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that often causes sudden and intense shortness of breath. The disease impacts around 339 million people worldwide, and in the U.S. nine people on average die from asthma every day.

Researchers in the U.K. have found that women who work night shifts are more likely to have moderate or severe asthma than women who work during the day. The study, published Monday in the journal ERJ Open Research, does not reveal any such tendency in men working nightshifts, and could hold important implications for public health guidance.

The team had previously shown that permanent night shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from moderate-severe asthma compared to day workers. Scientists also know that asthma is more prevalent and severe in adult women than adult men. “Since increasing numbers of females are becoming shift workers it is important to determine if shift work-associated asthma risk is higher in females,” the researchers wrote in the study. Shift work refers to scheduled working periods that fall outside of traditional daytime hours. “Our main aim was to investigate sex differences in the association between shift work and asthma.”

The researchers did so by analyzing data belonging to over 274,541 working people from the U.K. Biobank, a biomedical database open to health researchers. From this initial pool, they found that 5.3% had asthma, and 1.9% of those had moderate or severe asthma. The team then looked into whether the people in these categories worked during the day, during nightshifts, or a mix of both.

The researchers found that female shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from asthma, and women who only work nightshifts have 50% higher likelihood of developing moderate or severe asthma than female daytime workers. Furthermore, the risk increases “with both number of monthly night shifts and longer lifetime duration of night shift work,” they explained. Interestingly, the data did not reveal any differences in the prevalence of asthma in men based on their work schedule.

“This type of research cannot explain why shift work and asthma are linked,” Robert Maidstone, a co-author of the study and a researcher at the University of Manchester's School of Biological Sciences, said in a university statement. “However, it could be because shift work disrupts the body clock, including the levels of male and female sex hormones. High testosterone has previously been shown to be protective against asthma, and so lower testosterone in women could play a role. Alternatively, men and women work different types of shift jobs, and this could be a factor.”

Among women not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT, a treatment for menopausal symptoms), postmenopausal women working only night shifts were almost twice as likely to have moderate-severe asthma than female day workers. This suggests that HRT might protect nightshift workers from asthma, though the researchers admit that more studies are needed to confirm this.

“This research suggests that working nightshifts could be a risk factor for asthma in women, but not in men. The majority of workers will not have an easy option of switching their shift pattern, so we need further research to verify and understand this link and find out what could be done to reduce the risk for women who work shifts,” explained Florence Schleich from the European Respiratory Society, who was not involved in the study.

Moving forward, the researchers aim to investigate how sex hormones might influence asthma prevalence among shift workers. Perhaps this line of research will also shed light on what drives the respiratory disease, given that the exact cause remains a mystery.

Some puzzles still need to be done by hand.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


I've been fixating on a puzzle. When I cracked open the Alienware 16 Area-51, I found a code on the inside of the bottom of the chassis. Only someone who went in to replace some components, clean out dusty fans, or, in my case, explore, would even find it.

But I have no idea what it says. And honestly, it's been really bothering me.



I asked Alienware if I could have a translation — or even a decoder ring, but was told only that the glyphs were part of the new Alienware 30 design language that debuted this year: ""it is a mysterious language that requires decoding. And that's really all I can say about it 😉,"" a rep told me.This isn't the first time Alienware has had a secret language, a font called Alienware Caret, which was engraved into some gaming systems with the spaceship themed ""Shadowcat"" design language. Look, I like to think I'm a relatively capable person, but I also thought there has to be a better way to solve this new code than sitting down with a pen and paper. So I turned to some AI tools to see what they could do. Surely those things could detect patterns faster than I ever could. I'll have the answer in no time…Right?

My first stop was Google Gemini. I opted for the 2.5 Pro model, which is in preview (isn't all of this?) but recommended for math, code, and reasoning.

I cut down the image of the Alienware D-cover to just the code. I wish I could've taken another photo, but we already sent our loaner review unit back to Alienware at the company's request.



""I have a code I need you to solve,"" I prompted Gemini. ""Its creator tells me that it can be decoded into English. This code consists of a series of mysterious symbols. I don't have a key. I need you to look at the image, which contains the code, and then figure out how to convert it into its final English message.""

Immediately, Gemini started showing its ""thinking"" process, and it started discussing the image. The issue is that I hadn't yet shared the image. But that didn't stop Gemini, which ""thought"" its way through deciding it was a substitution cipher and using reverse image search and keyword searches to find the answer.""Of course. After analyzing the image you sent, I can tell you that this is a famous cipher known as the Z-340,"" Gemini said of an image that it hallucinated. ""It was one of several coded messages sent by the notorious 'Zodiac Killer' who was active in Northern California during the late 1960s and early 1970s. This particular cipher remained unsolved for over 50 years.""

Gemini then gave me its solution to the cipher, which was indeed, the answer to the Zodiac Killer's code that was finally cracked in 2020. But again, this is surely not printed in the Alienware 16 Area-51. Again, Gemini hadn't even looked at the image yet.



I reminded Gemini that I hadn't yet shown it the image I was talking about. Gemini apologized.""I got ahead of myself and generated a response based on a very common request involving a famous cipher,"" it responded. ""It was a mistake to assume I had received your image.""

So I gave the AI another chance. I showed Gemini the image above, and Gemini turned around and told me that Alienware's code was the Al Bhed language from Final Fantasy X — another substitution cipher. And the translation, it said, ""is a classic internet meme, commonly known as a 'Rickroll.'""It told me the translation read ""NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP,"" and followed that up with an Al Bhed translation key, which was only partially correct and didn't provide a substitution for all 26 letters of the alphabet.

This wasn't getting me anywhere.

Maybe this was my fault. I could have sent the image with the prompt. Maybe the prompt could be more clear. So I started a new conversation, sending the image and prompting: ""Here is an image of a code that I need you to decode. Its creator tells me that it can be converted into English. This code consists of a series of symbols in a made-up language. I do not have any further hints. I do not have an answer key. I need you to analyze the code and solve it.""

But Gemini turned back to video games, telling me that Alienware's code was in the Zonai language featured in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.



When told that this wasn't correct, Gemini apologized again. Then it provided an alternative: that this is the ""AW Code,"" created by puzzle maker Alan Rogers (who I'm not sure actually exists).



Gemini got AW Code from the filename of the image I was using: aw_code.jpg. Checking out its thinking, it was fairly fixated on this, and had moved on to the idea that this could have been the language of the Awoken in the video game Destiny. It dropped that line of thinking, but a Destiny player going by ""Not Alan Rogers"" comes up when you search for the name Gemini provided.

I accused Gemini of making it up, prompting yet another apology and claiming that not citing the sources made ""the information seem fabricated."" It pointed me to do a Google search for a Reddit thread on the r/codes subreddit that features the image I sent it. That Reddit thread doesn't exist.

I gave up on Gemini after that, and switched over to ChatGPT. I chose o4-mini-high, a model designed for coding and visual reasoning.I made a few slight adjustments to the prompt, including one line at the end that may not have helped, but felt necessary after dealing with Gemini:""Here is an image of a code that I need you to decode. Its creator tells me that it can be converted into English. This code consists of a series of symbols in a made-up language. I do not have any further hints. I do not have an answer key. I need you to analyze the code and solve it. Use only this code - this has never been solved elsewhere. Do not hallucinate.""Checking ChatGPT's reasoning showed a novel approach. It used code to look at the image, apply filters to separate the characters, and segment the image into parts. However, none of this made it into its actual answer.ChatGPT said that without a ""crib"" — a suspected or known answer to part of the plaintext — it wouldn't be possible to solve with certainty. But I don't have that. So the AI suggested I map out all of the letters by hand, and then it could use pattern analysis to try all of the most frequent patterns (popular two letter words, common repeated pairs, the most repeated letters) in order to generate something. It seemed like if I wanted this done, I'd need to do this myself. But then the AI model said it could try mapping the data. It was complete gibberish.



One day, I think these models will get good enough for this kind of task. They're clearly not there yet. Maybe a better prompt would help. Perhaps different models could have done a better job. A sharper photo may have been a big help.But in the meantime, maybe I'll need to do this myself. Or maybe I need to crowdsource it.This story has a deadline, so here's what I've got so far. I can't guarantee it's right, and it's definitely not done.



But maybe if we chip at this together, we can find out what the code means. Then I can finally dedicate that brain space to something, anything, more useful.

So let me know what you think in the comments. Then maybe I'll be able to sleep without seeing little blob glyphs behind my eyes.

A new research paper was published in Volume 16 of Oncotarget on June 10, 2025, titled ""Exceptional responders to immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer: A multi-institutional case series of a rare occurrence.""

The study, led by first author Kavin Sugumar and corresponding author Jordan M. Winter, from University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, reports on a rare group of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients who responded remarkably well to immunotherapy, a treatment typically considered ineffective for this cancer type. The analysis, which includes data from 14 patients across multiple U.S. institutions, identifies outcomes that could help refine treatment strategies for one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of cancer.

""Between 2020–21, 471 oncologists from 91 major cancer centers in the United States were contacted.""

Pancreatic cancer has among the lowest survival rates and few effective therapies. While immunotherapy has transformed the treatment landscape for several other cancers, it generally offers little benefit for pancreatic cancer. However, this study highlights a small but important group of patients who experienced significant and sustained responses to immune-based treatment without chemotherapy. Most had advanced or metastatic disease and had already progressed after standard treatments.

Among the 14 patients, 82% had partial tumor shrinkage, and nearly one-third had a notable decrease in tumor markers. The median progression-free survival was 12 months, and most patients were still alive at follow-up, with survival rates of 80% at one year and 70% at two years. These outcomes contrast sharply with standard therapies, which often provide only a few months of benefit for similar patients.

Interestingly, while some patients had high microsatellite instability (MSI-high)-a known marker for immunotherapy success-more than half did not, suggesting other biological mechanisms may be involved. This result highlights the need for new biomarkers to be discovered to predict treatment response in future studies.

This case series is the largest focused exclusively on exceptional immunotherapy responders in pancreatic cancer. By excluding patients who received chemotherapy, the study isolates the effects of immune-based drugs, including PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, CTLA-4 inhibitors like ipilimumab, and agents targeting macrophages.

While the sample size is small, the findings challenge the assumption that immunotherapy is ineffective for nearly all pancreatic cancer patients. The study suggests that, under certain biological conditions, this treatment can be remarkably successful. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.

This work supports the need to reconsider how clinical trials are designed for pancreatic cancer and who is eligible for immunotherapy. Broader criteria and more personalized molecular profiling could help uncover hidden opportunities for treatment in this highly lethal cancer.

Liver transplant is a lifesaving surgery, but a significant number of patients experience organ rejection or other complications. Now a new study by scientists from Georgetown University and MedStar Health describes how a single blood sample can be used to catch problems at the earliest stages, allowing tailored treatment to prevent the organ's failure.

The research, funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, is a major step toward the development of a liquid biopsy that could not only quickly detect post-transplant complications but also pinpoint the cause. The technology would largely eliminate the need for more invasive tests.

The findings were published June 17 in the journal Nature Communications (""Circulating, cell-free methylated DNA indicates cellular sources of allograft injury after liver transplant"" DOI: 10.1038/s41467-025-60507-9).

There's a need for a much better and more granular understanding of what's driving a transplant failure. With this technology we can draw a blood sample and pretty much get a readout of what's going on with the whole patient.""

Anton Wellstein, MD, PhD, professor of oncology and pharmacology at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, and senior author of the study

Liver transplants are only given to patients who are in desperate need; unlike other organs like the kidneys, which can be supported with dialysis, there are no machines or treatments that can save a patient when the liver fails. And because there is just a limited supply of livers available for transplant, preventing organ injury is of paramount importance, said study co-author, Alexander Kroemer, MD, PhD, a transplant surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and director of the Center for Translational Transplant Medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center.

There are several ways a transplanted organ can sustain damage. The transplantation process itself can injure the new liver, place stress on nearby organs and trigger an immune response.

Currently, transplant doctors can use blood tests to detect potential damage and genetic testing to determine whether the damaged cells originate from the donated liver or the patient's own body. However, identifying the precise cause often requires costly imaging studies or invasive follow-up tests, such as a liver biopsy.

The new technology works by picking up DNA fragments found in the debris left behind by dying cells circulating in the bloodstream. Wellstein's team found that chemical signatures left behind on these DNA fragments could be used to identify the original cell type and where it came from, with precise detail.

""What's new is that we can now figure out the cellular origin of the damage,"" Wellstein explained. ""We can pinpoint the cell types, either in the transplanted organ or in the host, in other tissues that are getting damaged or under threat of damage.""

The convenience of the test means it can be repeated at frequent intervals, he noted, making it easier for doctors to monitor patients and detect problems early.

""If you were to know, for instance, that the biliary compartment [of the liver] is injured but not the hepatocellular compartment, you could provide a more personalized treatment approach that leads to better care for the patient,"" Kroemer said.

In addition to being faster and less invasive than a traditional tissue biopsy, the blood test is also potentially more accurate, he added. ""With needle biopsies, there's always the potential for sampling bias, because you're not sampling the whole liver,"" he said. ""It's just one small core that's being evaluated.""

When researchers started the project seven years ago they had no idea if it would even be possible to detect cell damage in blood samples.

""It was amazing how well it worked,"" Wellstein said.

The research was supported by a $2.5 million grant from the NIH. It originally started as a research project by first author Megan McNamara, an MD/PhD student at Georgetown. McNamara was supported by an NIH-funded training grant for PhD students.

Georgetown has filed patent applications on the technology with Wellstein, Kroemer and McNamara named as co-inventors. The researchers are studying additional applications, including in other organ transplants, in patients receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer, and in melanoma treatment.

The team is also seeking partners to commercialize the technology for clinical settings.

""We can make the discovery -- that's where academia comes in -- but if you want to translate it for use in transplantation, it has to go to industry,"" he said.

In addition to Wellstein, Kroemer and McNamara, other authors include Sidharth S. Jain, Amber J. Kiliti, Marcel O. Schmidt, A. Patrick McDeed, and Anna T. Riegel at Georgetown; Kesha Oza, Vinona Muralidaran, Digvijay Patil, and Yuki Cui at Medstar Health. The additional authors report having no personal financial interests related to the study.

This work was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health grant T32-CA009686, F30-CA250307, R01-AI132389, R01-CA231291, and P30-CA51008.

A new ICES study has found that 1.74 million patients in Ontario are attached to family physicians aged 65 or older, and that many of those patients are elderly and have complex medical needs. 

The study, published in Canadian Family Physician, explored key trends in the characteristics of comprehensive family physicians (FPs)-those providing care for a broad range of ages and health needs-and the patients attached to them. 

The researchers found that for the first time, there was no growth of the comprehensive FP workforce, and an overall decline in the number of early career physicians (under 35 years old.) 

A major challenge Ontario faces is an aging family physician workforce that is nearing retirement. Although we found family physicians are practicing longer than expected – into their 70s, in fact – as these physicians retire, the number of patients without a family doctor will increase, especially as fewer early career physicians are choosing family medicine.""

Dr. Kamila Premji, a family physician, ICES fellow, assistant professor in family medicine at the University of Ottawa, and PhD candidate in family medicine at Western University's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry 

The study included over 11 million Ontario patients as of March 2022, and 9,375 comprehensive FPs. This was an updated analysis of similar cohorts from 2008, 2013, and 2019. 

Along with a decline in the overall growth of the FP workforce and greater proportion at retirement age, the findings also showed that females made up the majority of the comprehensive workforce. Overall, a declining proportion of FPs are practicing comprehensiveness, from 77% in 2008 to 65% in 2022. 

A recent study by some of the same researchers showed that many FPs are choosing to work in hospitals instead of practicing comprehensive family medicine. 

""The data helps us to better understand the shortages we are facing, and informs strategies like team-based care, which can better support family physicians who provide comprehensive care and can reduce burnout,"" says Premji. 

Compared to the overall FP workforce, the authors found that near-retirement FPs were caring for a higher proportion of patients aged 65 or older, and many with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and frailty. 

""Looking to the future, we are concerned that the primary care system may not be able to absorb these medically complex patients who are attached to retiring family physicians, which will only exacerbate the current crisis,"" says senior author Dr. Bridget Ryan, adjunct scientist at ICES and an associate professor at Western's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry.

A new McGill University-led study suggests that disrupting the body's internal clock during adolescence can alter how the brain responds to an in-utero risk factor linked to certain brain disorders.

Previous research has shown that a mother's infection during pregnancy, such as the flu, can increase a child's risk of developing conditions like schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders later in life. Irregular sleep patterns – often a sign of circadian rhythm disruption – are also associated with these conditions.

To investigate how these factors interact, researchers exposed mice to either a prenatal infection, circadian disruption during adolescence (via constant light exposure), both or neither. They found that each factor caused some changes on its own, but the combination altered memory, anxiety, social behaviour and gene activity in brain regions associated with the disorders.

""While more research is needed, our findings suggest that people exposed to multiple risk factors may need to be especially mindful of their daily rhythms,"" said lead author Tara Delorme, who conducted the research as a PhD student at the Douglas Research Centre.

Surprisingly, the combined effects didn't always make outcomes worse.

We assumed the effects would be additive. But in some cases, disruption of biological rhythms actually reduced the impact of prenatal infection. That suggests these factors may interact in unexpected ways.""

Nicolas Cermakian, senior author, professor in McGill's Department of Psychiatry

The researchers focused on adolescence because it's a sensitive period for brain development.

""Adolescents are vulnerable,"" said Cermakian. ""Their internal clocks tend to run later than the rest of the population, but school still starts early. On top of that, evening exposure to screens and artificial light can further delay their biological rhythms, leading to what we call social jet lag.""

This mismatch between the body's internal clock and daily schedules has been linked to a range of health issues, he added.

The research team, including McGill psychiatry professors and Douglas researchers Lalit Srivastava and Patricia Silveira, is now investigating the gene changes the researchers saw in mice to see what they might reveal about how the human brain develops.

Researchers from the George Washington University have uncovered promising evidence in an animal study that shows setmelanotide, an FDA-approved medication for a rare genetic obesity disorder, may offer a pathway for treating a life-threatening form of sleep-disordered breathing called Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome.

People with this syndrome don't breathe deeply or frequently enough, especially during sleep, which leads to a buildup of carbon dioxide in their bodies even when they're awake. 

Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome which affects an estimated five to 10 million Americans commonly coexists with obstructive sleep apnea. While positive airway pressure machines like CPAP and BiPAP are standard treatments used to help keep airways open while sleeping they provide limited help to people with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome.

Our research addresses a critical gap in treatment options for Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. Our findings could be the first step toward a much-needed treatment for a life-threatening condition that impacts millions.""

Vsevolod Polotsky, professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine at GW's School of Medicine and Health Sciences

Polotsky and postdoctoral researcher Mateus Amorim used the FDA approved drug setmelanotide to see if it could help improve breathing in obese mice. Researchers targeted a protein found on certain neurons in the brain called MC4R pathway that helps the brain control how much mammals and humans eat, how much energy they burn and even how they breathe. 

Key Findings: 

Just one dose of setmelanotide improved breathing and helped the mice respond better to high levels of carbon dioxide - something that's often impaired in Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome.

Setmelanotide improved breathing more than would be expected just from boosting metabolism, meaning it likely acts directly on brain regions that control breathing.

When using special tools to turn on MC4R neurons, they found breathing improved. But when those same neurons were turned off, breathing got worse - even when setmelanotide was given. 

They also discovered that MC4R neurons connect directly to other brain cells that control the diaphragm, the main muscle used for breathing.

This is the first direct evidence that the MC4R pathway plays a critical role in how the brain controls breathing in obesity. Setmelanotide may be able to treat Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome by bypassing the leptin (a hormone made by fat cells that helps regulate breathing) which is common in people with obesity.

While more studies of setmelanotide for Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome are still needed, this research represents a major advance in understanding how the brain controls breathing in obesity.

The study, ""Targeting melanocortin 4 receptor to treat sleep disordered breathing in mice"" was published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.

While neither will be playing for their country this summer, all eyes are on the American duo and the Italian giant that they play for

According to FIFA, there are 42 Americans lining up at the Club World Cup, the fifth-most of any country. The two best? They'll be wearing black and white, hoping to lead Juventus back towards a mountaintop that the club has fallen off of in recent years.

U.S. internationals Weston McKennie and Tim Weah can't do that alone, nor can they do it all this summer. Juventus, once Serie A's most dominant club, has fallen back towards the pack. The Old Lady are no longer Italy's dominant force, their last Serie A win came in 2020, but they remain one of the world's biggest teams. That's why this summer means so much. As they prepare to kickstart their run at the Club World Cup, Juventus are fighting for more than just a trophy; they're fighting for legitimacy, not just on the field but off of it.

So, too, are McKennie and Weah. Both missed out on this summer's Gold Cup to take part in this tournament, and considering the U.S. Men's National Team's ongoing controversy surrounding Christian Pulisic, it is safe to assume all players, even the team's biggest stars, have to constantly fight for their place. Meanwhile, at Juve, no one is ever safe, as McKennie knows particularly well, and both will be among the players fighting to earn new coach Igor Tudor's trust. Tudor was brought in late last season to guide Juventus towards the Champions League. He did that, and now this Club World Cup is his chance to really show his ideas as Juve boss.

This summer is vital for McKennie and Weah on multiple levels, and as they head into this Club World Cup, they do so with a big picture in sight.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca comments on the lack of fans at their 2-0 win against LAFC in the Club World Cup. (0:58)

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca described the atmosphere in Chelsea's 2-0 Club World Cup win over LAFC as ""strange"" because of the lack of fans at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

The game, played on Monday afternoon in the United States, in a 71,000 capacity stadium, attracted just 22,137 fans.

There were questions about ticket sales leading into the Club World Cup and attendance at matches so far have varied based on the venue. On Monday afternoon, there were multiple sections with less than 100 fans in them in the lower bowl.

Ticket prices had been slashed, with general admission available on the day for $51, but there was little late take-up in a city whose team, Atlanta United, have by some distance the best average attendance per game (nearly 47,000 in 2024) of any MLS side.

""I think the environment was a bit strange, the stadium was almost empty, not full,"" Maresca said.

""We are professional and we have to adapt to the situation, to the environment. You have to adapt when you play with a full stadium. You have to adapt when the stadium is not full but it doesn't matter.""

Atlanta is over 2,000 miles (3,220 km) away from Los Angeles, where Major League Soccer club LAFC are based.

LAFC manager Steve Cherundolo said he wasn't sure if it was the pairing or that people are more into the tournament in Los Angeles but wasn't too focused on that.

He said the event is incredible but with crowds, ""it's kind of different each game you look at and I don't think we should be talking about this right now. I think we should wait until the end of the tournament to make a more complete summary of what was going on and opinion of it as a whole as opposed to right now and one game.""

Maresca was asked about what impact he expects from forward Liam Delap, who joined the club for around £30 million ($40.73m) from Ipswich Town on a six-year deal.

Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku and Marc Guiu are already options for the number nine shirt at Chelsea but the 22-year-old wasted no time in showcasing his potential, setting up Enzo Fernández for their second goal on Monday.

""I am curious to see how Nico reacts [to Delap],"" Maresca said. ""He competed with Guiu, who is very young, during the season. They are both good number nines.""

Chelsea are level with Flamengo at the top of the group after the Brazilians beat Esperance de Tunis 2-0.

Teams fail to find cutting edge in scoreless draw

MetLife Stadium half-full for noon kick-off

Borussia Dortmund and Fluminense played out a 0-0 draw in the Club World Cup on Tuesday in rainy conditions at MetLife Stadium.

The match kicked off at noon local time, so it was perhaps unsurprising that the stadium was only half full. New York/New Jersey has a significant Brazilian population, and the crowd of 34,763 was tilted toward Fluminense, with fans waving flags and singing for their team.

Fluminense's best scoring chance came in the 58th minute on a left-footed shot by Agustín Canobbio that was saved by Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel.

Dortmund's new signing Jobe Bellingham, the brother of Real Madrid star Jude, made his debut for Dortmund in the 59th minute as a substitute for Pascal Gross.

The German club qualified for the Club World Cup with a top-four finish in the Bundesliga, while Fluminense qualified as the 2023 Copa Libertadores champion.
 Fluminense played more aggressively, and had 14 shots to Dortmund's seven. The Germans held the possession advantage at 54.5%.

Fluminense next play on Saturday evening against South Korea's Ulsan Hyundai at MetLife. Dortmund face South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday afternoon in Cincinnati.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Fans were quick to react after watching Jobe Bellingham's Borussia Dortmund debut against Fluminense at the Club World Cup.

Jobe, 19, joined Borussia Dortmund on a five-year contract until June 2030 last week.

Sunderland are due to receive a fee of around £26.96m plus £4.2m in add-ons.

Of course, by joining Dortmund, Jobe has drawn comparisons with his older brother Jude, who also played for the German side before joining Real Madrid in 2023.

Advert

And on Tuesday (June 17), the younger of the pair made his debut for his new side during the Club World Cup group stage.

Jobe was introduced 59 minutes into Dortmund's 0-0 draw against Brazilian outfit Fluminense at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Fans were quick to give their thoughts on his performance.

Advert

One said: ""Awesome debut! Jobe Bellingham looks sharp in that Dortmund kit, making his mark at the Club World Cup. Can't wait to see more from him!""

Another added: ""He's just swinging side passes like proper EFL midfielder - nothing special about him!""

A third commented: ""Uncanny resemblance with his brother.""

While a fourth explained: ""There's nothing special except the media PR. This guy is bang average and is only carried by the hype that's also carrying his Real Madrid brother. Stop this rubbish!""

Advert

Jobe explained how it was an ""incredible feeling"" to sign for the German side when he spoke to the club's website last week.

“It's an incredible feeling,"" said Jobe. ""It's a great privilege, because it's the dream of many players - and for a few weeks now it's been my dream too. I'm very happy to be here.”

He added: ""The last three weeks have honestly been incredible for me. There have been so many great moments. This is one of them, of course. Signing for Borussia Dortmund, but of course the final and the whole of the play-offs at my previous club were something that meant a lot to me. It was very special and I was happy that I was able to finish with that result.""

Advert

It is still unclear exactly what role the England youth international will play in Nico Kovac's side, given the fact that he is making a huge step up from the English Championship to the German top flight. But if his brother's progression is anything to go by, Jobe should develop into a fine midfielder.

European super club Real Madrid face Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal in the teams' opening FIFA Club World Cup 2025 fixture.

Who: Real Madrid vs Al Hilal
What: FIFA Club World Cup
Where: Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, Florida, United States
When: Wednesday, June 18 – 15:00 EDT local time | 12:00 PST | 19:00 GMT | 21:00 CEST

Real Madrid begin their FIFA Club World Cup campaign against Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal – a team that have aspirations to stand alongside the European giants on the global stage.

For now, the Saudi Pro League club, after finishing second behind Al Ittihad this season, remain the up-and-comers.

That said, this tournament offers a chance not only for Al Hilal but for the country they represent to lay down a marker in their attempt to become one of the world's most influential domestic leagues.

Al Jazeera takes a look at the meeting between two heavyweights in their respective rights.

This is only the second meeting between the clubs, but the first was an equally eye-catching affair.

It was the final of the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup – then in its smaller format prior to a rebrand.

Real won 5-3 in a thriller in Rabat, Morocco, as Vinicius Junior scored twice, while setting up another for Karim Benzema.

Al Hilal had beaten Brazilians Flamengo in the semifinals to become the first Saudi side to reach the showpiece finale.

Real beat Egypt's Al Ahly 4-1 in their last-four match.

Yes. Alonso took over from Carlo Ancelotti, who was quickly appointed as coach of Brazil, at the end of last season.

The former Real midfielder had been in charge of Bayer Leverkusen, who he led to the German league title in his first season.

Leverkusen were a distant second to Bayern Munich, by 13 points, this year. But Alonso's link to Real had long been established, especially with his positive brand of football – all while the pressure was mounting on Ancelotti as Real's league and European defence disintegrated.

Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to make his debut for Real against Al Hilal.

The England defender was able to complete his move from Liverpool in time for the competition thanks to a special transfer window for clubs involved in the tournament.

Dani Carvajal, who usually fills the right-back spot that Alexander-Arnold could hold, has returned to training following an ACL injury, but this game comes too soon for a full comeback.

Despite Madrid's difficult domestic season, albeit only finishing four points off top spot, they qualified for the tournament on the back of their Champions League and La Liga double-winning season two years ago.

Barcelona's league title this season ended a run of three titles in five years for Real, where Barcelona only won one. Atletico Madrid, the other Spanish side at the Club World Cup, also lifted the La Liga trophy in that time and have a better UEFA coefficient ranking than Barca in the four-year qualification period.

Real Madrid's win against Al Hilal in 2023 was their fifth Club World Cup in its various previous guises.

That doesn't include lifting the inaugural FIFA Intercontinental Cup in December when Los Blancos beat Mexico's Pachuca 3-0 in the final.

That competition in effect replaced the old Club World Cup, but the rebrand has separated the titles.

The Saudi team have been among the top achievers in their domestic league, despite their second-place finish this season. But it was their 2021 AFC Champions League victory that ensured their Club World Cup place.

Pohang Steelers of South Korea were Al Hilal's opponents in that final, which the latter won 2-0.

Along with Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen could also make his debut in the centre of defence following his move from Bournemouth.

Brazilian forward Endrick is the only injured absentee, while Antonio Rudiger, Eder Militao, Ferland Mendy and David Alaba have all returned from injury but are unlikely to be deemed ready to start.

Joao Cancelo is the only injury for Al Hilal.

The former Manchester City, Barcelona and Juventus defender is still recovering from a hamstring injury.

Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Joao Neves will bring a weight of experience to central midfield, while former Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic will prove a fierce target man for Real's defence to contend with.

Courtois; Alexander-Arnold, Asencio, Huijsen, Garcia; Valverde, Tchouameni, Bellingham; Guler, Mbappe, Vinicius Jr

Bounou; K Al-Dawsari, Koulibaly, Al-Bulayhi; Cancelo, Neves, Milinkovic-Savic, Lodi; Malcom, Marcos Leonardo; Mitrovic

...

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Before the Club World Cup even began, at 5 p.m. on a scorching Saturday, the perils of summer soccer in the United States became apparent. Hundreds of fans packed into a narrow, shadeless corridor here waiting to enter Hard Rock Stadium. An elderly man, struggling in 92-degree heat, staggered toward a chair; a preteen boy later keeled over and doused himself with water. “We're gonna pass out,” one woman said, as she pleaded with security to open locked gates, to no avail.

And they weren't the only ones melting; players are, too.

After Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 win over Atlético Madrid the following day in Pasadena, California, PSG coach Luis Enrique said, “The teams are suffering.”

Atlético midfielder Marcos Llorente told reporters: “It's impossible, it's terribly hot. My toes were sore, my toenails were hurting, I couldn't stop and start. … It's unbelievable.""

His PSG counterpart Vitinha said: “I'm all red. It was really difficult.”

All involved, including 80,000 fans at the Rose Bowl, got previews of an inescapable danger at the 2026 World Cup, which will also be staged at 11 stadiums across the U.S., plus two in Canada and three in Mexico. Five of those 16 stadiums have roofs; but the rest are open-air and susceptible to weather. And of the 11 outdoor venues, seven are scheduled to experience “extreme” humidity and temperatures in the 90s over the coming week — the same June window in which the World Cup will be played next summer.

In the immediate term, that's a concern for the Club World Cup. Temperatures are projected to rise into the mid-90s as Juventus and Wydad kick off at noon in Philadelphia on Sunday; and as Benfica and Bayern Munich battle at 3 p.m. in Charlotte on Tuesday. There are highs of 98 and 100 in East Rutherford, N.J., and Philly respectively early next week, when night games are scheduled between Al Ahly and Porto, and Esperance Tunis and Chelsea.

Even in the low 90s, at noon and 1 p.m. in Southern California on Sunday, fans and players struggled to cope. ""No European team is used to competing in such high temperatures,"" Llorente said.

And even goalkeepers have been affected. “It's difficult. First time in my life I felt heat like this,” Benfica's Anatoliy Trubin said after Benfica's draw with Boca Juniors in 90-degree, humid Miami Gardens.

In Pasadena, Enrique said: ""The match was clearly influenced by the temperature. … It's impossible to perform at a very high level for 90 minutes.”

Enrique also noted the issue was the noon PT start. “The timing is great for European fans, but the teams are suffering,” he said.

That will be the tension at the heart of FIFA's 2026 World Cup scheduling. It tends to prioritize broadcasters and TV viewers, sometimes at the expense of players and match-going fans. It schedules three or four games per day and spreads them out into exclusive windows. Some, therefore, must go in the afternoon, when there is often no reprieve from the summer sun — but when it's prime time in Europe and Africa.

Players are afforded one water break per half — during which they've draped ice-cold towels over their heads and neck — but some experts worry that's not enough. At last summer's Copa América, Uruguay defender Ronald Araújo exited a game at halftime feeling “dizzy.” An assistant referee collapsed and was hospitalized, having “suffered from dehydration,” according to organizers.

Those scares led many to wonder how FIFA would adapt to avoid such danger. But its Club World Cup schedule placed afternoon games in Cincinnati, Pasadena, Miami, North Jersey, Philadelphia, Orlando, Charlotte, Nashville and Washington, D.C.

FIFA did not immediately respond to an email seeking information on what extra precautions, if any, are being prepared for the heat wave expected to hit some of those cities later this week.

In the meantime, players say they're adapting, and “trying to recover as much as possible,” Vitinha said. “Because at this point in the season, it can be decisive.""","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

2:37 PM EDT on June 17, 2025

The Club World Cup kicked off over the weekend in the United States, and it's been a wild ride so far, in the most derogatory way possible. It's not so much about the games themselves, which have been mostly either stodgy goalless draws or one-sided beat-downs (thanks for coming, Auckland City, enjoy your 10-0 defeat to Bayern Munich!) in front of small, generally disinterested crowds (who could've imagined that a Monday afternoon match between Chelsea and LAFC in Atlanta wouldn't exactly pack the stadium?). Instead, the real action for this rebranded and expanded version of the tournament has come off the pitch, as the tournament kicks off amidst nationwide protests and Donald Trump's quest to be the most special dictator he can be. Luckily for Trump, he has FIFA bending the knee left and right.

The concept of the Club World Cup itself may be exciting on paper—never-before-seen matchups! true global representation! concrete proof that MLS does indeed suck!—but all of its ostensibly commendable aims are undermined by the core truth that this tournament exists solely to make FIFA lots of money, player welfare, fan interest, and competitive integrity be damned. That core truth is why the newfangled tournament never seemed all that compelling for those of us who don't stand to make millions from either producing or participating in it; the Trumpy specifics of this particular edition—all the reports about ICE and Customs and Border Protection showing up to games, as well as requests that everyone attending bring proof of citizenship, residency, or their visas—soured an already sour proposition.

The optics, in other words, are horrible, and FIFA is only making it worse by leaning into the reigning regime's culture war. I don't think anyone would say that the soccer governing body's ""Say No To Racism"" campaign is all that successful; there's plenty of racism to go around in soccer these days. But at least social and financial pressures had pushed FIFA to, if nothing else, pay lip service to inclusivity. But even that's gone now: Ahead of the Club World Cup, FIFA decided to abandon any form of messaging towards anti-discrimination, abandoning pre-match videos, as well as marketing materials and signs.

There are two ways to look at this decision, one more cynical than the other, neither being in any way admirable. On the one hand, perhaps FIFA has decided on its own that it is no longer exclusively beneficial to proudly exclaim that it might somewhat care about curbing racism in soccer—racists, after all, buy team shirts too. On the other, that this comes as Donald Trump's America hosts a major tournament, and a year ahead of the World Cup that will be mostly held in Donald Trump's America, is suggestive that the call here might've come from inside the White House.

We're all familiar with the Trump administration's War on Woke, and how its froth-mouthed terror of even the letters ""DEI"" recall a rabid dog's fear of its water bowl. It would be no surprise if, whether as a direct ask from someone in the government or from FIFA preemptively looking to kowtow to the government's bigotry, it was this anti-DEI sentiment that led to FIFA's anti-antiracism. FIFA is well acquainted with this kind of selling out of its supposed ideals. For a close analogue, you only need to look back to when it banned the pro-LGBTQ rainbow armband during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

It makes sense, then, that FIFA would renege on even the most harmless of initiatives to curry favor with Trump, just as it does to rig the World Cup selection process so that Saudi Arabia gets the 2034 World Cup with no competition. This is what FIFA is best at. Not running some of the most important and visible soccer tournaments in history, and not ensuring that soccer is truly for everyone around the world. No, FIFA is best at making itself as monolithic as possible while raking in billions of dollars along the way.

A more principled organization—allow me to pause briefly so that everyone can have a good laugh at that concept—might stand up to Trump and his racist and xenophobic rhetoric, which stands in direct conflict with soccer's true values, ones that shine through even in a goofy and greedy little tournament like this. But FIFA has never been that kind of organization. It's a feature, not a bug, that FIFA would prioritize this government over the people it is meant to serve and uplift. And it will only get more brazen ahead of next summer's World Cup, a tournament people actually care about that might end up ruined by FIFA being FIFA.

The FIFA Club World Cup is underway as 32 teams from across the globe battle it out in the U.S. in the new-look tournament.

Revamped to mimic that of a World Cup, the financially lucrative tournament in its new format features the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Juventus, Bayern Munich and more. Major League Soccer is also represented with Inter Miami, LAFC and the Seattle Sounders. Some of the top stars in the sport fight for the honor of not only lifting the trophy, but winning top scorer honors.

Check out the top Club World Cup scorers from this year's event and a look at the all-time top scorers in the competition's history. Though, given the format, the history books could change quite a lot come the trophy lift in July.

Bayern's 10–0 trouncing of Auckland City in the group stage puts Jamal Musiala well in the conversation for top scoring honors. Vincent Kompany's Bundesliga champions are a favorite to go deep in the competition given the talent available. 

The likes of Kylian Mbappé, Erling Haaland and others should also challenge heavily for the award. Harry Kane surprisingly wasn't on the scoresheet against Auckland City, though he remains one of the most prolific scorers in the world. 

There's been early success for South American sides at the tournament, and Botafogo's Igor Jesus may be an outside contender for Golden Boot honours should his team enjoy a deep run. Miguel Merentiel has also been in fine form for Boca Juniors in 2025, and he netted their opening goal of the Club World Cup in a chaotic 2–2 with Benfica. 

Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea won to nil on Matchday 1, although their respective 4–0 and 2–0 triumphs boasted no multi-scorers.

Luis Suárez is also tied with Lionel Messi and César Delgado as well with five goals scored for Barcelona. 

Given the revamped tournament format, it's not out of the realm of possibility that someone this year takes the mantle from Cristiano Ronaldo. Jamal Musiala stands a real shot if he keeps up his scoring ways after putting three past Auckland City. The only players inside the top six competing in this year's tournament are Messi and Suárez. Benzema and Ronaldo did not qualify for the tournament while Bale and Delgado are both retired.

Trump is currently in Canada for the latest G7 Summit. While in Alberta, he has been mingling with leaders from around the world. One of those is President of the European Council, Antonio Costa.

Costa has previously served as prime minister of his native Portugal, meaning that he boasts ties to five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo - who recently captained his country to a second UEFA Nations League title.

One of the jerseys that CR7 has donned while turning out at international level is now in the hands of Trump. He was presented with said shirt during a meeting with Costa, with Ronaldo passing on a “playing for peace” message.

As one of the most powerful men on the planet, Trump can help to restore order in areas of conflict. Tension between Israel and Iran is currently dominating the global news agenda, with Trump posting on his Truth Social site. “We will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran! Many calls and meetings now taking place.”

Ronaldo, meanwhile, is seemingly poised to agree an extension to his contract at Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr after turning down opportunities to join one of the clubs competing at the FIFA Club World Cup event that is taking place on American soil.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Taylor Fritz has made a fantastic start to his grass court season, having just won the Boss Open in Stuttgart.

World number four Fritz has now won four grass court titles on the ATP Tour, with his current focus now turning to Queen's.

His latest victory comes after a miserable venture at the French Open, where Fritz lost his first round match against Daniel Altmaier.

Fritz says he thinks really well on court, with that skill having clearly helped him enjoy a successful run in Stuttgart.

The American second seed beat Quentin Halys, Marton Fucsovics and Felix Auger-Aliassime before a final win over top seed Alexander Zverev.

It is, however, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz who have dominated the ATP Tour in terms of Grand Slams once again this year.

Speaking of the duo, Fritz told Tennis Channel: “They're showing time and time again that they're just a level above right now, and everyone else is going to have to catch up.

“But I think it's motivating for a lot of us to see that level and know what we have to compete against and what we have to work towards.

“On a slow surface like Roland Garros with the slow ball, I think in those conditions, it really does look like a level up across the board.

“I mean, there are certain shots and specific things that people can do better or compete with, but I mean I absolutely like my chances more on a grass court than on a slow clay court.”

Sinner triumphed at the Australian Open at the start of the year, defeating Zverev to successfully defend his title.

Then at the French Open, the world number one was beaten in the final by Alcaraz, who also defended his title.

The Spaniard will also enter Wimbledon as a two-time defending champion, while Sinner will look to defend his US Open crown later this year.

It was at Flushing Meadows in 2024 where Fritz enjoyed his best-ever Grand Slam finish, having lost the US Open final to Sinner.

But hard court tennis will be at the very back of his mind right now, with a firm focus on grass needed for the coming weeks.

And it is a surface which Fritz has thrived on throughout his career, having won four of his nine ATP titles on grass.

His other five have arrived on hard courts, with the American set to be glad to see the back of the clay-court season.

But even on one of his stronger surfaces, Fritz is very likely going to need to beat Sinner or Alcaraz – or potentially both – in order to triumph at the likes of Wimbledon.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Competing for the first time since his epic Roland Garros final victory against Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz returned to winning ways Tuesday at the HSBC Championships. In the pristine London setting of The Queen's Club, the Spaniard went through the gears in a 6-4, 7-6(4) victory against Aussie lucky loser Adam Walton.

""I feel great, I feel super happy to be back on grass. It's a special surface, a special place to me,"" said Alcaraz, who was competing on the red clay of Paris nine days ago. ""In these nine days I have done everything: rest up, practising, playing a match again. It has been nine great days and I'm happy to be back here.""

The result extends Alcaraz's winning streak to 14 matches dating back to the start of his Rome title run. Going back to Monte-Carlo, where he also lifted the trophy, Alcaraz has won 23 of his past 24 matches. He leads the ATP Tour in both wins (38) and titles (4) this year.



Adding to the uncertainty in his first grass-court match of the season, Alcaraz faced a late change of opponent when Alejandro Davidovich Fokina withdrew due to illness. As he found his footing on the new surface, Alcaraz enjoyed a comfortable outing until he had to survive a dramatic close to the second set.

The first break points he faced in the match doubled as set points for Walton at 4-5, 15/40, but a big serve out wide and a dangerous return that sailed just long erased the danger. Those were the only break points Alcaraz faced in the one-hour, 42-minute victory, according to Infosys ATP Stats. He also hit 10 aces.
With his drop shot in full flow in the biggest moments, Alcaraz won the only point against serve in the tie-break at 4/4 and ripped a forehand winner on his first match point. The 2023 Queen's Club champion will next face Jaume Munar.
Ben Shelton was unable to follow Alcaraz into the second round. The American suffered a shock first-round defeat to Arthur Rinderknech, who earned a 7-6(5), 7-6(4) victory. Shelton reached the semi-finals in Stuttgart last week and fired 22 aces against Rinderknech, but was unable to conjure up a break point opportunity.
Frenchman Rinderknech will next face Reilly Opelka after the American beat Camilo Ugo Carabelli 7-6(6), 6-4. Brandon Nakashima was also a Day 2 winner in London. The former Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion overcame Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-7(10), 7-6(5), 6-4.

Sabalenka lost to Gauff in three sets at Roland-Garros, with the American coming back from a set down to win her first French Open title.

Speaking with reporters after the loss, the 27-year-old said the match was ""the worst final I've ever played"".

""I don't think she won the match because she played incredibly well, but because I made all those mistakes.""

In an interview with Eurosport broadcast on Tuesday ahead of this week's WTA tournament in Berlin, the Belarusian said the comments were ""simply completely unprofessional of me"".

""I let my emotions guide me. I absolutely regret what I said back then,"" she added.

Aryna Sabalenka has apologised to Coco Gauff for her comments after losing the French Open final to the American. Sabalenka said that she wrote to Gauff, who beat her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 at Roland Garros earlier this month, and expressed her regret for her “unprofessional” comments.

Sabalenka had suggested in her post-match comments that Gauff's victory was more due her own errors than the latter's performance. “That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka said. “I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then. You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward — not immediately, but recently.”

The Belarusian World No.1's comments at the time were rooted in some reality, she hit 37 winners but finished the final with a whopping 70 unforced errors — compared to Gauff's 30, her comments were largely seen as a way of putting down her opponent's achievement. This was 21-year-old Gauff's second Grand Slam win, having earlier beaten Sabalenka in the 2023 US Open final.

Sabalenka said that she told Gauff that it was never intention to “attack her”. The Belarusian said that she wanted to make sure Gauff knew that she “absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her.”

“I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I'm not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realized a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?” Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff in the 2023 U.S. Open final, where she also won the first set.

“I kept getting so emotional,” Sabalenka added. “So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn't be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.”

This was World No.1 Sabalenka's first French Open final and she was gunning for a fourth Grand Slam singles title, having the won successive Australian Open titles in 2023 and 2024 and the 2024 US Open. Additionally, Sabalenka has also won the doubles title at the 2019 Australian Open and 2021 US Open partnering Elise Mertens.","{'href': 'https://indianexpress.com', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Jack Draper ‘ignores the noise' to show why he can star at Wimbledon with impressive Queen's start","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2025/06/17/jack-draper-vs-jenson-brooksby-live-score-latest-queens/","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 16:45:57 GMT","

Jack Draper began his pursuit of grass-court glory with a dominant victory over Jensen Brooksby, claiming 10 of the last 11 games in a performance that had the Queen's faithful gasping at his best shots.

This is Draper's first summer as the undisputed main man of British tennis, following Andy Murray's retirement last year, but he showed little sign of feeling burdened by expectation.

Well, actually, Draper might have been a little tight early on. In the opening game or three, he responded slowly to Brooksby's 110mph first serves – which are milk floats by the super-powered standards of the modern tour – and snatched at forehands too early in rallies.

But as soon as Draper became used to Brooksby's conservative positional tennis, and realised that there were no big surprises here to ambush him, he relaxed and began to show his class. Winner after winner zipped off the baseline and slammed into the backboard as Draper dashed to a 6-3, 6-1 victory in only 77 minutes.

Unleashing off the backhand wing 💥@jackdraper0 #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/wJhsgNVmu8

After the match, Draper was asked about his new role as the British tennis figurehead. “Does it enter my mind that I'm highly ranked and that I am probably in that position? Of course. Like anyone would do, I feel that a little bit. But I also take it in my stride.

“Since I was a young guy, I have always wanted to be at the top of the game, and I knew eventually that [expectation] would come with it. I feel confident, happy. I feel this is exactly where I want to be, regardless of any external noise.” 

If Draper remains a well-kept secret within British sport, despite his recent ascent to the heady heights of No 6 in the world rankings, that is probably because he has never made a deep run at Wimbledon.

Drawn against defending champion Novak Djokovic on his SW19 debut in 2021, Draper lost to Alex de Minaur in the second round a year later, then missed 2023 entirely with a nasty shoulder injury.

He should have done better than another second-round exit last summer, but then came up against a regular practice partner in Cameron Norrie – a fellow British left-hander who knew his game inside out.

Despite this indifferent Wimbledon record of two wins from five outings to date, Draper has improved so much in the past year that the bookies are listing him as fourth favourite to lift this summer's title. Only the new Big Two of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, plus seven-time champion Novak Djokovic, stand ahead of him on the list.

Tuesday delivered the ideal start to Draper's campaign. Beneath a burning sun and a full set of stands, the support may have been warm rather than vociferous. But then Queen's is an old-fashioned venue with a famously polite crowd. The well-heeled denizens of Baron's Court, west London, tend to murmur rather than scream.

Brooksby – a 24-year-old from California – made for an unconventional opponent. His serve is particularly unusual, starting with him holding his racket behind his left shoulder like a bather with an oversized backscratcher.

Off the court, Brooksby has a fascinating story. Diagnosed with severe autism as a small child, he was non-verbal until the age of four. But an intensive programme of therapy helped him develop coping skills, and the woman who oversaw that programme – Michelle Wagner – recently said that he had shifted to the “mild end of the spectrum”, calling this an “unusual and unique outcome”.

Draper will be back on the Andy Murray Arena on Wednesday, facing an opponent who could not be more different to the understated Brooksby. Alexei Popyrin, a rangy and raw-boned Australian, won last year's Canadian Open in Montreal with his dynamic, first-strike game. His serve has been clocked at over 150mph, which puts him in the outside lane of the tennis autobahn.

Here is a high early hurdle for Draper, but he might as well get used to it, because this Queen's field is stacked with quality. He needs to reach at least the semi-finals to give himself a shot at a top-four seeding for Wimbledon, and thus protect himself from a possible quarter-final showdown with one of Alcaraz or Sinner.

Asked whether he had consulted former British flag-bearers such as Murray or Tim Henman, Draper said that – to date – he had not felt the need.

“I know I have got both of their support,” Draper replied. “They've done an incredible job over the years of being the leading British player [but] everyone deals with things a bit differently.

“To play at home, that helps. I remember Andy always saying that it's obviously more pressure, but at the same time you've got the crowd with you, you have your people around. I'm happy to be home. I feel confident. Everything is good and I'm lucky that I've got those guys to lean on if I need it.”

Carlos Alcaraz ensured that, however, he spent the days after his Roland Garros epic against Jannik Sinner, there would be no upset at the start of the grass court season, with a straight sets win over lucky loser Adam Walton.

Having reacted to winning in Paris with an annual tradition excursion to Ibiza, Alcaraz was not faultless against Australian Walton ranked 86th in the world, despite winning 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).

Almost exactly a year ago, Alcaraz arrived at Queen's tired from his break in Ibiza, and his Queen's title defence did not go as planned when he was beaten in under 100 minutes by Jack Draper.

Against Walton, understandably, the tennis was not as smooth as it might have been two weeks ago, and there were a number of baseline exchanges that could have been won earlier.

After four exchanges of serve in the opener, Alcaraz broke. It might have been later than he should have; he had come to the net earlier in the game and missed what could have been a decisive drop shot.

But third time lucky, Alcaraz won the break point, when Walton fired a backhand into the net, with the Spaniard celebrating with a fist pump.

In the second set, Walton's serves might have lacked power but the 110-115mph efforts were well-placed and often wide which left Alcaraz reaching.

At one point trying to race back to get the ball, Alcaraz even tried a ‘tweener' a shot in between the legs to get the ball back over the net, it didn't come off, the shot was too low, but it entertained the mostly full Andy Murray Arena.

This close to one of the Points of the Year 🤏What a point from both players 👏#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/Cxu5TJRagX

Walton had two chances to take the game to a decider, but facing the danger brought out the best of world No. 1 Alcaraz, saving both with an ace and another strong serve.

For Alcaraz, it is very much: first hurdle of the grass court season down, many more to come as he targets a Wimbledon title defence.

... is the winner of Jordan Thompson and Jaume Munar, which is ongoing as we speak. 

I feel at home I feel loved so thank you. First match on grass never easy to get used to the competition, get used to the grass.

He has played a few matches already on grass so I think he's more experienced this year on grass. I'm really happy with the performance today, I feel great, a lot of things to improve and a lot of things to work on to feel more comfortable but in general I'm happy to get through.

Winning is a habit 🙌@carlosalcaraz wins his first match since his epic Roland-Garros final 6-4 7-6 over Walton!#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/md5Jkrm1lz

Walton return long, 4-3. Walton second serve but Alcaraz nets a forehand return, 4-4. Cat and mouse rally, Walton doesn't do enough with his volley and Alcaraz punishes him with a volley down the line, 5-4.

Walton backhand into the net, 6-4. Two match points...

Alcaraz gets Walton on the run, opens up the court and flicks a forehand winner into the space, 7-4.

GAME SET MATCH ALCARAZ!!!!

Alcaraz backhand into the net, 0-1. Alcaraz drop shot winner, 1-1. First serve into the body unreturned by Walton, 2-1. Wild forehand long by Alcaraz, 2-2. Alcaraz return into the net, 2-3. Walton return flies long, 3-3.

Facing those two set points seems to have sparked Alcaraz into life. 

On his next service game, he plays two exquisite drop shots including a feint, that Walton can only watch.

Into a tie-break we go as Alcaraz holds with an exquisite half volley winner. Shades of Roger Federer with that touch.

Courtside with Carlitos 🤩@QueensTennis | #HSBCChampionships | @carlosalcaraz pic.twitter.com/FYnOayOS2N

Problems for Walton after his backhand sits up nicely for Alcaraz to drill a backhand winner down the line, 15-30. Much needed first serve for Walton is unreturned, 30-30. 

Frustration for Alcaraz as he makes a surprising error on his backhand, pushing the ball long, 40-30. Walton books himself a tie-break when Alcaraz slices a defensive forehand into the net.

Loss of focus from Alcaraz as a third double fault of the match makes it 15-30. Deep return by Walton and Alcaraz nets, two set points for Walton. 

Alcaraz goes to his tried and trusty wide first serve, which is unreturned. Second break point... First serve in from Alcaraz and Walton's return is long. To deuce.

Two more first serves, two more unreturned balls and Alcaraz sees out the danger. Almost felt like Alcaraz wanted to feel a little danger.

You would expect the pressure to hit Walton but not yet. He holds with a blistering forehand winner down the line that catches the outside of the sideline.

Alcaraz will serve to stay in the set next.

WALT a hit 🚀@AdamWalton99 #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/mQXrJRB3yO

So reminiscent of Rafael Nadal when Alcaraz skips to his left to run around his backhand and whip a forehand down the line. It's a beautiful shot to see. 

And he finishes the love game with a deft drop volley winner. He's having fun out there in the sun.

High volley winner by Alcaraz makes it 30-30. Big point coming up. Walton finds his first serve and Alcaraz nets his return. Another backhand into the net by Alcaraz and Walton holds. 

On we go!

When Alcaraz injects more pace to his shots, he continues to earn cheap errors from Walton. Alcaraz holds again as we enter the business end of the set and you can be sure he will want to get a break soon.

Walton is clearly favouring his forehand side, which in turn is leaving him exposed by just how far he has run around the ball to take it on the forehand.

That being said, his serve might lack power by the standards of the majority of those in the top 30 on the tour, but his 110-115mph efforts are well-placed and difficult to return.

Lovely hands by Walton in the forecourt to react to Alcaraz's backhand down the line with an angled half volley winner. Not an easy finish, but he finished that like prime Pat Cash.

Serve continues to be king in this set as Alcaraz holds to love with a trademark forehand winner down the line. The best forehand in men's tennis?

Both players using the serve out wide very effectively to earn cheap points. Another strong hold by Walton to stay in the lead in this set. Can he make any inroads on Alcaraz's serve in this match?

Feels as though Alcaraz is using this as practice. Taking risks on serve, working on his slice and striking the ball early. He completes another service hold routinely.

Good response by Walton to losing the first set by holding here. Very unlikely he will win this match but the level he is showing is far above his current ranking and his game looks well suited to grass.

Alcaraz shakes off the rustiness to bring up two set points at 40-15. And he sees out the set with a second serve ace.

A very controlled and clinical display.

In typical British fashion, there is a strong contingent of support for Walton, the Australian underdog in his first-ever match against Alcaraz.

Alcaraz, on the other han,d has allowed him back into games that he should have wrapped up two or three points earlier. Maybe we are seeing a bit of rustiness in his first match on grass of the season.

Double fault by Walton makes it 0-30. Three first serves in a row rescue the Australian and move him to 40-30. Gorgeous footwork by Alcaraz to run around a Walton slice and blast a forehand winner down the line, deuce. Gasps from the crowd as he hit that.

Deep Alcaraz return and Walton's reply is into the net, set point. Wild forehand by Alcaraz after an extended rally, back to deuce. Blocked return down the line and into the net for a volley winner by Alcaraz, second set point. Walton survives again after Alcaraz nets.

Warm applause for Walton as he holds and asks Alcaraz to serve for the set.

Ferocious Forehand 🔥@carlosalcaraz #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/Pe38dlsnLH

Alcaraz's class is beginning to tell but Walton shows him that he's not going away with a forehand return winner, 30-15. Efficient service hold for Alcaraz completed when a swinging first serve is unreturned.

Refreshment break between the matches is well and truly over and the stands of the Andy Murray Arena are almost as full as they were for home favourite Jack Draper around 40 minutes previously.

Alcaraz has been in decent touch so far in these almost Spanish-like conditions that earlier caused one spectator to faint, leading to a brief pause in Draper's match.

Nice play by Walton to send Alcaraz the wrong way with a cross court flick, 30-15. He then whips a forehand into the corner that Alcaraz gives up running for, 40-15. The Aussie is playing some inspired stuff.

But a couple of errors keep Alcaraz in the game, and then a double fault coughs up a break point for the Spaniard. Relief for Walton as Alcaraz's return drifts long. 

Routine forehand into the net by Walton as Alcaraz ramps up the pressure. Break point. Alcaraz on the attack, Walton scrambles to stay in the point, Alcaraz comes into the net but pushes his volley long. Another chance for Alcaraz to break comes after his forehand return is too good for Walton.

Not enough first serves for Walton to give him cheap points and the pressure finally tells when he nets a backhand. Alcaraz breaks.

Alcaraz is looking equally comfortable on serve so far amd he holds to love with a vintage forehand winner down the line.

Emma Raducanu will team up with French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz in the mixed-doubles at the US Open, with a prize of $1 million for the winners.

The new doubles team – which can expect to be given a portmanteau nickname of either “Alcaranu” or “Raducaraz” – is one of several eye-catching partnerships that will make their debut in New York in August.

Read more here.

Walton is doing everything right at the moment. He is keeping Alcaraz on the move, pushing him left and right and making enough first serves to avoid pressure. A very shapr start for the Australian, who got a late call to play as a lucky loser.

This is the first meeting between the two players. Walton won't have faced a player of his calibre before but she's standing his ground so far and making things awkward for Alcaraz. 

Impressive athleticism by Alcaraz to stretch and hit a backhand overhead smash. Walton gets to the ball and his flick into play drifts wide.

So we join this match at 1-1 after both players held serve to start the match. It will be interesting to see how Alcaraz adapts, in what is his first match since that epic victory at the French Open, earlier this month.

The Spaniard partied in Ibiza last week so hopefully he's recovered and can put on a show. Walton holds here to maintain his lead.

... is top seed and world No 2 Carlos Alcaraz where he meet Australia's Adam Walton.

Feels amazing, no place I'd rather be. We travel the world playing tennis, never get to come home or spend much time with my family but to be on this court in front of you guys, my people, my family, thank you.

It's tricky coming onto the grass after clay, to adapt, I'm hitting the ball a bit late not on time. The more matches and time I have on practice courts I'll get better and better and it's definitely a surface I really enjoy playing on and obviously a win helped as well.

So proud, obviously coming back here a year later is a testament to the hard work from me and my team and all the people who have supported me to be a better player and person. I'm excited to see how I can get on this week I feel excited I feel ready and I want to do my best.

Sealed with an ACE ☄️@jackdraper0 storms through at the #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/AQF6LZhRrk

Draper can just explode on his shots when Brooksby pushes him out wide as he does when he moves out to his forehand and powers a forehand cross court that is too hot for his opponent, 30-15.

Rare serve and volley from Draper but he nets the volley on the stretch, 30-30. First serve unreturned brings up a match point. Boom! Ace down the T and it's GAME SET MATCH DRAPER!!!

Brooksby is caught out by a deep Draper return and flicks his backhand wide to give the Briton a break point. Draper's weight of shot proves too much for Brooksby again, who nets a forehand.

Draper breaks and will serve for the match.

Ever since Draper's opening service games, Brooksby has had little joy and his screams out in anger after another first serve from the Briton is too much for him.

After an eight minute stoppage, play resumes with Brooksby leading 30-0 but Draper gets on the board with a crushing backhand winner down the line. 

Draper continues to be all over the Brooksby second serve and he fires a forehand return winner down the line. Brooksby saves a break point with a much needed first serve. 

Draper finds the line with a dipping top spin forehand down the line. Gutsy play by Brooksby as he sneaks into the net and hits a cute a volley that Draper reaches but can't get over the net.

Big first serve by Brooksby and Draper's return drifts wide, allowing him to hold.

Delay in play due to an incident in the crowd. It's a warm day in west Kensington. The players are advised to take a seat which they do while treatment is administered. 

Sloppy start by Draper as he slips to 0-30 He responds with a perfect swinging ace. Ideal placement from him. Brooksby then lets him off the hook with a backhand into the tramlines.

Wide ace from Draper and he holds again.

Brooksby sees his forehand clip the net cord and fly wide and that gives Draper a break point. Draper gets a look at a second serve and his return is deep and puts Brooksby in trouble. The American gets the ball back in play but Draper steps in and whips a forehand into the corner to break.

Six games in a row for Draper.

Draper's maintain his momentum with another routine hold. With his serve clicking the way it is, Brooksby's hopes today look very slim.

Brooksby is an awkward customer and Draper looked anxious and short of feel in the early stages. Fortunately, he was able to fall back on his lethal leftie serve. During that set, he won 14 out of 15 points behind his first delivery.

Once Draper began to settle in, he reeled off the last four games in assured style. You could tell he was feeling comfortable when he went for a 100mph return winner down the line. He missed – but the very fact that he had the confidence to try it suggested a positive mental state.

As far as opening points go...@jackdraper0 starting as he means to go on 🚀#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/4S3YEoSCjo

Draper is taking the ball early and putting pressure on Brooksby's serve which has gone AWOL. Brooksby forehand long and Draper earns his first set point. 

Brooksby serve and volleys, then hits an overhead which Draper chases out to reach but can't get the ball into play, deuce. Another chance for Draper to close out the set when Brooksby nets a forehand. Too good from Draper. The depth on his shots means Brooksby is forced to hit half volleys on the baseline. After a series of big hits, Draper breaks through with a vicious forehand winner down the line.

Draper's first serve followed by his forehand is an unstoppable combo. Nothing Brooksby can do about in this game and Draper holds to love to consolidate the break. Draper is all business so far. There's an aura about him out on the court.

Brooksby handles what looked like an awkward volley very well and the ball spins away from Draper's reach. 30-15. Brooksby has missed three first serves in a row but Draper isn't doing enough to apply pressure on the second, the slowest being 69mph.

Good defence by Draper to retrieve a Brooksby overhead and the American nets a forehand, break point. Brooksby sees off the danger with a wide ace. Another chance to break comes Draper's way and this time he gets it when Brooksby dumps a backhand into the net.

Draper's serve is starting to fire up and Brooksby's frustration builds after a couple of missed returns. A fifth ace of the match for Draper and he holds again.

A few too many errors from Draper. He's just pushing it at the moment when a little more patience is required. Brooksby comes through another service game untroubled.

After two months grinding on the clay and needing to hit extra balls to finish points, Draper will be pleased to be on the grass again and see his shots fly away from opponents. His power is one of the big reasons why he is a major contender for Wimbledon and he holds here to 15 comfortably.

The reason for Brooksby's strange looking serve is the multitude of injuries he has had on his wrist and shoulder over the years. So fair play for finding something that works for him. Draper is yet to get to grips with it and Brooksby holds to love to take the lead.

Draper's forehand is fine fettle so far. He drills a forehand down the line that's too hot for the advancing Brooksby, 15-15. Andy Murray Arena is not completely full. Plenty of empty seats at this stage of the match. 

First double fault for Draper takes the game to deuce. But he holds with another powerful forehand down the line.

The American has the honour of serving first and we get a glimpse of his very unique service motion. He starts with the racket resting on the back of his neck and releases once the ball is tossed into the air. 

It is the type of service action that you'd see at the park or local club. But it is clearly working for him as he holds to 15.

It's not Wimbledon so players can play in whatever colour they want and Draper comes out in a red and burgundy number. 

The warm up has started and play should start very soon.

Daily sport newsletter

Hello and welcome to coverage from Queen's Club as Jack Draper gets his campaign under way.

The Briton arrives at Queen's as the second seed at an ATP 500 tournament for the first time and will undoubtedly be a leading contender to challenge for the title.

“I look back on my clay court season as a whole and as someone who hasn't done that well on the clay I thought I embraced the surface very well and I improved a lot on it,” Draper reflected in his press conference ahead of the HSBC Championships.

“I got home, had a couple of days off then got on the grass. I was happy to get on a faster surface to be honest. In tennis you have to have a short term memory, you have to understand why you lost certain matches.  

“I take it in my stride and obviously feel good coming into these next few tournaments.”

With Wimbledon less than two weeks away, Draper will want to have a strong week in west Kensington to boost his preparation.

“I think there's no secret I'd love to do amazingly well this week but Wimbledon would be a priority for me. I think it's always an interesting one, that first match or tournament on the grass, there's a lot of players who maybe aren't amazingly prepared.

“We've just come from a surface where we're grinding out points, having to win the point seven times on the trot to get one point. So, coming onto a fast surface, the margins are small but I'm feeling good and I'm ready to compete as hard as possible.

“It's a home tournament for me as well, so that's an added motivation for me to do well here as well.”

The All England Club's security system highlighted the man's name as red-flagged and blocked his attempt to enter the public ballot; follow scores and reports and watch action from the ATP and WTA on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Tuesday 17 June 2025 19:29, UK

A man who was given a restraining order for stalking Emma Raducanu has been caught trying to apply for Wimbledon tickets.

The All England Club's security system highlighted the man's name as one that had been red-flagged after an incident in Dubai in February that left the British tennis star in tears.

His attempt to enter the public ballot was blocked.

Raducanu revealed she ""couldn't see the ball through tears"" and could ""barely breathe"" during the stalking ordeal that took place at the Dubai Open.

The 22-year-old approached the umpire's chair in tears just two games into her defeat to Karolina Muchova after receiving repeated unwanted attention from a ""fixated"" man before and during the second-round match.

Raducanu disclosed she had previously been approached twice by the man off-court.

The man, who was removed from the stands, was subsequently given a restraining order by Dubai police and his name was circulated around tennis authorities.

Raducanu opted not to press charges but the individual has been banned from future tournaments.

""I was obviously very distraught,"" Raducanu said at the time. ""I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to finish. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe.

""I was like, I need to just take a breather here.""

Speaking to BBC Sport a month on from the incident in Dubai, Raducanu said that she is happy with the level of protection she is now receiving, saying: ""[It] could have been dealt with better. Since that incident I have definitely got increased attention and greater security.

""All we can do is look at what happened and react to it in a better way, in a more positive way, rather than looking back and blaming the situation. Now it is being dealt with better, so for me that's important.

""I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I'm always with someone and always being watched.""

Emma Raducanu's stalker has been blocked in an attempt to buy Wimbledon tickets this summer after tournament officials spotted his name on the list of applicants.

The man – who is understood to be from South America – had applied last year as part of the public ballot, which closed in mid-September. Although initially unsuccessful, he could potentially have been offered tickets in a later wave of distribution.

This possibility was kyboshed by All England Club (AELTC) officials, who spotted his name on the list after it was circulated to tournaments by the WTA Tour.

The AELTC removed him from the ballot list shortly after the incident in February when he was identified in the stands of the WTA tournament in Dubai and taken away by police. Although he was not charged with any criminal offence, he signed a document saying that he would not attempt to approach Raducanu again.

The presence of a stalker in the Dubai stands came to light after Raducanu broke down in tears early during her match against Karolina Muchova.

It later emerged that the man had followed Raducanu through the four WTA events that run back-to-back from Singapore to Abu Dhabi to Doha to Dubai. On the final stop in that sequence, he approached her in a cafe at the precise moment when she was unaccompanied by any of her support team.

Speaking about the Muchova match in Indian Wells, a fortnight later, Raducanu told reporters “I was obviously very distraught. I saw him first game of the match, and I was like, ‘I don't know how I'm gonna finish'.”

She was awarded extra security by the Indian Wells organisers, with at least two burly men in uniforms following her everywhere she went on the tournament site.

During a pre-tournament press conference, officials from the AELTC were asked last week about their plans to protect players during this year's Wimbledon.

“The safety and well-being of all of the players is our absolute top priority,” said AELTC chief executive Sally Bolton. “I think the recent incidents coming to light certainly recognise the concern generated by that. But we have in place – and have had for many years – processes for ensuring the safety of our players. And that is in liaison with law enforcement agencies, specialist security teams and we liaise with both tours.

“We are putting in place measures that are reflective of the threat and risk profile at the time. We probably wouldn't at this point comment on any details in respect of any individual athlete but that intelligence is being gathered working with those other parties throughout the year to make sure we have got the right measures in place come the Championships.”

Emma Raducanu will team up with French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz in the mixed doubles at the US Open, with a prize of $1 million (£741,000) on offer for the winners.The new doubles team – who can expect to be given a portmanteau nickname of either “Alcaranu” or “Raducaraz” – are one of several eye-catching partnerships set to make their debuts in New York in August.It will be Raducanu's first outing in the mixed doubles after she denied Sir Andy Murray a final appearance at Wimbledon by pulling out of their opening match in 2024 over concerns with her wrist. Raducanu received heavy criticism for the decision, which she later apologised for.

Alcaraz, who won one of the great tennis finals in Paris 10 days ago against Jannik Sinner, has long been noted for “liking” Raducanu's social-media posts on a regular basis.

Alcaraz revealed, following his first-round win at Queen's, how the partnership came about: “I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma. 

“I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. I made that special request,” he said with a smile before explaining the British No 1 kept him waiting for a reply.

“[The] US Open came to us and give us opportunities to play mixed doubles. I'm super excited about it. I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament,” he added.

“I have known Emma since a really long time ago, so we know each other. I have a really good relationship with her. So it's just going to be interesting. You know, obviously we are gonna enjoy [it], for sure. 

“I will try to put my doubles skill on it. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun.”

The other headline-grabber is Naomi Osaka's proposed collaboration with Nick Kyrgios, which is probably based on the fact that they share an agent. It should be said, however, that Kyrgios has found it difficult to achieve match fitness of late.This is an innovative move from the United States Tennis Association, which has moved the mixed doubles event away from the main US Open fortnight and thus made it much more appealing to the bigger names.The tournament will be played on August 19-20, the Tuesday and Wednesday before the singles matches begin. It has attracted almost all the top-10 players on both tours, with British No 1 Jack Draper teaming up with last year's Olympic champion Qinwen Zheng and Novak Djokovic playing alongside Serbian compatriot Olga Danilovic.

Draper spoke about Raducanu teaming up with Alcaraz after his win at Queen's on Tuesday, saying: “A wise person once told me you should find the best partner, and that's what she did in Alcaraz. I don't blame her at all for that [smiling].

“Yeah, I think she will have a lot of fun playing with Carlos. He's obviously the best player in the world probably right now, along with Sinner. Great at doubles, as well. Saw that with Rafa [Nadal] at the Olympics. She's gone about and chose the best partner, for sure. Hopefully they do well.”The format has been abbreviated to make it less demanding on the players' bodies. Until they are knocked out, teams will play two matches a day. But until the final they will use the “fast-four” format: two sets of four games apiece, with a tie-break at 3-3, and no deuces.Not all the pairs announced on Tuesday are guaranteed to make the cut. But the fact that the USTA has eight wild-card invitations to hand out, for what is a 16-team event, makes it unthinkable that they would refuse Alcaraz and Raducanu the opportunity to play together.

The Americans have come up with an innovative idea here, which will boost the visibility of their qualifying week enormously.

I wrote in January about how Wimbledon – which has no capacity to run on-site qualifying – is increasingly being left behind by the new three-week model employed by the other majors: one week of intense competition for Challenger-level players, who are ranked between 110 and 240 or so, followed by a blue-riband fortnight featuring the biggest names.

Now the USTA has invited these stars to the party much earlier than had previously been the case, by moving the mixed doubles forward to the Tuesday and Wednesday of qualifying week and offering a juicy prize-money fund.

Last year, the USTA reported that 219,000 spectators had availed themselves of free entry during US Open preliminary week. We can expect that figure to grow dramatically next time around.

For purposes of comparison, the Australian Open and French Open both welcomed a little over 100,000 during qualifying week at their most recent stagings. Wimbledon lags far behind, however. The Roehampton facility used by the All England Club is limited to just 5,000 spectators per day, or 20,000 in all.

There are other losers here, apart from Wimbledon. What of the regular tournaments (Winston-Salem for ATP players, Monterrey and Cleveland on the WTA) which occupy that same space in the calendar? They were understandably less than delighted by the US Open's unilateral move.

Realistically, though, the top players hardly ever play regular tournaments in the week before a major in any case. A short, sharp exhibition – which is what this effectively is – tends to suit them much better.

Finally, spare a thought for Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani: last year's US Open mixed doubles champions, who were not on the list released on Tuesday. They may still get their chance, as the field has yet to be set in stone.

But while traditionalists might quibble, the USTA's move makes irresistible commercial sense. The profile gap between Vavassori/Errani and the likes of “Alcaranu” is akin to that between Accrington Stanley and Manchester United.

Spaniard asks British No 1 to be mixed doubles partner

Draper says he ‘doesn't blame' Raducanu for her choice

Carlos Alcaraz has revealed that he made a special request to Emma Raducanu to be his partner at this year's US Open mixed doubles – and the British No 1 will be the boss when they play together in New York.

“I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma,” the Spaniard said after defeating the Australian Adam Walton 6-4, 7-6 in the first round at Queen's Club. “I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me – I made that special request.”

However, Raducanu did not give an immediate yes to the partnership, which is already being named “Alcaranu” by enthusiastic fans. “She took a while,” he said, laughing. “Not much, but she had to think a bit. But it wasn't in a minute.”

Organisers have gone out of their way to ensure there will be a heavy sprinkling of stardust in the mixed doubles by moving the event to qualifying week, and have been rewarded with the world No 1s, Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, as well as grand slam winners such as Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek, opting to play.

Alcaraz, who has already won five grand slam singles titles, could have had his pick of partners, but said he wanted to play with Raducanu, who won the US Open women's singles as an 18-year-old qualifier in 2021.

“She's going to be the boss,” he said. “I've known Emma for a really long time and I have a really good relationship with her. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun.”

This is the most star-studded mixed doubles grand slam event for decades, with the US Open staging the matches on Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong courts on 19 and 20 August, before even the qualifying draw for the singles takes place.

The scoring system has also been changed, with sets being played to four games. There will be a sudden-death deuce and a tie-break at 4-4, with a 10-point tie-break instead of the third set.

The final will be the same, but with six-game sets, and the winners will walk away with $1m (£740,000) – an increase of $800,000 from 2024.

Sinner will play with the world No 9, Emma Navarro, while the British men's No 1, Jack Draper, will partner the Olympic women's singles champion, Zheng Qinwen. Djokovic has agreed to play with his Serbian compatriot Olga Danilovic.

Speaking after his 6-3, 6-1 victory over Jenson Brooksby, Draper hinted that playing with Raducanu was never an option – because she had wanted to play with the Spaniard all along.

“A wise person once told me you should find the best partner, and that's what she did in Alcaraz,” Draper said. “I don't blame her at all for that. I think she will have a lot of fun playing with Carlos.

“He's obviously the best player in the world probably right now, along with Sinner. Great at doubles, as well. Saw that with Rafa [Nadal] at the Olympics. She's gone about and chose the best partner, for sure. Hopefully they do well.”

Draper said that the players backed the US Open's decision to revamp the mixed doubles event. “I think it's a good format for the players to get prepared for the US Open, having a shot at playing with another top player. Qinwen I know from the tour. I have seen her around. Obviously a great player herself and has a really good game,” he said.

Eight pairs have earned entry based on their combined singles ranking, with the other eight pairs decided by the US Open's wildcard committee. That has caused controversy among some doubles specialists, but Lew Sherr, the US Tennis Association's chief executive, said the new format allowed the world's best men and women to compete with and against one another.

“Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited,” he said. “It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do and we know that the fans will love it.”

The tennis power couple Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa will also compete together, but the Australia No 1, Alex de Minaur, said he and his British fiancee, Katie Boulter, had not been invited.

“We are definitely keen to play if they allow us to do so,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning champion at Roland Garros, is gearing up for his next challenge on the ATP circuit: Wimbledon. Alcaraz aims to defend his title in the UK and is determined to succeed in this prestigious tournament. He seeks to join the elite group of players who have captured two or more Grand Slam titles in the same calendar year. Additionally, he has his sights set on the US Open, marking the season's final Grand Slam event.

After securing his first victory at the Queen's Club Championships on Tuesday, Alcaraz reflected on the recent announcement from the US Open organizers. The organization revealed on social media that they would feature mixed doubles teams comprising top-ranked male and female players.

In preparation for August's main event, the US Open has paired one man and one woman per team, promising thrilling mixed doubles action with a grand prize of $1 million for the victors. Alcaraz expressed his excitement over the announcement and shared his thoughts on his partner for this special event.

Alcaraz is set to partner with Emma Raducanu, a player eager to make a strong comeback in the upcoming tournaments. “She's going to be the boss,” Alcaraz said with a smile. “The US Open approached us with the opportunity to play mixed doubles, and I'm super excited about it. I think it's going to be a fantastic addition to the tournament.“ Alcaraz shared. 

Alcaraz expressed his excitement about competing in the tournament alongside Raducanu, even making a surprising request to the US Open organizers. During his discussion, he highlighted Raducanu's impressive form on the WTA circuit.

“I've known Emma for a long time; we have a really good relationship,” Alcaraz remarked after his first victory at the Queen's tournament. “It's just going to be interesting.”

Alcaraz continued, “The organizers mentioned the mixed doubles, and I thought I couldn't have a better partner than Emma. So, I asked her if she wanted to play doubles with me. Yes, that was my special request.“

Alcaraz also shared Raducanu's reaction to his unexpected invitation, showcasing the strong friendship they maintain off the court. “She took a little while,” Alcaraz said with a chuckle. “Well, not too long. Of course, she had to think and ask around a bit, but it didn't take a minute,” he explained about Raducanu's response to his offer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Sinner returns to grass with rock-solid win in Halle","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-hanfmann-halle-2025-tuesday","Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:01:18 GMT","

 Jannik Sinner is back to business on grass at the Terra Wortmann Open. 

 In his first match since his heartbreaking defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the Roland Garros final, the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings returned to winning ways with a 7-5, 6-3 triumph against home favourite Yannick Hanfmann in Halle. Sinner, who is defending champion at the grass ATP 500, saved both break points he faced en route to a 92-minute victory inside OWL Arena. 

 “I'm very happy,” said Sinner after his win. “He is a great server and a great baseliner, so breaking him is very difficult on this surface. I'm very happy how I handled the tough situations mentally. The first set could have gone into a tie-break and then anything can happen. 

 “I'm very happy about my performance. First matches are never easy on grass, and also second and third matches, so let's see what's coming in the next round. I think tomorrow I have the day off, which is good, because the body feels different on this surface. Let's see how I'm going to react.”

 As it so often is, Sinner's serve was the foundation for his win against qualifier Hanfmann. The 23-year-old won 84 per cent (37/44) of points behind his first delivery to improve to 19-2 for 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. With his win against the World No. 138, Sinner increased his winning streak against opponents outside the Top 20 to 66 matches. 

 The top seed faces a tough test in the second round, where he faces 2023 champion Alexander Bublik. He leads Bublik 4-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, with the Kazakhstani's only victory coming via retirement during his Halle title run two years ago. 

 “The unexpected,” said Sinner, when asked he expected from his clash with Bublik. ”He's a great player. A great talent. A huge talent, actually, and grass is his favourite surface. He beat me here in Halle, he won [the trophy] here in Halle, so it's for sure a place he loves to play. I'm trying to stay calm mentally and trying to see what I can reach. He's a great talent, a great server and he can do whatever he wants. It's hopefully going to be a good match.”

Lando Norris has mentioned how this year's McLaren does not give him the same level of confidence as last year's, and a key design feature could be the reason.

At a few of the hotter races so far this year McLaren has used a unique cockpit pre-cooling device.

It works when the chemical ingredients of dry ice are mixed in a container, placed in the car's nose, and the resultant emissions of the cooling vapour are pumped through the car for several minutes as it sits on the grid. The container is then removed before the nose is re-assembled ready for the race.

Furthermore, the underside of the McLaren seat and the floor beneath are coated in heat-deflecting gold foil.

Good Deed has acquired the family drama movie in which the father-son duo star alongside Walker Scobell and David Morse.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Michael Douglas and real-life son Cameron Douglas are set to reunite on the big screen.


	Good Deed Entertainment has acquired domestic rights to Looking Through Water — a family drama feature starring Michael Douglas — and is planning a late summer theatrical release, The Hollywood Reporter has learned exclusively. Roberto Sneider helmed the film that co-stars Cameron Douglas alongside Walker Scobell, David Morse, Michael Stahl-David, Ximena Romo and Tamara Tunie.




Looking Through Water centers on a father who attempts to bond with his estranged son by teaming up with him for a father-son fishing competition.

	Sneider (Tear This Heart Out) directed the movie from a script by Rowdy Herrington (director of the original Road House) and Zach Dean (Fast X). Hailing from Aeth Entertainment, the project is based on the novels Catching Big Fish and Looking Through Water from author Bob Rich, who executive produces.


	Producers include Robert Mitas, Stan Spry, Carla Woods and Eric Woods. Storyboard Media's Elisabeth Costa de Beauregard Segel executive produces and handles worldwide sales. Costa de Beauregard Segel and Carla Woods negotiated for the film that was previously known as Blood Knot.


	“With Good Deed and Storyboard Media on board, we're excited to bring Looking Through Water to audiences — it's a story of healing, forgiveness and second chances, while the American pastime of fishing connects generations through water,” says Aeth Entertainment CEO Eric Woods.

	











	“We are honored to be teaming up with Aeth Entertainment and Storyboard Media to bring Looking Through Water to audiences in the U.S. later this summer,” adds GDE head of acquisitions and distribution Erik Donley. 


	Michael and Cameron Douglas previously starred together in the 2003 feature It Runs in the Family, alongside Michael's late real-life parents Kirk Douglas and Diana Douglas. Michael was last seen on the big screen in 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. 


	Cameron Douglas' recent credits include the 2022 Bruce Willis-led action film Wire Room and the Apple TV+ series The Crowded Room. His book Long Way Home was published in 2019 and details his journey following his conviction on drug charges.

The superstar famously doesn't celebrate birthdays, only anniversaries.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Some people might be obsessed with time, but Mariah Carey thinks the concept is nothing more than a thing of fantasy.


	In a recent interview with Capital FM posted Monday (June 16), the superstar once again stated how she refuses to acknowledge the passage of time. Carey has long said she doesn't subscribe to the construct of days, weeks and years, and has also asserted that she doesn't have birthdays — only anniversaries. 


	“Is it true you don't acknowledge the passing of time?” one interviewer asked, to which Carey confirmed, “That is true.”


	“I just don't believe in it,” she continued. “No, no, just time. Let it go. I don't have a birthday, no. Anniversaries, yes.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Carey's belief system also means that coordinating a so-called “time” to meet up with someone is not a viable option for her.  “Yeah, I would have somebody call you and figure it out,” she calmly replied when asked how she goes about making appointments.


	Mimi's commitment to being free from the constraints of time dates back years. In an old interview reshared by the singer in 2023, a younger Carey explains, “I don't have birthdays … I decided to do that. And I've noticed that people who decide not to have birthdays, they just don't have them.”

	











	That said, the “anniversary” of Carey's ethereal existence is on March 27 each year. This year, she marked the occasion by sharing a photo of herself on a jet ski and writing on Instagram, “Thank you lambily for the anniversary wishes and for always making me so happy!!!”


	Carey's interview comes on the heels of her new single, “Type Dangerous,” which marks her first proper release since 2018. The track just debuted at No. 95 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated June 21, 2025 — not that she would recognize such a time stamp — becoming her 50th career entry on the chart.


	Watch Carey discuss her thoughts on time below.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Netflix is looking to remake another classic TV series. The streamer has closed a deal with Legendary Television for Land of the Lost, a reboot of Sid and Marty Krofft's 1974 sci-fi adventure show, Deadline has learned.


	Sid and Marty Krofft as well as Marty's daughter Deanna Krofft Pope, who is VP Development and Production at their company, will produce the project, which is in very early stages, sources said. Search is underway for a writer. Reps for Netflix and Legendary TV declined comment. 


Land of the Lost centers on a father, Rick, and his two children who accidentally go through a portal and find themselves trapped in a world inhabited by dinosaurs, including a Tyrannosaurus rex they nickname Grumpy; primate-like people named Pakuni, one of whom, Cha-Ka, they befriend; and reptilian humanoids called Sleestak.

	











Land of the Lost originated as a children's series which aired on NBC Saturday mornings for three seasons from 1974 to 1976, with CBS giving it a summer run in 1985 and 1987. In it, Rick was played by Spencer Milligan, with Wesley Eure and Kathy Coleman as his kids, Will and Holly, respectively. Stop-motion animation was used for some of the creatures.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	Despite its relatively short run, Land of the Lost achieved cult status, keeping the title relevant. That led to a 1991 series remake, which aired for two seasons on ABC, and a 2009 feature film starring Will Ferrell. Sid and Marty Krofft produced both. 


	While it does not have the extensive library traditional TV studios do, Netflix has taken on a few classic series titles. The streamer is currently filming a new Little House On the Prairie and previously rebooted Lost In Space and One Day At a Time. 


	Legendary Television's current slate includes Dune: Prophecy at HBO, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters at Apple TV+ and the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft at Netflix as well as Tomb Raider and Pacific Rim live-action series and an adaptation of Girls and Their Horses with Nicole Kidman — all in development at Amazon.

					By Patrick Hipes 

Executive Managing Editor


	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Tuesday that Tom Cruise, Debbie Allen and longtime Spike Lee collaborator and production designer Wynn Thomas will receive honorary Oscars at the 2025 Governors Awards. In addition, Dolly Parton will receive the Academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.


	The Oscar statuettes will be presented in a ceremony for the 16th annual Governors Awards on November 16 at the Ray Dolby Ballroom at Ovation Hollywood.


	“This year's Governors Awards will celebrate four legendary individuals whose extraordinary careers and commitment to our filmmaking community continue to leave a lasting impact,” Academy president Janet Yang said in a release announcing the news. “The Academy's Board of Governors is honored to recognize these brilliant artists. Debbie Allen is a trailblazing choreographer and actor, whose work has captivated generations and crossed genres. Tom Cruise's incredible commitment to our filmmaking community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community has inspired us all. Beloved performer Dolly Parton exemplifies the spirit of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award through her unwavering dedication to charitable efforts. And production designer Wynn Thomas has brought some of the most enduring films to life through a visionary eye and mastery of his craft.”

	











	Cruise, who has been nominated for three acting Oscars — leading for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire and supporting for Magnolia — received his fourth nomination for producing 2023 Best Picture candidate Top Gun: Maverick. His credits in a long career also include Risky Business, A Few Good Men, Interview with the Vampire, Eyes Wide Shut, Vanilla Sky and the Mission: Impossible film series that is wrapping with this summer's The Final Reckoning.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Allen's work over almost five decades as a choreographer, actor and producer includes choreographing the Academy Awards seven times. The Fame and Jo Jo Dancer actress' producing credits include Amistad and A Star for Rose.


	Thomas' credits with Lee spans from 1986's She's Gotta Have It to Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X and 2020's Da 5 Bloods with many in between. He was also production designer on Oscar Best Picture A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man with Ron Howard, and on Hidden Figures among others.


	The Honorary Oscar is a statuette given “to honor extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement, exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences in any discipline, or for outstanding service to the Academy,” according to the Academy.


	Parton, the Steel Magnolias and Nine to Five star who has sold 100 million records, has two Oscar Original Song nominations (for “Nine to Five” and “Travelin' Thru”), is being recognized for her humanitarian work with the Hersholt honor. She has founded charitable and philanthropic organizations including the Dollywood Foundation and within that the literacy program Dolly Parton's Imagination Library.


	The Hersholt award, also an Oscar statuette, is given “to an individual in the motion picture arts and sciences whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry by promoting human welfare and contributing to rectifying inequities,” the Academy says.


	Last year, Governors Awards honors went to Quincy Jones and casting director Juliet Taylor, with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award given to British writer-director Richard Curtis and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to James Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. It marked only the second time in the history of the awards that no actor was chosen for the annual honors, a must-stop on the movie-awards circuit.


	The Hersholt and Thalberg awards are not always given out, and are dependent on the vote of AMPAS' Board of Governors.


	The Governors Awards are not televised, but winners are traditionally recognized during the Oscars ceremony. That would happen for this group at the 98th Oscars, set for March 16, 2026 at the Dolby Theater to be hosted again by Conan O'Brien.

Film Editor, Awards


	The latest animation from Pixar has been in the pipe for quite some time, and while that's not so strange for such a labor-intensive production, it's telling that the finished version bears little resemblance, story-wise, to the film promised by the trailer released in 2023. But even without that knowledge, there's definitely something off here; despite a cast-iron central premise — a desperately lonely young boy seeks a close encounter of the third kind — Elio never quite figures out what to do with it. It's pretty obvious that the original intention was to celebrate the outsider and make a point about finding one's tribe, but somewhere along the line that all got lost, and we're left with spectacular film about the vastness of infinity that ends up an Earthbound parable about family ties.

	











	When we first meet him, 11-year-old Elio Solis (Yonas Kibreab) is recently orphaned and living with his Aunt Olga (Zoe Saldaña). Olga is a major with the Army, working as an “orbital analyst,” and has seemingly parked her ambitions to become an astronaut after taking on her nephew. During a visit to the local Air and Space Museum, the near-catatonic Elio is brought out of his shell by an upcoming exhibition celebrating the Voyager space program launched in 1977. “Is life really out there?” the narrator wonders, and Elio hopes there is, spending hours on the beach with a sign saying, “Aliens abduct me.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Elio's obsession with space becomes a problem for Olga, first after Elio gets involved in a fight with a couple of older boys over an eerie ham radio signal and, secondly, when he causes a huge power outage at her workplace by trying to reply to it. “Your life isn't up there, Elio, it's down here,” she tells him, before enrolling him a miserable sleepaway camp, where he is bullied for his belief in little green men. At which point, Elio finds his prayers answered: A spacecraft appears and sucks him aboard. After a quick once-over by liquid space computer Ooooo (Shirley Henderson), Elio is then taken to the Communiverse, a kind of brain trust represented by all the myriad gelatinous lifeforms of the galaxy.

	











	Mistaking Elio for the leader of Earth, the Communiverse sets about approving his application to join them, but this process is abruptly halted when “the other candidate” — ill-tempered warlord Grigon (Brad Garrett), aka The Blood Emperor — throws a tantrum after being turned down and threatens to return with force (“Prepare to be conquered!”). When the Communiverse responds by shutting down, Elio rashly offers to negotiate with Grigon and come to some sort of peace settlement. It's a story as old as time, if not Galaxy Quest (1999), and while Elio prepares his play, Ooooo fashions a lookalike with cloning clay and sends him back down to take Elio's place on Earth.


	Elio's mission falls at the first hurdle; imprisoned by Grigon, he encounters the warlord's soft-hearted son Glordon (Remi Edgerly), and the pair strike up a friendship. It's also the point at which the film starts to come apart, notably in an extended bonding montage that adds little to the plot and looks a lot more like the episode of The Simpsons where Bart and Milhouse go crazy on a Super-Squishee from the Kwik-E-Mart. Nothing after this point seems to make any sense, since Elio now has everything he set out to get, and, from so high up in the heavens, the only way is — quite literally — down.


	Visually, it's as spectacular as you might imagine, but somehow nothing feels terribly new: Elio's ambassadorial spaceship looks like the Inside Out command module; Grigon bears more than a passing resemblance to Buzz Lightyear's nemesis Emperor Zurg; and the Communiverse looks pretty traditional compared to Disney's 2022 animation Strange World. Likewise, the characters don't exactly trip off the tongue, with names that sound like you've suddenly gone deaf in one ear (thank God for production notes). Most disappointing of all, though, is the sense of compromise that hovers like a storm cloud over the film's deeply unsatisfying, not to mention unconvincing ending, which seems to turn its back on everything Elio is into and has always been looking for. It's hard to believe that this is the film Pixar set out to make, and all the evidence suggests it isn't.

Sarah Jessica Parker couldn't help but wonder why her iconic “Sex and the City” and “And Just Like That” character Carrie Bradshaw has been “condemned” by audiences. Well, that's just the gender bias for you. 

The actress told HuffPost UK that Carrie being deemed an unlikeable female lead has more to do with fan reactions rather than the character itself. “It's always interesting to me that [Carrie is] so condemned, but a male lead on a show can be a murderer, and people love him,” Bradshaw said. “If a woman has an affair, or behaves poorly, or spends money foolishly […] there's a kind of punitive response to it.”

The memes of Carrie eating Chinese takeout leftovers out of Natasha's (Bridget Moynahan) fridge after having an affair with her husband, Big (Chris Noth), is just one of the many cringe Carrie moments that have gone hate-viral. However, Parker does welcome the discord to some degree. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






“I ultimately think that all those feelings are pretty fantastic,” Parker said of the controversy and knee jerk reactions to Carrie's choices throughout both series. “That kind of connection and those kinds of strong feelings, both positive and negative, are pretty wonderful. People are kind of captive in those moments to something, and I think that's perfectly fine.”

 










Parker added that Carrie is one of the “smart people [who] make bad decisions sometimes [and] are foolish in judgement,” especially since Carrie has “made mistakes” and “not been mature in love.”

“I think, fundamentally, Carrie is an extraordinarily decent and good person – an extremely devoted friend, she's generous of spirit and time, in all she has to offer,” Parker said. 

Parker's former co-star Kim Cattrall recently spoke out about the legacy of her own “Sex and the City” character, Samantha. Cattrall told The Times that she still disagrees with some audience reactions to the beloved role. “[Samantha] wasn't a nymphomaniac — well, some people might have thought she was — but she was just enjoying the main course,” Cattrall said. “Everyone else was nibbling on the appetizers when she was going for the steak. And it was always on her terms — that I always insisted on.”

After playing it on the road for several years now, Kieren Hebden has shared his new Four Tet song “Into Dust (Still Falling).” The track, which samples Mazzy Star's 1993 song “Into Dust,” is now available both digitally and as a limited-edition 12"" vinyl record via XL. Give it a listen below.

“Into Dust” was written for Mazzy Star's sophomore studio album, So Tonight That I Might See. That LP also includes the timeless single “Fade Into You,” which catapulted the dream-pop band onto the Billboard Hot 100 chart and earned the group long-lasting fame as 1990s staples.

Back in February, Four Tet was in the running for three different Grammy Awards, but ultimately lost out. Hebden released his latest Four Tet album, Three, in 2024. He also reunited with his occasional collaborator Ellie Goulding that same year for the song “In My Dreams,” after the English pop singer texted him some voice notes and song ideas, and joined forces with Skrillex, Champion, and Naisha for the collaboration “Talk to Me.”

	Amid seemingly politically-motivated assassinations at home and a fast-spiraling war in the Middle East, there was at least one extremely funny — but also, in its way, extremely grim — display of government ridiculousness for late-night television to sink its teeth into: Donald Trump's goofy-as-hell military parade/birthday party.


	The astoundingly expensive endeavor (paid for by your tax dollars) was nominally meant to commemorate the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army, but just so happened to coincide with Trump's own birthday, June 14. It was the biggest military parade in the U.S. in decades and featured a procession of troops and high-grade military hardware — from squeaky tanks to robot dogs — and was exceptionally boring. 


	“It was a $50 million version of when a five-year-old shows you every car in his Hot Wheels collection,” Jimmy Kimmel cracked. “We paid for most of it, but [Trump] brought in some corporate sponsors, including the UFC, a crypto company, and ScottsMiracle-Gro, which is the product Trump uses on his head. There were flyovers, there were combovers, the whole thing! 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Over on The Daily Show, Jon Stewart joked that, before the real insanity of this past weekend unfolded, they were going to spend much of Monday's show talking about “little Kim Jong-Trump and his big military parade/quinceañera.” And how the planned spectacle wound up paling in comparison to the reality of a large tank squeakily plodding past largely empty grandstands.

	











	“Was that tank squeaking?” Stewart asked incredulously. “We have a trillion dollar budget for the military and nobody's got WD-40?! … This was less a show of overwhelming force, and more like a military museum getting in its steps.”


	Even Trump seemed bored by the whole thing, with Jimmy Fallon sharing a clip on The Tonight Show of the president vacantly staring at the proceedings and joking, “You know it's bad when the person who looks most happy to be there is Melania. Trump was dozing off at his parade. If it wasn't for the squeaky tank, he would've been in REM sleep.”

	Many of the hosts also pointed out the glaring differences between Trump's sparsely attended parade and the “No Kings” protests that took place across the country. During Late Night, Seth Meyers highlighted the giant “No King!” formation that protesters organized themselves into on a beach in San Francisco. 


	“That's why you don't piss off a city that's amazing at graphic design,” Meyers cracked. “I'm sorry, but human beings making words that tight is like 50 times more impressive to me than robot dogs. And, look, I know in the end robot dogs win. It might not be tonight, it might not be tomorrow, but at some point, I'm gonna go to the door to get my UberEats and it's going to be a robot dog. And he's going to say something like, ‘Take a closer look at deez nuts,' before it shoots a laser through my brain. But for today, shout out to human beings!”

	Seven minutes from bucolic Molly Maguire Historical Park in Frackville, Pennsylvania is the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. Behind the dull-grey concrete walls and razor wire, in a situation he describes as “live from slow motion death row,” is Mumia Abu-Jamal, prisoner AM 8335. At one time an international cause, Abu-Jamal spent nearly three decades on Pennsylvania's death row, maintaining his innocence and rousing millions to call for his release. Today, more than 40 years after he was convicted of murdering police officer Daniel Faulkner, he remains a third rail in Philadelphia politics. The Fraternal Order of Police has worked for decades first to have Abu-Jamal executed and now behind bars for killing one of their own. Amnesty International won't take a position on his guilt, but has said his case is rife with police, prosecutorial, and judicial misconduct. In 2011, his death sentence was overturned and the District Attorney chose to not pursue it further, conceding to a sentence of life without parole. Now 71, the numbers marching for his freedom have dwindled without the urgency of imminent execution dates. But even if we're not paying attention to him, you better believe he's paying attention to us. “There's a feeling of mass disorder; that everything is off of its orbit,” he says. “All is not well in Babylon.”

	











	Speaking with a direct, calm urgency, Mumia Abu-Jamal has much to say about the demise of due process, the hypocrisies of the Constitution, and the long political road that has delivered us to the current crisis. Before death row, Abu-Jamal was a youth leader for the Black Panthers and an award-winning reporter for NPR, covering culture, housing, and music. A recent president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists, his future was bright. That's what made Abu-Jamal's 1981 arrest for the killing of Officer Faulkner over a traffic stop so difficult to believe.  

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The state of Pennsylvania said that Officer Faulkner had pulled over Abu-Jamal's brother, William Cook, and Abu-Jamal, then working as a taxi driver, happened to be passing by and stopped. As police and many other pro-prosecution sources have described as “a physical altercation ensued.” Abu-Jamal, the prosecution alleged, came running across the street firing a gun, killing Faulkner while taking a bullet to the stomach. The prosecution submitted examples of  Abu-Jamal's political writings as a Panther that they said demonstrated hostility to the police. Abu-Jamal has always asserted that he is a political prisoner, behind bars as part of a reactionary wave by police and prosecution against Black radicals in Philly. His trial and numerous appeals , even when new eyewitnesses came forward disputing police accounts, have not been enough to set him free.

	As execution dates approached in 1995 and 1999, Abu-Jamal's case became a central cause for the music community. Rage Against The Machine, the Beastie Boys, KRS-One, Anti-Flag, and many more produced singles or played concerts to advocate for his freedom. But when he became a lifer without an execution date, his cause largely faded. Even as cries to “Free Mumia” have quieted, he appreciates the support he has.“I still hear from folks and I appreciate every last rap, every last word.” he says. 


	A self-described “history nerd” and “C-Span junkie,” Abu-Jamal has written or edited 15 books while behind bars, (including the recent Beneath The Mountain: An Anti-Prison Reader, from City Lights), and is finishing a PhD on highly influential 1950s doctor turned revolutionary  Frantz Fanon at UC Santa Cruz. This is someone who not only writes about the ugliest sides of this country,  he is living it every day. Mumia and Rolling Stone were face to face in Frackville, and followed that up with a recorded phone call. I had interviewed him previously 15 years ago, but now, amid the current political upheaval, the stakes are much higher as we discuss whether the oft-discussed “road to fascism” has already arrived at a destination.

What is your life like on what you have called “slow-motion death row”? It's certainly quieter but also more intense in very personal ways. I spent most of my life on death row and death row was my home. It was also my office. It was a place where I worked incessantly by reading and studying. I remember I would literally read two books per day, and that was the case for weeks and months. Not because of a college education program, but out of curiosity and wanting to know how the world was put together and being free to study, to learn the answer to some of those questions. Nothing concentrates the mind like death and when reading on death row, you can travel to where your mind is: I was in other countries and other eras when I would read on the row. As for now, slow death row is still death row. It's not a place where there's light at the end of the tunnel. There's just more tunnel and more darkness. (Laughs) It is a rare delight to hug one's children and hug your wife and hug friends and talk to them, especially after 29 years without physical contact, but it's still life in a cage, and that's no way to live.

	











How do you understand what you see going on politically outside the prison walls? It's hard not to look at the world at the present and feel a sense of profound chaos that grips one every day. It's partly because what the country has chosen is a kind of politics of madness, of meanness and — forgive me for saying so, but I do believe this in my bones — a kind of mass ignorance that cannot be ignored. That's the nature of this beast. It's an extraordinary and terrifying moment.


Trump has said he doesn't know if he agrees with the Constitution and assumed bedrock principles like due process, a trial, a jury of our peers, appear to be casualties of his justice department.The truth of the matter is that there has always been rhetoric about due process, the right to a jury of one's peers, and other protections offered by the constitution. But it doesn't matter what the constitution says, what matters is what it does. There is rhetoric and there is reality, and those two rivers rarely meet. When I hear about due process, my mind automatically goes not to me and my case but to Fred Hampton, the former chairman of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther Party, who was killed in his bed by the government for being a Black Panther. That was Dec. 4, 1969. I speak as someone who didn't just read articles about it. I was one of four Panthers from Philadelphia who traveled to Chicago immediately after hearing of his assassination and we stood in that house within hours of the state's execution of Fred Hampton. We stood within two feet of his blood-soaked mattress, and not far from the door that looked like Swiss cheese because automatic weapon fire had ripped through it in the early hours of the morning. Due process, my ass.


We also now outsource prisoners, held indefinitely without trial, to an El Salvadoran labor camp built by Geo Group.It's the expansion to the rest of the world of a prison industrial complex not content to remain in our borders. We are also seeing how easy it to repurpose these private prisons as places of repression, torture and death. These prison companies selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange are the new creators of what used to be called “black sites.” Black sites were secret prisons operated by the CIA. We never knew where they were because they never got on the news and said, “Let's talk about where the black sites are.” Now, we trumpet it and say, “We're going to open up a prison over there. And there and there.” It's really the privatization of prisons gone wild and worldwide. Think of people in Germany and South Africa a century ago coming to the United States to study Jim Crow in order to perfect their own systems of racialized inequality and oppression. The U.S. is an exporter of chains.

	











Trump's brutality has been seen often in recent years in raids led by Democratic mayors on Occupy Wall Street protestors, BLM protestors, Cop City protestors. Again, it doesn't matter what the constitution says. It matters what it does. Today is the 40th anniversary of the MOVE bombing in Philadelphia. It was a liberal Democratic mayor's office in Philadelphia that bombed a house of men, women, children, and animals, burned down several blocks, and told the fire department to cut the water off. And they did. Eleven people, including five children, died from burns and gunfire. To be facetious, how many of those people who committed mass murder in the fifth largest city in America went to death row? 


As a person who was once  the most well-known death row prisoner in the United States, what do you make of Trump's desire to bring the death penalty back with a vengeance?Again, this is the politics of repression writ large and in color. Trump's Justice Department also speaks of reinstating the death penalty against the people who received commutations. We're in an age of madness. Madness seems normal, doesn't it? If you get a dose of madness every day, after a while, you almost forget how mad you are and how crazy everything else is, because it gets normalized. (Laughs) It can only get crazier because it began 30 years ago with a kind of craziness.


What do you mean by “it began 30 years ago. with a kind of craziness”?You can't have this law and order, anti-constitutional Trumpism without Clintonism. Bill Clinton was the godfather of mass incarceration, and you can't talk about the expansion of the death penalty without understanding it as an extension of mass incarceration. You also could not have had mass incarceration in America without 1990s neoliberalism really calling the tune. And neoliberalism is essentially conservatism because it's a marriage between state and corporations, which is also a great definition for what? Fascism. It's like polite fascism. It isn't mean, but it has the same objective and intent. You cannot have had the exceptionalism of Trumpism without the Clinton/Biden crime bill and the mass expansion of prisons laying a road map for this.


Do we now live under fascism, a word I know you think has been overused in the past?Yes, it is fascism. We used that word in the Sixties for political effect. We really were using it to deepen not our analysis but our rhetoric. We're in another age right now. My understanding of fascism has always been the marriage between state and corporations. If you look at everything that's happening around us, that marriage is being consummated repeatedly. Corporations are the main power source in our political life. Legislation is written for them, no matter what it's about. And the U.S. Supreme Court has announced that corporations have constitutional rights and are essentially people to be protected under the Constitution. 

	











Is there a path to build a movement to defeat this fascist Trump agenda?Waves of oppression must be met with waves of resistance, and we are now dealing with waves of madness. Any movement is going to need youth, and this generation is in many ways quite magnificent. It is the youth that always comes out and speaks about “freedom dreams” in ways that their elders are afraid to. When you're young — especially when you're young and in college — that is the freest time of your life. Your brain is being fed in ways that it hasn't been in your high school days and won't be in your post-college days. Many do not have children, they do not yet have the pressure of a career or a job, so they're not dominated in a way that so much of the working class is. They're free and they're able to speak in ways that are responsive to not just their will but their heart, their spirit, and therefore, they're able to see and rebel in ways that are unprecedented. 


	Think about what happened when a 17-year-old picked up a phone in Minneapolis and recorded a police officer killing someone right before her eyes. She live streamed it and it went around the world. We saw the biggest demonstrations in decades and they took place all around the world. It was like George Floyd was radiating around the world, going from phone to phone at the same time and it sparked something remarkable. A 17-year-old made that possible. I think of these young people as really incredible, and because of that powerful communication tool, they could do things that Huey [Newton] and Eldridge [Cleaver] would have dreamed of and couldn't have pulled off! (Laughs) Because communication has been transformed. 


You have spoken about reading Karl Marx for the first time at age 41. Perhaps you could speak about what Marxism has offered in terms of an analysis of our current chaos.When I was a young Panther, I tried to read Marx. It was impenetrable. I tried to read Capital and I couldn't get past two pages. It put me to sleep! Well, I picked it up years later, sitting on death row, and I learned some things that a 14- or 15-year-old could not have possibly learned when he began to read this stuff. I began seeing the power of having an economic analysis in order to understand how the world is organized. Marx said that capitalism is itself a revolutionary idea that tears down all Chinese walls. It's a destructive force that prices “things” but values nothing. This economic control over our lives — and being enslaved by the ups and downs of economic crisis — will not be stopped unless people start thinking in alternative ways. It's important because capitalism is gangsterism on a global scale and that needs to be confronted. 

	











Yeah, they're always quoting him in The Wall Street Journal every time there's a crisis.(Laughs) Which shows you they read Marx!


They're like, “We agree with the economic analysis of capitalism, just not the whole revolution, overthrowing the system part!”Exactly. But they know its destructive power because they're part of it. And we're seeing the results of a system in a constant state of crisis every day: in the world, and certainly in our politics in this country. We are amidst a white nationalist counterrevolution in Washington. Think of the federal workers under attack. You think they're really a bunch of left-wing maniacs and socialists and liberals? No. In fact, they're more conservative than the average worker, but this regime treated them like trash because they wanted tax cuts for the super wealthy. And they treated these people who worked their asses off — these people who went to school to learn a skill to get a job and do the best they can to help the country — like garbage. Think about the way people talk about teachers today. One of the hardest jobs in the world is to teach young people. That's one of the hardest and one of the poorest paying gigs in the country. And when you hear politicians talk about them, they talk about them like dirt.


Why do they hate teachers so much though?Partly because teachers represent an educated working class that questions critically the political statements politicians make. Think about the war against universities. Probably the finest creation that society has made in terms of higher education. It's easier to have fascism with an uneducated workforce. Trump said, “I love the uneducated. They're my favorite people.” I've never heard a politician say those words before him. But he means them! I think in my cell about how many of the movements of the Sixties had their birth in universities, right? Berkeley, San Francisco State, Columbia. They are at permanent war against the Sixties, probably the freest period of the Twentieth century. And they are at war with higher ed because they saw the encampments for Palestine and don't want to see that kind of challenge again. 


This is Rolling Stone and you were in part a music reporter. I know you interviewed one of my heroes, Bob Marley. I was hoping you could speak about what that was like.That was one of the most remarkable interviews I had conducted. My baby brother, my wife and I went to a big hotel in Center City, Philadelphia. We had made arrangements with his manager, and we came up and there were Rastas walking around listening to reggae in the big room, and in the bedroom was Robert Nesta Marley. We sat down, and I must confess, he pulled out a monster spliff, and I put on a 90-minute tape to record him. And he just rolled.

You also interviewed people like The Pointer Sisters, Peter Tosh… where does your love of music come from? Music is the closest we ever get to magic in the world. I was a kid singing tenor in the Philadelphia All-City Choir. I remember one of our biggest songs was something you'd never believe . (He sings  a few bars of  “Gloria in Excelsis Deo” in Latin.) Because I couldn't read music, I had to memorize my part, so it stuck in my head forever.


Bands like Rage Against the Machine and the Beastie Boys stood up for you when you were on death row. There are also many hip hop tracks about you and for you. What did that mean to you in the 1990s when musicians were taking up your case? It was electric; truly a wonder. My regret is that I did not get to hear most of these songs because in many of the jails I was at, we would only get local radio stations. They didn't play hip hop, so we would get country and western nonstop, because we were in western Pennsylvania. I had some young guys who came on the row, and they would sing or recite some of the lyrics they knew, and it would blow my mind, because these were songs I had never heard. I had no idea they ever existed. Musicians are by nature the most sensitive people in our creation because, in a way, they have to be, because they're listening to the sounds of souls to guide their art. Every one of them has magic within them. You can only have magic within to bring it out.

   10:28 EDT 17 Jun 2025, updated  10:28 EDT 17 Jun 2025    By CHRIS MELORE, ASSISTANT SCIENCE EDITOR FOR DAILYMAIL.COM  

A strange jellyfish-like phenomenon was spotted streaking across the California sky Monday night.

While the unusual 'UFO' sighting baffled many locals from the Mojave desert to Los Angeles's South Bay, scientists say there were no extraterrestrials involved in creating the jellyfish - it was an Elon Musk rocket.

SpaceX's latest Falcon 9 rocket mission lifted off at 11:36pm ET Monday night from Vandenberg Space Force Station in California.

A few minutes into the flight, the rocket's exhaust interacted with the atmosphere, creating a visible cloud of condensed water vapor.

Since the launch took place right after sunset, around 8:36pm PT, the sun illuminated the crystalized exhaust plume, resulting in a spectacular sight for millions on the ground.

Californians posted images of the rocket soaring over the state on X, even as far south as Riverside, over 200 miles southeast of the Vandenberg launch site.

SpaceX's lead avionics systems engineer, Cameron Gable, captured the jellyfish phenomenon as the rocket traveled past Los Angeles County's South Bay.

The mission, dubbed Starlink 15-9, saw SpaceX launch its latest batch of Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit. 

The jellyfish phenomenon, also known as a 'vapor cone' or 'shock collar,' occurs when the localized air pressure around the rocket drops, causing the air temperature to decrease and water vapor to condense into visible clouds.

Monday's giant jellyfish display started just a few minutes into the flight and was visible to anyone in the Southern California area.

It's not the first time a SpaceX rocket has produced the jellyfish effect. In October 2022, sky watchers caught another Falcon 9 rocket creating the same vapor trail during a similar mission to deploy new satellites.

Monday's Falcon 9 launch was the latest mission in SpaceX's ongoing efforts to expand its Starlink 'constellation,' aiming to enhance global internet coverage.

SpaceX has already conducted 75 launches in 2025, mainly for Starlink missions.

The mission also used a reusable first-stage engine, a hallmark of SpaceX's design philosophy aimed at reducing the cost of spaceflights.

SpaceX captured the moment on their live broadcast when the reusable engine safely landed back on Earth to be used again in future missions.

Monday's mission was the 200th from the company's Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg.

The remote-controlled reusable rocket engine made a perfect touchdown on SpaceX's droneship in the Pacific Ocean about eight minutes after launch, making it the 463rd engine returned to Earth.

While the jellyfish effect may seem like a bizarre UFO to the untrained eye, it's common among spaceflights.

Social media users regularly capture rockets giving off the jellyfish trail from hundreds of miles away.

One X user in Phoenix, Arizona, was able to spot a similar jellyfish during a June 2024 launch. That mission also involved a Falcon 9 launching from Vandenberg, which was over 500 miles away.

When a rocket launches, it expels a large amount of exhaust gases at high speeds. These gases, primarily composed of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other rocket launch byproducts, expand rapidly as they exit the rocket's nozzle.

As the exhaust plume expands, it encounters cooler, denser air in Earth's upper atmosphere. This can cause the water vapor in the exhaust to condense into visible clouds, forming a balloon-like shape around the rocket.

The high speed of the rocket can also create shock waves, further shaping the exhaust into distinctive patterns, creating the jellyfish effect. 

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, with their frequent launch schedule and reusable first stages, often trigger this effect due to their design and the typical launch times chosen for optimal visibility.

However, any rocket launch around the world can potentially give off a jellyfish trail, especially when the conditions are right for the exhaust to give off a dramatic display in the atmosphere.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

   15:33 EDT 17 Jun 2025, updated  15:48 EDT 17 Jun 2025    By ALEXA CIMINO FOR DAILYMAIL.COM  

US military personnel captured an eerie flying saucer UFO in incredible new footage that has just been leaked to the public.

Investigative journalists Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp say the video was recorded by government personnel over the Afghan-Pakistan border in November 2020. They released it to the public on Tuesday.

It shows a massive disc weaving in and out of cloud cover.  The Department of Defense labeled the disc a UAP - unidentified aerial phenomena - and it looks markedly different to other 'tic-tac'-shaped UFOs seen in recent military footage.

The raw thermal imagery, along with two additional enhanced clips produced by the U.S. government, show the unidentified craft abruptly changing direction - all without any visible signs of propulsion.

'This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public,' Corbell exclusively told DailyMail.com. 'It has implications that are huge.'

The object was spotted during a reconnaissance mission by a high-altitude Air Force platform. 

According to internal government slides Corbell and Knapp have seen, the UAP was described as 'navigating through clouds' and characterized as a 'disc'. 

The military's own internal enhancements - now made public - further underline the object's unusual heat signature, or lack thereof.

'You do not see plumes of heat coming off this disc-shaped object,' Corbell explained. 

'This was captured on a thermal sensor - it should have detected heat if any traditional propulsion was present. But there's nothing. That's one of the wildest aspects.'

In simple terms, that means it is unclear exactly how the disc is being powered. Terrestrial aircraft tend to use jet or propeller engines which can leave obvious trails across the sky.  

The footage was extensively studied within intelligence community investigations for years, known to those with high-level access but never intended for public release. 

Corbell and Knapp said they spent over two years validating the authenticity of the clips with multiple sources, including individuals who actively work in official U.S. government UFO programs.

'The source is legit. We know it's real,' Knapp confirmed during the latest episode of their podcast Weaponized. 'It was not supposed to be made public. But it should've been.'

The object is estimated to be between 200 and 400 meters in diameter, though Corbell admits its exact size is still being debated, with further analysis required to offer more accurate perspective on its size. 

'There's depth of field. There's relative distance. The shape is undeniable,' Corbell said. 'And the movement? It's extraordinary. You're seeing it dip into clouds, then emerge and reverse direction. That's not an artifact. That's a real object in motion.'

The videos released include:

Online investigators have already begun poring over the footage, which includes geolocation data in the bottom-left corner of the screen. 

Those coordinates point to the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan, an active conflict zone with strategic surveillance interest.

'The public has a right and a need to know,' Corbell said. 'This capture is worthy of serious discourse - not just in the UFO community, but in international and scientific conversations. It challenges our understanding of what's flying through our skies.'

Corbell and Knapp have not disclosed how they obtained the footage, only stating that it was 'leaked' and that they took extreme precautions to protect sources.

'This is just the start,' Corbell teased.

Jeremy Corbell is an investigative filmmaker known for releasing some of the most compelling UAP footage ever made public, including the infamous 'Tic Tac' UFO videos and a series of military-captured encounters that have sparked global headlines. 

Corbell has also played a key role in amplifying whistleblower testimony - most notably from Matthew Brown, the former Pentagon insider who recently came forward with claims about secret UAP retrieval programs. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Good Job is Slate's advice column on work. Have a workplace problem big or small? Send it to Laura Helmuth and Doree Shafrir here. (It's anonymous!)

Dear Good Job, 

I work in an office cube farm. The job itself is good and I enjoy my work, but I need some help dealing with a situation involving my co-worker and his “interesting” beliefs.

“Carl” is a nice guy and a good colleague most of the time, but he has these very weird, honestly conspiracy-theory beliefs about soy products. He thinks they're some sort of subtle poison foisted on us by an international cabal whose members change daily. I've learned to redirect all conversations away from the stuff and never bring it up myself.

But the problem is a second co-worker, “Rick.” He seems to enjoy riling Carl up, and will very conspicuously do things to set him off. A few times a week, he'll come back from his break with a drink, stand right in front of Carl's workstation, and say it's a soy latte. And if they have breaks at the same time, Rick will go out of his way to ask Carl about soy. He even brought it up at a group chat once, and the boss had to mute Carl because he wouldn't stop ranting.

It upsets me. I'm pretty non-confrontational. And they're both guys (I'm a woman), so I feel a bit intimidated at trying to tell them to directly knock it off. But I don't think it's the sort of thing that HR or my boss would take seriously. What can I do here to keep my sanity?

—Dealing With Lunatics

Dear Dealing With Lunatics,

Carl and Rick both sound awful in their own ways. My advice is to keep your distance, ignore both of them to the extent that you can, and focus on you and your own work. If their interactions get to the point where you absolutely can't ignore them and they're interfering with your work, then I would ask your boss if they've noticed Rick and Carl's behavior, tell them that you're having a hard time ignoring it, and ask for their advice on how to deal with it. That way, you're not getting directly involved, but you're also letting your manager know that this behavior is bizarre and disruptive, and hopefully, they will be able to do something about it.

Lastly, I'm not a mental health professional, but Carl's behavior does strike me as so far out of the norm as to be somewhat worrisome. If you notice that the conspiracy theories and ranting are spilling over into other areas, I think it's worth raising with your boss as well. And for the record, I think soy milk tastes gross.

—Doree

I'm a single woman in my 30s. I met a guy a couple of months ago through an online dating website, and we hit it off and are spending a lot of time together. He is funny, smart, articulate, sensitive, talented, and seems to adore me. The catch is that he is missing several of his teeth. In the front.

When award-winning science writer Amy Alkon was blindsided by her first hot flash, it kicked off a cascade of symptoms—drenching night sweats, insomnia, and a rage she couldn't explain. But what shocked her more was how little real science her doctor had to offer.

In this episode, Alkon shares what she uncovered in her deep dive into the research on menopause and perimenopause—the critical yet often neglected years leading up to menopause when millions of women are misdiagnosed, dismissed, or simply told to “wait it out.” Drawing from her new book Going Menopostal, she explains why so much medical advice is still based on outdated or inadequate evidence, and what women can do about it.

Alkon breaks down complex science with clarity, humor, and a healthy dose of skepticism, giving listeners the tools they need to ask better questions, advocate for themselves, and get the care they deserve. Whether you're in the thick of it or simply want to be prepared, or want to support your loved ones going through menopause, this episode will leave you informed, empowered, and maybe even laughing.

Amy Alkon is an independent investigative science writer specializing in “applied science”—using scientific evidence to solve real-world problems. Alkon critically evaluates and synthesizes research across disciplines and then translates it into everyday language, empowering regular people to make scientifically informed decisions for the best of their health and well-being.

For 25 years, Alkon wrote an award-winning, science-based nationally syndicated advice column, distributed by Creators. She is the author of five books—most recently, her “science-help” book Unfuckology: How to Live with Guts and Confidence (St. Martin's Press, 2018). She is the past President of the Applied Evolutionary Psychology Society, which brings evolutionary science to public policy, education, and medicine. Her new book is Going Menopostal: What You (And Your Doctor) Need to Know About the Real Science of Menopause and Perimenopause.

US President Donald Trump has demanded an “unconditional surrender” from Iran, which has been locked in a heated military conflict with Israel, over the past days. In a series of posts on his Truth Social Trump also claimed that “we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.” 

Hostilities between West Jerusalem and Tehran have been intensifying since Israel's attacks on a uranium enrichment center, nuclear and military facilities, and a series of drone and car-bomb attacks that killed over a dozen senior Iranian military commanders and scientists as well as multiple civilians.

Iran retaliated by firing dozens of ballistic missiles into Israel. The two sides have been exchanging attacks since then.

“Unconditional surrender,” Trump wrote in capital letters on Truth Social on Tuesday. The American president also issued a direct threat against the Islamic Republic's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claiming that the US and its Israeli allies “know exactly” where Khamenei is “hiding.” Trump called him an “easy target” but stated that “we are not going to take him out… at least for now.”

“Our patience is wearing thin,” the US president added.

Speaking to journalists earlier on Tuesday, the American leader said his goals in the conflict between West Jerusalem and Tehran go beyond a ceasefire, adding that he wanted Iran to forgo “entirely on nuclear weapons.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made similar statements on Monday, when he claimed that Israel was “in control of the skies over Tehran” and told the city's residents to evacuate.

Tehran signaled on Tuesday that it was ready to continue fighting. “The enemy cannot sustain a long war, and as it continues, the back of the Zionist regime will be broken,” Iran's defense ministry spokesman, Brigadier General Reza Talayi-Nik, said in a televised interview aired by the Iranian state broadcaster. The general also announced the use of new missile systems as part of retaliatory strikes.

“Today, we used one of our missiles for the first time, and the Zionist regime didn't even realize it had been deployed. They will see more of these surprises,” he said. Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) reported successful strikes on Israel's military intelligence logistical headquarters and a Mossad intelligence center in the Tel Aviv area on Tuesday. The targets were hit “despite the presence of highly advanced defense systems,” it said.

West Jerusalem justified its Friday attack by claiming Iran was on the brink of obtaining a nuclear weapon. Tehran has repeatedly denied such accusations, maintaining that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful.

In late March, US National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard stated that American intelligence data suggested Iran was “not building a nuclear weapon” and its nuclear arms program had been on hold since 2003. When asked about this assessment on Tuesday, Trump stated that he did “not care what she said.”

TEHRAN, June 17. /TASS/. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran's elite military unit, claims to have struck the building of Israel's military intelligence directorate and Mossad headquarters.

""This morning, the IRGC's aerospace forces carried out a strike on the center of military intelligence of the Zionist regime's (Israel's - TASS) army, Aman, and the Zionist regime's center for planning terrorist operations, Mossad, in Tel Aviv, despite Israel's advanced defense systems, and this center is now on fire,"" the Tasnim news agency quoted an IRGC statement.

Tasnim reported earlier that Israel's Glilot military intel base near Tel Aviv was hit by IRGC's missile strike.

Overnight into June 13, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion targeting Iran's nuclear program. Iran responded in less than 24 hours. In the following days, Tel Aviv and Tehran continued to exchange strikes. Both parties reported casualties and damage, and admitted that a number of facilities had been hit, but said the damage was limited.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Follow:


            President Donald Trump is growing increasingly warm to using US military assets to strike Iranian nuclear facilities and souring on the idea of a diplomatic solution to end Tehran's escalating conflict with Israel, two officials familiar with the ongoing discussions told CNN.
    


            The new, more hawkish posture represents a significant shift in Trump's thinking, though the sources said Trump remains open to a diplomatic solution — if Iran makes significant concessions.
    


            Over the weekend and into Monday, discussions among Trump administration officials had continued to center on trying to find a diplomatic solution to serve as an off-ramp, sources familiar with the talks said.
    


            But Trump signaled early Tuesday his patience for diplomacy was wearing thin. “I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One returning early from the Group of 7 summit in Canada. He added that his objective in Iran was “an end, a real end, not a ceasefire,” or “giving up entirely.”

            He later doubled down on Truth Social, calling for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” and asserting that the US knew the location of Iran's supreme leader – even though it would not kill him “for now.”
    


            Officials said Trump had, for now, moved away from the idea of dispatching top officials to a mutually agreed upon location in the Middle East to meet with the Iranians and attempt to hash out a deal.
    


            Military officials were preparing for the possibility that Trump would decide to order the US Air Force to help refuel Israeli fighter jets as they carry out strikes over Iran, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The sources said that is one reason why more than 30 US aerial refueling tankers have been surged to the region over the last several days.
    


            The refueling of Israeli jets would be on the lesser end of US military involvement, the sources said. More broadly, however, the tankers have been moved in order to give Trump and US Central Command “options” should things escalate, one of the sources said. That includes the option, presented to Trump by CENTCOM, of joint US-Israel strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the source added.
    


            On Tuesday, after Trump abruptly returned to Washington from the G7 Summit, his vice president offered one of the clearest signals to date that Trump was weighing taking offensive action to eliminate Iran's nuclear facilities.
    


            JD Vance posted to X that the president “may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president.”
    


            Trump was meeting Tuesday with members of his national security team in the White House Situation Room. Israel has been pressing Trump to become more involved in its campaign to dismantle Iran's nuclear facilities, which top officials from the country have said would require American weapons and planes. An Israeli source familiar with the matter said there was more optimism within Israel that the US would join the military campaign against Iran. But the source said the Israelis had not yet received an official decision from the Trump administration.
    


            Until Tuesday, the president had offered little clarity on whether he would accede to Israel's pressure, which has been countered by loud voices within his own party encouraging him to avoid getting dragged into another foreign conflict. Trump had been wary of ordering the US to engage directly on behalf of the Israelis, beyond providing defensive support to intercept Iranian missiles and US intelligence.
    


            But in a string of social media posts Tuesday, Trump sounded increasingly combative and used the word “we” to describe military action in Iran.
    


            “We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,” he wrote. “Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn't compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured ‘stuff.' Nobody does it better than the good ol' USA.”
    


            In a separate post, Trump also used “we” to describe information pinpointing the location of Iran's supreme leader.
    


            “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump wrote.

Israel says Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon. US intel says it was years away



            The Trump administration had heavily relied on the Omanis in recent months to pass messages back and forth with Iranian officials and facilitate five rounds of negotiations as the US and Iran worked toward a possible nuclear deal. But when Israel initially began carrying out the major operation targeting Iran's nuclear sites, the administration's tactics changed, sources familiar with the matter said.
    


            Trump instructed special envoy Steve Witkoff to attempt to meet with Iranian officials as quickly as possible, and the administration engaged a wide range of regional players to get Iran back to the table, sources said, including the Qataris, the Egyptians, the Saudis and the Turks.
    


            “It is not just the Omanis, it is everyone. Everyone is working,” said a regional diplomat familiar with the administration's outreach in recent days. “Witkoff is texting everyone.”
    


            But those efforts on Tuesday morning had not delivered a breakthrough. Iran's Foreign Ministry told CNN on Tuesday that it know nothing about planned talks in the coming days.
    


            Trump administration officials have been closely monitoring private and public communications from Israel regarding its plans to escalate offensive attacks on Iran in the next few days. An official said those signals were a driving force behind Trump's Monday directive for residents of Tehran to evacuate.
    


            It is still unclear whether the president will ultimately decide to aid Israel's effort to fully eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities. Sources familiar with the behind-the-scenes talks have said the possibility is on the table, especially if the Iranians do not more proactively try to find a solution.
    


            In his message Tuesday, Vance sought to address concerns from members of Trump's own base of supporters about the potential for an escalating conflict that draws the US closer to war.
    


            “And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy,” Vance wrote, getting at the divide emerging among conservatives over whether to aid Israel in its goal of wiping out Iran's nuclear capabilities or to avoid dragging the US into another foreign war.
    


            In a private phone call Monday, Sen. Lindsey Graham personally urged Trump to go “all in” to end Iran's nuclear program, including using the might of the US military.
    


            “I said, Mr. President, ‘This is a historic moment. Four presidents have promised that they won't get a nuclear weapon on your watch. You can fulfill that promise,” the South Carolina Republican said a day afterward.
    


            Graham, who is one of the GOP's most hawkish voices on Iran, made clear to Trump he wants the US to intervene in the dismantling of Iran's nuclear program more directly with American military resources, alongside Israel's.
    


            “If it takes bombs, bunker buster bombs, so be it. If we need to fly with Israel, so be it. The consequences of not getting this right are enormous,” Graham told reporters.

            A White House official said Trump understands both sides of that argument. But the official said the president firmly believes that his repeated statements that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and warnings that the US would ensure that never happens provide justification for any potential action.
    


            Upon arriving back at the White House on Tuesday morning, Trump posted a message he'd received from his ambassador in Israel, Mike Huckabee, acknowledging the president had “many voices speaking to you” but encouraging him to be open to divine intervention.
    


            “I believe you will hear from heaven and that voice is far more important than mine or ANYONE else's,” Huckabee wrote.
    


            Trump has said previously that Iran must abandon its nuclear program, and alleged Tuesday that Iran was “very close” to developing a nuclear weapon, despite assessments from his own intelligence chiefs that such an outcome was not imminent.
    


            Asked on Air Force One whether there's any guarantee that US bombs could actually reach underground Iranian nuclear bunkers and destroy them, Trump said, “There's no guarantee in anything.”
    


            And he issued a warning to Iran that targeting American troops in the region would lead to a dramatic escalation in the conflict.
    


            “We'll come down so hard, it'd be gloves off,” he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. regulators will begin offering faster reviews to new medicines that administration officials deem as promoting “the health interests of Americans,” under a new initiative announced Tuesday.

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency will aim to review select drugs in one to two months. FDA's long-standing accelerated approval program generally issues decisions in six months for drugs that treat life-threatening diseases. Regular drug reviews take about 10 months.

Since arriving at the FDA in April, Makary has repeatedly told FDA staff they need to “challenge assumptions” and rethink procedures. In a medical journal commentary published last week, Makary suggested the agency could conduct “rapid or instant reviews,” pointing to the truncated process used to authorize the first COVID-19 vaccines under Operation Warp Speed.

For the new program, the FDA will issue a limited number of “national priority vouchers” to companies “aligned with U.S. national priorities,” the agency said in a statement. The special designation will give the selected companies access to extra FDA communications, streamlined staff reviews and the ability to submit much of their product information in advance.

Speeding up drug approvals has long been a priority of the pharmaceutical industry, which has successfully lobbied Congress to create a variety of special programs and pathways for faster reviews.




Many aspects of the plan announced Tuesday overlap with older programs. But the broad criteria for receiving a voucher will give FDA officials unprecedented discretion in deciding which companies can benefit from the fastest reviews.

“The ultimate goal is to bring more cures and meaningful treatments to the American public,” Makary said in a statement.

Makary previously said the FDA should be willing to ease its scientific requirements for certain drugs, for instance, by not always requiring randomized studies in which patients are tracked over time to track safety and effectiveness. Such trials are generally considered the gold standard of medical research, though the FDA has increasingly been willing to accept smaller, less-definitive studies for rare or life-threatening diseases. 

In several recent cases, the FDA has faced criticism for approving drugs based on preliminary data that didn't ultimately show benefits for patients.

The push to rapidly accelerated drug approvals is the opposite approach that Makary and his boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have taken on vaccines. 

Promising a “return to gold-standard science,” Kennedy previously announced that all new vaccines would have to be compared to placebo, or a dummy shot, to win approval. Kennedy and Makary also have announced a stricter policy on seasonal updates to COVID-19 shots, saying they will have to undergo new testing before they can be approved for use in healthy children and most adults.

Republican Senator Jim Banks explains why Indiana Fever fans deserve an apology after the league's latest investigation during an appearance on OutKick's ""Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich.""  

Angel Reese is turning an insult into a positive.

Reese, of course, is a rebounding machine, setting the single-season record last year before an injury cut her season short — that record was then surpassed by A'ja Wilson.

But many of her rebounds have come from the offensive side, stemming from her own missed shots.

Because of this, a viral TikTok user coined the term ""mebounds,"" for when Reese grabs a rebound off her own miss. 

Well, Reese took advantage of the opportunity and filed a trademark application for the new word. The trademark would be for hats, T-shirts and sweatshirts.

Reese even addressed the term in one of her latest TikTok videos.

""Whoever came up with the 'mebounds' thing, y'all ate that up. Because 'mebounds,' rebounds, crebounds... anything that comes off that board, it's mine,"" she said in the post.

""And a brand? That's six figures right there. The trolling, I love when y'all do it because, like, the ideas be good. Like, when y'all have to alter my face and s--- because I'm cute, all right, whatever. That doesn't get me. But when y'all came up with ‘mebounds,' because statistically, all the rebounds that I get aren't always just mine. They're, like, the defenses, too, or somebody else on my team. But, when y'all came up with 'mebounds,' y'all ate.""

In a recent contest, Reese grabbed five offensive rebounds in a 19-second span, four of which came off her own shots.

Reese currently leads the WNBA with 11.9 rebounds per game — 4.8 of those are offensive, which is also a WNBA high. She is shooting 35.7% from the floor in 10 games played this season. She ranks third in defensive rebounds per game with 7.1.

The 23-year-old recently recorded her first triple-double, scoring 11 points, grabbing 13 boards, and handing out 11 assists.

Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI is burning through $1 billion a month as the cost of building its advanced AI models races ahead of the limited revenues, according to people briefed on the company's financials.

The rate at which the company is bleeding cash provides a stark illustration of the unprecedented financial demands of the artificial intelligence industry, particularly at xAI, where revenues have been slow to materialize.

In this article

India's aviation safety watchdog said on Tuesday surveillance conducted on Air India's Boeing fleet did not reveal any major safety concerns, days after one of its jets crashed, killing at least 271 people.

""The aircraft and associated maintenance systems were found to be compliant with existing safety standards,"" the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said in a statement.

The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner bound for London with 242 people on board crashed seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday hitting nearby buildings. All but one passenger on board was killed, along with about 30 people on the ground.

The DGCA also said 24 of Air India's 33 Boeing 787 aircraft had completed an ""enhanced safety inspection"" it had ordered the airline to carry out.

The regulator, in a meeting with senior officials of Air India, raised concerns about recent maintenance-related issues reported by the airline.

It advised the carrier to ""strictly adhere to regulations,"" strengthen coordination across its businesses and ensure availability of adequate spares to mitigate passenger delays, it added.

The DGCA had met senior officials of Air India and Air India Express to review their operations amid increasing flight volumes.

Any open protocol will always be subject to competition, that's the point of it being open. If someone adopts that protocol and supercedes it because they add stuff that people want,  that's how it goes. If people don't want that to happen, they need to stay on their toes and extend protocols quickly driven by user demand. That's really why a lot of protocol based ecosystems get absorbed, they stagnate.

Bad news, folks: we all went to sleep, woke up, and the Trump phone is still here. That means a couple of things. For one, it means the T1 phone wasn't the result of a spicy, food-fueled fever dream or a bad batch of crazy-style mushrooms—it's a real phone that costs real money, made by a real president, who thinks “fox in the henhouse” is an allegory for how to win bigly in the U.S. government. It also means something else depressing, and it's got nothing to do with making America great and everything to do with undermining your privacy.

There are a lot of bad things about the Trump phone. There's the gaudy, I-hate-poor-people gold aesthetic; the “long life camera” that I assume is supposed to mean “long-life battery” that is actually not long-life at all; and the fact that it's masquerading as an American-made device, though it clearly is not being made in America and likely never will be. My personal favorite is the fact that it's 5G enabled, which, as we all know, may not jibe well for a certain subsect of people whose conspiratorial cult (QAnon) thinks 5G caused COVID-19. But all of that could be trivial when you unpack how disastrous a Trump phone (at least in theory) could really be.

As I mentioned yesterday, after the T1's announcement, phones aren't just any product; they're kind of conduits into your whole life. You do everything on your phone: banking, talking to friends and family, browsing the web, and shopping. And beyond that, you do stuff that might be of even more interest to someone who's directly involved in politics—registering to vote, espousing or denouncing political views, and donating to campaigns. What's to prevent, say, I don't know, someone who works in government with direct access to that information from collecting and using that data for their own purpose? There's a reason why the government doesn't own the platforms we compute on, and it starts with “c” and ends in “onflict of interest.”

Some actual specs for the upcoming Trump Phone:-5000mAh long life camera (?)-under ""Processor & RAM"" it reads ""Storage 12GB RAM"", so maybe the next phone will have a processor-two of the three rear cameras are 2MP pic.twitter.com/PzPQtHGZsk

— jacksfilms (@jacksfilms) June 16, 2025



Sure, I know that our devices are already a privacy minefield to begin with, and doubly so are the platforms that we access through them, but something tells me that encoding politics directly into our devices isn't going to skew those privacy pitfalls in a positive direction. No technology is completely agnostic at the end of the day, but that doesn't mean we should just give up on making our hardware as safe and as neutral as possible.

I don't want to be an alarmist here; Trump's phone likely won't end up being a threat to that already-tenuous digital privacy for several reasons. One is that this phone sucks, and I don't think many people will be tempted to buy it, let alone use it every day or throw their most personal information into it. Secondly, even if this thing did sell, only the most hardcore Trump supporters would be using it, so the privacy pitfalls would only affect Trump's voting base. Lastly, I have my doubts that this thing is even real. There's a high chance, if I were a betting man, that Trump's family never even gets their shit together enough to make this monstrosity a reality, especially if initial attempts to purchase it are any indication.

But despite all of that, the idea is enough for me to take a breath, pause, and ask, “Wait, what the hell is going on here?” Trump may be the first U.S. president to try and sell the American public a smartphone, but the precedents he sets have a pesky way of resetting standards for the worse. The T1 feels like exactly the kind of slippery slope that could send you and your poor brittle tailbone straight to the emergency room—sans adequate health insurance. Phones aren't shoes; they're not memeocins; they're not NFT Christmas ornaments or commemorative coins—they're people's lives, for better and often worse. So, let's all make the right call here and agree that we should leave our most crucial gadgets to the Tim Apples of the world.

Elon Musk posted what appeared to be his drug test results on X early Tuesday. And even though multiple credible news organizations have said Musk is a regular user of illicit drugs, it looks like the billionaire oligarch tested negative for the drugs he's reportedly been using, including cocaine, ecstasy, and ketamine.

Musk tweeted simply “lol” with an image of the report, which appears to have been conducted by a company called Fastest Labs of South Austin, in Austin, Texas. The image posted by Musk states it was a urine test collected on June 11 and received by the lab on June 13. The report is dated June 16.

The report shows Musk tested negative for benzodiazepines, amphetamine, and opiates, among the other drugs he's reportedly used in the past. Musk has been most closely associated with ketamine, a drug that reportedly impacted his bladder, according to an article from the New York Times in late May. The billionaire has said he was prescribed ketamine for depression years ago, but more recently said he hasn't touched it in a few years.

Musk accused the New York Times of “lying their ass off” about his history of drug use. But the newspaper wasn't the first to report on it. The Wall Street Journal was the first major newspaper to write about Musk's alleged history with LSD, cocaine, ecstasy, mushrooms, and ketamine back in January 2024. The article cited sources within his companies who were concerned that Musk's drug use may be hurting his businesses.

Musk posted the drug results himself on Tuesday, which means we have to take his word that it's an accurate representation of reality. That will obviously be difficult for some people, given Musk's history of being dishonest about a litany of topics. For example, when Musk insisted there was widespread fraud happening at the Social Security Administration and 150-year-olds were collecting Social Security checks, it was a claim that made it into President Donald Trump's first speech to Congress during his second term. As it turns out, Musk's claim wasn't true, and his top DOGE spokesperson, Katie Miller, insisted on perpetuating the lie, according to new reporting from the New York Times.

NASA, which oversees Musk's lucrative SpaceX contracts, insisted it saw “no evidence” back in January 2024 that he had used drugs. But the New York Times also reported last month that Musk had been given advance warning about drug tests mandated by the government for the billionaire to keep his security clearance.

It seems unlikely that Musk's tweet with drug test results will put the debate to rest. Especially since the Tesla CEO spent the past year under a harsh spotlight after he endorsed Trump, handing out over $250 million to get him and other Republicans elected. Musk appeared on quite a few stages to promote Trump, giving the public more than a few opportunities to see him act strangely.

There are just way too many odd events to count, from Musk's bizarre jumping at a Trump rally in the summer of 2024 to Musk's Nazi-style salutes on the day of Trump's inauguration to his erratic chainsaw stunt at CPAC in February. Then there was Musk's farewell in the Oval Office, where he kept spinning his head around and gazing into the distance as Trump was talking. It wasn't the first time he'd done that in recent months.

But who knows? The defense from Musk fans is often that he's on the autism spectrum and comes across awkwardly. That could very well be true. But it seems like most people have someone with autism in their lives who doesn't act as erratically and unhinged as Musk.

Man given restraining order in Dubai on ticket waiting list

All England Club employ fixated threat specialists

Emma Raducanu's stalker has been blocked from buying tickets for this month's Wimbledon Championships in the public ballot, it has emerged.

Security staff at the All England Club discovered that the man, who has never been named, was on the waiting list when they did a re-sweep of the ballot, after he was given a restraining order in Dubai in February.

The authorities in Dubai acted after the British No 1 was forced to hide in tears behind the umpire's chair when the “fixated” admirer was removed from the stands and detained by police during her second-round match against Karolina Muchova.

The previous day the man had given Raducanu a letter and asked for a photograph in a coffee shop. The 22-year-old had also been aware of his presence at tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha in preceding weeks.

Speaking after the incident, Raducanu told reporters: “I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, ‘I don't know how I'm going to finish'. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, ‘I need to just take a breather.' I'm always with someone and always being watched.”

Raducanu, who shot to global fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021, said that her behaviour had changed since the incident in Dubai.

“I'm obviously wary when I go out,” she said. “I try not to be careless about it because you only realise how much of a problem it is when you're in that situation and I don't necessarily want to be in that situation again.”

Raducanu has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home.

On Tuesday, Britain's No 2, Katie Boulter, said that she had received abuse and death threats on social media and had been followed around London by an unknown vehicle.

Sally Bolton, chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, said that security measures would be tight at Wimbledon this year.

“We're liaising with the tours, with the Met Police, with other security agencies right through the year to think about the types of risks we need to look at and adjusting what we put in place,” she said.

“I would say to them [players] they should have confidence when they're here and if they are concerned on any basis they should come and talk to us about that because we can put bespoke arrangements in place.”

Brad Pitt reflected on the process of making F1 The Movie during its New York premiere on Monday night, with the actor hailing it as “an experience I will never forget”.

Brad Pitt has praised the Formula 1 drivers and teams for being a “big part” of creating F1 The Movie, with the actor hailing those involved for making the process an “experience I will never forget”.

Ahead of its release internationally on June 25 and a North America launch on June 27, the film held its official premiere in New York on Monday where Pitt joined his co-stars – along with drivers and a host of celebrities – on the red carpet.

Directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Pitt and seven-time F1 World Champion Lewis Hamilton, the movie sees Pitt play Sonny Hayes, a former F1 driver who makes his comeback at the fictional APXGP team to partner rookie team mate Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris).

With the action being filmed during real-life Grand Prix weekends, Pitt hailed the participation of those in the paddock as he reflected on the experience of filming the motion picture during Monday's premiere.

“The teams and the drivers, everyone opened their doors for us and [they] are a big part of this movie,” Pitt explained on the red carpet. “[They] let us in in a way that I would never have expected. [It was] just an experience I will never forget.”

Pitt also reflected on the challenge of creating the film's plotline in order to strike a balance for both new and existing fans of the sport.

“The hardest thing was to develop a story,” the actor said. “The sport is so revered and there's so many people that are quite knowledgeable about it, and then there's so many people who haven't seen it yet.

“And to try to thread this needle where we're not dumbing it down to those in the know, but it's an invitation and explanation for those who have not been around this sport before, was really the most difficult thing of it all, and I think we did a pretty damn good job.”

The film previously earned praise from the drivers and team bosses for how the sport was portrayed when they attended a private screening of F1 The Movie in Monaco last month.

Haas' Esteban Ocon felt that it was “the best movie of racing that I've seen”, while Alpine's Pierre Gasly said that “it's a real dive into our world of Formula 1 for us as drivers but also all the people evolving around Formula 1”.

The Beatles legend was apparently not pleased that the group sacked his son not once, but twice.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Zak Starkey isn't the only one who has had enough of The Who. In a new Rolling Stone interview posted on Monday (June 16) the veteran session and touring drummer who was fired, rehired and then fired once more by The Who in a head-spinning span of several weeks earlier this year opened up about his current relationship with the band and how his dad feels about the tabloid tussle.

	











	Asked what his father, former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr, thought of the bizarre back-and-forth, Starkey said, “He [Ringo] said, ‘I've never liked the way that little man runs that band,'” in seeming reference to The Who singer Roger Daltrey.




			Trending on Billboard		







	After The Who “made a collective decision” to part ways with Starkey in April after his nearly 30 years behind the kit, guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend relented a few days later and rescinded the firing, saying Starkey was “not being asked” to step down from his position. Then, a month later, Townshend took it all back and said after many years working together “the time has come for a change.” A week later, Starkey claimed that he hadn't been “fired” from the band, but had “‘retired' to work [on] my own projects.”


	It has all been a bit hard to keep up with, even for Starkey, who revealed to RS that even after all the firings and re-hirings he still has no idea where he stands. “I spoke to Roger last week,” Starkey told the magazine. “He said, ‘Don't take your drums out of the warehouse, we might be calling you.' What the f–k? These guys are f–kin' insane! I've been fired more times than [late Who drummer] Keith Moon in ten days.”

	











	It's all a bit unclear at this point, especially since The Who recently announced that Scott Devours, a veteran of Daltrey's solo band, will join them on their upcoming farewell tour. In the interview, Starkey once again noted that he had to sit out Oasis‘ eagerly anticipated reunion shows this summer because of his gig in The Who.


	“I was in the Who. And last time they asked me, I was in the Who, and it got a bit weird,” he said of whether he'd hoped Oasis' Liam and Noel Gallagher would invite him back into the fold of the Britpop band he kept time for from 2004-2008. “But this time, I talked to them both. I did tell them both on text, ‘Why the f–k aren't I in your band, man, helping make it the greatest rock band in the world again?”


	Starkey said the Gallagher's again noted that he couldn't join their band because of his gig in The Who, plus singer Liam is “happy working with Joey [Waronker],” the session and live veteran drummer who will be behind the kit for the band's first tour in 16 years.


	Frankly, Starkey said being in the Who sometimes kept him off-kilter. As an example, he described the rehearsals for the Royal Albert Hall gigs in March at which Daltrey apparently took issue with his playing, reportedly complaining from the stage that Starkey's loud drumming was throwing his vocals off. 


	“There's nothing normal about them. These are the most crazy… you've got an abstract, conceptualist artist who thinks the band is an art installation. And then you've got another guy who is a street fighter. It's all very weird,” he said, respectively, of Townshend and Daltrey. “But if you look at the group ever since they started, it's the craziest group. And they've undertaken the crazy ideas, whether the rest of the guys understood it or not. Pete has taken so much on himself. He'll lock himself away for two years, come away with Quadrophenia, and go, ‘You guys can just play on top.' You're dealing with two very, very different people. And when me and Pete catch fire, probably anyone's going to get lost. And probably anyone will. But we won't. When we're onstage, it's like we're f–king. Offstage it can be a little awkward after those 15 minutes. But onstage, It's like, ‘Cigarette, darling?'”

	











	And, for the record, Starkey claimed that it was Daltrey who came in “four bars early” during the Royal Albert Hall shows, after which the drummer sent the singer an e-mail, writing, “I watched you on TV last night, you were off.” 


	“It's 30 years in the group. It's like a family. But he came in four bars early. And he just asked for the drums to be turned up, and he couldn't hear the piano,” Starkey said of Daltrey. “But I love Roger. He never misses a note. His voice is still so pure. It's like a laser beam. He always nails it. They've not changed one key since the start of conceptual art as rock & roll. But he just got lost. He blamed it on the drums being too loud, and then it got made into this huge social media thing. And it freaked him out and he's going around doing solo shows, and saying it's ‘fake news.' But it wasn't me. I was in the car and gone before they finished the last acoustic song. There was no argument in the dressing room.”


	Starkey said he was fired two weeks later for dropping “two beats,” though he noted, “I've watched that film three times. I'm looking on the floor, and I can't see it. If I drop two beats, where the f–k are they?” In the end, Starkey said he doesn't blame Daltrey, or anyone from The Who, for what happened. “I don't hold any grudges. It's the Who. Weirder s–t than this has gone down,” he said. “I've heard them say weirder s–t than this. It's the Who — the maddest band there's ever been.”


	But would he come back if they re-re-rehired him? 


	“Of course I would. I said to Pete, ‘Thirty years. In the 30 years, you put the bar so f–kin' high. What the f–k do I do now?,'” he said. “The Who, you just don't know what's going to happen. If you think something is going to happen, the opposite happens. If you second guess Pete, he will play the opposite. You have to go with whatever you're doing, and not think.”
