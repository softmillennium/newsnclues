                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was looking for something “better than a ceasefire” in the escalating Iran-Israel conflict. Asked by a reporter aboard Air Force One what specifically he hoped to achieve, Trump responded: “An end. Long lines could be seen at gas stations, and traffic stood bumper to bumper on roads heading out of the city. Smoke could be seen over the Tel Aviv skyline on Tuesday, amid reports of more Iranian strikes.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel claimed Tuesday to have killed a top Iranian general as it traded more strikes with its longtime foe, and U.S. President Donald Trump warned residents of Tehran to evacuate while demanding that Iran surrender without conditions. Trump left the Group of Seven summit in Canada a day early to deal with the conflict between Israel and Iran, telling reporters on Air Force One during the flight back to Washington: “I'm not looking at a ceasefire. President Donald Trump boards Air Force One at Calgary International Airport, Monday, June 16, 2025, in Calgary, Canada, on his way back to Washington. Later, he warned Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that the U.S. knows where he is hiding and called for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.” Iran offered no immediate response to the president's posts, but the country's military leaders vowed that Israel would soon see more attacks. Residents of Tehran fled their homes in droves, and the U.N. nuclear watchdog for the first time said Israeli strikes on Iran's main uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz had also damaged its main underground section, not just an above-ground facility, as previously acknowledged. The strikes have killed at least 224 people in Iran. Iran has retaliated by launching some 400 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. The Israeli military claimed to have killed another top Iranian general in a strike on Tehran. Iran did not immediately comment on the reported killing of Gen. Ali Shadmani, whom Israel described as the most senior military commander in Iran. Shadmani was little-known in the country before being appointed last week to a chief-of-staff-like role as head of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters. That appointment followed the killing of his predecessor, Gen. Gholam Ali Rashid, in an Israeli strike. The Israeli military warned the population to stay close to shelters as Iran fired new salvos of missiles, but officials said most were intercepted. Sirens blared in southern Israel, including in the desert town of Dimona, the heart of Israel's never-acknowledged nuclear arms program. Iran has fired fewer missiles in each of its barrages, with just a handful launched late Tuesday. Gen. Effie Defrin announced a new wave of strikes on Iran on Tuesday evening as explosions and anti-aircraft fire boomed throughout Tehran, shaking buildings across the capital. The Israeli military said its warplanes had targeted 12 missile launch sites and storage facilities. Shops remain shuttered Tehran's historic Grand Bazaar, Monday, June 16, 2025. Echoing an earlier Israeli military call for some 330,000 residents of a neighborhood in downtown Tehran to evacuate, Trump warned on social media that “everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran.” Asked why he had urged the evacuation of Tehran, Trump said: “I just want people to be safe.” Many middle- and upper-class Iranians were headed to the Caspian Sea, a popular getaway spot. Phone and internet service was disrupted, with landline phones unable to receive or dial international calls. Iran, which has crippled important communications tools in past nationwide protests and during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, did not acknowledge any restrictions. International websites appeared to be blocked, but local websites were functioning, likely signaling that Iran had turned on the so-called “halal net,” its own locally controlled version of the internet aimed at restricting what the public can see. In a statement, WhatsApp said it was concerned that “these false reports will be an excuse for our services to be blocked at a time when people need them the most.” The International Atomic Energy Agency said Tuesday that it believed that Israel's first aerial attacks on Iran's Natanz enrichment site had directly affected the facility's underground centrifuge facility. Satellite imagery collected after Friday's attacks showed “additional elements that indicate direct impacts on the underground enrichment halls,” the watchdog said. Located 220 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of Tehran, the Natanz facility was fortified by anti-aircraft batteries, fencing and Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. The IAEA earlier reported that Israeli strikes had destroyed an above-ground enrichment hall at Natanz and knocked out electrical equipment that powered the facility. However, most of Iran's enrichment takes place underground to protect from airstrikes. Israel has struck Natanz repeatedly and claims to have hurt its underground facilities, which experts assess contain 10,000 centrifuges that enrich uranium up to 60%. Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful, and the U.S. and others have assessed that Tehran has not had an organized effort to pursue a nuclear weapon since 2003. But the IAEA has repeatedly warned that the country has enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs should it choose to do so. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Monday that Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear sites have set the country's nuclear program back a “very, very long time,” Israel has not been able to reach Iran's Fordo uranium enrichment facility, which is built deep into a mountainside. The 30,000-pound (14,000-kilogram) GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator uses its weight and sheer kinetic force to reach deeply buried targets. French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that discussions were underway on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but Trump shot that down in his comments on social media. He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire.</p>

Republican Senator Jim Banks explains why Indiana Fever fans deserve an apology after the league's latest investigation during an appearance on OutKick's "Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich." Angel Reese is turning an insult into a positive. Reese, of course, is a rebounding machine, setting the single-season record last year before an injury cut her season short — that record was then surpassed by A'ja Wilson. But many of her rebounds have come from the offensive side, stemming from her own missed shots. Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese grabs a rebound against the New York Liberty during the first half at Wintrust Arena. Because of this, a viral TikTok user coined the term "mebounds," for when Reese grabs a rebound off her own miss. The trademark would be for hats, T-shirts and sweatshirts. Reese even addressed the term in one of her latest TikTok videos. Like, when y'all have to alter my face and s--- because I'm cute, all right, whatever. But when y'all came up with ‘mebounds,' because statistically, all the rebounds that I get aren't always just mine. They're, like, the defenses, too, or somebody else on my team. In a recent contest, Reese grabbed five offensive rebounds in a 19-second span, four of which came off her own shots. Reese currently leads the WNBA with 11.9 rebounds per game — 4.8 of those are offensive, which is also a WNBA high. She is shooting 35.7% from the floor in 10 games played this season. She ranks third in defensive rebounds per game with 7.1. The 23-year-old recently recorded her first triple-double, scoring 11 points, grabbing 13 boards, and handing out 11 assists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is growing increasingly warm to using US military assets to strike Iranian nuclear facilities and souring on the idea of a diplomatic solution to end Tehran's escalating conflict with Israel, two officials familiar with the ongoing discussions told CNN. The new, more hawkish posture represents a significant shift in Trump's thinking, though the sources said Trump remains open to a diplomatic solution — if Iran makes significant concessions. But Trump signaled early Tuesday his patience for diplomacy was wearing thin. “I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One returning early from the Group of 7 summit in Canada. live updates Israel and Iran trade strikes on fifth day of conflict He later doubled down on Truth Social, calling for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” and asserting that the US knew the location of Iran's supreme leader – even though it would not kill him “for now.” More broadly, however, the tankers have been moved in order to give Trump and US Central Command “options” should things escalate, one of the sources said. Trump was meeting Tuesday with members of his national security team in the White House Situation Room. Israel has been pressing Trump to become more involved in its campaign to dismantle Iran's nuclear facilities, which top officials from the country have said would require American weapons and planes. Until Tuesday, the president had offered little clarity on whether he would accede to Israel's pressure, which has been countered by loud voices within his own party encouraging him to avoid getting dragged into another foreign conflict. Trump had been wary of ordering the US to engage directly on behalf of the Israelis, beyond providing defensive support to intercept Iranian missiles and US intelligence. But in a string of social media posts Tuesday, Trump sounded increasingly combative and used the word “we” to describe military action in Iran. “We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,” he wrote. In a separate post, Trump also used “we” to describe information pinpointing the location of Iran's supreme leader. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding. Related article Israel says Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon. Everyone is working,” said a regional diplomat familiar with the administration's outreach in recent days. But those efforts on Tuesday morning had not delivered a breakthrough. Iran's Foreign Ministry told CNN on Tuesday that it know nothing about planned talks in the coming days. Trump administration officials have been closely monitoring private and public communications from Israel regarding its plans to escalate offensive attacks on Iran in the next few days. An official said those signals were a driving force behind Trump's Monday directive for residents of Tehran to evacuate. In his message Tuesday, Vance sought to address concerns from members of Trump's own base of supporters about the potential for an escalating conflict that draws the US closer to war. “And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy,” Vance wrote, getting at the divide emerging among conservatives over whether to aid Israel in its goal of wiping out Iran's nuclear capabilities or to avoid dragging the US into another foreign war. In a private phone call Monday, Sen. Lindsey Graham personally urged Trump to go “all in” to end Iran's nuclear program, including using the might of the US military. Four presidents have promised that they won't get a nuclear weapon on your watch. You can fulfill that promise,” the South Carolina Republican said a day afterward. If we need to fly with Israel, so be it. The consequences of not getting this right are enormous,” Graham told reporters. Related article Built inside a mountain and hardened against bunker-busting bombs. A White House official said Trump understands both sides of that argument. Upon arriving back at the White House on Tuesday morning, Trump posted a message he'd received from his ambassador in Israel, Mike Huckabee, acknowledging the president had “many voices speaking to you” but encouraging him to be open to divine intervention. “I believe you will hear from heaven and that voice is far more important than mine or ANYONE else's,” Huckabee wrote. Trump has said previously that Iran must abandon its nuclear program, and alleged Tuesday that Iran was “very close” to developing a nuclear weapon, despite assessments from his own intelligence chiefs that such an outcome was not imminent. Asked on Air Force One whether there's any guarantee that US bombs could actually reach underground Iranian nuclear bunkers and destroy them, Trump said, “There's no guarantee in anything.” And he issued a warning to Iran that targeting American troops in the region would lead to a dramatic escalation in the conflict. “We'll come down so hard, it'd be gloves off,” he said.

PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan announced on Tuesday that he is leaving the tour, and Tiger Woods seems excited about the future. Monahan will leave the tour next year, and top NFL executive Brian Rolapp was announced as the PGA Tour's CEO. Golf has one of the deepest histories and many of the most timeless traditions in all of sports," Rolapp said in an open letter posted on social media. My goal as CEO is to honor golf's traditions but not be overly bound by them." PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, left, congratulates Tiger Woods after the final round of the TOUR Championship at East Lake Golf Club on Sept. 23, 2018 in Atlanta. Woods posted on X, thanking Monahan for his service to the tour and congratulating the new CEO. "Congrats to Brian on becoming CEO of the PGA TOUR. I'm excited about where the TOUR is headed. "His arrival strengthens our leadership team and reflects our shared commitment to the TOUR's continued evolution. With Brian's expertise and vision, and the trust we've established with our players and fans, I'm more confident than ever in the future we're building." Jay Monahan, commissioner of the PGA Tour, speaks to the media in a press conference prior to The Players Championship on The Players Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass on March 7, 2023 in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Monahan will shift his day-to-day responsibilities to Rolapp and focus more on his position on the PGA Tour board, along with the commercial PGA Tour Enterprises board, through 2026. But there's still significant work to do and incredible opportunity remains ahead. From creating the highest quality golf product that includes the best players in the world, to strengthening commercial partnerships - as I spoke to players, board member, and fans in recent months, I felt drawn to this potential," Rolapp said. NFL executive vice president and chief of media and business officer Brian Rolapp speaks to the media during the annual league meetings at the JW Marriott. Monahan's announcement comes amid continued negotiations with the Public Investment Fund and LIV Golf, which were unearthed over two years ago. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Marty Makary speaks during a news conference at the Hubert Humphrey Building Auditorium in Washington, April 22, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. regulators will begin offering faster reviews to new medicines that administration officials deem as promoting “the health interests of Americans,” under a new initiative announced Tuesday. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency will aim to review select drugs in one to two months. FDA's long-standing accelerated approval program generally issues decisions in six months for drugs that treat life-threatening diseases. Since arriving at the FDA in April, Makary has repeatedly told FDA staff they need to “challenge assumptions” and rethink procedures. In a medical journal commentary published last week, Makary suggested the agency could conduct “rapid or instant reviews,” pointing to the truncated process used to authorize the first COVID-19 vaccines under Operation Warp Speed. Speeding up drug approvals has long been a priority of the pharmaceutical industry, which has successfully lobbied Congress to create a variety of special programs and pathways for faster reviews. Many aspects of the plan announced Tuesday overlap with older programs. But the broad criteria for receiving a voucher will give FDA officials unprecedented discretion in deciding which companies can benefit from the fastest reviews. “The ultimate goal is to bring more cures and meaningful treatments to the American public,” Makary said in a statement. Makary previously said the FDA should be willing to ease its scientific requirements for certain drugs, for instance, by not always requiring randomized studies in which patients are tracked over time to track safety and effectiveness. Such trials are generally considered the gold standard of medical research, though the FDA has increasingly been willing to accept smaller, less-definitive studies for rare or life-threatening diseases. In several recent cases, the FDA has faced criticism for approving drugs based on preliminary data that didn't ultimately show benefits for patients. The push to rapidly accelerated drug approvals is the opposite approach that Makary and his boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have taken on vaccines. Kennedy and Makary also have announced a stricter policy on seasonal updates to COVID-19 shots, saying they will have to undergo new testing before they can be approved for use in healthy children and most adults.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was looking for something “better than a ceasefire” in the escalating Iran-Israel conflict. Asked by a reporter aboard Air Force One what specifically he hoped to achieve, Trump responded: “An end. President Donald Trump said Tuesday the U.S. knows where Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is hiding during the Israel-Iran conflict but doesn't want him killed “for now.” Trump urged, in a social media posting, Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” as the five-day conflict continues to escalate. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump added. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. New York City comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by federal agents at an immigration court Tuesday as he was trying to accompany a person out of a courtroom. Lander had spent the morning observing immigration court hearings and told an AP reporter that he was there to “accompany” some immigrants out of the building. In the moments before Lander was handcuffed, agents could be seen trying to physically separate Lander from the man they had come to detain. ▶ Read more about the arrest of Brad Lander This photo released by an official website of the office of the Iranian supreme leader, shows Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a televised speech, under a portrait of the late revolutionary founder Ayatollah Khomeini, Friday, June 13, 2025. Trump said Tuesday the U.S. knows where Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is hiding during the Israel-Iran conflict but doesn't want him killed “for now.” Trump urged, in a social media posting, Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” as the five-day conflict continues to escalate. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump added. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Prominent Trump supporters, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and conservative pundit Tucker Carlson have raised concerns about how far the president should go in backing Israel after vowing during his campaign to keep the U.S. out of expensive and endless wars. In a Tuesday posting on X, Vance said he wanted to address “a lot of crazy stuff on social media” about Trump's approach to Iran. Vance made the case that Trump has been consistent that “Iran cannot have uranium enrichment” and has said “repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways — the easy way or the ‘other' way.” That decision ultimately belongs to the president,” Vance added. “And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release that Senate Republican proposals for the tax cuts bill “will deliver the permanence and certainty both individual taxpayers and businesses alike are looking for, driving growth and unleashing the American economy.” Senate Republicans on Monday proposed steeper Medicaid cuts, new work requirements for parents of teens and keeping in place the current $10,000 deduction of state and local taxes, called SALT, to offset the costs of making Trump's tax breaks permanent. President Donald Trump drops papers as he meets with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer on the sidelines of the G7 Summit, Monday, June 16, 2025, in Kananaskis, Canada. Starmer said he had no choice, since anyone else trying to help risked being shot by the president's security team. “There were quite strict rules about who can get close to the president,” Starmer told reporters Tuesday. President Donald Trump meets with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer on the sidelines of the G7 Summit, Monday, June 16, 2025, in Kananaskis, Canada. That comes after Trump on social media urged the 9.5 million residents of Tehran to leave. “Throughout the dinner yesterday I was sitting right next to President Trump, so I've no doubt, in my mind, the level of agreement there was in relation to the words that were then issued immediately after that,” Starmer said. To answer this, we asked AP White House Reporter Aamer Madhani. That 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, was brokered by the Obama administration before being abandoned by Trump in 2018. It included caps on enrichment, how much material Iran can stockpile and limits the operation of advanced centrifuges needed to enrich. “They don't need to enrich past 3.67%,” Witkoff said in an April Fox News interview. “Plaintiffs have now received the relief they sought in their Complaint because Defendants have taken extraordinary steps and have facilitated, and indeed effectuated, Abrego Garcia's return,” U.S. attorneys wrote in a filing Monday. His deportation violated a U.S. immigration judge's order in 2019 that barred him from being sent to El Salvador because he faced a credible threat of violence from local gangs there. The U.S. returned Abrego Garcia earlier this month to face federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee, where he remains in custody. He opens by referencing last year's attempted assassination of Trump in Pennsylvania, saying Trump was spared by God to be the “most consequential President in a century – maybe ever.” Not since Truman in 1945.” That's a reference to President Harry Truman's decision to drop an atomic bomb on Japan during World War II. Trump returned to Washington early Tuesday after leaving an international summit a day ahead of schedule because of the Israel-Iran conflict.

Back in March, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers U.S. spy agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon. When asked about the comment aboard Air Force One, Trump dismissed her remark. “I think they were very close to having it.” Trump had signed an order in early April to keep TikTok running for another 75 days after a potential deal to sell the popular video sharing app to American owners was put on ice. “Probably yeah, yeah,” he responded when asked by reporters on Air Force One whether the deadline would be extended again. I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.” He indicated in an interview last month with NBC that he would be open to pushing back the deadline again. Trump bristled when asked about some of his MAGA faithful, including conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who've suggested further U.S. involvement would be a betrayal to supporters who were drawn to his promise to end U.S. involvement in expensive and endless wars. “Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,' IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON! Other prominent Trump supporters have also raised concerns about how far the president should go in backing Israel. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk are among prominent Trump World allies who've noted that voters backed Trump because he promised not to entangle the nation in foreign clashes and to be wary of expanding U.S. involvement in the Mideast conflict. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt listens while flying aboard Air Force One en route from Calgary, Canada to Joint Base Andrews, Md., late Monday, June 16, 2025. The president said he won't call Walz after the targeted shootings of two state lawmakers because it would “waste time.” One of the lawmakers and her husband were killed. The Republican president spoke to reporters early Tuesday aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington after abruptly leaving an international summit in Canada because of rising tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. Asked if he planned to call Walz, Trump said the Democratic governor is “slick” and “whacked out” and said, “I'm not calling him.” Tim Walz speaks during a press conference at the State Emergency Operations Center on Sunday, June 15, 2025, in Blaine, Minn., following the arrest of Vance Luther Boelter in Sibley County. Trump added, “The guy doesn't have a clue. So, you know, I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?” If the U.S. decides to support Israel more directly in its attack on Iran, one option for Washington would be to provide the “bunker-buster” bombs believed necessary to significantly damage the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, built deeply into a mountain. Such a bomb would have to be dropped from an American aircraft, which could have wide-ranging ramifications, including jeopardizing any chance of Iran engaging in Trump's desired talks on its nuclear program.

Such a bomb would have to be dropped from an American aircraft, which could have wide-ranging ramifications, including jeopardizing any chance of Iran engaging in Trump's desired talks on its nuclear program. Israeli officials have also suggested that there are other options for it to attack Fordo as it seeks to destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities. The bomb is believed to be able to penetrate about 200 feet (61 meters) below the surface before exploding, and the bombs can be dropped one after another, effectively drilling deeper and deeper with each successive blast. A federal appeals court in San Francisco is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday on whether the Trump administration should return control of National Guard troops to California after they were deployed following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids. The three-judge panel is set to hear oral arguments via video starting at 3 p.m. ET, and protests outside the downtown San Francisco court are expected. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco ruled last week that the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said it was “entirely positive” that President Donald Trump was to leave the Group of Seven summit a day early, as efforts to de-escalate the conflict between Israel and Iran continued.

But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. The comments about Khamenei and calls for surrender came shortly after Trump in a separate posting touted complete control of the skies over Tehran. Israel, with five days of missile strikes, has done considerable damage to Iran and believes it can now deal a permanent blow to Tehran's nuclear program — particularly if it gets a little more help from the Republican president. But deepening American involvement, perhaps by providing the Israelis with bunker-busting bombs to penetrate Iranian nuclear sites built deep underground or offering other direct U.S. military support, comes with enormous political risk for Trump. He said he was now looking for “a real end” to the conflict and a “complete give-up” of Tehran's nuclear program. I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.” Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, and U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran is not actively pursuing a bomb. “Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” he wrote on social media. Asked about his evacuation comment aboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters: “I just want people to be safe.” Trump said he wasn't ruling out a diplomatic option and he could send Vice President JD Vance and special envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with the Iranians. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters while flying aboard Air Force One en route from Calgary, Canada to Joint Base Andrews, Md., late Monday, June 16, 2025. He also dismissed congressional testimony from National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, who told lawmakers in March that U.S. spy agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon. “I think they were very close to having it.” The Israelis say their offensive has eviscerated Iran's air defenses and they can now strike targets across the country at will. So far, Israel has targeted multiple Iranian nuclear program sites but has not been able to destroy Iran's Fordo uranium enrichment facility. Israel's own defenses remain largely intact in the face of Iran's retaliatory strikes, but some of Tehran's missiles are getting through and having deadly impact. The White House dispatched Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for a prime-time TV appearance as speculation grows about whether Trump could be tilting toward more direct U.S. involvement.

Instead, he continued to press Iran on negotiations over its nuclear program. “They should talk, and they should talk immediately,” Trump said during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. He added, “I'd say Iran is not winning this war.” Iranian protesters chant slogans as one of them holds up a poster of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an anti-Israeli gathering in Tehran, Iran, Friday, June 13, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks with reporters while flying aboard Air Force One en route from Calgary, Canada to Joint Base Andrews, Md., late Monday, June 16, 2025. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard departs following a closed door meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at Malacanang Palace in Manila, Philippines Monday, June 2, 2025. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters while flying aboard Air Force One en route from Calgary, Canada to Joint Base Andrews, Md., late Monday, June 16, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — Tulsi Gabbard left no doubt when she testified to Congress about Iran's nuclear program earlier this year. But President Donald Trump dismissed the assessment of U.S. spy agencies during an overnight flight back to Washington as he cut short his trip to the Group of Seven summit to focus on the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. “I don't care what she said,” Trump told reporters. In his view, Iran was “very close” to having a nuclear bomb. Trump's statement aligned him with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described a nuclear-armed Iran as an imminent threat, rather than with his own top intelligence adviser. Trump was expected to meet with national security officials in the Situation Room on Tuesday as he plans next steps. In her March testimony to lawmakers, Gabbard said the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.” She also said the U.S. was closely monitoring Iran's nuclear program, noting that the country's “enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.” The latest break over Iran was striking because Trump has staffed his second administration with loyalists rather than establishment figures. Gabbard, a military veteran and former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, was narrowly confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate because of her scant experience with intelligence or managing sprawling organizations. Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2022 and endorsed Trump in last year's election, is expected to testify Tuesday in a closed session on Capitol Hill, along with CIA Director John Ratcliffe, during a previously scheduled budget hearing. Both officials likely would face questions about their views on Iran and Trump's latest statements. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly warned that Iran has enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs should it choose to do so.

However, an intelligence assessment in April found no evidence of that. “President Trump took necessary and historic action to safeguard our nation when he deported these violent Tren de Aragua terrorists,” the statement said. “Now that America is safer without these terrorists in our cities, deep state actors have resorted to using their propaganda arm to attack the President's successful policies.”</p>

Constitutional law attorney Jonathan Turley discusses President Donald Trump's directive for ICE to ramp up deportations and prioritize sanctuary cities. Gavin Newsom appeared to take a personal affront to the Trump administration considering the rescission of national monument status from two natural areas in the Golden State enshrined into protection by former President Joe Biden. Grow up," Newsom said in response to news that Trump might abolish the Chuckwalla and Sattitla Highlands National Monuments, the former of which is close to the extant Joshua Tree National Monument. "If it's a day ending in Y, it's another day of Trump's war on California," Newsom's office said in a separate X post. The Trump Justice Department issued a memo ruling that the president's power is reversible by future administrations and offered examples of similar actions. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., continue their feud over the response to the LA riots, with Newsom most recently accusing Trump of being "not all there." That decision nullified former Attorney General Homer Cummings' 1938 assertion that presidents could not abolish such areas of protection. The administration expressed concern that enshrining such large areas of land under federal control would prevent them from being able to be developed for economically beneficial purposes in the future – a claim conversely derided by environmentalists. The Justice Department opined that "revocation of prior monument designations" can be found to either never have been or no longer deserving of protection under the Antiquities Act of 1906, according to the Washington Post. Previously, Chief Justice John Roberts gave his blessing to cases challenging the usage of the Antiquities Act in prohibiting economic activities on federal lands and seabeds, the Post reported. On Monday, Newsom further mocked the Trumps, presenting a faux advertisement tagline for podcaster Benny Arthur Johnson's interview with Donald Trump Jr. on the idea that border czar Tom Homan could arrest the governor for "working against ICE and [its] deportations." "Promo code ARREST for 15% off your Trump Phone," Newsom quipped on X. The governor also claimed a social media post by Trump expressed the notion of seeking to incite violence in Democrat-run states and use it as a proxy to "militarize our cities." He also slammed House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., for telling him to focus on "lawlessness and crime" in San Francisco and Los Angeles. "California's Green New Scam energy policies are a disaster for the state. Their energy shortages, outrageous energy prices, and continued assault on American energy have hurt Californians and enriched the Democrats' donors while selling out the citizens of the Golden State," White House spokesman Harrison Fields said of Newsom's barbs. "Freeing up federal lands in an effort to secure American energy dominance is not petty. We wouldn't expect Gavin to understand adult decisions that help his state, considering his legacy of failure." Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Joy Taylor shares her take on the biggest winner of Aaron Rodgers' signing, explaining why she believes Rodgers himself came out on top—because he still gets to play. The reaction was a bit more mixed than supportive. The Steelers have had five different quarterbacks start games for them since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season, and Rodgers was not exactly in MVP form when he signed with the New York Jets in 2023. While one former general manager claimed Rodgers would be "irrelevant" by Thanksgiving, Super Bowl champion Joe Theismann took a more optimistic approach when he spoke to Fox News Digital as he prepared for the American Century Championship golf tournament next month. "Remember the offenses Aaron has been in up until this year he basically controlled," Theismann said. Now, this is why I think he is going to be successful, now he just gets to play quarterback. "He doesn't have to be assistant general manager. He doesn't have to worry about personnel. The only thing he needs to worry about is being able to run this offense, nothing else. So, from my perspective, I think it takes a burden off him to be honest with you. And instead of trying to make a team better, just be part of a team and do your part to make it better." Additionally, the Mike Tomlin-led Steelers have always been well-coached. Rodgers had 3,897 passing yards, 28 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions in his first season coming off of his Achilles tear. After starting 2-1, New York fell five straight times. Pittsburgh did make the playoffs at 10-7, and it will certainly be interesting to see how they do with Rodgers under center. Fox News' Connor McGahan contributed to this report.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. The LPGA Tour is filled with incredible golfers like Nelly Korda, Rose Zhang, Lydia Ko and Jeeno Thitikul to name a few. The average fair-weather golf fan may not be too privy to those names. Instead, they could be more susceptible to following influencers like Paige Spiranac, Grace Charis and Tisha Alyn. Paige Spiranac watches her teammates putt on the No. 6 green during the 2023 Kaulig Companies Championship Pro-Am at Firestone Country Club on Wednesday, July 12, 2023 in Akron, Ohio. While Spiranac may be the most popular with more than 4 million followers on Instagram and another 1.6 million followers on TikTok, Charis and Alyn have built up their own strong following with millions of fans on social media as well. Annika Sorenstam may be the most well-known female golfer of this generation. She won 72 times on the LPGA Tour and had 10 major titles. As Spiranac and other golf influencers have taken a different approach to growing the game, the Swedish golf legend was all for it. Annika Sorenstam walks up to the fourth tee box during the final round of the PNC Championship golf tournament at Ritz-Carlton Golf Club Grande Lakes Orlando Course in Orlando, Florida, on Dec. 18, 2022. "Nowadays, information is shared differently, people get information in different places, so I think it is great. They bring a different view or perspective into the sport. Whether it is fashion or trick shots, I mean they all have a little niche." Sorenstam is set to participate in the American Century Championship at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Club next month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump confirmed he will not call Gov. Four days have passed since Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot. Minnesota Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also seriously injured by the same suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, who was taken into police custody on Sunday. The president had yet to call Walz about the matter, and he said he had no plans to. “I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. Why would I call him?” Trump told a gaggle of press as he boarded Air Force One Tuesday to leave the G7 summit. “I could call him and say, ‘How are you doing?' So I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?” This was a reappointment from former Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016 and was not a political appointment. “Governor Walz wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans, but this tragedy isn't about Trump or Walz. Walz has continued to criticize Trump and is seeking reelection in Minnesota next year. Authorities suspected that Boelter had more targets in his planned attack after police found a list in his car of potential targets, including other politicians and abortion providers. He did not enter a plea during his first court appearance Monday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Libertarian vice presidential nominee Mike ter Maat and dozens of other members of the third party have joined a caucus within the Republican Party, hoping to usher in fiscally conservative policies. Ter Maat, 2024 Libertarian presidential candidate Chase Oliver‘s running mate, left the Libertarian Party with over 40 members who have joined the Republican Liberty Caucus, a political organization working with the national party to promote limited government and free markets. Trump's address to the Libertarian Party was met with loud booing, but he was cheered for pledges to free Ulbricht and pardon the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters — two promises the president has fulfilled since taking office in January. That includes when the party chooses its next standard-bearer, said Joshua Hlavka, the former chairman of the Libertarian Party in Florida and a former adviser for ter Maat in 2024, pointing to the fact that Trump has not thrown his full support behind a successor yet. “Generally speaking, when the guy in power isn't backing anybody, there's going to be a lot of people looking to influence here,” Hlavka said. “I'd like to see somebody who's going to care about issues that I'm worried about: Staying uninvolved in foreign conflicts that don't concern the American people, minimizing our tax burdens out here, protecting individual rights.” “I want to make sure that whoever does follow up behind Trump represents those values, and also the fiscal conservatism that we're looking for here in America,” he continued. Moving into 2026 and 2028, the RLC is hoping to recruit members from across the political spectrum, including Libertarians, Republicans, independents, and even Democrats. Ter Maat told the Washington Examiner that he did not have plans to run for either the GOP nomination or a congressional seat. Massie and Paul have broken with the Republican Party multiple times, most recently over the massive Republican-led tax cut and spending bill to advance Trump's second-term agenda, which Massie voted against on the House floor. The bill, titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has been criticized by fiscal hawks for not cutting spending enough. “I feel like Americans are better served making decisions for their own lives,” Dolby said. Oliver netted less than 1% of the national vote share in 2024. Referring to now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s unsuccessful 2024 independent presidential bid, ter Maat said it was evidence of how the U.S.'s two-party system makes it difficult for any third-party bid to get any traction. “You know, here's a smart, charismatic guy with a good last name and a whole bunch of money behind him, and he still found it difficult, right?” ter Maat said about Kennedy, who also spoke at the Libertarian convention in an attempt to court an endorsement. It's probably going to be hard for a long time.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats are touting former Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who they hope will be a bright spot for the party in the state's gubernatorial election later this year, after months of internal drama and political bruisings from the GOP. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA), who is term-limited, ahead of Tuesday's primary. Polling from the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College last month shows Spanberger with a 17-point lead over Earle-Sears, 43%-26%. “Polls do show that Abigail Spanberger right now looks pretty good in the general election,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington. “The reality of 2025 may very well be that if Spanberger wins, it will be one of the brightest spots for Democrats this year. It's clear that the Virginia Democratic Party is more energized than the national Democratic Party, which continues to seem to struggle with questions of identity.” Democrats have struggled to find a consistent message against President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. Kathy Hochul (D-NY), JB Pritzker (D-IL), and Tim Walz (D-MN) sparred with House Republicans over immigration during a congressional hearing last week. “Virginians know that Abigail has a record of bringing people together and getting things done,” Spanberger spokeswoman Libby Wiet said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “We have both New Jersey and Virginia as leans democratic,” said J. Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, about the two gubernatorial races this year. “That said to kind of maybe split hairs a little, I wouldn't be surprised if Virginia ends up a bigger win for the Democrats.” Youngkin capitalized on his conventional standard in 2021 when he defeated former Democratic Gov. DGA leaders claimed that Spanberger has the momentum against Earle-Sears during a recent call with reporters, but they are prepared for a competitive race. Farnsworth claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency's cuts to federal workers, who make up a significant portion of Virginia's workforce, will likely help Democrats come November. “Virginia looks a lot like 2017 right now,” he said, referring to just before the 2018 midterms that allowed Democrats to retake the House. The layoffs do not just affect federal workers, Coleman added. “There are whole industries who do work with the federal government, who are facing more uncertainty or possible layoffs, and it's kind of some backlash that we think could probably work in Spanberger's favor, especially because she comes from that world. Wiet said that “Virginians who have lost their jobs, are afraid their jobs will be targeted next, or are worried about Virginia's economic future deserve a Governor who will stand up to the Trump Administration's attacks, not someone whose advice is ‘do not fret' — and Virginia voters trust Abigail to always put Virginia first. That's why she will be elected to serve as the next Governor of Virginia.” “While Democrats pin their hopes on a candidate who has only ever been a part of the problem in Washington, Winsome Earle-Sears is out talking to Virginians about real solutions to real problems,” Earle-Sears spokeswoman Peyton Vogel said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “Winsome has a record of delivering results, and as Governor, she'll continue to build upon the successes of the Youngkin-Sears Administration that has created jobs and put more money back in Virginians' pockets,” Vofel continued. David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, agreed that Spanberger's polling and fundraising figures are in a good spot. “If it's not going to be a very diverse ticket, then the Republicans have that advantage if they choose to use it,” he said. Two Democrats are running in the attorney general primary: former state Del. Jay Jones and Henrico County Commonwealth's Attorney Shannon Taylor. Six candidates are running for lieutenant governor on the Democratic side: Alex Bastani; state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi; Dr. Babur Lateef, chairman of the Prince William County School Board; state Sen. Aaron Rouse; Victor Salgado; and former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney. On the Republican side, Attorney General Jason Miyares is seeking reelection, while John Reid is the only GOP candidate for lieutenant governor. Youngkin previously asked Reid, who is gay, to step away from the ticket after nude photos of men were posted to a social media account affiliated with the candidate. “Actually, as you know, we are all running our campaigns,” Earle-Sears said. The Virginia race likely will not turbocharge until after Labor Day, which Richards said gives the GOP ticket “plenty of time” to decide when to campaign together. “If you check back in in October and they still haven't been onstage together, I'm going to be very concerned,” he said. “But right now, give them some time, they'll figure it out.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not even scheduled to arrive in Canada until Tuesday morning. Trump's early departure upends plans for him to meet with Zelensky and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, in addition to holding a press conference. “President Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer,” she wrote. “Much was accomplished, but because of what's going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.” President Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Much was accomplished, but because of what's going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State. Trump had posted his own cryptic statement on social media earlier in the day, advising the approximately 9.5 million residents of Iran's capital, Tehran, to evacuate. “Iran should have signed the ‘deal' I told them to sign,” he wrote. En route back to his own capital, where he has reportedly asked his National Security Council to be ready for him, Trump posted a sharp critique of French President Emmanuel Macron, too. Macron had indirectly undermined Trump before the G7 summit by stopping in Greenland, which Trump has promised to annex, and expressing his support before traveling on to Canada. He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's order to block incoming foreign students from attending Harvard University will remain on hold temporarily following a hearing Monday, when a lawyer for the Ivy League school said Trump was using its students as “pawns.” US District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston extended a temporary restraining order on Trump's proclamation until June 23 while she weighs Harvard's request for a preliminary injunction. Burroughs made the decision at a hearing over Harvard's request, which Trump's Republican administration opposed. Burroughs granted the initial restraining order June 5, and it had been set to expire Thursday. Attacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months. Trump moved to block foreign students from entering the US to attend Harvard earlier this month, citing concerns over national security. It followed a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard's ability to host foreign students on its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ian Gershengorn, a lawyer for Harvard, told Burroughs on Monday that Trump was “using Harvard's international students as pawns” while arguing the administration has exceeded its authority in an attempt to retaliate against the school for not agreeing to the president's demands. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status. Foreign students were brought into the battle in April, when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short, and on May 22 she revoked Harvard's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. Judge halts Trump's proclamation to suspend new international student visas at Harvard hours after university filed amended lawsuit The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard's students, including two universities in Hong Kong. “The power is within Harvard to fix this,” Davis said, adding that currently the federal government believes “other universities might be better” to host foreign students. Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its “core, legally-protected principles,” even after receiving federal ultimatums.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is under opposing pressure from inside Israel and his own MAGA base as he ponders the most fateful national security decision of either of his presidencies — whether to attempt a killer blow against Iran's nuclear program. Israel is sending clear signals, including through former senior officials, that it hopes the US will ultimately join the conflict and use its unique military edge to destroy the Iranian nuclear complex at Fordow, which is buried deep underground. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, used an ABC News interview Monday to pour cold water on a diplomatic channel with Iran that Trump seems desperate to revive, saying it had been used to “string the US along.” A sense that an entwined political and national security crisis is building was exacerbated by Trump's decision to suddenly leave the G7 summit in western Canada on Monday night. “I have to be back early for obvious reasons,” Trump said. He flies home to Washington as it reverberates with blunt warnings from some of the most influential opinion shapers in MAGA media. Personalities like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson say that a decision to strike Iran would represent a repudiation of his 10-year-old political movement and “America First” principles. ”I don't want the US enmeshed in another Middle East war that doesn't serve our interests,” Carlson said on Bannon's “War Room” show on Monday. Synergy between right and left populist movements in America is also on display. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran as a Democrat primary candidate in the 2016 and 2020 elections, said the US “must not get dragged into another of Netanyahu's wars.” Loud voices opposed to deeper US involvement underscore the painful legacy of the Iraq and Afghan wars, which created political forces that nurtured Trump's populist uprising. Hawks like Sen. Lindsey Graham are trying to convince Trump that Israel's blitz against Iranian air defenses and a confluence of forces that have weakened the regime offer the US a chance to definitively end the nuclear aspirations of its 45-year foe and to transform the Middle East. European leaders who met Trump in Canada brought to bear their own pressure, seeking to see whether the US will rein in Netanyahu amid concern over Trump's suggestion that Russian President Vladimir Putin might join a peace effort. Even Iran joined the cacophony, accusing Israel of sabotaging US nuclear talks with the Islamic Republic, a centerpiece of the president's so far frustrated strategy of branding himself as a global peacemaker. Multiple voices bearing down on Trump reflect the gravity of a decision that will carry consequences that go beyond the always-heavy burden of whether to send American personnel to war. Whatever he decides, Trump will set off consequences that will be pivotal for Israel's security, the wider Middle East, and US power and influence. He can't know whether a US attack on subterranean chambers in Fordow could succeed or whether it will suck the US deeper into a prolonged conflict. Historically, Trump has balked at perceptions that his options are being narrowed — or that others are trying to make up his mind for him. His decision to walk away from a previous US nuclear deal with Iran in his first term delighted Israel — but laid the groundwork for a future crisis. Trump often creates shock and disorientates opponents by igniting confrontations that he later defuses or postpones. But there would be no going back from a US military strike with bunker-busting bombs at Fordow. This may explain why he avoided committing himself to any course of action on Monday. He said Iran has “to make a deal” and should talk immediately “before it is too late.” But pressed by reporters on what would cause a direct US intervention in the conflict, he replied, “I don't want to talk about that.” On Monday evening, the president wrote on Truth Social that “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON” and said everyone should “immediately evacuate Tehran,” although he did not explain why he would issue such a warning. Iran has so far not directly targeted US bases or personnel, nor has it widened the conflict — for instance, by going after shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, which could trigger global economic shockwaves. Another former Israeli defense minister, Benny Gantz, also noted unique US military assets. “I do remember that the United States is much stronger than us. “I am sure that the United States, if it decides to act, will do it for its own interests and not our interests only.” And Netanyahu aimed a message at Trump's MAGA critics. A sincere debate over Iran is underway inside Trump's grassroots movement, and it is causing splits across the right-wing media empires that normally support the president unequivocally. Bannon argued that a major new US escapade in the Middle East would deviate from the core principles of Trumpism, which involved avoiding “forever wars,” expelling undocumented migrants, securing the border and confronting China to bring back US manufacturing jobs. He said on “War Room” that Israel had to make sovereign decisions for itself, as any nation should. “But when you start making decision that are predicated on the assumption that America is going to come in, not just for defense but for offense … No, we have to make decisions that put America first.” Bannon went on: “This has to be thought through. This Pearl Harbor-type attack on the mullahs is fine for Israel. A fundamental question underpins this internal MAGA debate: If “America First” is not about avoiding the kind of Middle East quagmires that that ruined President George W. Bush's Republican presidency, does it really mean anything? Those conflicts started with shock-and-awe initial success like the one Israel is celebrating with its elimination of top Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists. But they degenerated into bloody slogs that still haunt American politics. No one is openly talking of a betrayal yet. But Sanders also seemed to be vying for Trump's attention, warning in a statement, “The attack was specifically designed to sabotage American diplomatic efforts: Israel assassinated the man overseeing Iran's nuclear negotiating team, despite the fact that further talks with the United States were scheduled for Sunday.” An allergy to such foreign entanglements is not just endemic to Trump's political project: His two predecessors, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, felt much the same way.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee on Monday released its proposal for President Donald Trump's agenda bill that calls for enacting sweeping cuts to Medicaid and preventing a multi-trillion dollar tax hike on Americans. But the committee is calling for some notable changes to the package, including lowering the cap on state and local tax deductions, instituting deeper cuts to Medicaid, slowing the elimination of some clean energy tax credits and making permanent several business tax breaks and a beefed-up child tax credit. Senate committees are racing to release their versions of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” in hopes of passing their package next week so the two chambers can work out a final deal and send it to Trump by July 4. But top Senate Republicans are running into some resistance from several key senators about the details of the bill, potentially complicating plans to deliver that package by their own deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson worked out an agreement with GOP lawmakers from high-tax states to raise the cap to $40,000 for those making $500,000 or less. But Senate Republicans have expressed disdain for the deal because of its price tag and because it primarily benefits taxpayers from blue states. Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, issued a stern warning to Senate Republicans earlier on Monday: Any changes to pare back the deal, he said, would cause the bill to collapse in the House. “After engaging in good faith negotiations, we were able to increase the cap on SALT from $10,000 to $40,000,” Lawler said in a statement. “That is the deal, and I will not accept a penny less. And while the Senate committee would keep Trump's campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, it would place caps on that relief –- allowing tipped workers to deduct only up to $25,000 in tip income and limiting the deduction for overtime pay to $12,500 for a single worker. But the Senate measure would provide a more generous deduction for senior citizens than the House bill: $6,000 versus $4,000. In a contentious move, the committee would cap most states' ability to levy provider taxes on certain health care providers – notably, hospitals – to 3.5% by 2031, down from the current 6% limit. However, that provision would only apply to the 40 states and the District of Columbia that have expanded Medicaid to low-income adults. States that have not expanded Medicaid, which are largely GOP-led states, would be restricted from increasing the rate of their current provider taxes, which would not have as sizable an impact. The issue of provider taxes has divided GOP lawmakers, with conservatives arguing that states use these taxes to get more federal Medicaid matching funds, while more moderate members worry that limiting such taxes could hurt hospitals, particularly those in rural areas. States use the revenue they raise from taxing providers to boost provider rates and fund health-related initiatives, among other uses. Also, the Senate would require more parents to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month to maintain their Medicaid benefits. The Senate Finance Committee text would kill a consumer tax credit for electric vehicles and quickly phase out tax credits helping homeowners defray the cost of energy efficient appliances and rooftop solar, ending those by next year. Like the House bill, it hits wind and solar producers particularly hard, phasing out clean energy tax credits for those projects starting next year, with the credit ending by 2028. However, companies generating electricity with zero-emission sources like nuclear, geothermal or hydropower can claim the credit for a longer period of time. The Senate text is more generous than the House when it comes to a tax credit that businesses could claim for battery and clean energy manufacturing, although it eliminates that credit for wind turbine manufacturers by 2027. The text would also terminate a tax credit for companies that make clean hydrogen, something favored by the oil and gas industry. The Senate committee would raise the debt limit by $5 trillion, compared to $4 trillion in the House version, providing more time for Trump to enact his policies without needing to negotiate a deal with Democrats to address the cap. The US hit its roughly $36 trillion debt ceiling in January. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the cap before its August recess to allow the agency to continue paying the nation's bills in full and on time, preventing a default that would likely have catastrophic global economic consequences.
