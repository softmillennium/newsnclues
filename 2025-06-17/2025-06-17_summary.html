US spies have assessed that Iran has not been pursuing a nuclear weapon for over 20 years.

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he doesn't care that his own Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has said that according to the assessment of U.S. intelligence sources, Iran has not been pursuing the development of a nuclear weapon for over two decades — an assessment that undercuts the U.S. and Israel's stated reason for the current attack on Iran.

In March, Gabbard testified that U.S. spy agencies “continu[e] to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon.” She added that “Supreme Leader [Ayatollah Ali] Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.”

However, in an eerie echo of the U.S. propaganda around the Iraq War, on Tuesday, Trump outright dismissed his own government's assessments of Iran's nuclear capabilities. The statement is seemingly made in service of his quest to continue fueling Israel's aggression and ramp up the campaign to pressure Iran to capitulate in talks for a nuclear deal, like the deal Trump himself withdrew from during his first term. 

“I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having one,” Trump said. 

This is, at best, a complete mischaracterization of what intelligence assessments have said and is designed to stoke further violence. 

Officials have found that not only is Iran not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it is also up to three years away from creating a functional one, per CNN. However, that has not stopped U.S. and Israeli officials, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, from warning that Iran is just months away from a nuclear weapon — which they have done for decades now to push for a war with Iran.

In fact, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the U.S. was also unconvinced when Israeli officials, as a justification for the war, recently provided the U.S. with its own supposed intelligence that Iran is conducting research related to building a nuclear bomb.

Trump's dismissal of Gabbard's statements undercuts the idea that the core purpose of Israel's current aggression against Iran is to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, as Netanyahu has dubiously claimed. Notably, Israel is the only country in the Middle East to actually possess nuclear weapons. 

In posts on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump further dispensed with the pretense of negotiations with Iran.

“UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” he posted, shortly after sending another post where he outright threatened to assassinate Khomeini if Iran doesn't capitulate to the U.S.'s demands.

“We don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin,” he said.

Analysts like Iranian writer Trita Parsi have said that the Trump administration's demands in nuclear deal negotiations have always been about laying the groundwork for war. Last month, Parsi pointed out that the U.S.'s demand that Iran completely stop enriching uranium is “unrealistic” and a “fantasy” that, ironically, only allows Iran to take more steps toward obtaining a nuclear weapon in the absence of a deal.

“Over the past two decades, the persistent demand for zero enrichment — an unachievable goal — has only resulted in a larger and more advanced Iranian nuclear program by postponing realistic, enforceable limits on enrichment,” Parsi wrote.

Trump and Netanyahu's fear mongering over Iran's nuclear capabilities is heavily reminiscent of the Bush administration's now infamous lie about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction as a pretense for the U.S.'s disastrous invasion of Iraq.

Nearly 447,000 US kids under 3 were unhoused at last count. Trump's budget bill threatens to make that number skyrocket.

Homelessness among newborns, infants, and toddlers skyrocketed from 2022 to 2023, impacting 446,996 newborns, infants, and toddlers, according to a new report.

SchoolHouse Connection, in partnership with Poverty Solutions at the University of Michigan, found a 23 percent increase in the number of unhoused children under the age of 3 since 2021. Their situations were varied. The report, “Infant and Toddler Homelessness Across 50 States: 2022-2023,” found that some families were staying in temporary shelters or short-term transitional housing, while others were living doubled up with friends or family, camping, or sleeping in cars, abandoned buildings, or bus or train stations.

But as horrendous as these numbers are, unhoused people and their advocates fear that if Donald Trump's big, brutal budget bill gets Senate approval, the situation for unhoused families and those teetering on the edge of economic precarity will soon get significantly worse.

Senior director of Strategic Initiatives and Partnerships at SchoolHouse Connection, Erin Patterson, was one of the authors of the report. She told Truthout that several factors contributed to the 2022-23 spike in unhoused children. “The reason for the increase is no mystery given the lack of affordable housing throughout the country,” Patterson said. “Add in the expiration of the COVID eviction moratorium and the lasting impact of the virus, and a perfect storm of factors impacting low-income families with young children unfolded.”

That perfect storm can have dire consequences.

“Between birth and the age of 3, a child's brain develops faster than at any other time in life,” the report states. “Tragically, an increasing number of infants and toddlers move through these critical years without a safe and stable home, an experience that jeopardizes their healthy development and future.”

Moreover, when pregnancy and homelessness intersect, prenatal care can become inaccessible. According to the National League of Cities, a lack of transportation to see health care providers, coupled with overt and covert discrimination against the unhoused, can mean that treatable pregnancy complications go unnoticed. Unsurprisingly, this increases the odds of preterm deliveries, lower newborn birth weights, and more frequent hospitalizations in neonatal intensive care units. Pervasive respiratory infections and asthma, frequent fevers, learning disabilities, and developmental delays are also commonly diagnosed as babies become toddlers.

“Any period of homelessness can have negative health impacts on fetuses and children,” the Loma Linda University Institute for Health Policy and Leadership warns.

In addition, being unhoused can exact an emotional toll.

Carol L. Hornbeck is a Minnesota-based family therapist who frequently works with people experiencing homelessness. “Babies need routines,” she told Truthout. “These are hard to establish when a family does not have a permanent home. The lack of routine, the lack of structure, causes anxiety. Babies pick up the anxiety of the adults who are caring for them.”

This disquiet, she explains, can become apparent when a child begins school or preschool. “It's hard for unhoused kids to pay attention, concentrate, and receive new information when they're anxious,” she said. What's more, Hornbeck says that children experiencing homelessness are often diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. “They usually don't have it,” she said. “What they have is hypervigilance due to fear and worry.”

This can also be expressed outside of school. “Kids who've been unhoused come into a new place and immediately look around to see if any food is available,” she said. “The first thing I notice when I meet these kids for the first time is that they quickly check out their surroundings to see if they're safe and if they'll find something to eat if they get hungry.”

Diane Nilan, president and founder of HEAR US, Inc: Giving Voice and Visibility to Homeless Children and Youth, agrees with Hornbeck and adds that the long-term impact of being unhoused as a child can last into adulthood. “People I met in a shelter I worked in 30 or 40 years ago are now showing the aftereffects of the trauma they experienced decades ago as kids,” she told Truthout. “The trauma of instability, of having no place to stay, and of being raised by parents who were constantly worried about where they'd sleep and what they'd eat can cause fears that never go away. This can cause physical and mental health problems later in life.”

Alice Jeffrey, a once-unhoused mother who is now living in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, hopes to avoid this outcome.

Although Jeffrey's daughter, Harmony, was taken by child protective services when she was days old in May 2022, the pair are now reunited and are doing well. In fact, Jeffery has become something of a model for other unhoused women and recovering drug users. Now 38, Jeffrey was appointed to the Parent Partnership Board of the Oklahoma Commission on Children and Youth earlier this year and is attending Oklahoma State University to pursue a degree in substance abuse counseling. But despite these achievements, she's found the experience of homelessness hard to shake off and describes being homeless while pregnant and in recovery from meth use, as “dehumanizing.”

“Not having a bathroom of your own when you're pregnant is awful,” she told Truthout. “You want to take a bath. You want privacy to deal with what is happening to your body, and it does not exist.”

Jeffrey says that she got clean while pregnant, but the fact that she was living in a van with someone who was still using led to Harmony's removal. “I thought that since I was clean and the baby was born clean, it would be OK, but apparently, this was not enough, so Harmony was placed. At the time, I was broken, hurt, but I got lucky. Harmony was given to an amazing family. They sent me photos of her every single day. At first, I had to submit to supervised visitations, but I slowly got myself together, stayed clean, and five months after Harmony was born, she was returned to me.”

That this story has a happy ending is heartening; nonetheless, Jeffrey says that Harmony's removal still bothers her. That said, she told Truthout that she is grateful to have an ongoing and loving relationship with Harmony's foster siblings and parents. “We go to church with them and have Sunday dinner together every week,” she said. “I thank the Lord every moment or every day for these people because so far, Harmony seems to be doing fine. I believe this is because the foster family and I bridged, but there is always a huge risk of trauma manifesting later.”

But Jeffrey is not letting her fears stop her and says that she is stoked to speak about what she's been through. “Telling my story gives my life meaning,” she said. “If I can be brave, if I can be vulnerable and put a face to homelessness and addiction, I want to do it.” Jeffrey also wants to promote a “co-parenting model” like the one she and Harmony's foster family have developed. At the same time, she is paying close attention to the news and worrying that looming budget cuts will undermine the already tattered social safety net that has allowed her to return to school and receive public benefits.

The stakes have rarely been higher.

“Children Under Attack: How Congressional Assaults on Health and Food Programs are Endangering the Youngest Americans,” a report compiled by First Focus on Children, the AFL-CIO, and UnidosUS lays out the scope of the proposed retrenchment for the 33.8 million children under 18 who rely on Medicaid, SNAP, or both for food and medical care. Trump's budget is poised to boot millions off both programs, decimate clean energy efforts, slash federal spending on housing and child care assistance, defund climate resiliency work, eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood and other health centers, and eviscerating public pre-K to college education programs — all while simultaneously hiking the budgets of the Pentagon, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Patrol, and increasing the domestic surveillance and prosecution of dissent. The resulting “savings” will provide a 10-year $3.8 trillion tax cut to those earning $800,000 or more annually.

What's more, approximately 11 million people — about a quarter of those who rely on SNAP to eat, including 4 million kids, and 500,000 adults aged 65 or older or living with a disability — will lose some or all of their food assistance.

Patricia Cole, a senior policy officer at Zero to Three, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group that focuses on the early childhood needs of infants, toddlers, and their families, told Truthout that the budgetary threat has put advocacy organizations into “defensive mode since the threats are coming from every direction.”

Along with other advocates, Zero to Three is “raising up” impacted individuals and encouraging them to tell their elected officials about the importance of Medicaid, SNAP, the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, Head Start, and other safety net entitlements in their lives. “Congress members and this administration seem to have a lack of identification with, and understanding of, what the vast majority of families' lives are like,” Cole said. “There seems to be the idea that the government has no responsibility for supporting families. Instead, Congress seems hellbent on cutting spending, advancing defense, and reducing immigration. But even if they wipe out every social safety net program, it will not wipe out the national debt. It will, however, leave families with infants and toddlers who live at or under 200 percent of the federal poverty line, in dire straits.”

Unions and anti-poverty, child welfare, education and legal advocates — as well as impacted people like Alice Jeffrey — are working overtime to push back on the House-approved budget as the reconciliation process takes shape. Some are also urging states to pick up the slack if federal cutbacks are enacted.

The need is obvious.

“The reality of unhoused families bouncing between shitty hotels, cars, and couches is horrific,” Diane Nilan told Truthout. “As a society, we tend to ignore kids who are suffering, and any attention that goes to the unhoused tends to focus exclusively on adults. We seem to forget that children grow up. If Trump's budget is passed, it will destroy the shred of a safety net that now exists. We're looking at overt cruelty.”

“We need the kind of visionary leadership that Zohran is providing in this campaign,” said Sanders.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) announced his endorsement of Zohran Mamdani in the race for New York City mayor on Tuesday, giving the progressive up-and-comer his backing in an ever-tightening election.

In a statement, Sanders said that New York City voters are being given the choice between the status quo, with billionaires and corporations dominating politics, or a movement that represents everyday people, focused on building momentum against growing “oligarchy, authoritarianism and kleptocracy.”

“The New York City Democratic primary presents a clear choice as to the path forward,” Sanders said. “We need a new politics and new leadership which is prepared to stand up to powerful corporate interests and fight for the working class.”

Mamdani represents a strong choice for this future, Sanders said, citing his “inspirational grassroots campaign” based on progressive policy proposals like affordable housing, public transportation, and groceries. The senator also praised Mamdani's grassroots campaign funding, powered by small donations from individuals — in sharp contrast to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mamdani's main competitor, and the army of billionaires and corporations backing him.

“At this pivotal and dangerous moment in American history, status quo politics is not good enough,” Sanders said. “We need the kind of visionary leadership that Zohran is providing in this campaign. In my view, Zohran Mamdani is the best choice for mayor of New York City.”

Mamdani welcomed the endorsement. “As for so many across this country, [Bernie Sanders] has been the single most influential political figure in my life,” he said. “As Mayor, I will strive to live up to his example by fighting for the working class every day and hopefully, make Brooklyn's own proud.”

The endorsement, from one of the most popular politicians in the U.S., may prove a crucial boost for the Mamdani campaign, just a week from the primary on June 24. Mamdani has also been endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), who has urged voters to rank the Democratic socialist as their first choice in the polls.

Recent polls have shown that the two candidates are neck-and-neck, with Mamdani trailing by just a few percentage points in final rounds of ranked choice voting. This is a major surge for Mamdani over polls from just months ago, when Cuomo had significant double digit leads over Mamdani. 

A rally for Mamdani on Saturday with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew a large crowd, with thousands of supporters packing New York's Terminal 5 cheering, holding signs and banners backing the candidate. 

As Mamdani's campaign has surged, however, corporate news outlets are consolidating their voices against him. Last week, The Atlantic published an article entitled “New York Is Not a Democracy” — a screed against ranked-choice voting, asking, ominously, “Could ranked-choice voting help Zohran Mamdani beat Andrew Cuomo?”

Meanwhile, the New York Times editorial board trotted out familiar arguments against Mamdani's progressive vision in a non-endorsement op-ed this week, which criticized Cuomo but also praised him even as the writers acknowledged the numerous sexual harassment allegations against him.

“Congress must make it clear that the United States will not be dragged into Netanyahu's war of choice,” Sanders said.

U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders late Monday led the introduction of a bill that would prevent the Trump administration from using federal funds for a military attack on Iran without explicit authorization from Congress, as Israel's unlawful assault on the country continued for the fifth consecutive day.

“Netanyahu's reckless and illegal attacks violate international law and risk igniting a regional war,” Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a statement. “Congress must make it clear that the United States will not be dragged into Netanyahu's war of choice.”

“Our Founding Fathers entrusted the power of war and peace exclusively to the people's elected representatives in Congress,” the senator added, “and it is imperative that we make clear that the president has no authority to embark on another costly war without explicit authorization by Congress.”

Seven Democratic senators — Peter Welch (Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), and Tina Smith (Minn.) — joined Sanders in introducing the legislation, which is titled the No War Against Iran Act.

The legislation states that “no federal funds may be obligated or expended for any use of military force in or against Iran” unless Congress declares war or enacts “specific statutory authorization for such use of military force.”

“Another war in the Middle East could cost countless lives, waste trillions more dollars, and lead to even more deaths, more conflict, and more displacement,” Sanders said Monday. “I will do everything that I can as a senator to defend the Constitution and prevent the U.S. from being drawn into another war.”

The bill came hours after Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) introduced a war powers resolution similarly aimed at preventing the Trump administration from launching an unauthorized attack on Iran. Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) announced plans to introduce a companion resolution in the House, a sign of burgeoning congressional opposition to a U.S. war with Iran.

“This is not our war,” Massie wrote on social media. “But if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution. I'm introducing a bipartisan war powers resolution tomorrow to prohibit our involvement.”

The legislative efforts kicked off as Israel expanded its aerial attacks on Iran and as Trump — who has suggested U.S. forces could get more deeply involved in the conflict — urged residents of the Iranian capital to “immediately evacuate,” heightening chaos and panic in the densely populated city and fueling concerns of American intervention.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) condemned Trump's evacuation call as “both reckless and disturbing,” noting that “Tehran is one of the most populous cities in the world, home to ten million people and many millions more in the surrounding suburbs.”

“While many have tried to flee Israel's campaign of terror, the fact is that many cannot flee — the elderly, or those who can't get gas amid war shortages, and those who have nowhere to go,” said NIAC. “We hope that this does not mean an unauthorized U.S. entry into the war, or that he has knowledge of further depraved attacks from Israel.”

“There is a choice before Trump: take the pathway of peace by telling Bibi to stop the war, or join with a war criminal and wreak further havoc and endanger U.S. troops in a fight that isn't ours,” the group added.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s actions at the CDC “put U.S. families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,” they say.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

On Monday, the 17 former members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who were dismissed earlier this month by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published an op-ed decrying that decision, noting that action and his questionable replacements for the board would leave the country “critically weakened.”

The op-ed by the former ACIP members, the first time that they have collectively spoken out since being ousted, was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). 

ACIP is a panel of independent scientists and health experts that provides guidance to the CDC on the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Those recommendations are then reviewed by the director of the CDC, who has the final say on whether to adopt them. Currently, there is no director for the agency, which means Kennedy himself has the final say, for the time being.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Kennedy announced the dismissal of the previous board in a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier in June, claiming that a “clean sweep” of the board was needed “to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science.” He named eight new members to the board two days later, which prompted health experts to express concern about their expertise, many noting that several of the new ACIP members are vaccine skeptics and conspiracy theorists. 

The new members of ACIP are set to meet later this month to vote on vaccine recommendations relating to COVID, HPV, the flu, RSV, and more.

The 17 former members, comprising of health and science experts across various fields, stated that the ACIP has traditionally provided “a unified and trusted approach to vaccinations for the diverse array of immunization providers across the U.S.”

“For more than 60 years, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — codified in the federal regulations (42 USC 217a: advisory councils or committees) — has served as a panel of experts that reviews the most up-to-date evidence on vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (eg, against respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]), providing sound recommendations to the [CDC] regarding how vaccines should be used,” the former ACIP members said.

Kennedy's decision to abruptly dismiss them from the board and appoint eight new members two days later has “left the U.S. vaccine program critically weakened,” the group wrote, adding, “These actions have stripped the program of the institutional knowledge and continuity that have been essential to its success over decades.”

ACIP has provided an incredible service to the American people, the former board members said, writing that their work and the work of their predecessors over the past 30 years “likely prevented around 508 million lifetime cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1,129,000 deaths.”

The op-ed authors concluded by stating:

We are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of U.S. immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put U.S. families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses.

In addition to the letter from the former ACIP board members, a highly respected senior scientist at the CDC also announced her resignation from the agency, in protest over the recent actions taken by Kennedy.

“I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,” Fiona Havers, an expert on respiratory viruses who oversaw surveillance of nationwide outbreaks at the CDC, wrote in a letter to her colleagues.

While Kennedy has stated that his actions are necessary to restore confidence, polling shows that most Americans are unlikely to view him as trustworthy when it comes to health matters, especially vaccines. According to a Quinnipiac University poll published last week, only 38 percent of voters say they approve of Kennedy's work so far as HHS secretary, with 53 percent disapproving of his job performance. Additionally, only 5 percent of voters said they could trust him for guidance on vaccinations for themselves or their family members.

            At least 51 people were killed and more than 200 others injured by Israeli fire as they waited for aid trucks to arrive in Khan Younis in southern Gaza early Tuesday morning, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
    


            The incident marks the highest reported number of people killed while seeking aid over the past few weeks in the enclave. In total, nearly 400 Palestinians have been killed near aid centers since Israel lifted an 11-week total blockade on Gaza and allowed a trickle of aid to enter, according to the health ministry.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a Tuesday statement that “a gathering was identified adjacent to an aid distribution truck that got stuck in the area of Khan Younis, and in proximity to IDF troops operating in the area.”
    


            The IDF said it was “aware of reports regarding a number of injured individuals from IDF fire following the crowd's approach,” that “details of the incident are under review,” and that it “regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and operates to minimize harm as much as possible to them while maintaining the safety of our troops.”
    


            One eyewitness, Mohammed Abu Abed, said that a group of people was hit by an airstrike. He told CNN: “We were waiting for flour trucks. Suddenly, we were among the people and were hit by two missiles that tore apart people's bodies, remains, pieces of flesh everywhere. I don't know what to say; they killed the people, unarmed people who had nothing on them.”
    


            “They went to bring bread for their children, just bread or flour. They killed us in cold blood,” Abu Abed said.
    


            The IDF told CNN it was “unaware” of an airstrike in that area on Tuesday.
    


            Video from the scene in Khan Younis on Tuesday shows dozens of bodies lying on the ground, covered in blood.
    


            The latest scenes of death, violence and desperation underline a grim existence for over 2.1 million people living in Gaza – which the United Nations has warned is edging closer to famine.
    


            Humanitarian organizations say that aid currently entering the enclave is only a tiny fraction of what is needed, with the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – the main supplier of aid in Gaza – coming under global scrutiny since it opened its distribution points late last month.
    


            Palestinians en route to GHF distribution sites have repeatedly been fired upon since its inception, according to the health ministry, with some 3,000 people injured in addition to the fatalities. On Tuesday, eight people were also killed after coming under Israeli fire near an aid distribution site west of Rafah, the ministry said.
    


            The GHF, an Israeli-US backed private contractor, has been criticized by multiple international aid agencies for setting up its distribution centers amid active combat zones. The organization has repeatedly said there has been no violence at their sites. But the GHF acknowledged earlier this month that there have been Palestinian casualties in the surrounding areas, which the organization described as “well beyond our secure distribution site.” A spokesman referred further questions to the Israeli military.
    


            The IDF has not yet responded to CNN's comment on Tuesday's incident in Rafah.
    


            On Tuesday, Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said on X: “Israel has weaponized food and blocked lifesaving aid. I urge immediate, impartial investigations into deadly attacks on desperate civilians trying to reach food distribution centres.”
    


            One of those killed in Khan Younis on Tuesday was a 20-year-old man, who had traveled there in hope of returning with food for his family.
    


            Speaking through tears, his mother said: “He didn't go for a picnic. He went to bring food for his siblings and father.”
    


            Nearby, at Nasser Medical Complex, hospital staff said that the entire ward was crowded with casualties. Video from the hospital showed dozens of people arriving with wounds, with others inside the hospital waiting for treatment as they laid on the floor.
    


            One intensive care doctor told Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), an aid organization based in the United Kingdom, that the hospital had received on Tuesday “a large number of injured and killed from the Israeli army's targeting of aid distribution points in Khan Younis.”
    


            “The situation here is catastrophic beyond imagination,” the doctor said, adding that the morgue was completely full and that additional bodies had been placed outside the building.
    


            “We are trying our best, but the numbers are overwhelming,” he said.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated as new details emerge.

At least 14 people have been killed and 117 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17.

Ukraine's National Police initially reported 15 dead and 124 injured in the attack, but Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later revised the death toll to 10. The State Emergency Service subsequently updated the figure to 14. 

Klymenko said operational data may change, as body parts found during rescue efforts can sometimes be mistakenly counted as multiple victims.

According to the State Emergency Service, one body has been recovered from the rubble of the nine-story building, and rescue operations are still ongoing.

The almost nine-hour-long attack saw Moscow's forces launch large numbers of kamikaze attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine's capital.

Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported the sounds of drones, missiles, and multiple rounds of explosions throughout the night.

The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia launched 472 aerial weapons overnight, including nearly 280 Shahed-type attack drones and two Kinzhal ballistic missiles. The strike primarily targeted Kyiv.

Ukraine's air defense forces reportedly destroyed 428 air targets, including 239 Shahed drones and 15 Kh-101 cruise missiles. Air defenses also intercepted one Kinzhal missile, while another was reportedly lost from radar tracking.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault "one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv," saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. 

"Such attacks are pure terrorism," he said in a statement on social media. "And the whole world, the U.S., and Europe must finally respond as civilized societies respond to terrorists."

Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block.

In a video posted on Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said cluster munitions had been found in one area of the city. He later added that June 18 would be an official day of mourning in Kyiv.

Many of the deaths and injuries occurred when a Russian missile hit a nine-storey residential building in the Solomianskyi district, "completely destroying" one section, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said.

"I saw the missile because it was low," Olena Kushnirova, a 46-year-old  nurse who lives in a neighboring building to the one that was hit, told the Kyiv Independent.

"I grabbed my daughter by the hand and shouted 'run!' It was literally 15 seconds. We ran to the toilet, and then there was a very powerful explosion."

During the attack on the capital, a 62-year-old U.S. citizen died in the Solomianskyi district in a building across from where medics were assisting the injured, Klitschko reported. Medical personnel confirmed biological death.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a "massive and brutal strike" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit.

"Putin does this on purpose... He sends a signal of total disrespect to the United States and other partners who have called for an end to the killing," Sybiha said. "Only strong steps and real pressure on Moscow can prove him wrong."

A Russian drone also hit a multi-storey building Darnytskyi District.

"At first there was shock," Tatiana Bratus, a 50-year-old resident of the building told the Kyiv Independent.

"People started running outside, shouting, some in panic, because the attack wasn't over yet. They said there were still rockets flying. People ran to the bomb shelter.

A kindergarten in the Darnytskyi district was also damaged, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration said. No casualties were reported at the site. 

The upper floors of residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts were also damaged.  

A dormitory at the Kyiv Aviation Institute was hit by drones during the attack, the news outlet Suspilne reported. Drones struck the institute's 10th floor and broke windows on three other floors.

Outside the capital, the attacks also caused damage and injured civilians in Kyiv Oblast towns. At least one woman was injured and multiple homes were damaged, according to the regional administration. 

The Russian strike damaged the production facility of Fahrenheit, a Ukrainian clothing manufacturer that supplies apparel and undergarments for both civilians and the military. The company announced it was forced to cancel all current orders and suspend new ones indefinitely following the destruction of its Kyiv site.

Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) freight train carrying grain. Several railcars overturned, temporarily halting operations and spilling grain from the damaged wagons. Ukrzaliznytsia said the damage would be "promptly repaired" and train traffic would not be affected.

Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, reported the destruction of two of its branches in Kyiv during the attack, according to CEO Ihor Smiliansky. The company's team is working to "quickly restore services," he said. 

The attack followed a series of drone strikes overnight on June 16 targeting Kyiv Oblast, including both the capital and surrounding settlements. In the Obukhiv district, a 60-year-old man was injured, according to regional authorities.  

Russian attacks against Ukraine have intensified in May and June, with Moscow launching several record-breaking mass strikes against Kyiv and other cities.

Convicted sex trafficker had been placed in solitary and given medication by prison staff, court filing alleges

Lawyers for R Kelly say in new court documents that the convicted sex trafficker and singer was recently rushed to hospital after medically overdosing in prison.

The 58-year-old reportedly collapsed on Friday at the federal correctional institute in Butner, North Carolina, which specializes in housing sex offenders, and was transported to Duke University hospital.

In a new court filing on Monday reviewed by the Guardian, Kelly's lawyers allege that he had been placed in solitary confinement on 10 June and was given medication by prison staff – along with “instructions to take it”.

According to the filing, Kelly awoke in the early morning hours of 13 June, feeling “faint” and “dizzy”, and “he started to see black spots in his vision”.

“Kelly tried to get up, but fell to the ground,” the filing alleges. “He crawled to the door of the cell and lost consciousness.”

The document alleges that Kelly was then placed on a gurney and taken by ambulance to Duke University hospital. During the ambulance ride, Kelly reportedly overheard a prison officer say: “This is going to open a whole new can of worms.”

At the hospital, Kelly's lawyers say he “learned that he had been administered an overdose quantity of his medications that threatened his life”. They also say that he “required hospitalization for two days”.

The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment to USA Today, which first reported the filing, citing “pending litigation”.

Monday's filing came after an emergency motion by Kelly's lawyers in which they alleged that three Bureau of Prisons officials had orchestrated a plot to have him killed by another inmate. That motion requested that Kelly be released to home detention.

Federal prosecutors have opposed that request.

“Kelly is a prolific child molester,” the prosecutors wrote. “He is unapologetic about it. Kelly has never taken responsibility for his years of sexually abusing children, and he probably never will.

“Kelly now asks this court to release him from incarceration indefinitely under the guise of a fanciful conspiracy,” the prosecutors added. “Kelly's motion makes a mockery of the harm suffered by Kelly's victims.”

In Monday's filing, Kelly's lawyers requested again that the court order a temporary furlough to home detention.

Kelly was convicted in 2021 on racketeering and sex-trafficking charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison. In 2022, he was also found guilty on three counts of producing child sexual abuse imagery and three counts of child enticement. He received a 20-year sentence to be served concurrently with his existing term.

Pallavi Devulapalli says party is diverging from founding principles towards a more ‘leftwing authoritarian culture'

The Green party is veering away from its founding culture towards a more leftwing authoritarianism, its former health spokesperson has claimed.

Dr Pallavi Devulapalli said trans rights had become an obvious totem in the new climate, and accused the party of trying to purge anyone with gender-critical views.

Devulapalli, a GP and member of King's Lynn and West Norfolk council, was expelled from the party for a rules breach that she has said was due to her beliefs on gender. Her expulsion this month, she said, has exposed a rift in the party's leadership on transgender issues that threatens to widen during this summer's leadership election.

The party's current co-leader Adrian Ramsay, who has argued that members should not be thrown out for saying trans women are not women, is pressing internally for Devulapalli's expulsion to be reviewed.

A Green party spokesperson said: “We don't comment on individual cases.”

Devulapalli was suspended last September, three months after she failed to back the party's manifesto policy on the right of self-identification for trans people during a hustings event. Last week she was informed she had been expelled from the party after attending what Devulapalli said she thought was a social gathering, but which a disciplinary panel deemed was an official party event from which she was banned because of her suspension.

Devulapalli said the move was a “pretext” to get rid of her. She said: “They don't like my stance on trans self ID and the trans women policy. They didn't come out and say that so they expelled me on a technicality.”

She added: “It feels like a purge. We've seen the Greens veer away from its original founding culture towards a much more leftwing authoritarian culture. If you say or think the wrong thing then you're out – that's really worrying.”

Devulapalli is now one of 25 “Greens in Exile” – former party members who have been suspended or expelled largely for their gender critical views. Last year a court found the party had removed Dr Shahrar Ali as a party spokesperson in a procedurally unfair way that discriminated against him because of his gender critical belief. In 2021, Ali's position as spokesperson is understood to have prompted Siân Berry, now an MP, to quit as co-leader.

Devulapalli said the party's belief that trans women are women was “peddling a falsehood”, adding: “It denies science and denies reality and alienates the Greens from the vast majority of voters who know the truth when they see it.”

Following April's supreme court ruling that a “woman” in the Equality Act refers only to a biological woman, the Greens' policy has come under strain. In interviews since, Ramsay, who is standing again as co-leader with fellow MP Ellie Chowns, has refused to commit to an answer, but Carla Denyer, who is standing down as co-leader, has said that “trans women are women [and] trans men are men”. Zack Polanski, a leadership challenger, is campaigning on the slogan “trans rights are human rights”.

Devulapalli fears that if Polanski wins, the party will become more “authoritarian” and less tolerant of gender critical views as it tries to appeal to disillusioned Labour supporters. She said: “A lot of members have said they will leave the party if he's elected. People are trying to reclaim the Greens back to being a party of democratic values and science.”

Since her expulsion Devulapalli says she has had dozens of messages of support, including from fellow GPs and prominent Greens such as the party's former candidate for London mayor Jenny Jones and another former Green party health spokesperson, Larry Sanders, who called for “debate not expulsion”.

Devulapalli said accusations of transphobia, which she denies, had contributed to a culture of fear within the party. “People are afraid of being bullied online and being cast out of the party. But speaking up calmly, rationally and with compassion is important.”

Officials say the suspect accused of shooting Democratic state lawmakers in Minnesota left behind an apparent hit list with dozens of names in his car after exchanging fire with police outside the home of one victim and fleeing the scene. CNN's John Berman speaks with Rep. Hillary Scholten (D) who was on the list.

The Sûreté du Québec has appealed for the public's help as it searches for Claire Bell, 3, in several locations around Montreal.Supplied

Quebec police continued their search on Tuesday west of Montreal for a missing three-year-old girl after her mother was charged with child abandonment.

Rachel-Ella Todd, 34, has been charged with one count of unlawful abandonment of a child. Claire Bell, 3, was last seen Sunday morning in Montreal's LaSalle borough, and was reported missing at around 3 p.m. that day in Coteau-du-Lac, Que., about 50 kilometres to the west.

Ms. Todd appeared briefly in court by video conference on Tuesday morning and is scheduled to return in person on Wednesday in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Que., west of Montreal. According to the charging document, the alleged offence is to have taken place on Sunday in Quebec or Ontario.

Wearing a maroon T-shirt and wrapped in a grey blanket, the accused appeared from a provincial police station in Vaudreuil, Que. Ms. Todd didn't speak as a court-appointed attorney asked Quebec court Judge Bertrand St-Arnaud to scheduled the next court date on Wednesday. The accused does not have a criminal record.

Outside the courtroom, Crown prosecutor Lili Prévost-Gravel said, “the investigation is ongoing,” adding that the Crown opposes bail due to the gravity of the alleged crime. Ms. Todd will be taken to Leclerc detention centre for women in Laval, Que., Ms. Prévost-Gravel said.

Meanwhile, police searched on Tuesday for the child in several locations in the Montérégie region, including the Coteau-du-Lac area and near Highway 30 in nearby Vaudreuil-Dorion, where a dog that may have belonged to the girl was found on Monday.

Provincial police spokesman Jean-Raphaël Drolet said in a social media video that searchers were going to focus on the Vaudreuil-Dorion area, located about 35 kilometres from the boundary with Ontario. Police have been looking for the girl since Sunday.

“It's possible there are other areas that will be searched as well,” Mr. Drolet said. “We will move based on the information we have.”

Police released a video of Ms. Todd's 2007 grey Ford Escape with Quebec licence plate K50 FVE and a 'Baby on Board' sticker on the right passenger side corner of the back window. They asked anyone who might have spotted the vehicle between 9:45 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Sunday to come forward.

Provincial police say Claire Bell is three feet tall, has brown hair and brown eyes and was last seen wearing a white long-sleeve shirt with a pink collar, grey pants, and no shoes. Anyone who sees the girl or has information about her whereabouts is asked to contact police.

A U.S. government working group that formulated strategies for pressuring Russia into peace talks and ending the war in Ukraine has been disbanded by the White House, Reuters reported on June 17.

Officials cited by the news outlet said it was established this spring but became increasingly irrelevant as it became clear U.S. President Donald Trump wasn't willing to apply any concrete pressure on Moscow during peace talks.

"It lost steam toward the end because the president wasn't there. Instead of doing more, maybe he wanted to do less," an anonymous official said.

As Ukraine and the U.S. continue to push for an unconditional ceasefire, Russia has maintained maximalist demands and rejected all such proposals.

At the same time it has escalated attacks on Ukrainian civilians, killing at least 15 people and injuring scores of others in the latest attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17.

Trump has expressed frustration with Moscow's intransigence and growing violence but has yet to impose any new sanctions on Russia.

On June 16 while speaking in Canada ahead of a G7 summit, Trump said barring Russia from the G8 for its invasion of Ukraine in 2017 had been a "mistake."

According to Reuters, the working group, staffed by officials from the National Security Council, State Department, Treasury Department, the Pentagon and intelligence community, was decimated in a purge of personnel around three weeks ago.

Trump pledged to "stop the wars" when he was elected U.S. president for the second time but after just five months in office, the world is a far more violent place.

As well as Russia escalating attacks on Ukraine, Israel and Iran are now locked in a conflict that further threatens stability in the Middle East.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated as new details emerge.

At least 10 people have been killed and 124 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17.

Ukraine's National Police initially reported 15 fatalities, but Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later revised the figure to 10.

He noted that operational data may change, as body parts found during rescue efforts can be mistakenly recorded as multiple victims.

The almost nine-hour-long attack saw Moscow's forces launch large numbers of kamikaze attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine's capital.

Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported the sounds of drones, missiles, and multiple rounds of explosions throughout the night.

The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia launched 472 aerial weapons overnight, including nearly 280 Shahed-type attack drones and two Kinzhal ballistic missiles. The strike primarily targeted Kyiv.

Ukraine's air defense forces reportedly destroyed 428 air targets, including 239 Shahed drones and 15 Kh-101 cruise missiles. Air defenses also intercepted one Kinzhal missile, while another was reportedly lost from radar tracking.

15 people have been killed and at least 124 people have been injured, according to the latest reports.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault "one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv," saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. 

"Such attacks are pure terrorism," he said in a statement on social media. "And the whole world, the U.S., and Europe must finally respond as civilized societies respond to terrorists."

Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block.

In a video posted on Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said cluster munitions had been found in one area of the city. He later added that June 18 would be an official day of mourning in Kyiv.

Many of the deaths and injuries occured when a Russian missile hit a nine-storey residential building in the Solomianskyi district, "completely destroying" one section, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said.

"I saw the missile because it was low," Olena Kushnirova, a 46-year-old  nurse who lives in a neighboring building to the one that was hit, told the Kyiv Independent.

"I grabbed my daughter by the hand and shouted 'run!' It was literally 15 seconds. We ran to the toilet and it then there was a very powerful explosion."

During the attack on the capital, a 62-year-old U.S. citizen died in the Solomianskyi district in a building across from where medics were assisting the injured, Klitschko reported. Medical personnel confirmed biological death.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a "massive and brutal strike" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit.

"Putin does this on purpose... He sends a signal of total disrespect to the United States and other partners who have called for an end to the killing," Sybiha said. "Only strong steps and real pressure on Moscow can prove him wrong."

A Russian drone also hit a multi-storey building Darnytskyi District.

"At first there was shock," Tatiana Bratus, a 50-year-old resident of the building told the Kyiv Independent.

"People started running outside, shouting, some in panic, because the attack wasn't over yet. They said there were still rockets flying. People ran to the bomb shelter.

A kindergarten in the Darnytskyi district was also damaged, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration said. No casualties were reported at the site. 

The upper floors of residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts were also damaged.  

A dormitory at the Kyiv Aviation Institute was hit by drones during the attack, the news outlet Suspilne reported. Drones struck the institute's 10th floor and broke windows on three others.

Outside the capital, the attacks also caused damage and injured civilians in Kyiv Oblast towns. At least one woman was injured and multiple homes damaged, according to the regional administration. 

The Russian strike damaged the production facility of Fahrenheit, a Ukrainian clothing manufacturer that supplies apparel and undergarments for both civilians and the military. The company announced it was forced to cancel all current orders and suspend new ones indefinitely following the destruction of its Kyiv site.

Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) freight train carrying grain. Several railcars overturned, temporarily halting operations and spilling grain from the damaged wagons. Ukrzaliznytsia said the damage would be "promptly repaired" and train traffic would not be affected.

Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, reported the destruction of two of its branches in Kyiv during the attack, according to CEO Ihor Smiliansky. The company's team is working to "quickly restore services," he said. 

The attack followed a series of drone strikes overnight on June 16 targeting Kyiv Oblast, including both the capital and surrounding settlements. In the Obukhiv district, a 60-year-old man was injured, according to regional authorities.  

Russian attacks against Ukraine have intensified in May and June, with Moscow launching several record-breaking mass strikes against Kyiv and other cities.

TEHRAN, June 17. /TASS/. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran's elite military unit, claims to have struck the building of Israel's military intelligence directorate and Mossad headquarters.

"This morning, the IRGC's aerospace forces carried out a strike on the center of military intelligence of the Zionist regime's (Israel's - TASS) army, Aman, and the Zionist regime's center for planning terrorist operations, Mossad, in Tel Aviv, despite Israel's advanced defense systems, and this center is now on fire," the Tasnim news agency quoted an IRGC statement.

Tasnim reported earlier that Israel's Glilot military intel base near Tel Aviv was hit by IRGC's missile strike.

Overnight into June 13, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion targeting Iran's nuclear program. Iran responded in less than 24 hours. In the following days, Tel Aviv and Tehran continued to exchange strikes. Both parties reported casualties and damage, and admitted that a number of facilities had been hit, but said the damage was limited.

Emergency services in Kyiv have recovered fragments of cluster munitions following the overnight Russian missile and drone attack on June 17, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported, calling it further evidence of Russia's "genocide" against Ukrainians.

"In the capital's Nyvky neighborhood, emergency workers are now finding these kinds of cluster munition parts," Klitschko said in a statement shared on social media. "Another clear sign of the genocide Russia is committing against Ukrainians."

Cluster munitions are banned under international law by more than 100 countries due to their indiscriminate nature and the long-term threat they pose to civilians, especially when unexploded submunitions remain hidden in residential areas.

While Russia and Ukraine are not signatories to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, international humanitarian organizations have repeatedly condemned the use of such weapons in populated areas. Ukraine uses cluster munitions on the battlefield against Russian forces. 

The mayor's comments came hours after one of the largest and deadliest attacks on the Ukrainian capital in months, in which at least 15 people were killed and nearly 100 injured. The Russian strike, which lasted nearly nine hours, included waves of kamikaze drones, ballistic missiles, and what authorities now confirm were banned explosive parts.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault "one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv," saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. 

"Such attacks are pure terrorism," he said in a statement on social media. "And the whole world, the U.S., and Europe must finally respond as civilized societies respond to terrorists."

Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block. 

He added that strikes also hit Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, and Kyiv regions. "Fifteen people are confirmed dead. My condolences to their families and loved ones," Zelensky said. 

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a "massive and brutal strike" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit, which is taking place in Canada on June 16-17.

    Editor's Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.



            A melting glacier draped in the tattered remains of a thermal blanket, a ghostly abandoned mining town in Chile, and an ancient tree marked by floodwaters are among the winning images of the Earth Photo 2025 competition.
    


            The award — created in 2018 by Forestry England, the UK's Royal Geographic Society and visual arts consultancy Parker Harris — aims to showcase the issues affecting the climate and life on our planet.

            More than 1,500 images and videos were submitted to this year's competition by photographers and filmmakers from all over the world. The winners were announced last night at a ceremony at London's Royal Geographical Society, ahead of an exhibition of the imagery at the same location.
    


            Photographer Lorenzo Poli took the top prize for his series of photos titled “Autophagy,” which document — in black and white — the Chuquicamata mine in Chile, one of the largest and deepest open-pit copper mines in the world, plunging nearly 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) into the Earth.
    


            Poli captures the vastness of the site, with moonlike landscapes of endless gray. One photo shows an abandoned miners' town and cemetery which is gradually being enveloped by the expanding mineral ore extraction. In a press release he said the photograph highlights the “unrelenting expansion of extractive endeavors” and he hopes that it serves to highlight unsustainable mining practices.
    


            Through the competition, Earth Photo wants to open people's eyes to the stories behind the pictures and encourage conversation and action.
    


            “These compelling images and storytelling bring us closer to landscapes, wildlife and communities, engaging us all with the conservation work underway and the new creative solutions needed ahead. Intensely thought-provoking photography and film like this deepens our understanding and can inspire all of us to action,” Hazel Stone, national curator of contemporary art at Forestry England and a member of the jury, told CNN.
    


            Other winning imagery included a photograph titled “Waterline,” by Mateo Borrero, that depicts declining flood waters in the Amazon rainforest of Peru. In one photo, a man from the Ticuna indigenous people stands beside a gigantic ancient Ceiba tree, the waterline from previous rainy seasons visible just below his shoulders.

            “This photograph, taken in May 2024, shows that the water level should be at its maximum; however, rainfall was scarce and, by the peak of the rainy season, non-existent,” explained Borrero in a press release.
    


            Drought is increasingly becoming a problem in the region, with some areas of the Amazon reportedly seeing river levels at their lowest in 120 years. This has disrupted ecosystems and affected millions of people who rely on the rivers for transport, food and income.  



            Louise Fedotov-Clements, prize chair and director of Photoworks UK, said in a press release that the images bring us “face to face” with the reality of the climate crisis.
    


            “Within each edition of Earth Photo we see a compelling diversity of international projects using these powerful visual tools to share the beauty and tragedy of life on our planet. Through the lens, film and photography transforms climate change from an abstract threat into a visceral reality, capturing not only the damage, but the resilience of communities and ecosystems in the face of environmental crisis,” she said.

PARIS (AP) — The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic — but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.

It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures — paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.

Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.

“It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,” said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. “Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.”

The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world's most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.

Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols — a theatrical bid to “cool down” runaway tourism.

The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called “untenable” working conditions.

It's rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes — including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.

What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over — water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.

But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.

“We can't wait six years for help,” said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. “Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art — it's about the people protecting it.”

At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa — a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.

Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des États, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her — works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.

“You don't see a painting,” said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. “You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.”

Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the “Louvre New Renaissance,” promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.

“Conditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,” Macron said in January.

But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre's annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade — even as visitor numbers soared.

“We take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,” Sefian said, “but when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.”

While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited “masterpiece route” for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.

The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year — more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.

In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are “no longer watertight,” that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs — food, restrooms, signage — fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as “a physical ordeal.”

“What began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,” Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.

The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.

But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.

Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo — neither fully funded nor fully functional.

President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.

Until then, France's greatest cultural treasure — and the millions who flock to see it — remain caught between the cracks.

PYONGYANG, June 17. /TASS/. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu arrived in Pyongyang on a special mission from President Vladimir Putin where he is expected to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a TASS correspondent reported.

This is Shoigu's third visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in almost three months.

"Sergey Shoigu arrived in Pyongyang on special instructions from Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold talks with the North Korean leadership as part of agreements reached during his previous visit on June 4. These agreements are a follow-up to the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Russia and the DPRK," the Russian Security Council explained.

On June 4, the North Korean leader and the senior Russian security official discussed the situation around Ukraine, the restoration of the Kursk Region, and measures to perpetuate the memory Korean fighters who helped liberate the bordering Russian region.

The Group of Seven countries released a statement Monday supporting Israel and condemning Iran as both countries launched fresh attacks on each other.

G7 Leaders are currently meeting a summit in Canada's Rocky Mountains.

The United States signed on to the statement even though U.S. President Donald Trump quit the G7 Leaders summit early Monday night, citing the tensions in the Mideast.

“We, the leaders of the G7, reiterate our commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East,” the G7 countries said. 

Members include the United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, France, Canada and Italy.

“In this context, we affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself. We reiterate our support for the security of Israel,” the G7 said.

Conversely, the group labelled Iran as the “principal source of regional instability and terror,” adding “we have been consistently clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon.”

Iran is also an ally of Russian President Vladimir Puttin helping him wage war on Ukraine by supplying him with equipment and weapons.

The G7 said it wants the resolution of the Iranian crisis to lead to a “broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza.”

The latest Israel-Iran conflict began last week when Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities and killed senior members of its military. 

Oil prices have so far not spiked but the Group of Seven said they are ready to respond if necessary.

“We will remain vigilant to the implications for international energy markets and stand ready to coordinate, including with like-minded partners, to safeguard market stability,” the group said.

Since the turn of the century, the United States has sought to help India rise as a great power. During George W. Bush's presidency, Washington agreed to a major deal with New Delhi that offered support for India's civilian nuclear program despite the country's controversial development of nuclear weapons. Under the Obama administration, the United States and India began defense industrial cooperation that aimed to boost the latter's military capabilities and help it project power. During President Donald Trump's first term, the United States started sharing sensitive intelligence with India and made it eligible to receive advanced technologies previously reserved only for American allies; under President Joe Biden, Washington gave New Delhi sophisticated fighter jet engine technology. Each of these recent administrations deepened diplomatic, technological, and military cooperation with India, making good on Bush's promise “to help India become a major world power in the twenty-first century.”

The rationale for this pledge was simple. Washington wanted to transcend the rancor of the Cold War era that had divided the two great democracies. With the demise of the Soviet Union, India and the United States no longer had reason to be on opposite sides. Furthermore, they were increasingly tied by deep people-to-people connections, as Indian immigrants played a larger role in shaping the American economy and New Delhi's own post–Cold War economic reforms invited American firms and capital to Indian markets. Beneath these shifts lay a deeper geopolitical opportunity: Indian and U.S. officials recognized that they had many shared interests, including combating Islamist terrorism and, more important, addressing the dangers of a rising China while protecting the liberal international order. Washington correctly concluded that a stronger India would make for a stronger United States.

But India and the United States are not aligned on all issues. New Delhi does not want a world in which Washington is perpetually the sole superpower. Instead, it seeks a multipolar international system, in which India would rank as a genuine great power. It aims to restrain not just China—the near-term challenge—but also any country that would aspire to singular, hegemonic dominance, including the United States.

India believes that multipolarity is the key to both global peace and its own rise. It obsessively guards its strategic autonomy, eschewing formal alliances and maintaining ties with Western adversaries such as Iran and Russia, even as it has grown closer to the United States. This behavior is intended to help advance a multipolar international order. But it may not be effective or even realistic. Although India has grown in economic strength over the last two decades, it is not growing fast enough to balance China, let alone the United States, even in the long term. It will become a great power, in terms of relative GDP, by midcentury, but not a superpower. In military terms, it is the most significant conventional power in South Asia, but here, too, its advantages over its local rival are not enormous: in fighting in May, Pakistan used Chinese-supplied defense systems to shoot down Indian aircraft. With China on one side and an adversarial Pakistan on the other, India must always fear the prospect of an unpalatable two-front war. Meanwhile, at home, the country is shedding one of its main sources of strength—its liberal democracy—by embracing Hindu nationalism. This evolution could undermine India's rise by intensifying communal tensions and exacerbating problems with its neighbors, forcing it to redirect security resources inward to the detriment of outward power projection. The country's illiberal pivot further undermines the rules-based international order that has served it so well.

India's relative weakness, its yearning for multipolarity, and its illiberal trajectory mean that it will have less global influence than it desires even when it can justifiably consider itself a great power. Becoming the fourth (or possibly the third) largest economy in the world should herald a dramatic expansion of a country's clout, but that will not be the case for India. Even by 2047—the centenary of its independence—it may still have to rely on foreign partners to ward off Chinese power. And because of its perennial discomfort with alliances, or even with close partnerships, securing external support could be challenging, especially as the United States grows more transactional in its foreign policy—and also if Washington comes to fear New Delhi as a competitor. In the coming decades, India will grow undeniably stronger but less able to wield that strength in meaningful ways, with less global sway.

For most of the Cold War, India's economic performance fell short of its inherent potential. Although the country overcame the stagnation that marked the century before its independence, it grew at just around 3.5 percent per year from 1950 to 1980—far less than many other developing countries. India's average growth rates improved to about 5.5 percent during the 1980s, after the government began modest economic reforms. But the pace of growth remained lackluster compared with other Asian states.

In 1991, Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, took an axe to the country's controlled economy, dismantling the so-called License Raj, which had stifled India's economic growth through excessive regulations, production controls, and closed domestic markets. As a result, the economy finally began to pick up in the mid-1990s. Since then, India's GDP has grown at about 6.5 percent annually—a remarkably long and unprecedented period of sustained growth. India has consequently been able to lift millions of people out of poverty and rejoin the international economy as an important engine of global growth. It is one of the main reasons why the United States sees India as an important partner and a potential counterweight to China.

But no matter how impressive India's more recent performance has been, the country has fallen short of China's reform-era achievements. Since Beijing opened up its economy in the late 1970s, Chinese GDP has grown at close to nine percent annually, reaching double digits 15 times between 1979 and 2023, according to World Bank data. The same figures show that, by contrast, India has never chalked up double-digit GDP growth. As a result, China's economy went from being roughly the same size as India's in 1980 to almost five times its size today.

Beijing has also used its wealth to become far more influential than New Delhi. It has built a larger, more sophisticated military. It has more deeply integrated itself into the Indo-Pacific region in ways that enhance its economic heft and provide it with enormous—sometimes choking—political influence. This helps explain why New Delhi, despite its often confident rhetoric, is skittish about confronting Beijing unless pressed, even when it is backed by Washington.

Indians, of course, are not happy about this disadvantage. Many of the country's officials hope that, in the years ahead, they will match their northern neighbor. The Chinese economy, after all, has slowed considerably over the last decade: China is now growing at between four and five percent annually on average—behind India's pace. The Chinese economy is buffeted by multiple challenges that could keep growth rates down, such as a real estate crisis, high local debt, and increasing constraints on its market access to the West. Most important, it faces significant demographic headwinds. After years of slowing growth, China's population declined for the first time in 2022, and it continues to age rapidly. The country's diminishing workforce further imperils its longer-term economic prospects and, by extension, its power. India, meanwhile, still has a growing population, despite declining fertility rates. It will possess a large cohort of working-age adults for some time to come.



But China's slowdown does not guarantee that India will catch up. In fact, based on current trends, the Indian economy is unlikely to match its Chinese counterpart before the middle of the century, if at all. To become a genuine peer of China, India would need to grow consistently at eight percent per year over the next 25 years while China grows at a glacial two percent. This is unlikely to happen. India has not developed a significant manufacturing sector (and probably will not because it lacks the requisite comparative advantage), clings to excessive protectionism that impedes exports, and invests too little in research and development. It lags in overall technological proficiency, despite having many excellent technology companies. It has not yet invested sufficiently in improving its large human capital.

India will therefore likely grow at an annual rate of six percent over the next two decades, its average annual rate during the last decade, based on World Bank data through 2023. If that happens, and China grows at just two percent per year, on average, New Delhi's standing vis-à-vis Beijing would certainly improve: by midcentury, India's GDP would be a little more than half that of China. But China could still achieve average annual GDP growth higher than two percent in the coming decades. For all its challenges, China still has enormous economic advantages relative to India, including a literate, skilled, and comparatively healthy population; greater technological proficiency; and larger capital stocks. It has made substantial investments in critical technologies—such as artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, and information and communications—which could improve growth despite its demographic constraints. If China grows even a little faster, say at three percent annually, it could end up with an economy that is closer to three times as large as India's, even if India grows at six percent.

Long-range projections of economic growth are admittedly difficult to make. Yet if past is prelude, India will become a great power by the middle of this century, but it will be the weakest of a quartet that includes China, the United States, and the European Union. It will not be on par with China. And it will certainly not be on par with the United States.

If New Delhi wants to constrain Beijing, it will therefore need Washington. None of the other Indo-Pacific powers, not even Australia or Japan, will be strong enough by 2050 to compensate for the United States. The EU might have the collective economic and military capacity to do so, but its members are not threatened by China in the same way that the Indo-Pacific states are. New Delhi and Washington then will—indeed, must—continue cooperating in the years ahead.

But those hoping for a boundless friendship will be disappointed. Despite its weaknesses, India will not settle for any alliance with the United States, and there will be limits on their partnership. That is because India does not want to be part of any collective defense arrangements. Instead, it will zealously guard its nonallied status.

India's desire to avoid formal coalitions is partly the product of its colonial past. The country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, pledged that India would never become a “camp follower” of any great power, given that it had spent centuries suffering under British rule. But the country's attitude is equally motivated by the conviction that a rising power must never do anything in the interim to compromise the freedom of action it will enjoy once it has ascended. Indian policymakers fear that accepting the constraints that come with alliances, particularly in coalitions that include more powerful states, would not only lead to the country's subordination but also limit its ability to maneuver between the various geopolitical divisions in the international system. At heart, New Delhi has realist inclinations: it does not trust other states to act out of anything other than self-interest. It assumes that it will receive external support only if the donor benefits appropriately. To the degree that the United States and others have an interest in balancing Chinese power, India expects their support without having to make any onerous compromises to secure such assistance.

With this assessment of the world in mind, New Delhi will keep trying to push the international order toward multipolarity even if that is not what Washington wants. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee articulated this ambition in 2004, when he declared, “India does not believe that unipolarity is a state of equilibrium in today's world.” India, he insisted, would work to build a “cooperative, multipolar world which accommodates the legitimate aspirations and interests of all its component poles.” Indian leaders across the political spectrum share this vision, believing that multipolarity is the natural state of the world, that the international system is entering a state of multipolarity, or that multipolarity is needed for global peace because it ensures that no single country can impose its will on others.



Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar argues in his 2020 book, The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World, that New Delhi should advance its “national interests by identifying and exploiting opportunities created by global contradictions” to reap the most benefits “from as many ties as possible.” A unipolar order undermines this strategy because it denies New Delhi the opportunity to play one pole against another. A bipolar order is more favorable; throughout the Cold War, for example, India played the Soviet Union against the United States to benefit itself. But multipolarity is best. After all, a multipolar world would have many more cleavages and affinities that India could use to its advantage.

In practice, this means that India pursues eclectic partnerships with individual countries and groupings of countries, even if some of those partners have strikingly anti-American agendas. New Delhi often serves as a moderating force in these forums, to the benefit of the United States. But sometimes, even as India has deepened its ties with the United States bilaterally, it acts to constrain U.S. power in the larger global arena. India has, for instance, pushed back against the United States on issues such as climate policy, trade preferences, data sovereignty, e-commerce rules, and global governance. Even in the realm of high politics, India has opposed U.S. sanctions on friendly third countries, championed the so-called global South in its campaign against Western domination, and preserved its traditional ties with countries such as Iran and Russia, despite the latter's appalling war in Ukraine. India has even sought to maintain stable relations with China, cooperating whenever possible, to preserve a modicum of peace across their shared border. Unlike Washington, New Delhi cannot tolerate violent oscillations in its bilateral relationship with Beijing and, depending on the future trajectory of U.S. policy, may edge closer to China as circumstances demand.

So far, however, these Indian efforts have done little to make the world any more multipolar than it was. In fact, if economic trends continue, genuine multipolarity will remain elusive as China and the United States will be in a class by themselves by the middle of the century. The world, then, will be bipolar. And should that happen, India may find itself in an uncomfortable position. It will frustrate Washington by remaining ensconced in non-Western forums, such as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, only to find that Beijing has more influence in those groups and among many non-Western countries than does New Delhi. Thus far, India has escaped this dilemma because successive U.S. presidential administrations have deliberately overlooked these dalliances. But a more jaundiced government, like the one currently led by Trump, might be tempted to penalize India for this behavior. For example, New Delhi's effort to conduct some of its bilateral trades in local currencies rather than the U.S. dollar, although intended to immunize India against U.S. sanctions on third countries, could provoke a nationalist U.S. administration to limit cooperation with India.

Even if India avoids such retaliation, the country should be wary of multipolarity for other reasons. In a genuinely multipolar system, New Delhi would benefit less from the collective goods the United States supplies, such as protecting the sea-lanes in the Indian Ocean. To compensate, India would have to bear larger financial and security burdens than it has been willing to thus far. It might also fail to balance against Beijing, should the other two great powers (the United States and the EU) decide to leave India—the weakest in the mix—to fend for itself. Under multipolarity, India could end up worse off than it is under American unipolarity or than it might be under U.S.-Chinese bipolarity. As a result, India's current approach—seeking continued American support for itself while promoting a multipolar system that would limit Washington's power—is both counterproductive and unwise.

India's qualities as a great power will not just be characterized by its approach to other states. They will also be defined by its internal politics. And here, the country is experiencing a profound—and dangerous—shift.

For decades, India has been a spectacular democratic success. Since winning independence in 1947, the country has had 18 national elections. The average voter turnout across these contests has been 60 percent, and turnout has increased with time. More pertinently, Indian citizens have enjoyed universal adult franchise from the very beginning, irrespective of their gender, caste, or economic status. They have also enjoyed vital fundamental rights to freedom, equality, and religion, enforceable via judicial action. The government did suspend these rights from 1975 to 1977, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi infamously declared an “emergency” that let her rule as a dictator and imprison her opponents. But the Indian people resisted her authoritarianism and threw her out of office when she called an election in the hope of ratifying her dictatorship.

What made Indian democracy especially remarkable, however, is that it thrived in conditions in which democracy typically fails. Political science research has shown that democratic success is strongly correlated with a country's level of per capita income. Most Third World states, for example, that were born as democracies lapsed into dictatorships or became autocratic shortly after independence. But not India. Despite being poor, India's democracy thrived as its leaders managed the country's political fortunes through open competition.

The country's success at staying democratic is attributable, in part, to its constitution. This document has multiple provisions guaranteeing respect for all people. To guard against the tyranny of the majority, for example, India defined citizenship entirely by the principle of jus soli—place of birth—rather than by ascriptive markers such as religion, wealth, or race. It also offered minorities meaningful legal protections, including the right to manage their religious and charitable institutions, beyond the broader freedom offered to all citizens to freely profess, practice, and propagate their religion. The country also created a federal system in which multiple linguistic groups, for instance, were afforded their own states in order to protect the country's cultural diversity. India's constitution set deliberate limits on executive power both by empowering the legislature and the judiciary at the federal and provincial levels to serve as checks and balances and by creating space for civil society wherein citizens could tangibly express their freedoms of speech, assembly, and association, among others.



This is what made India's political system not merely democratic but also fundamentally liberal. As Nehru put it, the country's founders sought “to create a just society by employing just means.” They believed, and proved, that a poor country could zealously protect individual rights and reject authoritarianism's promise of faster economic growth.

But now, India is distancing itself from these origins. Unlike the India of the Cold War, which remained robustly liberal even when underperforming economically, India today, despite being more economically successful, has been markedly tainted by illiberalism and authoritarianism. Its long tradition of secular politics is now eclipsed by Hindu nationalism, whose proponents believe India to be the land of Hindus and that its religious minorities are, at best, second-class citizens. This ideology, called Hindutva, was repudiated and marginalized by the country's founders. But it never disappeared, and since the 1990s it has been resurrected in Indian politics, winning power for the first time late in that decade through its incarnation in the Bharatiya Janata Party and then more decisively from 2014 onward, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept into office. This ascendance has precipitated policies that have alienated India's almost 200 million Muslims and nearly 30 million Christians. Along the way, the BJP has attempted to reabsorb previously alienated lower-caste Hindus in order to create a unified Hindu voting bloc that, collectively, numbers almost one billion people even as Hindu nationalists have sought to promote the idea that many of India's other minority faiths—notably Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism—are really Hinduism in disguise. All this is part of the larger belief that only adherents belonging to religious traditions that arose in the Indian subcontinent are authentically Indian.

This attack on the secular ideals of the Indian constitution has also been accompanied by rising authoritarianism. This drift has not manifested through rewriting the constitution itself, although some have voiced the idea of replacing it entirely. Instead, the change has occurred through the deliberate erosion of fundamental norms related to belonging and through the weaponization of once neutral institutions. Harking back to the emergency, Modi's government has deputized the tax authorities and other instruments of law to intimidate India's opposition parties, civil society, regulatory institutions, and some opposition-ruled states.



Yet Indian democracy is not dead. The country still has competitive elections, and there are faint signs that it could liberalize again. The BJP lost its outright majority in parliament during the last national elections, and it now has to govern in a coalition. It has, in fact, never won a popular vote majority; it secured parliamentary majorities thanks to the country's first-past-the-post electoral system. Despite the party's best efforts, Hindutva does not appear to enjoy the allegiance of most Indian voters. The opposition still governs a third of India's states. Indian liberals are beleaguered, but they continue to resist the Hindutva tide. And occasionally, the judiciary and other adjudicating bodies still push back on the executive's overreach. The question of whether India will be an illiberal great power thus remains open.

But if the country's politics do not revert, it will have serious consequences for the world. India would cease to be an exemplar of liberal democracy at a time when the world desperately needs one. It would not enhance the liberal international order, which promises both peaceful politics and economic prosperity and which has come under growing assault. In fact, if both India and the United States end up being persistently illiberal democracies, the postwar order—which has served both countries well, despite their current complaints to the contrary—would be severely damaged. Persistent illiberalism in both erstwhile liberal democracies would strengthen similar political forces in other countries. In a speech in New Delhi in 2015, President Barack Obama presciently declared, “If America shows itself as an example of its diversity and yet the capacity to live together and work together in common effort, in common purpose; if India, as massive as it is, with so much diversity, so many differences is able to continually affirm its democracy, that is an example for every other country on Earth.” Today, both the United States and India seem intent on failing this test.

An illiberal India is also likely to be less powerful. The BJP's policies have polarized India along ideological and religious lines, and the unresolved issues about how India's changing demography is to be represented in parliament threaten to exacerbate regional and linguistic divisions. This makes India look increasingly like the highly divided United States. Polarization has been bad enough for Americans, hobbling their institutions and fueling democratic decay. But it will be even worse for India, where the state and society are much weaker. Polarization, for example, could intensify the armed rebellions against New Delhi that have long been underway, creating opportunities for outside powers to sow chaos within India's borders. Those conflicts could also spill over into India's neighborhood, as the ideological animus against Muslims exacerbates tensions with both Bangladesh and Pakistan. Polarization would also increase India's internal security burdens, consuming resources that New Delhi needs to project influence abroad. And even if polarization does not create more internal troubles, it will undermine New Delhi's efforts to mobilize its population in accumulating national power.

The combination of moderate economic growth, the persistent quest for partnerships with all states but privileged relationships with none, and growing illiberalism within the country make for an India whose global influence will fall short of its increasing material strength. Although India will become the third or fourth largest economy globally, its lagging development indicators imply that its relatively large population will neither enjoy the standard of living nor contribute proportionately to the production of national power that its counterparts do in China, the United States, and Europe. Even as its economy grows inarguably larger, India will still face tremendous challenges of deprivation and grievance that could threaten the country's social stability and national power.

If India's continuing growth also remains tied largely to domestic market expansion but not international integration—as China's has been, in striking contrast—its ability to grow faster will inevitably be constrained. Equally, India will lose the opportunity to influence the choices of countries in its wider neighborhood. Scholars have often argued that the minimum characteristic of a great power is the ability to decisively shape outcomes in the region beyond its immediate frontiers. India today, unfortunately, fails this test in both East Asia and the Middle East, and the situation will probably not change dramatically in the decades ahead, given the likely activities of China and the United States in these regions. The imperatives of tying India's economic fortunes more closely to the transformations occurring in these regions are therefore incontestable, especially because India already faces strong impediments to translating its natural dominance within South Asia into lasting local hegemony.

Because even if India grows at a rate of six percent over the next two decades or so, it will be eclipsed by China in Asia. India will need to rely on external balancing, that is, cooperating comprehensively with foreign powers to keep China at bay. The best candidate here remains the United States because it will probably still be the most powerful country in the international system in the coming decades, no matter its domestic dysfunction.



New Delhi and Washington have made important strides together toward balancing Chinese power in recent years, but India's diffidence about a tight partnership with the United States frustrates this outcome. The economic ties between the two are not as strong as they could be given the countries' natural complementarities. But the biggest constraint is India's preoccupation with promoting multipolarity through multialignment, which presumes that India will become a meaningful peer of China, the United States, and Europe sometime soon and, consequently, will be able to balance China on its own.

Not only is this prospect nowhere in sight, but it also prevents the crafting of a genuine cooperative defense against China. This deficiency would be tolerable if India could expand its military capabilities sufficiently to neutralize the Chinese threat independently and to assist other Indo-Pacific states threatened by China. For the foreseeable future, India will find it hard to achieve either objective. Given the current, and likely future, gap in GDP with China, India will struggle to compete with its northern neighbor when it comes to defense modernization. Beijing's military capabilities already surpass India's, and given its lower defense burden—the ratio of military expenditures to GDP—China could expand its defense spending with fewer penalties to its economic growth compared with India while further widening its military superiority.

India's reluctance to partner more closely with the United States in building cooperative defense, however understandable, thus makes balancing against China difficult. Even worse, the Indian ambition of promoting multipolarity puts it at odds with the United States on many issues of international order at a time when working with Washington should be the more pressing priority. India should not delude itself that it can contain China on its own, which it cannot, while calling for a multipolar world in which the United States has a reduced role.



The United States has tolerated these Indian behaviors in the past in part because both countries were largely liberal democracies. As both proceed down the path of illiberalism, however, they will no longer be tied by shared values. Transactional habits may come to dominate the relationship, and Washington could demand more of New Delhi as the price of partnership. Trump's approach to India in his second term has already signaled such an evolution. Indeed, India's inability to match China in the future, as well as its commitment to multipolarity, which is fundamentally at odds with American interests, will be deeply inconvenient for the United States. India, it seems, will partner with the United States on some things involving China, but it is unlikely to partner with Washington in every significant arena—even when it comes to Beijing.

If New Delhi cannot effectively balance Beijing in Asia, Washington will invariably wonder how many resources and how much faith it should invest in India. A liberal United States might continue to support a liberal India because helping it would be inherently worthwhile (provided that the costs were not prohibitive and New Delhi's success still served some American interests). But if either India or the United States remains illiberal, there will be no ideological reason for the latter to help the former.

To be sure, a narrower U.S.-Indian relationship centered on interests, not values, will not be a disaster for either country. But it would represent shrunken ambitions. The transformation of the bilateral ties between the two countries after the Cold War was once conceived as a way to help improve and uphold the liberal international order. Now, that relationship could be largely limited to trying to constrain a common competitor, China. And if so, neither India nor the United States nor the world at large will be the better for it.

NEW YORK, June 17. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has requested that a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) be convened in the White House as he returns early from the G7 summit in Canada, Fox News reporter Lawrence Jones said.

"I've been informed that the President will have dinner with the heads of state of the G7 nations [in Canada] and then immediately depart for Washington. He has requested that the National Security Council be prepared in the situation room [of the White House]," Jones wrote on his account on X.

MOSCOW, June 17. /TASS/. Israel has for the first time used its Iron Beam laser weapon system to intercept Iranian missiles and drones, an employee of the Israeli embassy in Moscow told TASS.

"Israel is already using the Iron Beam laser weapon system to intercept Iranian missiles and drones in test mode," the employee said.

The system was first used in combat conditions in the conflict with Iran, he specified.

A doctor charged over Matthew Perry's drug overdose death has agreed to plead guilty, according to a court filing.

Salvador Plasencia will admit four counts of ketamine distribution following the death of the “Friends” actor in Oct 2023, the US justice department said on Monday.

The charges carry a statutory maximum sentence of up to 40 years in federal prison.

Mr Plasencia is one of the five people charged after Perry died aged 54 from the acute effects of ketamine and other factors that caused him to lose consciousness and drown in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home.

According to court documents, he said in a text message that he “wonder[ed] how much this moron will pay” for the drugs.

Mr Plasencia's plea agreement stated that he distributed 20 vials of ketamine, ketamine lozenges and syringes to Perry and the actor's assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, between Sept 30 and Oct 12 2023.

Mr Plasencia “admits that his conduct fell below the proper standard of medical care and that transfers of ketamine vials to Defendant Iwamasa and [Perry] were not for a legitimate medical purpose,” it stated.

Another doctor in the case, Mark Chavez, pleaded guilty last October to conspiring to distribute ketamine in the weeks before Perry's death.

Mr Plasencia allegedly bought ketamine off Mr Chavez and sold it to the “Friends” actor at hugely inflated prices, according to court filings.

Mr Iwamasa allegedly injected Perry more than 20 times with ketamine in the four days before he died, according to California prosecutors.

He pleaded guilty in August 2024 to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine causing death, the justice department said. He is scheduled to be sentenced in November.

Jasveen Sangha, the alleged “Ketamine Queen” who supplied drugs to high-end clients and celebrities, is charged with selling Perry the dose that killed him, and has pleaded not guilty.

Perry had publicly acknowledged struggle with drug addictions for decades, including the years he starred as Chandler Bing on “Friends”.

In 2018, he suffered a burst colon after overdosing on opioids and underwent multiple surgeries.

“I have mostly been sober since 2001, save for about sixty or seventy little mishaps,” he wrote in a memoir published in 2022.

An Iranian state television reporter had to stop a live broadcast on Monday when an explosion occurred an hour after Israel issued a warning to evacuate an area of Iran's capital Tehran where the TV studios are located.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was looking for something “better than a ceasefire” in the escalating Iran-Israel conflict. Asked by a reporter aboard Air Force One what specifically he hoped to achieve, Trump responded: “An end. A real end. Not a ceasefire. An end.”

Long lines could be seen at gas stations, and traffic stood bumper to bumper on roads heading out of the city. Many people appeared to be heading to the Caspian Sea area, with local reports suggesting there were some diversions.

Smoke could be seen over the Tel Aviv skyline on Tuesday, amid reports of more Iranian strikes.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel claimed Tuesday to have killed a top Iranian general as it traded more strikes with its longtime foe, and U.S. President Donald Trump warned residents of Tehran to evacuate while demanding that Iran surrender without conditions.

Trump left the Group of Seven summit in Canada a day early to deal with the conflict between Israel and Iran, telling reporters on Air Force One during the flight back to Washington: “I'm not looking at a ceasefire. We're looking at better than a ceasefire.”

When asked to explain, he said the U.S. wanted to see “a real end” to the conflict that could involve Iran “giving up entirely.” He added: “I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.”

Later, he warned Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that the U.S. knows where he is hiding and called for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.”

Iran offered no immediate response to the president's posts, but the country's military leaders vowed that Israel would soon see more attacks.

“The operations carried out so far have been solely for the purpose of warning and deterrence,” Gen. Abdul Rahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said in a video. “The punishment operation will be carried out soon.”

Trump's hard line added to the uncertainty roiling the region on the fifth day of Israel's air campaign aimed at Iran's military and nuclear program. Residents of Tehran fled their homes in droves, and the U.N. nuclear watchdog for the first time said Israeli strikes on Iran's main uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz had also damaged its main underground section, not just an above-ground facility, as previously acknowledged.




Israel says its sweeping assault is necessary to prevent its adversary from getting any closer to building an atomic weapon. The strikes have killed at least 224 people in Iran.

Iran has retaliated by launching some 400 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel.



The Israeli military claimed to have killed another top Iranian general in a strike on Tehran.

Iran did not immediately comment on the reported killing of Gen. Ali Shadmani, whom Israel described as the most senior military commander in Iran.

Shadmani was little-known in the country before being appointed last week to a chief-of-staff-like role as head of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters. That appointment followed the killing of his predecessor, Gen. Gholam Ali Rashid, in an Israeli strike.

The Israeli military warned the population to stay close to shelters as Iran fired new salvos of missiles, but officials said most were intercepted. Sirens blared in southern Israel, including in the desert town of Dimona, the heart of Israel's never-acknowledged nuclear arms program.

Iran has fired fewer missiles in each of its barrages, with just a handful launched late Tuesday. It has not explained the drop in missiles fired, but the decline comes after Israel targeted many Iranian launchers.

Israeli military spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin announced a new wave of strikes on Iran on Tuesday evening as explosions and anti-aircraft fire boomed throughout Tehran, shaking buildings across the capital. The Israeli military said its warplanes had targeted 12 missile launch sites and storage facilities.

Echoing an earlier Israeli military call for some 330,000 residents of a neighborhood in downtown Tehran to evacuate, Trump warned on social media that “everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran.”

Tehran is one of the largest cities in the Middle East, with around 10 million people, roughly equivalent to the entire population of Israel. People have been fleeing since hostilities began.

Asked why he had urged the evacuation of Tehran, Trump said: “I just want people to be safe.”

Downtown Tehran emptied out early Tuesday, with many shops shuttered, even the ancient Grand Bazaar, which has closed only in times of crisis, such as during the 2022 anti-government protests and the coronavirus pandemic.

On the roads out of Tehran to the west, traffic stood bumper to bumper. Many middle- and upper-class Iranians were headed to the Caspian Sea, a popular getaway spot. Long lines snaked from Tehran's gas stations.



Iranian authorities appeared to be curbing the public's access to the outside world. Phone and internet service was disrupted, with landline phones unable to receive or dial international calls. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group, reported that it had detected a significant drop in internet traffic from the country.

Iran, which has crippled important communications tools in past nationwide protests and during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, did not acknowledge any restrictions.

International websites appeared to be blocked, but local websites were functioning, likely signaling that Iran had turned on the so-called “halal net,” its own locally controlled version of the internet aimed at restricting what the public can see.

Iran's state TV on Tuesday urged the public to remove the messaging app WhatsApp from their cellphones, alleging without evidence that the app gathered user information to send to Israel.

In a statement, WhatsApp said it was concerned that “these false reports will be an excuse for our services to be blocked at a time when people need them the most.”








The International Atomic Energy Agency said Tuesday that it believed that Israel's first aerial attacks on Iran's Natanz enrichment site had directly affected the facility's underground centrifuge facility.

Satellite imagery collected after Friday's attacks showed “additional elements that indicate direct impacts on the underground enrichment halls,” the watchdog said.

Located 220 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of Tehran, the Natanz facility was fortified by anti-aircraft batteries, fencing and Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.

The IAEA earlier reported that Israeli strikes had destroyed an above-ground enrichment hall at Natanz and knocked out electrical equipment that powered the facility.

However, most of Iran's enrichment takes place underground to protect from airstrikes.

Israel has struck Natanz repeatedly and claims to have hurt its underground facilities, which experts assess contain 10,000 centrifuges that enrich uranium up to 60%. But Tuesday's IAEA statement marked the first time the agency has acknowledged damage there.

Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful, and the U.S. and others have assessed that Tehran has not had an organized effort to pursue a nuclear weapon since 2003. But the IAEA has repeatedly warned that the country has enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs should it choose to do so.

While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Monday that Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear sites have set the country's nuclear program back a “very, very long time,” Israel has not been able to reach Iran's Fordo uranium enrichment facility, which is built deep into a mountainside.

Hitting Fordo would require the U.S. to get involved militarily and deploy B-2 stealth bombers to drop its bunker-busting bomb. The 30,000-pound (14,000-kilogram) GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator uses its weight and sheer kinetic force to reach deeply buried targets.








Before leaving the summit in Canada, Trump joined the other leaders in a joint statement saying that Iran “can never have a nuclear weapon” and calling for a “de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza.”

French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that discussions were underway on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but Trump shot that down in his comments on social media. 

Macron “mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a ‘cease fire' between Israel and Iran,” Trump wrote. “Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.” 

Trump posted that there were no plans to kill Khamenei “at least not for now.” Despite warning that U.S. “patience is wearing thin,” he indicated that diplomatic talks remained an option. 

He said he could send Vice President JD Vance and special envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with the Iranians.

Republican Senator Jim Banks explains why Indiana Fever fans deserve an apology after the league's latest investigation during an appearance on OutKick's "Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich."  

Angel Reese is turning an insult into a positive.

Reese, of course, is a rebounding machine, setting the single-season record last year before an injury cut her season short — that record was then surpassed by A'ja Wilson.

But many of her rebounds have come from the offensive side, stemming from her own missed shots.

Because of this, a viral TikTok user coined the term "mebounds," for when Reese grabs a rebound off her own miss. 

Well, Reese took advantage of the opportunity and filed a trademark application for the new word. The trademark would be for hats, T-shirts and sweatshirts.

Reese even addressed the term in one of her latest TikTok videos.

"Whoever came up with the 'mebounds' thing, y'all ate that up. Because 'mebounds,' rebounds, crebounds... anything that comes off that board, it's mine," she said in the post.

"And a brand? That's six figures right there. The trolling, I love when y'all do it because, like, the ideas be good. Like, when y'all have to alter my face and s--- because I'm cute, all right, whatever. That doesn't get me. But when y'all came up with ‘mebounds,' because statistically, all the rebounds that I get aren't always just mine. They're, like, the defenses, too, or somebody else on my team. But, when y'all came up with 'mebounds,' y'all ate."

In a recent contest, Reese grabbed five offensive rebounds in a 19-second span, four of which came off her own shots.

Reese currently leads the WNBA with 11.9 rebounds per game — 4.8 of those are offensive, which is also a WNBA high. She is shooting 35.7% from the floor in 10 games played this season. She ranks third in defensive rebounds per game with 7.1.

The 23-year-old recently recorded her first triple-double, scoring 11 points, grabbing 13 boards, and handing out 11 assists.

            President Donald Trump is growing increasingly warm to using US military assets to strike Iranian nuclear facilities and souring on the idea of a diplomatic solution to end Tehran's escalating conflict with Israel, two officials familiar with the ongoing discussions told CNN.
    


            The new, more hawkish posture represents a significant shift in Trump's thinking, though the sources said Trump remains open to a diplomatic solution — if Iran makes significant concessions.
    


            Over the weekend and into Monday, discussions among Trump administration officials had continued to center on trying to find a diplomatic solution to serve as an off-ramp, sources familiar with the talks said.
    


            But Trump signaled early Tuesday his patience for diplomacy was wearing thin. “I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One returning early from the Group of 7 summit in Canada. He added that his objective in Iran was “an end, a real end, not a ceasefire,” or “giving up entirely.”

            He later doubled down on Truth Social, calling for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” and asserting that the US knew the location of Iran's supreme leader – even though it would not kill him “for now.”
    


            Officials said Trump had, for now, moved away from the idea of dispatching top officials to a mutually agreed upon location in the Middle East to meet with the Iranians and attempt to hash out a deal.
    


            Military officials were preparing for the possibility that Trump would decide to order the US Air Force to help refuel Israeli fighter jets as they carry out strikes over Iran, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The sources said that is one reason why more than 30 US aerial refueling tankers have been surged to the region over the last several days.
    


            The refueling of Israeli jets would be on the lesser end of US military involvement, the sources said. More broadly, however, the tankers have been moved in order to give Trump and US Central Command “options” should things escalate, one of the sources said. That includes the option, presented to Trump by CENTCOM, of joint US-Israel strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the source added.
    


            On Tuesday, after Trump abruptly returned to Washington from the G7 Summit, his vice president offered one of the clearest signals to date that Trump was weighing taking offensive action to eliminate Iran's nuclear facilities.
    


            JD Vance posted to X that the president “may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president.”
    


            Trump was meeting Tuesday with members of his national security team in the White House Situation Room. Israel has been pressing Trump to become more involved in its campaign to dismantle Iran's nuclear facilities, which top officials from the country have said would require American weapons and planes. An Israeli source familiar with the matter said there was more optimism within Israel that the US would join the military campaign against Iran. But the source said the Israelis had not yet received an official decision from the Trump administration.
    


            Until Tuesday, the president had offered little clarity on whether he would accede to Israel's pressure, which has been countered by loud voices within his own party encouraging him to avoid getting dragged into another foreign conflict. Trump had been wary of ordering the US to engage directly on behalf of the Israelis, beyond providing defensive support to intercept Iranian missiles and US intelligence.
    


            But in a string of social media posts Tuesday, Trump sounded increasingly combative and used the word “we” to describe military action in Iran.
    


            “We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,” he wrote. “Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn't compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured ‘stuff.' Nobody does it better than the good ol' USA.”
    


            In a separate post, Trump also used “we” to describe information pinpointing the location of Iran's supreme leader.
    


            “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump wrote.

            The Trump administration had heavily relied on the Omanis in recent months to pass messages back and forth with Iranian officials and facilitate five rounds of negotiations as the US and Iran worked toward a possible nuclear deal. But when Israel initially began carrying out the major operation targeting Iran's nuclear sites, the administration's tactics changed, sources familiar with the matter said.
    


            Trump instructed special envoy Steve Witkoff to attempt to meet with Iranian officials as quickly as possible, and the administration engaged a wide range of regional players to get Iran back to the table, sources said, including the Qataris, the Egyptians, the Saudis and the Turks.
    


            “It is not just the Omanis, it is everyone. Everyone is working,” said a regional diplomat familiar with the administration's outreach in recent days. “Witkoff is texting everyone.”
    


            But those efforts on Tuesday morning had not delivered a breakthrough. Iran's Foreign Ministry told CNN on Tuesday that it know nothing about planned talks in the coming days.
    


            Trump administration officials have been closely monitoring private and public communications from Israel regarding its plans to escalate offensive attacks on Iran in the next few days. An official said those signals were a driving force behind Trump's Monday directive for residents of Tehran to evacuate.
    


            It is still unclear whether the president will ultimately decide to aid Israel's effort to fully eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities. Sources familiar with the behind-the-scenes talks have said the possibility is on the table, especially if the Iranians do not more proactively try to find a solution.
    


            In his message Tuesday, Vance sought to address concerns from members of Trump's own base of supporters about the potential for an escalating conflict that draws the US closer to war.
    


            “And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy,” Vance wrote, getting at the divide emerging among conservatives over whether to aid Israel in its goal of wiping out Iran's nuclear capabilities or to avoid dragging the US into another foreign war.
    


            In a private phone call Monday, Sen. Lindsey Graham personally urged Trump to go “all in” to end Iran's nuclear program, including using the might of the US military.
    


            “I said, Mr. President, ‘This is a historic moment. Four presidents have promised that they won't get a nuclear weapon on your watch. You can fulfill that promise,” the South Carolina Republican said a day afterward.
    


            Graham, who is one of the GOP's most hawkish voices on Iran, made clear to Trump he wants the US to intervene in the dismantling of Iran's nuclear program more directly with American military resources, alongside Israel's.
    


            “If it takes bombs, bunker buster bombs, so be it. If we need to fly with Israel, so be it. The consequences of not getting this right are enormous,” Graham told reporters.

            A White House official said Trump understands both sides of that argument. But the official said the president firmly believes that his repeated statements that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and warnings that the US would ensure that never happens provide justification for any potential action.
    


            Upon arriving back at the White House on Tuesday morning, Trump posted a message he'd received from his ambassador in Israel, Mike Huckabee, acknowledging the president had “many voices speaking to you” but encouraging him to be open to divine intervention.
    


            “I believe you will hear from heaven and that voice is far more important than mine or ANYONE else's,” Huckabee wrote.
    


            Trump has said previously that Iran must abandon its nuclear program, and alleged Tuesday that Iran was “very close” to developing a nuclear weapon, despite assessments from his own intelligence chiefs that such an outcome was not imminent.
    


            Asked on Air Force One whether there's any guarantee that US bombs could actually reach underground Iranian nuclear bunkers and destroy them, Trump said, “There's no guarantee in anything.”
    


            And he issued a warning to Iran that targeting American troops in the region would lead to a dramatic escalation in the conflict.
    


            “We'll come down so hard, it'd be gloves off,” he said.

LIV Golf is a league in their own, exploding in popularity around the world. Trying to prove, that golf is for everyone. 

PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan announced on Tuesday that he is leaving the tour, and Tiger Woods seems excited about the future.

Monahan will leave the tour next year, and top NFL executive Brian Rolapp was announced as the PGA Tour's CEO.

"I'm honored to step into the role of CEO of the PGA Tour. Golf has one of the deepest histories and many of the most timeless traditions in all of sports," Rolapp said in an open letter posted on social media. "That history and those traditions have inspired generations of players and fans, creating both a game and a Tour that millions around the world love. At the same time, professional golf is evolving, as are the ways fans consume sports. My goal as CEO is to honor golf's traditions but not be overly bound by them."

Woods posted on X, thanking Monahan for his service to the tour and congratulating the new CEO.

"Congrats to Brian on becoming CEO of the PGA TOUR. I'm excited about where the TOUR is headed. And a big thank you to Jay for everything he's done for our game and for the players and fans," Woods posted.

Monahan himself added, "Brian is the perfect choice for the next chapter of the PGA Tour.

"His arrival strengthens our leadership team and reflects our shared commitment to the TOUR's continued evolution. With Brian's expertise and vision, and the trust we've established with our players and fans, I'm more confident than ever in the future we're building."

Monahan will shift his day-to-day responsibilities to Rolapp and focus more on his position on the PGA Tour board, along with the commercial PGA Tour Enterprises board, through 2026.

"Over the past few years, the TOUR has made meaningful progress in addressing these changes - from creating more opportunities for players to improving the competitive structure and enhancing the fan experience. But there's still significant work to do and incredible opportunity remains ahead. From creating the highest quality golf product that includes the best players in the world, to strengthening commercial partnerships - as I spoke to players, board member, and fans in recent months, I felt drawn to this potential," Rolapp said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. regulators will begin offering faster reviews to new medicines that administration officials deem as promoting “the health interests of Americans,” under a new initiative announced Tuesday.

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency will aim to review select drugs in one to two months. FDA's long-standing accelerated approval program generally issues decisions in six months for drugs that treat life-threatening diseases. Regular drug reviews take about 10 months.

Since arriving at the FDA in April, Makary has repeatedly told FDA staff they need to “challenge assumptions” and rethink procedures. In a medical journal commentary published last week, Makary suggested the agency could conduct “rapid or instant reviews,” pointing to the truncated process used to authorize the first COVID-19 vaccines under Operation Warp Speed.

For the new program, the FDA will issue a limited number of “national priority vouchers” to companies “aligned with U.S. national priorities,” the agency said in a statement. The special designation will give the selected companies access to extra FDA communications, streamlined staff reviews and the ability to submit much of their product information in advance.

Speeding up drug approvals has long been a priority of the pharmaceutical industry, which has successfully lobbied Congress to create a variety of special programs and pathways for faster reviews.




Many aspects of the plan announced Tuesday overlap with older programs. But the broad criteria for receiving a voucher will give FDA officials unprecedented discretion in deciding which companies can benefit from the fastest reviews.

“The ultimate goal is to bring more cures and meaningful treatments to the American public,” Makary said in a statement.

Makary previously said the FDA should be willing to ease its scientific requirements for certain drugs, for instance, by not always requiring randomized studies in which patients are tracked over time to track safety and effectiveness. Such trials are generally considered the gold standard of medical research, though the FDA has increasingly been willing to accept smaller, less-definitive studies for rare or life-threatening diseases. 

In several recent cases, the FDA has faced criticism for approving drugs based on preliminary data that didn't ultimately show benefits for patients.

The push to rapidly accelerated drug approvals is the opposite approach that Makary and his boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have taken on vaccines. 

Promising a “return to gold-standard science,” Kennedy previously announced that all new vaccines would have to be compared to placebo, or a dummy shot, to win approval. Kennedy and Makary also have announced a stricter policy on seasonal updates to COVID-19 shots, saying they will have to undergo new testing before they can be approved for use in healthy children and most adults.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was looking for something “better than a ceasefire” in the escalating Iran-Israel conflict. Asked by a reporter aboard Air Force One what specifically he hoped to achieve, Trump responded: “An end. A real end. Not a ceasefire. An end.”

President Donald Trump said Tuesday the U.S. knows where Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is hiding during the Israel-Iran conflict but doesn't want him killed “for now.”

Trump urged, in a social media posting, Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” as the five-day conflict continues to escalate.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump added. “He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”

Trump's increasingly muscular comments towards Tehran come after urging Tehran's 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his visit to an international summit to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team.

New York City comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by federal agents at an immigration court Tuesday as he was trying to accompany a person out of a courtroom.

A reporter with The Associated Press witnessed Lander's arrest at a federal building in Manhattan. The person Lander was walking out of the courtroom was also arrested.

Lander had spent the morning observing immigration court hearings and told an AP reporter that he was there to “accompany” some immigrants out of the building.

A video of the arrest, captured by an AP reporter, shows an agent telling Lander, “You're obstructing.”

In the moments before Lander was handcuffed, agents could be seen trying to physically separate Lander from the man they had come to detain. Lander briefly struggled to stay close to the detainee before he was pulled away.

The combination of Trump's tariffs and the GOP's proposed “big, beautiful bill” would hit the finances of many working class households, according to a report from Democrats on the congressional Joint Economic Committee.

Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, the panel's top Democrat, said the analysis shows “those who make up the backbone of our country — fire fighters, teachers, truck drivers, and others — will all face higher costs,” while the top earners “get a massive windfall.”

The committee used data from various sources, including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and new data from the Yale Budget Lab.

Prominent Trump supporters, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and conservative pundit Tucker Carlson have raised concerns about how far the president should go in backing Israel after vowing during his campaign to keep the U.S. out of expensive and endless wars.

In a Tuesday posting on X, Vance said he wanted to address “a lot of crazy stuff on social media” about Trump's approach to Iran.

Vance made the case that Trump has been consistent that “Iran cannot have uranium enrichment” and has said “repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways — the easy way or the ‘other' way.”

“He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president,” Vance added. “And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release that Senate Republican proposals for the tax cuts bill “will deliver the permanence and certainty both individual taxpayers and businesses alike are looking for, driving growth and unleashing the American economy.”

“We look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to further refine this bill and get it to President Trump's desk,” he said.

Senate Republicans on Monday proposed steeper Medicaid cuts, new work requirements for parents of teens and keeping in place the current $10,000 deduction of state and local taxes, called SALT, to offset the costs of making Trump's tax breaks permanent.

Trump is pushing Congress to send the final product to his desk to become law by the Fourth of July.

It was an awkward moment at the G7 summit — President Trump dropping the papers of a newly signed U.S.-U.K. trade deal on the ground and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stooping to pick them up, all in front of the world's media.

Starmer said he had no choice, since anyone else trying to help risked being shot by the president's security team.

“There were quite strict rules about who can get close to the president,” Starmer told reporters Tuesday.

Despite Trump's mishap and early departure from the summit, Starmer said the president “was in good form yesterday,” participating in all the summit sessions and the evening dinner, where all seven leaders agreed on a statement urging de-escalation in the Middle East.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says he's confident Trump isn't about to take the U.S. into the Israel-Iran conflict, despite the president's early departure from a G7 summit to deal with the escalating crisis.

Starmer told reporters at the summit Tuesday that “I don't think anything that the president said either here or elsewhere suggests that” the U.S. will get involved. That comes after Trump on social media urged the 9.5 million residents of Tehran to leave.

Starmer pointed to a statement issued late Monday by all G7 leaders, including Trump, calling for a “de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza.”

“Throughout the dinner yesterday I was sitting right next to President Trump, so I've no doubt, in my mind, the level of agreement there was in relation to the words that were then issued immediately after that,” Starmer said.

Hey, Lisa. Thanks for your question. To answer this, we asked AP White House Reporter Aamer Madhani. Here's what he said:

That 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, was brokered by the Obama administration before being abandoned by Trump in 2018. It included caps on enrichment, how much material Iran can stockpile and limits the operation of advanced centrifuges needed to enrich. Trump called it the “worst deal ever.”

Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff have offered inconsistent public messages about whether Iran would be allowed to retain the capacity to enrich uranium to lower levels for civilian purposes.

“They don't need to enrich past 3.67%,” Witkoff said in an April Fox News interview. “This is going to be much about verification on the enrichment program and then ultimately verification on weaponization.”

The next day Witkoff backtracked. “A deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal,” Witkoff wrote in a post on X.

The administration argues the case is moot because he's back in the United States.

“Plaintiffs have now received the relief they sought in their Complaint because Defendants have taken extraordinary steps and have facilitated, and indeed effectuated, Abrego Garcia's return,” U.S. attorneys wrote in a filing Monday.

Jennifer Vasquez Sura, Abrego Garcia's American wife, filed the lawsuit in a U.S. District Court in Maryland after Abrego Garcia was expelled in March to his native El Salvador. His deportation violated a U.S. immigration judge's order in 2019 that barred him from being sent to El Salvador because he faced a credible threat of violence from local gangs there.

The Trump administration later described the deportation as an administrative error. 

The U.S. returned Abrego Garcia earlier this month to face federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee, where he remains in custody. Abrego Garcia's attorneys have characterized the smuggling case as a desperate attempt to justify the mistaken deportation.

On his social media site, Trump shared a screenshot of the text from Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee's also a Baptist minister and a former Arkansas governor.

He opens by referencing last year's attempted assassination of Trump in Pennsylvania, saying Trump was spared by God to be the “most consequential President in a century – maybe ever.”

Huckabee says no president in his lifetime “has been in a position like yours. Not since Truman in 1945.” That's a reference to President Harry Truman's decision to drop an atomic bomb on Japan during World War II.

Trump returned to Washington early Tuesday after leaving an international summit a day ahead of schedule because of the Israel-Iran conflict.

“You did not seek this moment. This moment sought YOU!” Huckabee wrote, adding, “It is my honor to serve you!”

The Senate is expected to approve the legislation Tuesday that would regulate a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, the first of what's expected to be a wave of crypto legislation from Congress the industry hopes will bolster its legitimacy and reassure consumers.

The fast-moving legislation, which will be sent to the House for potential revisions, comes on the heels of a 2024 campaign cycle where the crypto industry ranked among the top political spenders in the country, underscoring its growing influence in Washington and beyond.

Eighteen Democratic senators have shown support for the legislation as it has advanced, siding with the Republican majority in the 53-47 Senate.

Still, most Democrats oppose the bill. They've raised concerns that the measure does little to address President Trump's personal financial interests in the crypto space.

Back in March, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers U.S. spy agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon.

When asked about the comment aboard Air Force One, Trump dismissed her remark.

“I don't care what she said,” Trump said. “I think they were very close to having it.”

Trump had signed an order in early April to keep TikTok running for another 75 days after a potential deal to sell the popular video sharing app to American owners was put on ice.

“Probably yeah, yeah,” he responded when asked by reporters on Air Force One whether the deadline would be extended again.

“Probably have to get China approval but I think we'll get it. I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.”

He indicated in an interview last month with NBC that he would be open to pushing back the deadline again. If it happens, it would be third time that the deadline has been extended.

Trump bristled when asked about some of his MAGA faithful, including conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who've suggested further U.S. involvement would be a betrayal to supporters who were drawn to his promise to end U.S. involvement in expensive and endless wars.

“Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,' IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!'” the president wrote on social media.

Other prominent Trump supporters have also raised concerns about how far the president should go in backing Israel.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk are among prominent Trump World allies who've noted that voters backed Trump because he promised not to entangle the nation in foreign clashes and to be wary of expanding U.S. involvement in the Mideast conflict.

The president said he won't call Walz after the targeted shootings of two state lawmakers because it would “waste time.”

One of the lawmakers and her husband were killed.

The Republican president spoke to reporters early Tuesday aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington after abruptly leaving an international summit in Canada because of rising tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. Asked if he planned to call Walz, Trump said the Democratic governor is “slick” and “whacked out” and said, “I'm not calling him.”

Presidents often reach out to other elected officials at times of tragedy to offer condolences.

Trump added, “The guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. So, you know, I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?”

Walz was the vice presidential running mate for 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who lost her presidential bid to Trump.

If the U.S. decides to support Israel more directly in its attack on Iran, one option for Washington would be to provide the “bunker-buster” bombs believed necessary to significantly damage the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, built deeply into a mountain. Such a bomb would have to be dropped from an American aircraft, which could have wide-ranging ramifications, including jeopardizing any chance of Iran engaging in Trump's desired talks on its nuclear program.

If the U.S. decides to support Israel more directly in its attack on Iran, one option for Washington would be to provide the “bunker-buster” bombs believed necessary to significantly damage the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, built deeply into a mountain.

Such a bomb would have to be dropped from an American aircraft, which could have wide-ranging ramifications, including jeopardizing any chance of Iran engaging in Trump's desired talks on its nuclear program. Israeli officials have also suggested that there are other options for it to attack Fordo as it seeks to destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities. But aside from a commando attack on the ground or a nuclear strike, the bunker buster bomb seems the most likely option.

The bomb is believed to be able to penetrate about 200 feet (61 meters) below the surface before exploding, and the bombs can be dropped one after another, effectively drilling deeper and deeper with each successive blast.

(Stephen Lam/San Francisco Chronicle via AP)



A federal appeals court in San Francisco is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday on whether the Trump administration should return control of National Guard troops to California after they were deployed following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.

The hearing comes after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request by the administration last week to temporarily pause a lower court order that directed Trump to return control of the soldiers to the governor who filed a lawsuit over the deployment.

The three-judge panel is set to hear oral arguments via video starting at 3 p.m. ET, and protests outside the downtown San Francisco court are expected.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco ruled last week that the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. It applied only to the National Guard troops and not the Marines, who were also deployed to LA.

French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said it was “entirely positive” that President Donald Trump was to leave the Group of Seven summit a day early, as efforts to de-escalate the conflict between Israel and Iran continued. The U.S. said Trump planned to skip a series of Tuesday meetings that would address the ongoing war in Ukraine and global trade issues.



We'll answer a few each day during our live coverage.






President Donald Trump in about eight hours Monday went from suggesting a nuclear deal with Iran remained “achievable” to urging Tehran's 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his visit to an international summit to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team.

He returns to the capital at a moment of choosing in his presidency. Israel, with five days of missile strikes, has done considerable damage to Iran and believes it can now deal a permanent blow to Tehran's nuclear program — particularly if it gets a little more help from Trump.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his overnight flight back to Washington that Iranian leaders had been unwilling to reach an agreement over their nuclear program, suggesting he was now less interested in talking with them.

“They should have done the deal. I told them: Do the deal,” Trump said. “So I don't know. I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.”

The Republican president, who said he plans to meet with advisers in the Situation Room, appears to be gradually building the public case for a more direct American role in the conflict. His shift in tone comes as the U.S. has repositioned warships and military aircraft in the region to respond if the conflict between Israel and Iran further escalates.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday the U.S. knows where Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is hiding during the Israel-Iran conflict but doesn't want him killed “for now.”

Trump urged, in a social media posting, Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” as the five-day conflict continues to escalate.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump added. “He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”

Trump's increasingly muscular comments toward the Iranian government come after he urged Tehran's 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his visit to an international summit to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team.

The comments about Khamenei and calls for surrender came shortly after Trump in a separate posting touted complete control of the skies over Tehran.

Trump returned the White House from his abbreviated visit to the Group of Seven summit in the Canadian Rockies early Tuesday at a moment of choosing in his presidency. Israel, with five days of missile strikes, has done considerable damage to Iran and believes it can now deal a permanent blow to Tehran's nuclear program — particularly if it gets a little more help from the Republican president.

But deepening American involvement, perhaps by providing the Israelis with bunker-busting bombs to penetrate Iranian nuclear sites built deep underground or offering other direct U.S. military support, comes with enormous political risk for Trump. 




Trump, as he made his way back to Washington, expressed frustration with Iranian leaders for failing to reach an agreement. He said he was now looking for “a real end” to the conflict and a “complete give-up” of Tehran's nuclear program. 

“They should have done the deal. I told them, ‘Do the deal,'” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “So I don't know. I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.”

Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, and U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran is not actively pursuing a bomb.

Trump, who planned to meet with advisers in the Situation Room, appears to be gradually building the public case for a more direct American role in the conflict. His shift in tone comes as the U.S. has repositioned warships and military aircraft in the region to respond if the conflict between Israel and Iran further escalates.

The White House announced Monday, while Trump was at the Group of Seven summit in the Canadian Rockies, that he would cut his trip short. 

“Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” he wrote on social media. “I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!”

Asked about his evacuation comment aboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters: “I just want people to be safe.”

“We're looking at better than a ceasefire. We're not looking for a ceasefire,” Trump said.

Trump said he wasn't ruling out a diplomatic option and he could send Vice President JD Vance and special envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with the Iranians.

He also dismissed congressional testimony from National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, who told lawmakers in March that U.S. spy agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon. 

“I don't care what she said,” Trump said. “I think they were very close to having it.”

The Israelis say their offensive has eviscerated Iran's air defenses and they can now strike targets across the country at will. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Israeli bombardment will continue until Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missiles are destroyed.

So far, Israel has targeted multiple Iranian nuclear program sites but has not been able to destroy Iran's Fordo uranium enrichment facility. 

The site is buried deep underground — and to eliminate it, Israel may need the 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which uses its weight and sheer kinetic force to reach deeply buried targets and then explode. But Israel does not have the munition or the bomber needed to deliver it — the penetrator is currently delivered by the B-2 stealth bomber. 

Israel's own defenses remain largely intact in the face of Iran's retaliatory strikes, but some of Tehran's missiles are getting through and having deadly impact.

The White House dispatched Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for a prime-time TV appearance as speculation grows about whether Trump could be tilting toward more direct U.S. involvement. Hegseth told Fox News Channel that “of course” Trump wanted to see a deal made to curb Iran's nuclear program.

“His position has not changed,” Hegseth said. “What you're watching in real time is peace through strength and America first. Our job is to be strong. We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that's what happens here.” 

Trump, meanwhile, during an exchange with reporters on the sidelines of the G7, declined to say what it would take for the U.S. to get more directly involved. Instead, he continued to press Iran on negotiations over its nuclear program.

“They should talk, and they should talk immediately,” Trump said during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. He added, “I'd say Iran is not winning this war.”

To be certain, Trump in the days-old conflict has sought to restrain Netanyahu. He rejected a plan presented by Israel to the U.S. to kill Khamenei, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to comment on the sensitive matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The Israelis had informed the Trump administration in recent days that they had developed a credible plan to kill Khamenei.

Trump bristled when asked about some of his MAGA faithful, including conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who have suggested that further U.S. involvement would be a betrayal to supporters who were drawn to his promise to end U.S. involvement in expensive and endless wars.

“Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,' IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!'” the president wrote on social media.

Other prominent Trump supporters have also raised concerns about how far the president should go in backing Israel.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk are among prominent Trump World allies who have noted that voters backed Trump because he promised not to entangle the nation in foreign clashes and to be wary of expanding U.S. involvement in the Mideast conflict.

He ran on a promise to quickly end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine but has struggled to find an endgame to either.

But there are also Trump backers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who are making the case that this is Trump's moment to deliver a decisive blow to Iran. Graham is calling for Trump to “go all-in” in backing Israel and destroying Iran's nuclear program.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Tulsi Gabbard left no doubt when she testified to Congress about Iran's nuclear program earlier this year.

The country was not building a nuclear weapon, the national intelligence director told lawmakers, and its supreme leader had not reauthorized the dormant program even though it had enriched uranium to higher levels.

But President Donald Trump dismissed the assessment of U.S. spy agencies during an overnight flight back to Washington as he cut short his trip to the Group of Seven summit to focus on the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.

“I don't care what she said,” Trump told reporters. In his view, Iran was “very close” to having a nuclear bomb. 

Trump's statement aligned him with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described a nuclear-armed Iran as an imminent threat, rather than with his own top intelligence adviser. Trump was expected to meet with national security officials in the Situation Room on Tuesday as he plans next steps.

Gabbard brushed off the inconsistency, blaming the media for misconstruing her earlier testimony and asserting that “President Trump was saying the same thing that I said.”

“We are on the same page,” she told CNN. Asked for comment, Gabbard's office referred to those remarks.

In her March testimony to lawmakers, Gabbard said the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.”




She also said the U.S. was closely monitoring Iran's nuclear program, noting that the country's “enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.” 

Trump's contradiction of Gabbard echoed his feuds with U.S. spy leaders during his first term, when he viewed them as part of a “deep state” that was undermining his agenda. Most notably, he sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 when asked if Moscow had interfered in the 2016 election, saying Putin was “extremely strong and powerful in his denial.”

The latest break over Iran was striking because Trump has staffed his second administration with loyalists rather than establishment figures. Gabbard, a military veteran and former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, was narrowly confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate because of her scant experience with intelligence or managing sprawling organizations. 

Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2022 and endorsed Trump in last year's election, is expected to testify Tuesday in a closed session on Capitol Hill, along with CIA Director John Ratcliffe, during a previously scheduled budget hearing. 

Both officials likely would face questions about their views on Iran and Trump's latest statements. A representative for the CIA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly warned that Iran has enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs should it choose to do so. Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful.

An earlier intelligence report, compiled in November under then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, also said Iran “is not building a nuclear weapon.”

However, it said the country has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses,” such as increasing stockpiles of enriched uranium and operating more advanced centrifuges. The report did not include any estimates for a timeline for how quickly a bomb could be built.

Trump's immigration agenda is another place where he's split with intelligence assessments. He cited the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law, to deport Venezuelan migrants, which he justified by claiming that the Tren de Aragua gang was coordinating with the Venezuelan government. However, an intelligence assessment in April found no evidence of that.

Gabbard fired the two veteran intelligence officers who led the panel that created the assessment, saying they were terminated because of their opposition to Trump.

In response to those reports, the White House released a statement from Gabbard supporting the president.

“President Trump took necessary and historic action to safeguard our nation when he deported these violent Tren de Aragua terrorists,” the statement said. “Now that America is safer without these terrorists in our cities, deep state actors have resorted to using their propaganda arm to attack the President's successful policies.”

Constitutional law attorney Jonathan Turley discusses President Donald Trump's directive for ICE to ramp up deportations and prioritize sanctuary cities. 

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom appeared to take a personal affront to the Trump administration considering the rescission of national monument status from two natural areas in the Golden State enshrined into protection by former President Joe Biden.

"This is just getting petty. Grow up," Newsom said in response to news that Trump might abolish the Chuckwalla and Sattitla Highlands National Monuments, the former of which is close to the extant Joshua Tree National Monument.

"If it's a day ending in Y, it's another day of Trump's war on California," Newsom's office said in a separate X post.

The Trump Justice Department issued a memo ruling that the president's power is reversible by future administrations and offered examples of similar actions.

DOJ ARGUES TRUMP MAY CANCEL BIDEN-ERA NATIONAL MONUMENTS

That decision nullified former Attorney General Homer Cummings' 1938 assertion that presidents could not abolish such areas of protection.

The administration expressed concern that enshrining such large areas of land under federal control would prevent them from being able to be developed for economically beneficial purposes in the future – a claim conversely derided by environmentalists.

The Justice Department opined that "revocation of prior monument designations" can be found to either never have been or no longer deserving of protection under the Antiquities Act of 1906, according to the Washington Post.

NEWSOM ADDRESSES TRUMP'S THREAT TO ARREST HIM AS THE TWO SPAR OVER LA RIOT RESPONSE: 'POINT OF NO RETURN'

Previously, Chief Justice John Roberts gave his blessing to cases challenging the usage of the Antiquities Act in prohibiting economic activities on federal lands and seabeds, the Post reported. 

On Monday, Newsom further mocked the Trumps, presenting a faux advertisement tagline for podcaster Benny Arthur Johnson's interview with Donald Trump Jr. on the idea that border czar Tom Homan could arrest the governor for "working against ICE and [its] deportations."

"Promo code ARREST for 15% off your Trump Phone," Newsom quipped on X.

The governor also claimed a social media post by Trump expressed the notion of seeking to incite violence in Democrat-run states and use it as a proxy to "militarize our cities."

He also slammed House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., for telling him to focus on "lawlessness and crime" in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The governor retorted that the Show-Me State purportedly has a 117% higher homicide rate than California.

"California's Green New Scam energy policies are a disaster for the state. Their energy shortages, outrageous energy prices, and continued assault on American energy have hurt Californians and enriched the Democrats' donors while selling out the citizens of the Golden State," White House spokesman Harrison Fields said of Newsom's barbs.

"Freeing up federal lands in an effort to secure American energy dominance is not petty. We wouldn't expect Gavin to understand adult decisions that help his state, considering his legacy of failure."

Joy Taylor shares her take on the biggest winner of Aaron Rodgers' signing, explaining why she believes Rodgers himself came out on top—because he still gets to play.

Aaron Rodgers answered the last remaining question of the NFL offseason earlier this month when he finally agreed to a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The reaction was a bit more mixed than supportive. The Steelers have had five different quarterbacks start games for them since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season, and Rodgers was not exactly in MVP form when he signed with the New York Jets in 2023.

While one former general manager claimed Rodgers would be "irrelevant" by Thanksgiving, Super Bowl champion Joe Theismann took a more optimistic approach when he spoke to Fox News Digital as he prepared for the American Century Championship golf tournament next month.

He said Rodgers had the "potential to be successful" because of his ability to throw the ball along with another key factor -- he does not have to play GM in addition to quarterback.

"Remember the offenses Aaron has been in up until this year he basically controlled," Theismann said. "He was familiar with the systems, he had his coordinators, his input into the people he wanted. Now, this is why I think he is going to be successful, now he just gets to play quarterback. 

"He doesn't have to be assistant general manager. He doesn't have to worry about personnel. The only thing he needs to worry about is being able to run this offense, nothing else. So, from my perspective, I think it takes a burden off him to be honest with you. And instead of trying to make a team better, just be part of a team and do your part to make it better."

Additionally, the Mike Tomlin-led Steelers have always been well-coached.

"You're a part of the football team, you know, the way you earn respect is you go out and do your job, and you study hard, and you work hard," Theismann added. "And, of course, Aaron is saying all the right things right now, and I believe he is going to do the right things."

Rodgers had 3,897 passing yards, 28 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions in his first season coming off of his Achilles tear.

The Jets suffered some tough losses throughout the year. After starting 2-1, New York fell five straight times. Of those five losses, four of them were within one score.

Pittsburgh did make the playoffs at 10-7, and it will certainly be interesting to see how they do with Rodgers under center.

The LPGA Tour is filled with incredible golfers like Nelly Korda, Rose Zhang, Lydia Ko and Jeeno Thitikul to name a few.

The average fair-weather golf fan may not be too privy to those names. Instead, they could be more susceptible to following influencers like Paige Spiranac, Grace Charis and Tisha Alyn.

While Spiranac may be the most popular with more than 4 million followers on Instagram and another 1.6 million followers on TikTok, Charis and Alyn have built up their own strong following with millions of fans on social media as well.

Annika Sorenstam may be the most well-known female golfer of this generation. She won 72 times on the LPGA Tour and had 10 major titles. As Spiranac and other golf influencers have taken a different approach to growing the game, the Swedish golf legend was all for it.

"I think it is great. I just want more people to play, to enjoy it, to have a good time, and experience it, whether it comes from traditional golfers, you know, the way we used to watch it on TV or read about it in magazines or whatever," Sorenstam told Fox News Digital. 

"Nowadays, information is shared differently, people get information in different places, so I think it is great. They bring a different view or perspective into the sport. Whether it is fashion or trick shots, I mean they all have a little niche."

Sorenstam is set to participate in the American Century Championship at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Club next month.

Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson breaks down the Trump administration's quest to end 'politicized science' on 'Special Report.'

A federal judge declared the Trump administration's move to nix some National Institutes of Health grants as illegal, describing the cuts as discriminatory during remarks on Monday, according to reports.

"I am hesitant to draw this conclusion — but I have an unflinching obligation to draw it — that this represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America's LGBTQ community," Judge William Young said, according to Politico. "That's what this is. I would be blind not to call it out. My duty is to call it out."

Young, who serves on the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, was nominated by then-President Ronald Reagan in 1985, according to the court's website.

"Any discrimination by our government is so wrong that it requires the court to enjoin it and at an appropriate time, I'm going to do it," the judge said, according to Reuters.

HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon noted in a statement that the department "is exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal and moving to stay the order."

"HHS stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people," Nixon declared in the statement the department provided to Fox News Digital. 

"Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy and the Trump administration, HHS is committed to ensuring that taxpayer dollars support programs rooted in evidence-based practices and gold standard science – not driven by divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology," Nixon said.

White House Spokesman Kush Desai accused the judge of airing his own view.

"It is appalling that a federal judge would use court proceedings to express his political views and preferences. How is a judge going to deliver an impartial decision when he explicitly stated his biased opinion that the Administration's retraction of illegal DEI funding is racist and anti-LGBTQ? Justice ceases to be administered when a judge clearly rules on the basis of his political ideologies," Desai declared in a statement he provided to Fox News Digital.

The White House deputy press secretary asserted, "DEI is based on the premise that an individual's competence and abilities are tied to his or her racial background, and Americans have resoundingly rejected this flawed and racist logic."

"The Trump administration is committed to restoring the Gold Standard of Science, and that starts with recognizing the biological reality of the male and female sexes. The NIH is focusing on Making America Healthy Again by realigning our research spending to address our chronic disease crisis instead, not to validate ideological activism," he noted.

President Donald Trump confirmed he will not call Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) in light of the shooting in Walz's state that killed the state speaker of the House and her husband.

Four days have passed since Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot. Minnesota Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also seriously injured by the same suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, who was taken into police custody on Sunday. The president had yet to call Walz about the matter, and he said he had no plans to.

“I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I'm not calling him. Why would I call him?” Trump told a gaggle of press as he boarded Air Force One Tuesday to leave the G7 summit. “I could call him and say, ‘How are you doing?' The guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. So I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?”

Trump also made reference to Walz's appointment of the suspect, Boelter, to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce in 2019. This was a reappointment from former Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016 and was not a political appointment.

“Governor Walz wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans, but this tragedy isn't about Trump or Walz. It's about the Hortman family, the Hoffman family, and the State of Minnesota, and the Governor remains focused on helping all three heal,” a spokesperson from Walz's office told the Washington Examiner.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate in her campaign against Trump last November. Walz has continued to criticize Trump and is seeking reelection in Minnesota next year.

Authorities suspected that Boelter had more targets in his planned attack after police found a list in his car of potential targets, including other politicians and abortion providers. Also in the car, officials found flyers for the anti-Trump “No Kings” protests happening that day.

The FBI called the event a “political assassination” while announcing the federal charges against him Monday. The murder charges against Boelter make him eligible for the death penalty, but the FBI didn't announce if it would seek that punishment. He did not enter a plea during his first court appearance Monday.

Walz has since called on Minnesotans to move forward with “humility, and grace, and compassion” to honor Hortman's memory.

Hunter Dobbins spoke with John Smoltz after the Boston Red Sox's win vs. the New York Yankees.

The Boston Red Sox's decision to trade Rafael Devers sparked an intriguing reaction from Baseball Hall of Famer David Ortz on Monday.

The Red Sox stunningly traded Devers to the San Francisco Giants for four players, including Kyle Harrison and Jordan Hicks. The deal marked the end of a saga between the front office and Devers, which started when Boston signed Alex Bregman.

The Red Sox asked Devers to move from third base – an ask he refused. When Triston Casas got hurt, Devers also was not going to move to first base. Red Sox manager Alex Cora even referred to Devers as his designated hitter.

The issue started a snowball effect that ended with Boston trading Devers to the National League West team. Ortiz told The Athletic he knew the situation with Devers "wasn't going to end well," but seemed to suggest Devers lacked "maturity" in the situation.

"I played for the Red Sox a long time. You think everything with me and the Red Sox was roses and flowers? I went through some tough times also," he said. "But I was mature enough to understand and keep things internal. Even in the best families, between the best brothers, s--- happens. You need to have the maturity to resolve the problems and move on."

Ortiz said that, in the end, it is the organization that has the power to make the final decision regardless of how much money it still owes the player.

"I know the communication between Devers and the Red Sox wasn't the best at the very beginning," Ortiz added. "But at some point, you have to realize the organization has the power over everyone. They can play you, trade you, let you go. 

"Sometimes, as a young player, it's hard to understand that. But they have the power to do whatever they want. The only thing you can control is what you do on the field."

Devers was hitting .272 with a .905 OPS and 15 home runs. He was leading the American League in walks with 56 and had played the most games in the majors (73).

Former Libertarian vice presidential nominee Mike ter Maat and dozens of other members of the third party have joined a caucus within the Republican Party, hoping to usher in fiscally conservative policies.

Ter Maat, 2024 Libertarian presidential candidate Chase Oliver‘s running mate, left the Libertarian Party with over 40 members who have joined the Republican Liberty Caucus, a political organization working with the national party to promote limited government and free markets.

The former vice presidential nominee told the Washington Examiner that he switched parties because the “big political battle” over the next few years will be within the Republican Party.

“That's the fight that is really going to matter to public policy at the federal level, to politics at the national level,” ter Maat said in an interview. “And that's because the president will eventually leave, and that will leave a big vacuum, and the Republican Party needs to decide what it's going to look like after that.”

The departures of the now-former Libertarians come after President Donald Trump heavily courted the Libertarian vote during the 2024 election cycle, making several promises to their members during a speech at their nominating convention, such as commuting the life sentence of “Silk Road” website creator Ross Ulbricht.

Trump's address to the Libertarian Party was met with loud booing, but he was cheered for pledges to free Ulbricht and pardon the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters — two promises the president has fulfilled since taking office in January.

While Trump's term doesn't end until 2029, ter Maat and several members who have left the national Libertarian Party to join the Republican Liberty Caucus are hoping to influence the GOP from the inside.

The former Libertarians told the Washington Examiner that they see an opportunity within the Republican Party to promote fiscal conservatism and other issues they are passionate about.

That includes when the party chooses its next standard-bearer, said Joshua Hlavka, the former chairman of the Libertarian Party in Florida and a former adviser for ter Maat in 2024, pointing to the fact that Trump has not thrown his full support behind a successor yet.

“Generally speaking, when the guy in power isn't backing anybody, there's going to be a lot of people looking to influence here,” Hlavka said. “I'd like to see somebody who's going to care about issues that I'm worried about: Staying uninvolved in foreign conflicts that don't concern the American people, minimizing our tax burdens out here, protecting individual rights.”

“I want to make sure that whoever does follow up behind Trump represents those values, and also the fiscal conservatism that we're looking for here in America,” he continued.

Conversations between ter Maat and the other members of the RLC started earlier this year, with Chairman John Dennis telling the Washington Examiner the caucus is an “entry point” for Libertarians who are “disappointed or just want to move on from the Libertarian Party.”

Moving into 2026 and 2028, the RLC is hoping to recruit members from across the political spectrum, including Libertarians, Republicans, independents, and even Democrats. Dennis called the recruitment into the caucus its “primary mission.”

The wave of Libertarians joining the RLC helps the caucus build its bench with prospective volunteers, donors, and candidates. Dennis floated ter Maat as a possible candidate in a federal race down the road.

Ter Maat told the Washington Examiner that he did not have plans to run for either the GOP nomination or a congressional seat.

In the past, the RLC has supported figures such as the libertarian-leaning Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).

Massie and Paul have broken with the Republican Party multiple times, most recently over the massive Republican-led tax cut and spending bill to advance Trump's second-term agenda, which Massie voted against on the House floor. The bill, titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has been criticized by fiscal hawks for not cutting spending enough.

Amity Dolby, a former Libertarian Party chairwoman of Virginia's 5th Congressional District, said she made the switch to promote more members such as the two Kentucky Republicans and to help “steer the GOP in the direction of liberty.”

“I feel like Americans are better served making decisions for their own lives,” Dolby said. “And if we have liberty, limited government, and free markets, then they have more opportunity to do that.”

The Libertarian Party, while the biggest third-party in the United States, has received a dwindling vote share in recent election cycles. Oliver netted less than 1% of the national vote share in 2024. In 2016, then-nominee Gary Johnson received over 3% of the vote, and Jo Jorgensen, the 2020 nominee, garnered just over 1%.

Ultimately, ter Maat said a large reason he decided to leave the Libertarian Party was the “substantial disadvantage” the party is at structurally, both in terms of ballot access and infighting.

CLASH OVER DEFICITS THREATENS SENATE PASSAGE OF GOP TAX BILL

Referring to now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s unsuccessful 2024 independent presidential bid, ter Maat said it was evidence of how the U.S.'s two-party system makes it difficult for any third-party bid to get any traction.

“You know, here's a smart, charismatic guy with a good last name and a whole bunch of money behind him, and he still found it difficult, right?” ter Maat said about Kennedy, who also spoke at the Libertarian convention in an attempt to court an endorsement. “So, that's hard, and in a system that is controlled largely by two parties. It's probably going to be hard for a long time.”

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals court in San Francisco is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday on whether the Trump administration should return control of National Guard troops to California after they were deployed following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.

The hearing comes after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request by the administration last week to temporarily pause a lower court order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of the soldiers to the governor who filed a lawsuit over the deployment.

The three-judge panel is set to hear oral arguments via video starting at noon, and protests outside the downtown San Francisco court are expected. 

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco ruled last week that the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. It applied only to the National Guard troops and not the Marines, who were also deployed to LA. 

The Trump administration argued the deployment was necessary to restore order and protect federal buildings and officers.

In his lawsuit, Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the president of inflaming tensions, breaching state sovereignty and wasting resources. The governor calls the federal government's decision to take command of the state's National Guard “illegal and immoral.”

Newsom filed the suit following days of unrest as demonstrators protested against federal immigration raids across the city.




The judge ruled the Trump violated the use of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is unable “to execute the laws of the United States.”




Breyer, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said in his ruling that what has been happening in Los Angeles does not meet the definition of a rebellion.

“The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion,'” he wrote. “Individuals' right to protest the government is one of the fundamental rights protected by the First Amendment, and just because some stray bad actors go too far does not wipe out that right for everyone.”

The National Guard hasn't been activated without a governor's permission since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

Democrats are touting former Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who they hope will be a bright spot for the party in the state's gubernatorial election later this year, after months of internal drama and political bruisings from the GOP.

Spanberger has already clinched the Democratic nomination in the race to succeed Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA), who is term-limited, ahead of Tuesday's primary.

She will run against Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R-VA), who survived two primary challengers and clinched the GOP nomination before the Tuesday primary. 

Polling from the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College last month shows Spanberger with a 17-point lead over Earle-Sears, 43%-26%. The Democratic nominee also raised $6.5 million between April 1 and June 5, more than $3 million more than her Republican competitor.

Spanberger has more than $14 million in cash on hand, far above the roughly $3 million Earle-Sears has on hand. 

“Polls do show that Abigail Spanberger right now looks pretty good in the general election,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington. “The reality of 2025 may very well be that if Spanberger wins, it will be one of the brightest spots for Democrats this year. It's clear that the Virginia Democratic Party is more energized than the national Democratic Party, which continues to seem to struggle with questions of identity.”

Democrats have struggled to find a consistent message against President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. Some leaders, such as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), have relished public battles with Trump.

Newsom and Trump traded barbs in the aftermath of some violent protests against immigration officials in Los Angeles. The California governor sued the Trump administration over deploying the National Guard to LA without Newsom's consent.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco will hold a hearing over the case on Tuesday after a separate judge ruled the National Guard deployment was illegal. 

A trio of Democratic leaders, Govs. Kathy Hochul (D-NY), JB Pritzker (D-IL), and Tim Walz (D-MN) sparred with House Republicans over immigration during a congressional hearing last week. 

Spanberger has opted to focus more on fixing the affordability crisis in Virginia and less on public feuds with the Trump administration, in her hopes to become the commonwealth's first female governor. If Earle-Sears is elected, she also would be the first female governor in the commonwealth and the first black female governor in the country.

“Virginians know that Abigail has a record of bringing people together and getting things done,” Spanberger spokeswoman Libby Wiet said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “They know that she will be a Governor who is relentlessly focused on making Virginia more affordable for their families, strengthening schools for their kids, and growing the Commonwealth's economy for everyone.”

Heading into both the primary on Tuesday and the general election in November, Democrats have historical precedent on their side. The Virginia gubernatorial race, long seen as a political bellwether for the next midterm elections, tends to vote for the political party opposite the president's party.

“We have both New Jersey and Virginia as leans democratic,” said J. Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, about the two gubernatorial races this year. “That said to kind of maybe split hairs a little, I wouldn't be surprised if Virginia ends up a bigger win for the Democrats.”

Youngkin capitalized on his conventional standard in 2021 when he defeated former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe by riding a wave of backlash against Democratic handling of school lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This time, it just doesn't feel like it has that same magic,” Coleman said about Earle-Sears's gubernatorial campaign. 

Officials with the Democratic Governors Association touted their confidence in Spanberger by announcing a $5 million investment in the Virginia race. DGA leaders claimed that Spanberger has the momentum against Earle-Sears during a recent call with reporters, but they are prepared for a competitive race.

Farnsworth claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency's cuts to federal workers, who make up a significant portion of Virginia's workforce, will likely help Democrats come November.

“Virginia looks a lot like 2017 right now,” he said, referring to just before the 2018 midterms that allowed Democrats to retake the House. “And that's before we even get to the real challenge that Winsome Earle-Sears is going to face, and that is, a lot of the policies that the Trump administration is pursuing have a disproportionately negative impact on Virginia.” 

The layoffs do not just affect federal workers, Coleman added. “There are whole industries who do work with the federal government, who are facing more uncertainty or possible layoffs, and it's kind of some backlash that we think could probably work in Spanberger's favor, especially because she comes from that world. She has a background in the intelligence community.”

Wiet said that “Virginians who have lost their jobs, are afraid their jobs will be targeted next, or are worried about Virginia's economic future deserve a Governor who will stand up to the Trump Administration's attacks, not someone whose advice is ‘do not fret' — and Virginia voters trust Abigail to always put Virginia first. That's why she will be elected to serve as the next Governor of Virginia.”

But the GOP ticket is aiming to paint Spanberger as a national Democrat who is unable to relate to the average Virginian's daily life. 

“While Democrats pin their hopes on a candidate who has only ever been a part of the problem in Washington, Winsome Earle-Sears is out talking to Virginians about real solutions to real problems,” Earle-Sears spokeswoman Peyton Vogel said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

“Winsome has a record of delivering results, and as Governor, she'll continue to build upon the successes of the Youngkin-Sears Administration that has created jobs and put more money back in Virginians' pockets,” Vofel continued. “She is a Marine, a mom, and a proven leader who knows how to fight and win, and that's exactly what she'll do in November.”

David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, agreed that Spanberger's polling and fundraising figures are in a good spot. But he also offered some caution for her campaign. 

“I saw some stuff over the weekend that I thought was a little worrisome for the Democrats' effort: The African American vote in the primaries is down,” Richards said. “That doesn't mean they're not going to vote in the general election, but if the African American vote isn't motivated, then you know that's going to hurt the Democrats in Virginia.”

Richards also offered some caution on what the Democratic ticket lineup could look like after the primary.

“If it's not going to be a very diverse ticket, then the Republicans have that advantage if they choose to use it,” he said. “Now, they have their own problems, of course.”

Two Democrats are running in the attorney general primary: former state Del. Jay Jones and Henrico County Commonwealth's Attorney Shannon Taylor. 

Six candidates are running for lieutenant governor on the Democratic side: Alex Bastani; state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi; Dr. Babur Lateef, chairman of the Prince William County School Board; state Sen. Aaron Rouse; Victor Salgado; and former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney.

On the Republican side, Attorney General Jason Miyares is seeking reelection, while John Reid is the only GOP candidate for lieutenant governor. Youngkin previously asked Reid, who is gay, to step away from the ticket after nude photos of men were posted to a social media account affiliated with the candidate.

Earle-Sears did not directly claim that the full GOP ticket would campaign together for a unity event when asked by a reporter. “Actually, as you know, we are all running our campaigns,” Earle-Sears said.

WHO IS ABIGAIL SPANBERGER? MEET THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR VIRGINIA GOVERNOR

The Virginia race likely will not turbocharge until after Labor Day, which Richards said gives the GOP ticket “plenty of time” to decide when to campaign together.

“If you check back in in October and they still haven't been onstage together, I'm going to be very concerned,” he said. “But right now, give them some time, they'll figure it out. They have to figure it out.”

Former Director of Navy Staff Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan unpacks the Israel-Iran conflict on 'The Story.'

Even his worst critics will eventually have to admit that President Donald Trump has dominated international and national events since he returned to office five months ago. 

His "masterful ambiguity" in the third round of the Iran-Israel War is simply brilliant. History will record it as such. 

You may have attended or watched either the Army's birthday parade or a "No Kings" rally or perhaps just watched the U.S. Open on Father's Day, but what will history note of the weekend's events? 

That President Trump has controlled the events unfolding in the Middle East and has done so with extraordinary skill. 

ISRAEL'S ACTIONS AGAINST IRAN CREATE STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY FOR US IN NUCLEAR TALKS, EXPERTS SAY

The most serious analysts in Israel agree. For example, Amit Segal of Israel's Channel 12 —a sort of rare but highly respected combination of anchor, reporter and analyst along the lines in the U.S. of Bret Baier —Segal and others believe President Trump gave a green light to Prime Minister Netanyahu to strike Iran in this third round of direct Iran-Israel combat in the past 14 months. 

Iran entered Israel's 10/7 Long War directly on April 13, 2024, and again on October 1 of that year by firing hundreds of missiles and bombs of all types via many attempted delivery mechanisms at the civilian population of Israel. The Israeli Defense Forces ("IDF"), with the assistance of the United States and other allies of the Jewish State, intercepted those two waves of attacks, and Israel absorbed some damage and loss of life and others injured. Israel responded with small but very precise counter-attacks that damaged Iran's air defenses and which sent a message about Israel's capabilities. President Biden and his team worked to restrain Israel from additional escalation on both occasions. 

After 10/7, as Israel reeled, Iran began a rush to weaponize its enriched uranium into a nuclear weapon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave the order to advance to active planning of this past weekend's strikes, shortly after President Trump's sweeping victory in November and days before the capitulation of Hezbollah to Israel in the Lebanon theater of the 10/7 Long War in the same week of Trump's triumph. 

But Netanyahu still needed at least tacit approval from President Trump, which he received after the expiration of the 60-day window which Trump had given the Iranian theocracy to engage in serious negotiations over the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program. 

Iran tried to play the president and that was a mistake of historic proportions. Now stories are flying about Iran's desperate attempt to get the U.S. to stop Israel's pummeling of the theocratic dictatorship which has ruled Iran since 1979 under first Ayatollah Khomeini and now Ayatollah Khamenei. Those two dictators are responsible for all the ruin Iran is experiencing now and for the past 46 years. Now the aging and obviously incompetent fanatic Khamenei has been allowed to survive to see the destruction of his madness. He may not live to see the overthrow of the regime, but he might. Because Donald Trump told him what he had to do and he not only rejected it, he repeatedly mocked Trump and threatened the U.S. 

Khamenei spent decades and billions building "proxy forces" in Hezbollah, Hamas, Syria's Assad regime, the Houthis in Yemen and some militias in Iraq in a vain attempt to intimidate Israel and thus prevent its striking Iran's nuclear facilities openly. 

Khameini is also suspected of trying to assassinate Trump and other American officials after Trump ordered the elimination of General Qasem Soleimani when this mastermind of Iran's international terror network landed in Iraq on January 3, 2020 on a mission to kill more Americans. (The Islamic Republic of Iran is directly responsible for the killing, wounding and hostage-taking of thousands of Americans since Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran in 1979.)

In five months Trump has moved the United States from telling Israel "don't attack Rafah" in Gaza, to "go ahead, strike Iran. They refuse to negotiate in good faith." Netanyahu didn't or need or ask a second time. And, for the first time in the many times Netanyahu has asked for the support of Israel's military leadership for the strikes, the IDF agreed: Rise up and strike. 

All this time Trump has maintained a "masterful ambiguity" about his role. It is remarkable and unprecedented.

A name from long ago, Sir John Lawrence, should be mentioned here. Lawrence was the British governor general and Viceroy of India from 1864-1869, and used the term "masterful inactivity" to summarize his policy towards Afghanistan, a policy that became associated with the very long and successful tenure of Lord Salisbury as Prime Minister of the Great Britain, who served as the top official in the United Kjngdom three times at the height of its Empire, retiring finally in 1902. 

Salisbury adopted and used the Lawrence approach again and again. Trump may not be up on the details of the Great Powers' maneuverings from the late 19th century, but he certainly knows how to play the new "Great Game" in the 21st century. 

Trump offers to mediate peace everywhere and always. He also always tells our enemies to not kill or wound Americans or they will feel the full force of the American military. And he knows, as only very experienced real estate developers do, when to make offers, when to withdraw them or condition them —and when to walk away. 

The past 60 days of "negotiations" between Iranian representatives and Special Envoy Witkoff were a genuine window for Iran to avoid the punishment it is now absorbing from Israel. Trump has offered to again dispatch Witkoff and now the U.S. has much greater leverage for those talks if they resume. President Trump is allowing Israel weeks to degrade Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs —and possibly destroy its energy export lifeline if Tehran continues to target Israeli civilians. He has not said so publicly, but he warned Khamenei it could come to blows.

Trump is a master messenger.  He basically messaged the "border is closed" and spoke that into closure. He is now messaging the criminal element among the millions of migrants that crossed the open border in the Biden years to get out or get arrested. He's messaged the Congressional GOP to get the "One, Big Beautiful Bill," H.R. 1, done and done.  

And he's messaged American pride in its military with the Army's birthday parade, which is best understood as part of our country's 250th birthday celebration which culminates on July 4, 2026.

Trump lives inside the heads of his opponents. The absurdity of the "No Kings" theater is just the latest example of how the left wing of the Democratic Party not only dominates it but also lacks even a basic grasp of where the majority of the country is politically. That majority elected Trump overwhelmingly and overwhelmingly both supports law enforcement at every level of government and condemns political violence, whether from the left or the far right. (Trump's condemnation of the Minnesota killer was quick and complete. As someone who has himself at least twice been the target of assassins, I expected nothing less.)

Trump has 43 months left as president. I hope they are as successful as his first five months back.

BANFF, Canada — The Group of Seven leaders have condemned Iran in what has become a rare joint statement after President Donald Trump departed the 2025 annual summit early to address the crisis unfolding between Israel and Iran in the Middle East.

“We, the leaders of the G7, reiterate our commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East,” the G7 leaders wrote late Monday. “In this context, we affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself. We reiterate our support for the security of Israel. We also affirm the importance of the protection of civilians.”

The leaders specifically criticize Iran as “the principal source of regional instability and terror,” adding they have been “consistently clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon.”

“We urge that the resolution of the Iranian crisis leads to a broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza,” they wrote. “We will remain vigilant to the implications for international energy markets and stand ready to coordinate, including with like-minded partners, to safeguard market stability.”

Earlier Monday, the White House appeared to confirm reports Trump was considering not signing onto the G7 leaders' Iran-Israel statement.

“Under the strong leadership of President Trump, the United States is back to leading the effort to restore peace around the world,” a White House official told the Washington Examiner. “President Trump will continue to work towards ensuring Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon.”

This year's G7 host, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, had previewed prior to this week's summit that there would be no leaders joint communique to conclude the meeting because of deep disagreements between Trump and the rest of the group on issues from the Russia-Ukraine war to tariffs. Instead, separate statements will continue to be issued underscoring areas of agreement, though Trump is not expected to sign onto the G7 sanctions package against Russia.

The late-night statement on Iran caps a dramatic day in the Canadian city of Kananaskis, where the summit is poised to continue without Trump on Tuesday. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not even scheduled to arrive in Canada until Tuesday morning. Trump's early departure upends plans for him to meet with Zelensky and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, in addition to holding a press conference.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt surprised reporters on Monday when she announced that Trump was returning to Washington early to “attend to many important matters.”

Leavitt then issued a clarifying statement, citing the conflict in the Middle East and the progress Trump made during the first day of the two-day summit.

“President Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer,” she wrote. “Much was accomplished, but because of what's going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.”

President Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Much was accomplished, but because of what's going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.

Trump had posted his own cryptic statement on social media earlier in the day, advising the approximately 9.5 million residents of Iran's capital, Tehran, to evacuate.

“Iran should have signed the ‘deal' I told them to sign,” he wrote. “What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!”

TRUMP IN CANADA: CARNEY ON ‘HIGH-WIRE ACT' TO AVOID G7 SUMMIT ENDING AS A G6

En route back to his own capital, where he has reportedly asked his National Security Council to be ready for him, Trump posted a sharp critique of French President Emmanuel Macron, too. Macron had indirectly undermined Trump before the G7 summit by stopping in Greenland, which Trump has promised to annex, and expressing his support before traveling on to Canada.

“Publicity seeking President Emmanuel Macron, of France, mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a ‘cease fire' between Israel and Iran,” Trump wrote. “Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong. Stay Tuned!”

NEW DELHI (AP) — Investigators in India are studying the black boxes of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner after recovering them from the aircraft wreckage to ascertain the cause of last week's plane crash that left at least 270 people dead.

The black boxes will provide cockpit conversations and data related to the plane's engine and control settings to investigators and help them in determining the cause of the crash.

The London-bound Air India aircraft, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, crashed on a medical college hostel soon after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad. Only one passenger survived the crash, while 241 people on board and 29 on the ground were killed in one of India's worst aviation disaster in decades.

Experts from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau are probing the crash with assistance from the U.K., the U.S. and officials from Boeing.

Amit Singh, a former pilot and an aviation expert, said the recovery of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, or black boxes, are crucial to piece together the sequence of events.

The cockpit voice recorder records pilots' conversation, emergency alarms and any distress signal made before a crash. The plane's digital flight data recorder stores information related to engine and control settings. Both devices are designed to survive a crash.

“The data will reveal everything,” Singh said, adding that the technical details could be corroborated by the cockpit voice recorder that would help investigators know of any communication between air traffic control and the pilots.

India's aviation regulatory body has said the aircraft made a mayday call before the crash.




Singh said the investigating authorities will scan CCTV footage of the nearby area and speak with witnesses to get to the root cause of the crash.

Additionally, Singh said, the investigators will also study the pilot training records, total load of the aircraft, thrust issues related to the plane's engine, as well as its worthiness in terms of past performances and any previously reported issues.

Aurobindo Handa, former director general of India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, said the investigators across the world follow a standard UN-prescribed Manual of Accident Investigation, also called “DOC 9756,” which outlines detailed procedures to arrive at the most probable cause of a crash. 

Handa said the investigation into last week's crash would likely be a long process as the aircraft was badly charred. He added that ascertaining the condition of the black boxes recovered from the crash site was vital as the heat generated from the crash could be possibly higher than the bearable threshold of the device.

The Indian government has set up a separate, high-level committee to examine the causes leading to the crash and formulate procedures to prevent and handle aircraft emergencies in the future. The committee is expected to file a preliminary report within three months.

Authorities have also begun inspecting and carrying out additional maintenance and checks of Air India's entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners to prevent any future incident. Air India has 33 Dreamliners in its fleet.

The plane that crashed was 12 years old. Boeing planes have been plagued by safety issues on other types of aircraft. There are currently around 1,200 of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft worldwide and this was the first deadly crash in 16 years of operation, according to experts.

            President Donald Trump's order to block incoming foreign students from attending Harvard University will remain on hold temporarily following a hearing Monday, when a lawyer for the Ivy League school said Trump was using its students as “pawns.”
    


            US District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston extended a temporary restraining order on Trump's proclamation until June 23 while she weighs Harvard's request for a preliminary injunction. Burroughs made the decision at a hearing over Harvard's request, which Trump's Republican administration opposed.
    


            Burroughs granted the initial restraining order June 5, and it had been set to expire Thursday.
    


Attacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months. A timeline of the dispute



            Trump moved to block foreign students from entering the US to attend Harvard earlier this month, citing concerns over national security. It followed a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard's ability to host foreign students on its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Burroughs has temporarily blocked that action, too, and is weighing whether it should remain on hold until the case is decided.
    


            Ian Gershengorn, a lawyer for Harvard, told Burroughs on Monday that Trump was “using Harvard's international students as pawns” while arguing the administration has exceeded its authority in an attempt to retaliate against the school for not agreeing to the president's demands.
    


            “I think there is no finding that Harvard is dangerous,” he said.
    


            Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after it rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status.
    


            Foreign students were brought into the battle in April, when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short, and on May 22 she revoked Harvard's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.
    


            The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world's top students and harmed Harvard's reputation as a global research hub, the school said in its lawsuit. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the suit said.
    


Judge halts Trump's proclamation to suspend new international student visas at Harvard hours after university filed amended lawsuit



            The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard's students, including two universities in Hong Kong.
    


            While Harvard's legal team on Monday said the federal government was unfairly and illegally singling the university out in Trump's proclamation, Department of Justice attorney Tiberius Davis countered that the administration has scrutinized dozens of universities over the past two months.
    


            “The power is within Harvard to fix this,” Davis said, adding that currently the federal government believes “other universities might be better” to host foreign students.
    


            Davis was the sole attorney to attend and defend the Trump administration during Monday's hearing compared with the six Harvard attorneys, a contrast that Burroughs commented on repeatedly.
    


            “Not only do you have this case but you have it alone,” she said.
    


            Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its “core, legally-protected principles,” even after receiving federal ultimatums.

            President Donald Trump is under opposing pressure from inside Israel and his own MAGA base as he ponders the most fateful national security decision of either of his presidencies — whether to attempt a killer blow against Iran's nuclear program.
    


            Israel is sending clear signals, including through former senior officials, that it hopes the US will ultimately join the conflict and use its unique military edge to destroy the Iranian nuclear complex at Fordow, which is buried deep underground.
    


            “We believe that the United States of America and the president of the United States have an obligation to make sure that the region is going to a positive way and that the world is free from Iran that possesses (a) nuclear weapon,” former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told CNN's Bianna Golodryga in an interview.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, used an ABC News interview Monday to pour cold water on a diplomatic channel with Iran that Trump seems desperate to revive, saying it had been used to “string the US along.”
    


            A sense that an entwined political and national security crisis is building was exacerbated by Trump's decision to suddenly leave the G7 summit in western Canada on Monday night.
    


            “I have to be back early for obvious reasons,” Trump said. “They understand. This is big stuff.”
    


            He flies home to Washington as it reverberates with blunt warnings from some of the most influential opinion shapers in MAGA media. Personalities like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson say that a decision to strike Iran would represent a repudiation of his 10-year-old political movement and “America First” principles. ”I don't want the US enmeshed in another Middle East war that doesn't serve our interests,” Carlson said on Bannon's “War Room” show on Monday.
    


            Synergy between right and left populist movements in America is also on display. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran as a Democrat primary candidate in the 2016 and 2020 elections, said the US “must not get dragged into another of Netanyahu's wars.”
    


            Loud voices opposed to deeper US involvement underscore the painful legacy of the Iraq and Afghan wars, which created political forces that nurtured Trump's populist uprising. But the neoconservative interventionist wing of the GOP has not disappeared. Hawks like Sen. Lindsey Graham are trying to convince Trump that Israel's blitz against Iranian air defenses and a confluence of forces that have weakened the regime offer the US a chance to definitively end the nuclear aspirations of its 45-year foe and to transform the Middle East.
    


            European leaders who met Trump in Canada brought to bear their own pressure, seeking to see whether the US will rein in Netanyahu amid concern over Trump's suggestion that Russian President Vladimir Putin might join a peace effort.
    


            Even Iran joined the cacophony, accusing Israel of sabotaging US nuclear talks with the Islamic Republic, a centerpiece of the president's so far frustrated strategy of branding himself as a global peacemaker.
    


            Multiple voices bearing down on Trump reflect the gravity of a decision that will carry consequences that go beyond the always-heavy burden of whether to send American personnel to war.
    


            Whatever he decides, Trump will set off consequences that will be pivotal for Israel's security, the wider Middle East, and US power and influence. He can't know whether a US attack on subterranean chambers in Fordow could succeed or whether it will suck the US deeper into a prolonged conflict.
    


            Historically, Trump has balked at perceptions that his options are being narrowed — or that others are trying to make up his mind for him. So pressure from any direction risks being counterproductive.
    


            Ironically, Trump set up this dilemma himself. His decision to walk away from a previous US nuclear deal with Iran in his first term delighted Israel — but laid the groundwork for a future crisis.
    


            The raging debate in the MAGA movement that is splitting conservative media is a sign that Trump's own support base is on the line, and that a legacy he promised would not be marked by foreign interventionism is also at stake.
    


            Trump often creates shock and disorientates opponents by igniting confrontations that he later defuses or postpones. This is his preferred approach to trade wars. But there would be no going back from a US military strike with bunker-busting bombs at Fordow. Whatever the aftermath, the president would own it.
    


            This may explain why he avoided committing himself to any course of action on Monday. He said Iran has “to make a deal” and should talk immediately “before it is too late.” But pressed by reporters on what would cause a direct US intervention in the conflict, he replied, “I don't want to talk about that.”
    


            On Monday evening, the president wrote on Truth Social that “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON” and said everyone should “immediately evacuate Tehran,” although he did not explain why he would issue such a warning.
    


            Perhaps Trump is just playing for time or trying to scare Tehran back to the table. But maybe he really doesn't know what he's going to do.
    


            Iran has so far not directly targeted US bases or personnel, nor has it widened the conflict — for instance, by going after shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, which could trigger global economic shockwaves. That may be a sign that it wants to avoid pulling Trump in. But it is generally agreed that while Israel can delay Iran's nuclear program, only the US can destroy it.
    


            In an extraordinary interview with CNN's Golodryga, Gallant warned that Trump had the future of the world in his hands.
    


            “This could be a disaster for the world,” he said, referring to the possibility of an Iranian bomb. “And I believe that the determination of the American president that has been shown recently will pave the way to America to enter into this very important operation,” Gallant said. “The president of the United States (has) the option to change the Middle East and influence the world.”
    


            Another former Israeli defense minister, Benny Gantz, also noted unique US military assets. “I do remember that the United States is much stronger than us. It has capabilities that we don't possess. But I'm not in a position to recommend to the president of the United States what to do,” Gantz told CNN's Anderson Cooper. “I am sure that the United States, if it decides to act, will do it for its own interests and not our interests only.”
    


            Israel's President Isaac Herzog implied that Trump had been taken for a ride in his pursuit of a diplomatic solution. “You can speak (of a) peaceful diplomatic (solution), and on the other hand, underneath you move forward to the bomb. And that was exactly the situation,” Herzog told Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.”
    


            And Netanyahu aimed a message at Trump's MAGA critics. “Today, it's Tel Aviv. Tomorrow, it's New York. Look, I understand ‘America First.' I don't understand ‘America Dead'. That's what these people want,” Netanyahu told ABC.
    


            A sincere debate over Iran is underway inside Trump's grassroots movement, and it is causing splits across the right-wing media empires that normally support the president unequivocally.
    


            Bannon argued that a major new US escapade in the Middle East would deviate from the core principles of Trumpism, which involved avoiding “forever wars,” expelling undocumented migrants, securing the border and confronting China to bring back US manufacturing jobs. He said on “War Room” that Israel had to make sovereign decisions for itself, as any nation should. “But when you start making decision that are predicated on the assumption that America is going to come in, not just for defense but for offense … No, we have to make decisions that put America first.”
    


            Bannon went on: “This has to be thought through. This Pearl Harbor-type attack on the mullahs is fine for Israel. But is it right for the United States?” He concluded that the real war that the US faces is against undocumented migrants on its own soil.
    


            A fundamental question underpins this internal MAGA debate: If “America First” is not about avoiding the kind of Middle East quagmires that that ruined President George W. Bush's Republican presidency, does it really mean anything?
    


            Trump's political success was forged in the US heartland, in the kind of towns that sent their young to fight and die in the post-9/11 wars. Those conflicts started with shock-and-awe initial success like the one Israel is celebrating with its elimination of top Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists. But they degenerated into bloody slogs that still haunt American politics. No one is openly talking of a betrayal yet. But just a month ago, in Saudi Arabia, Trump restated his opposition to interventionism and nation-building in the Middle East.
    


            On the left, there was already antipathy toward Netanyahu because of the terrible toll on Palestinian civilians of his war on Hamas. But Sanders also seemed to be vying for Trump's attention, warning in a statement, “The attack was specifically designed to sabotage American diplomatic efforts: Israel assassinated the man overseeing Iran's nuclear negotiating team, despite the fact that further talks with the United States were scheduled for Sunday.”
    


            An allergy to such foreign entanglements is not just endemic to Trump's political project: His two predecessors, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, felt much the same way.
    


            But now it's fallen to Trump to make a decision that every modern president dreaded.

            The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee on Monday released its proposal for President Donald Trump's agenda bill that calls for enacting sweeping cuts to Medicaid and preventing a multi-trillion dollar tax hike on Americans.
    


            The committee would maintain many of the provisions contained in the legislation that the House narrowly approved last month, including making permanent essentially all the individual income tax cuts contained in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are set to expire at year's end, and instituting work requirements in Medicaid for the first time.
    


            But the committee is calling for some notable changes to the package, including lowering the cap on state and local tax deductions, instituting deeper cuts to Medicaid, slowing the elimination of some clean energy tax credits and making permanent several business tax breaks and a beefed-up child tax credit.
    


            Senate committees are racing to release their versions of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” in hopes of passing their package next week so the two chambers can work out a final deal and send it to Trump by July 4.
    


            But top Senate Republicans are running into some resistance from several key senators about the details of the bill, potentially complicating plans to deliver that package by their own deadline.
    


            In the legislative text unveiled Monday, the Senate Finance Committee would permanently extend the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, potentially blowing up a carefully constructed deal in the House to lift the cap on state and local deductions to $40,000 for married couples. However, the committee noted in a summary of its provisions that the cap is “the subject of continuing negotiations.”
    


            The $10,000 cap, which was instituted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was a major sticking point in the House negotiations. Speaker Mike Johnson worked out an agreement with GOP lawmakers from high-tax states to raise the cap to $40,000 for those making $500,000 or less.
    


            But Senate Republicans have expressed disdain for the deal because of its price tag and because it primarily benefits taxpayers from blue states.
    


            Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, issued a stern warning to Senate Republicans earlier on Monday: Any changes to pare back the deal, he said, would cause the bill to collapse in the House.
    


            “After engaging in good faith negotiations, we were able to increase the cap on SALT from $10,000 to $40,000,” Lawler said in a statement. “That is the deal, and I will not accept a penny less. If the Senate reduces the SALT number, I will vote NO, and the bill will fail in the House.”
    


            Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee are also calling for making permanent several tax breaks for businesses, including allowing companies to immediately deduct the cost of equipment and research and development in the year the expense was incurred. These are designed to enhance the economic growth potential of the package but would also increase the cost.
    


            The committee would also permanently beef up the child tax credit to $2,200, in contrast to the House, which would increase the credit to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028.
    


            And while the Senate committee would keep Trump's campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, it would place caps on that relief –- allowing tipped workers to deduct only up to $25,000 in tip income and limiting the deduction for overtime pay to $12,500 for a single worker. Those tax breaks would only be in place from 2025 through 2028, as in the House version.
    


            But the Senate measure would provide a more generous deduction for senior citizens than the House bill: $6,000 versus $4,000. The provision would be in effect from 2025 through 2028 in both versions of the bill.
    


            In a contentious move, the committee would cap most states' ability to levy provider taxes on certain health care providers – notably, hospitals – to 3.5% by 2031, down from the current 6% limit. However, that provision would only apply to the 40 states and the District of Columbia that have expanded Medicaid to low-income adults.
    


            States that have not expanded Medicaid, which are largely GOP-led states, would be restricted from increasing the rate of their current provider taxes, which would not have as sizable an impact.
    


            The issue of provider taxes has divided GOP lawmakers, with conservatives arguing that states use these taxes to get more federal Medicaid matching funds, while more moderate members worry that limiting such taxes could hurt hospitals, particularly those in rural areas.
    


            States use the revenue they raise from taxing providers to boost provider rates and fund health-related initiatives, among other uses. Every state except one levies at least one type of provider tax.
    


            Also, the Senate would require more parents to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month to maintain their Medicaid benefits. The committee would mandate that parents of children ages 15 and older would be subject to the work requirement, while the House version exempted parents of dependent children.
    


            The Senate's changes would likely result in even more people losing their Medicaid coverage than the House provisions, which would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 7.8 million in 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
    


            The Senate Finance Committee text would kill a consumer tax credit for electric vehicles and quickly phase out tax credits helping homeowners defray the cost of energy efficient appliances and rooftop solar, ending those by next year.
    


            The Senate text differs somewhat from the House bill on energy tax credits for businesses producing electricity. Like the House bill, it hits wind and solar producers particularly hard, phasing out clean energy tax credits for those projects starting next year, with the credit ending by 2028. However, companies generating electricity with zero-emission sources like nuclear, geothermal or hydropower can claim the credit for a longer period of time.
    


            The Senate text is more generous than the House when it comes to a tax credit that businesses could claim for battery and clean energy manufacturing, although it eliminates that credit for wind turbine manufacturers by 2027. The text would also terminate a tax credit for companies that make clean hydrogen, something favored by the oil and gas industry.
    


            The Senate committee would raise the debt limit by $5 trillion, compared to $4 trillion in the House version, providing more time for Trump to enact his policies without needing to negotiate a deal with Democrats to address the cap.
    


            The US hit its roughly $36 trillion debt ceiling in January. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the cap before its August recess to allow the agency to continue paying the nation's bills in full and on time, preventing a default that would likely have catastrophic global economic consequences.

Fox News host Jesse Watters breaks down how Iran has lost any leverage in its conflict with Israel on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

President Donald Trump decided to cut his trip to the G7 short on Monday, shortly after he said on his social media platform, Truth Social, that "everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!"

In addition to Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in Alberta, Canada, this week for the G7 conference, will be cutting his trip short as well, Fox News has learned.

"I have to be back," Trump said during a ceremonial photo-op with the other world leaders present at the G7 summit on Monday. "You probably see what I see. And I have to be back as soon as I can."

LIVE UPDATES: ISRAEL-IRAN CONFLICT

The president's comments came amid confirmation from the White House that he would be cutting the trip short "because of what's going on in the Middle East." Trump, meanwhile, has requested his National Security Council be prepared for his return, Fox News learned.

Trump's change of plans also comes after he sent a message on his Truth Social platform to "everyone" in Iran, telling them they should "evacuate." 

Following the president's post, videos purportedly showing Iranians evacuating their capital city have begun surfacing on social media.

Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Fox News before heading to the situation room Monday night that the U.S. remains "postured defensively."

"What you're watching in real time is peace through strength and America first. Our job is to be strong. We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal," Hegseth told Fox News' Jesse Waters Monday night. 

"My job as the secretary of defense is to ensure that our people are safe and that we're strong so that we can set the conditions for a deal. And President Trump's made it clear it's on the table. The question is whether Iran will take it."

IDF International Spokesman (Res.) Doron Spielman provides an update on the Israel-Iran conflict on 'Fox & Friends.'

Former Cincinnati Reds shortstop Zack Cozart was a staunch supporter of Donald Trump as he defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris for the White House in the 2024 presidential election.

But the one-time MLB All-Star drew a line in his support for the president on Monday as Trump called for mass evacuations in Tehran while tensions between Israel and Iran escalated.

"If Trump gets us in a war, I will no longer support him, and I'm sure most of you know I love Trump," Cozart wrote in a post on X.

Trump is set to depart the G7 summit in Canada on Monday night because of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.

"President Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. "Much was accomplished, but because of what's going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State."

Trump has requested that the National Security Council be prepared in the situation room for his return, Fox News has learned.

Meanwhile, White House spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer dismissed reports the U.S. military was joining Israel in an attack on Iran.

"This is not true. American forces are maintaining their defensive posture, and that has not changed. We will defend American interests," Pfeiffer wrote on X.

Cozart came out in support of Trump ahead of the president's speech at the Republican National Convention nearly a year ago.

"I dunno bout yall but I can't wait to vote for Trump… I've honestly never seen the party as united as now… they tried to kill our President … least we can do is VOTE!!" he wrote.

Cozart played in Major League Baseball from 2011 to 2019. The Tennessee native was a second-round pick of the Reds in 2007. He played with the Los Angeles Angels for the final two years of his career in 2018 and 2019.

He played in 839 career games, batted .247 with a .300 on-base percentage and a .699 OPS with 87 career home runs and 305 RBI.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. will launch a pilot for a token called JPMD that represents dollar deposits at the world's biggest bank, as financial institutions deepen their push into the digital-asset sector.

In a transaction expected to take place within days, JPMorgan will move a fixed amount worth of JPMD from the bank's digital wallet to the biggest US crypto exchange, Coinbase Global Inc., Naveen Mallela, global co-head of the bank's blockchain division Kinexys by JPMorgan, said in an interview.

Israel-Iran War:

President Donald Trump was meeting with his national security team in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the escalating Middle East conflict, according to people familiar with the matter, fueling fresh speculation that the US is on the verge of joining Israel's attack on Iran. 

Before gathering his advisers in the White House Situation Room, Trump posted a demand for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” and warned of a possible strike against the country's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump posted on social media.

India's aviation safety watchdog said on Tuesday surveillance conducted on Air India's Boeing fleet did not reveal any major safety concerns, days after one of its jets crashed, killing at least 271 people.

"The aircraft and associated maintenance systems were found to be compliant with existing safety standards," the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said in a statement.

The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner bound for London with 242 people on board crashed seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday hitting nearby buildings. All but one passenger on board was killed, along with about 30 people on the ground.

The DGCA also said 24 of Air India's 33 Boeing 787 aircraft had completed an "enhanced safety inspection" it had ordered the airline to carry out.

The regulator, in a meeting with senior officials of Air India, raised concerns about recent maintenance-related issues reported by the airline.

It advised the carrier to "strictly adhere to regulations," strengthen coordination across its businesses and ensure availability of adequate spares to mitigate passenger delays, it added.

The DGCA had met senior officials of Air India and Air India Express to review their operations amid increasing flight volumes.

A new savings account for children with a one-time deposit of $1,000 from the federal government remained in the U.S. Senate's version of President Donald Trump's budget bill.

Under the proposal, so-called "Trump accounts," a type of tax-advantaged saving accounts, would be available to all children under the age of eight years old who are U.S. citizens. In earlier versions of the proposal, Trump accounts were termed "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA accounts."

If the bill passes as drafted, parents will be able to contribute up to $5,000 a year and the balance will be invested in a diversified fund that tracks a U.S.-stock index. This part of the Senate Republicans' version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was largely unchanged from the House plan advanced in May.

Not unlike a 529 college savings plan, Trump accounts come with a tax incentive. Earnings grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are taxed as long-term capital gains.

Under both the House and Senate versions of the bill, withdrawals could begin at age 18, at which point account holders can tap up to half of the funds for education expenses or credentials, the down payment on a first home or as capital to start a small business.

At 25, account holders can use the full balance for expenses that fall under those same guidelines and at 30, they can use the money for any reason. Distributions taken for qualified purposes are taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate, while distributions for any other purpose are taxed as ordinary income.

For children born between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2028, the federal government will deposit $1,000 into the Trump account, funded by the Department of the Treasury, as part of a "newborn pilot program," according to the Senate Finance Committee's proposed text released on Monday.

To be eligible to receive the initial seed money, a child must be a U.S. citizen at birth and both parents must have Social Security numbers.

If a parent or guardian does not open an account, the Secretary of Treasury will establish an account on the child's behalf. Parents may also opt out.

The White House and Republican lawmakers have said these accounts will introduce more Americans to wealth-building opportunities and the benefits of compound growth. But some experts say the Trump accounts are also overly complicated, making it harder to reach lower-income families.

Universal savings accounts, with fewer strings attached, would be a simpler alternative proposal at a lower price tag, according to Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a public policy think tank.

"I'm disappointed the Senate did not take the opportunity to improve these accounts," Michel said. Still, "provisions that remain in both the House and Senate text, we should expect them to become law, and this provision fits that criteria." 

Mark Higgins, senior vice president at Index Fund Advisors and author of "Investing in U.S. Financial History: Understanding the Past to Forecast the Future," said the key is "if the benefits comfortably exceed the cost."

According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump accounts would add $17 billion to the deficit over the next decade.

One provision in Republicans' "big beautiful" bill would narrow the relief options for struggling student loan borrowers. House and Senate Republicans both call for the elimination of both the economic hardship and unemployment deferment.

Those deferments allow federal student loan borrowers to pause their monthly bills during periods of joblessness or other financial setbacks, often without interest accruing on their debt.

Less attention has been paid to the GOP plan to do away with the deferments than its proposals to eliminate several student loan repayment plans and to establish a minimum monthly payment for borrowers.

The House advanced its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in May. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions released its budget bill recommendations related to student loans on June 10. Senate lawmakers are preparing to debate the massive tax and spending package.

Nixing the deferments could have major consequences, said Abby Shafroth, director of the National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project.

"I'm concerned this is going to lead more people to default on their student loans when they encounter a job loss, surprise medical expense or other economic hardship," Shafroth said.

The Trump administration said this spring that the number of student loan borrowers in default could soon rise from more than 5 million to roughly 10 million in the coming months.

Under the Senate Republicans' proposal, student loans received on or after July 1, 2026 would no longer qualify for the unemployment deferment or economic hardship deferment. The House plan does away with both deferments a year earlier, on July 1, 2025.

The unemployment deferment is typically available to student loan borrowers who are seeking but unable to find full-time employment or are eligible for jobless benefits, among other requirements, according to the National Consumer Law Center. Under the deferment, borrowers can pause their payments for up to six months at a time, and for a total of three years over the life of the loan.

The absence of the relief "means that for someone who lost their job and is struggling to keep their head above water, the government will demand monthly payments on student loans," Shafroth said.

The bill comes as the share of entry-level employees who report feeling positive about their employers' business prospects dropped to around 43% in May, a record low, according to a recent report by Glassdoor.

The economic hardship deferment, meanwhile, is generally available to student loan borrowers who receive public assistance, earn below a certain income threshold or work in the Peace Corps. The total time a borrower can spend in an economic hardship deferment is also three years.

The end of the deferments "eliminates one of the key benefits on subsidized loans," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

Persis Yu, deputy executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, agreed.

"The ability of borrowers to pause payments and interest on subsidized loans during financial shocks and hardship is a critical benefit of the federal loan program," Yu said.

Around 150,000 federal student loan holders were enrolled in the unemployment deferment in the second quarter of 2025, while around 70,000 borrowers had qualified for an economic hardship deferment, according to data by the U.S. Department of Education.

The absence of the deferments will push more federal student loan borrowers into a forbearance, experts say, during which interest continues to climb on their debt and borrowers often resume repayment with a larger bill.

Republicans say doing away with the payment pauses will encourage borrowers to enroll in repayment plan they can afford.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said in a statement on June 10, that his party's proposals would stop requiring that taxpayers who didn't go to college foot the loan payments for those with degrees.

"Biden and Democrats unfairly attempted to shift student debt onto taxpayers that chose not to go to college," Cassidy said.

Cassidy said the higher education legislation, which also stretches out student loan repayment timelines, would save taxpayers at least $300 billion.

Despite some improvement in the economic outlook, respondents to the June CNBC Fed Survey continue to forecast weaker growth and higher inflation than they did at the beginning of the year and most say uncertainty over tariff policy remains high.

The probability of a recession in the next year has fallen to 38%, down from 53% in May, but above the 23% level of January before President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy was unveiled.

Similarly, gross domestic product is now expected to grow 1.13% on average, up from 0.8% in the prior survey, but less than half the January expectation.

Respondents say there remains a considerable lack of clarity with 71% reporting they are very or somewhat uncertain over trade policy.

"Recent geopolitical events in the Middle East add uncertainty into an already uncertain environment on trade, tax policy, and with potentially weakening hard macroeconomic data pending," said Doug Gordon, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments. "Recession can be avoided, although this will require some help in mitigating some of these sources of volatility."

The help, he said, comes from trade deals and tax policy, with 29% saying the current tax bill in Congress makes them more optimistic about growth and 29% say it makes them more pessimistic; 43% say it has no effect on their growth outlook.

Yet 82% believe it will "somewhat" or "significantly increase" the federal budget deficit.

A 54% majority expect the U.S. to strike a new trade deal with China, compared with 39% who do not. On average, those looking for a trade deal believe it will be signed within about five months.

"While it appears that the worst-case scenario when it comes to tariffs will not happen, the best-case scenario still implies significantly higher tariffs and therefore higher inflation for an extended period,'' said Joel Naroff, president, Naroff Economics.

The Federal Reserve is expected to stand pat at the June meeting and not cut rates until September. The 28 respondents, who include economists, fund managers and analysts, see two rate reductions this year, bringing the funds rate down to 3.9% by year-end, but only one 25 basis point cut next year.

"There are multiple cross currents from geopolitical events that the Fed will have to weigh," said Constance Hunter, chief economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. "The see-saw between slower growth and adverse supply shocks are difficult to forecast, however we expect slower growth will ultimately be what causes the Fed to move closer to a neutral stance."

Asked how the Fed would react to a stagflationary outcome of higher prices and weaker growth, 54% believe the central bank will cut rates while 39% see the Fed holding rates steady. That's a bit more hawkish than May when 65% saw the Fed cutting.

By a slim margin, respondents don't believe the Fed will face that dilemma: 43% believe tariffs will result in just "one-time price increases" while 32% say they create a broader inflationary problem.

However, 61% say tariff inflation in future months will show up "more significantly" than it has, while 36% see it as appearing "only modestly."

"I expect (economic) moderation going forward as tariffs get incorporated into consumer prices and slower job growth due in part to a slower pace of immigration providing less fuel for aggregate disposable income," said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation.

Amid all those concerns, Mark Vitner, chief economist at Piedmont Crescent Capital & CAVU Securities, notes that the economy has remained "Resilient, Not 'Tariffied.'"

"There's no shortage of reasons to worry — elevated interest rates, huge budget deficits, geopolitical flare-ups, tariff threats — but the U.S. economy keeps proving its doubters wrong."

He added, "Consumers continue to spend, and businesses are doubling down on future-facing infrastructure: AI, life sciences, DefenseTech, and other emerging technologies."

Indeed, the outlook for stocks rose, with the S&P 500 now expected to hit 6,133 by year, for a modest 1.7% rise from current levels, but a more robust 10% increase to 6,625 by the end of 2026.

"Equity markets are near all-time highs in anticipation of certainty replacing uncertainty on tariffs, the 2017 tax cuts getting extended, deregulation, AI productivity, and Fed easing," said Hank Smith, head of investment strategy, Haverford Trust Co. "If all of this occurs, the economy should reaccelerate in the second half into '26."

When it comes to current stock levels, 58% believe they are overpriced, and 36% believe them to be correctly priced relative to their outlook for earnings and the economy. Just 7% see equities as underpriced.

A blistering rally in a tiny, money-losing traditional Chinese medicine company's stock has vaulted its founder's net worth to among the world's 100 largest fortunes.

The firm, Hong Kong-based Regencell Bioscience Holding Ltd., was for all intents and purposes trading as a microcap stock on the Nasdaq just eight weeks ago. But its shares have since exploded, gaining more than 46,000% this year as of Monday's close. The move has boosted the value of Chief Executive Officer Yat-Gai Au's 86% stake to $25.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making Au's paper wealth greater than rich-list stalwarts such as Jerry Jones and Masayoshi Son.

The Trump administration is discussing policies that would make it harder and more expensive for pharmaceutical companies to advertise directly to patients, in a move that could disrupt more than $10 billion in annual ad spending.

Although the US is the only place, besides New Zealand, where pharma companies can directly advertise, banning pharma ads outright could make the administration vulnerable to lawsuits, so it's instead focusing on cutting down on the practice by adding legal and financial hurdles, according to people familiar with the plans who weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

Higher mortgage rates and uncertainty in the broader economy continue to weigh on consumers — and consequently on the nation's homebuilders.

Builder sentiment in June dropped 2 points from May to 32 on the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI). Anything below 50 is considered negative. The index stood at 43 in June 2024.

Analysts had been expecting a slight improvement, given recent tariff negotiations and pullbacks by the Trump administration.

This index has only seen a lower reading than June's level twice since 2012 – in December 2022, after mortgage rates shot up from record lows during the first two years of the pandemic, and in April 2020 at the very start of the pandemic.

Of the index's three components, current sales conditions fell 2 points to 35, sales expectations in the next six months dropped 2 points to 40, and buyer traffic fell 2 points to 21, the lowest reading on that metric since the end of 2023.

"Buyers are increasingly moving to the sidelines due to elevated mortgage rates and tariff and economic uncertainty," said Buddy Hughes, NAHB chairman and a homebuilder from Lexington, North Carolina, in a release. "To help address affordability concerns and bring hesitant buyers off the fence, a growing number of builders are moving to cut prices."

In the June survey, 37% of builders said they had cut prices, the highest share since NAHB started tracking the monthly metric three years ago. That is up from 34% who reported cutting prices in May and 29% in April. The average price reduction was 5%, which has been steady since late last year.

"Rising inventory levels and prospective home buyers who are on hold waiting for affordability conditions to improve are resulting in weakening price growth in most markets and generating price declines for resales in a growing number of markets," said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the NAHB. "Given current market conditions, NAHB is forecasting a decline in single-family starts for 2025."

The report follows quarterly earnings from Lennar, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, in which the second-quarter average home price dropped nearly 9% from the same quarter in 2024. Guidance on new orders and deliveries was also below analysts' expectations.

"As mortgage interest rates remained higher and consumer confidence continued to weaken, we drove volume with starts while incentivizing sales to enable affordability and help consumers to purchase homes," said Lennar co-CEO Stuart Miller in an earnings release.

Regionally, on a three-month moving average, the South and West showed the weakest builder sentiment. Those are the regions where the most homes are built.

The PGA Tour on Tuesday named top NFL executive Brian Rolapp its next chief executive officer to succeed current Commissioner Jay Monahan. 

Monahan will begin to transition his day-to-day responsibilities to Rolapp and will step down at the end of 2026. Monahan said he informed the board last year of his intention to step down in 2026 after a decade leading the organization.

"We've found exactly the right leader in Brian Rolapp, and I'm excited to support him as he transitions from the NFL into his new role leading the PGA Tour," Monahan said in a statement.

In an open letter published on Tuesday, Rolapp talked about the respect he has for golf's history and rich traditions but said there is still work to do and incredible opportunities ahead.

Rolapp said after talking with players, board members and fans in recent months, he plans to focus on strengthening the Tour's commercial partnerships.

"Professional golf is evolving, as are the ways fans consume sports. My goal as CEO is to honor golf's traditions but not be overly bound by them," he said. 

Over the course of Monahan's tenure as commissioner, he helped secure $1.5 billion in investment for the league, created equity opportunities for players and launched a Fan Forward initiative, according to a news release. 

Yet, those efforts were often overshadowed by a pending merger with Saudi-backed LIV Golf. The two announced their intention to merge in June 2023, but have yet to reach an agreement.  

Rolapp, who was considered a top successor candidate for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, brings decades of experience in forging high-profile media partnerships.

As the NFL's Chief Media and Business Officer, Rolapp oversaw the league's commercial, broadcast and digital rights.

The PGA Tour will be renewing its media rights agreements with key partners ahead of the current deal's expiration in 2030.

"Brian's appointment is a win for players and fans," said golf legend Tiger Woods in a statement. "He has a clear respect for the game and our players and brings a fresh perspective from his experience in the NFL."

Think you know what bosses are looking for? Think again.

Getting hired and promoted used to hinge on traditional leadership traits like executive presence and vision. But in today's world, those aren't enough. As a CEO, board member and MBA professor, my research shows that a sharper, more relevant set of criteria is rising to the top. And it's long overdue.

At NYU's Stern School of Business, I teach a popular class called "Becoming You." Students start by identifying their values using a tool called The Values Bridge, then explore careers that match their aptitudes and emotional, intellectual and economic needs. Finally, and critically, they assess their leadership capacity.

I used to rely on old-school aptitude tests for that last part (think: the kind your college counselor used). But over time, I saw that those tools were built for a world that no longer exists. Today's professionals face nonstop change, geopolitical chaos and ambiguity about, well, everything.

So I set out to identify the traits that actually matter now — and tested them through consulting projects with a dozen companies across industries. Focus groups and manager surveys refined the list. And now, I use these four traits in every hiring decision I make.

When I see all four in one person? I try to hire them on the spot.

The business environment today is fast, unforgiving and always on. Leaders need uncommon levels of physical and mental stamina — and not in short bursts, but continuously. Nerve means making fast, high-stakes decisions with incomplete or conflicting information. That takes real confidence.

It also means having the courage to deliver tough truths with empathy. People who combine candor with kindness are rare — but invaluable. Nerve is courage, clarity, speed, transparency and an unrelenting bias for action.

According to LinkedIn, professionals needed to update 25% of their skills every 18 months from 2015 to 2020. That "skill churn" is expected to hit 65% in the years ahead. So yes, adaptability has always mattered. But today, it's mission-critical.

Elasticity isn't just tolerating change — it's actually enjoying reinvention. It's a mindset that says, "Bring on the new." I often look for what I call "irregular relationships": friendships, mentorships or collaborations with people very different from oneself. They signal flexibility, openness and the social curiosity that underpins comfort with change.

It's always been important to be steady at work. What's changed is how rare it's become. Managers tell me their best people are anxious, withdrawn or just worn out. The pace and pressure of work today are real — and intense.

That's why managers are putting a premium on soundness: a bundle of traits that includes positivity, accountability, resilience and self-awareness. You can ask colleagues for feedback on the first three. But self-awareness? That's the only trait on this list you can — and should — test for. If you're job searching or feeling stalled in your career, start there.

In a world that's always changing, your currency is your currency. In other words, how "current" you are (on trends, technology, culture and ideas) directly affects how valuable you are to your organization.

Gone are the days when you could stay informed just by talking to colleagues or skimming a few news platforms. The most successful people don't just absorb what's next — they share it in-house, sparking fresh thinking across teams. Wonderment is intellectual curiosity, cultural fluency, peer around corners and the proactive instinct to bring the outside in.

Wondering how you would rate on all of these traits? You can find out for free using The Career Traits Compass, which I designed to help both my MBA students — and professionals seeking career growth.

Now, obviously, every role has its own must-haves. Values matter. Skills matter. But these four traits? They're what every leader is quietly scanning for. And if you've got them all, trust me: Someone is already plotting how to hire you, even if they're not hiring.

Crude oil futures rose more than 4% on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump demanded Iran's unconditional surrender and threatened its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The U.S. crude oil contract for July delivery gained $3.07, or 4.28%, to close at $74.84 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent for August rose $3.22, or 4.4%, to settle at $76.45. Prices continued to rise after Tuesday's settlement with U.S. crude and Brent both up nearly 5%.

Trump threatened Khamenei as "an easy target," warning Iran's leader that U.S. "patience is wearing thin." The president then called for Iran's unconditional surrender on his social media platform Truth Social.

"We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding," Trump said in a social media post Tuesday. "He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin."

Trump met Tuesday afternoon with his national security team in the White House Situation Room. At the same time, the Pentagon moved assets to the Middle East Tuesday, increasing U.S. military capabilities for defensive positions and expanding Trump's options.

Oil prices had closed lower Monday on reports that Iran was seeking a ceasefire with Israel, but those hopes faded as the conflict went on for a fifth day with Trump taking a harder line against Iran. Trump left the Group of Seven summit in Canada early and demanded that everyone evacuate Iran's capital city.

"Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON," the president said in a social media post late Monday. "I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!"

Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was looking for "a real end" to the conflict, "not a ceasefire" agreement. The president said he was "not too much in the mood to negotiate" with Iran. Trump said there was no specific threat that led to his call for people in Tehran to evacuate.

The impact of the conflict on the oil futures market has been modest so far, with prices rising about 10% since Israel launched its air campaign against Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs on Friday.

The oil market has been relatively calm in the face of the conflict because the world is well supplied with crude, said Amos Hochstein, former President Joe Biden's senior energy advisor. OPEC+ is increasing supply to the market and U.S. production remains at record levels, Hochstein said.

Oil traders initially feared that Israel might strike Iran's oil infrastructure in an effort to cripple the Islamic Republic's economy. Israel has hit domestic energy facilities in Iran but has spared installations that export to the global market.

"What the market is seeing is this confidence that Israel is able to continue this escalation with Iran and the war against Iran without the Iranians being able to do very much in response," Hochstein told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Tuesday.

Iran is the third-largest oil producer in OPEC and exports about 1.6 million barrels per day mostly to China, according to data from OPEC and the Energy Information Administration. The market is overlooking the risk that Israel could hit Iran's export facilities and take barrels off the market, Hochstein said.

"The market believes it is able to handle it," Hochstein said of a potential supply disruption.

The worst case-scenario for the oil market would be an attempt by Iran to block the Strait of Hormuz in response to such an Israeli strike. The strait is a narrow waterway between Iran and Oman through which about 20% of the world's oil passes.

Goldman Sachs has warned that such an event could push oil prices above $100 per barrel. But Tehran would likely think twice before making such a move because it could draw the U.S. into the conflict, Hochstein said.

“The moment is approaching very fast, the regime is on the verge of collapse,” says Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, as he discusses the prospect of regime change in Iran amid the Israel-Iran conflict. Pahlavi says there are plans in place not only for “liberation from this regime,” but also “the transition to what we hope will come in a democratic outcome.” (Source: Bloomberg)

In this article

Regencell Bioscience Holdings, an early-stage, Hong Kong-based bioscience company with no revenue, is the latest speculative overseas stock to attract an unusual surge in trading demand.

Shares of Regencell, which says it develops traditional Chinese herb treatments to treat childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, more than tripled on Monday — soaring more than 280% by the close after a 38-for-1 split declared on June 2 took effect. By Monday's close, Regencell, founded in 2014 and traded on Nasdaq under the ticker 'RGC' since 2021, had a total market capitalization of $29.7 billion, according to S&P Capital IQ.

The stock continued to jump on Tuesday, gaining more than 25%. The company's year to date performance is off the charts too, having risen more than 58,000% in 2025. Its current market value of $36 billion tops Lululemon, eBay and Kraft Heinz. The shares traded for pennies at one point in the past one year.

Regencell is the latest example of a speculative international stock attracting attention during summer trading. In August, 2022, for example, AMTD Digital, a Hong Kong-based fintech company, climbed 126%, briefly giving it a market value greater than Coca-Cola and Bank of America.

Earlier this month, Regencell explained the stock split as designed solely "to enhance liquidity in the market for the company's ordinary shares and make the shares more accessible to investors." Stock splits do not change anything fundamentally about a company.

Regencell's surge also came amid an increased focus on alternative medicines after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in February. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, has taken steps to discourage routine immunizations in the U.S., last week removing all of the members of a panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccines.

Regencell's stock often makes huge one-day swings. For example, shares jumped roughly 30% on March 21, before dropping 30% the following trading day.

In spite of the wild spike in the stock, little is known about the efficacy and commercialization of the Regencell's treatments for ADHD and Autistic Spectrum Disorders.

Regencell's business centers on a proprietary Traditional Chinese Medicine formula (TCM) developed in a partnership with TCM practitioner Sik-Kee Au using his "Sik-Kee Au TCM Brain Theory." Sik-Kee Au is the father of the Regencell chief executive officer Yat-Gai Au, the company said in a 2022 statement.

The CEO controls 86.24% of the total number of shares outstanding, according to FactSet data.

Three liquid-based, orally TCM formulae candidates claim to address mild, moderate and severe conditions and only contain natural ingredients such as so-called "detoxication herbs," blood circulation herbs and digestion herbs.

"These TCM formulae form the basis of our TCM product candidates, which we intend to develop and commercialize for the treatment of ADHD and ASD," Regencell's website reads.

In its latest annual report filed last October, Regencell said that it had not generated any revenue, nor filed for any regulatory approvals of its TCM formulas. For the fiscal years ended June 2024 and 2023, Regencell incurred total net losses of $4.36 million and $6.06 million, respectively, according to a 20F filing to the SEC.

"We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable," read the filing.

Regencell has not responded to a CNBC request for comment.

Regencell's latest patient case study, dated Nov. 15, 2023, said 28 patients were given the treatment over a period of three months in a second efficacy trial and showed an improvement in symptoms of ADHD and ASD, according to the company's webpage.

In an earlier case, Regencell said in a 2021 news release that it treated a dozen patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases, using a modified version of Au's modified proprietary cold and flu TCM formula. What was described as an improvement of Covid conditions led Regencell to form a joint venture with Honor Epic Enterprises Limited in Sept. 2021 to conduct further tests and commercialize the company's Covid treatment in ASEAN countries, according to the statement.

The stock has attracted little chatter on social media over the past few years. Those comments that have been made suggest both retail trader enthusiasm — and skepticism.

One user on the Reddit page "r/Shortsqueeze" wrote on Monday that Regencell is "trading like a meme coin. Bought a little to see what happens and it dropped 50% right after lol." Another user said in a post made three months ago, "I scalp RGC everyday for a bit of profit." The stock jumped 1,360% in May alone.

On LinkedIn in May, one investor said he "can't stop laughing," after reading the company description. Another post from a user in the pharmaceutical industry, according to his profile, last week said Regencell has become the "stock to watch" after its spike in May on "no official news or catalysts." Another LinkedIn user last month commented on Regencell, saying, "China based, low volume and no official news, bizarro."

On X, one user wrote in a Monday post said, "for #CompleteBullsh__CompanyOfTheYear I nominate regencell."

Eli Lilly will acquire gene-editing startup Verve Therapeutics for up to $1.3 billion, the companies said on Tuesday, to boost its pipeline of experimental medicines beyond its blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs.

The U.S. drugmaker, which has struck multiple partnership deals with gene-editing companies in the last two years, will buy Verve for $10.5 per share, which is at a premium of 67.5% to the company's last close.

Shares of Boston, Massachusetts-based Verve jumped 76% to $11.03 in premarket trading, while Lilly's stock fell 1%.

The deal includes an upfront payment of almost $1 billion and a further $300 million based on the genetic-medicines firm achieving certain clinical milestones.

The Financial Times was the first to report that the companies were in talks.

Lilly - the world's largest drugmaker by market capitalization - and Verve were already partnering to develop one-time gene-editing therapies to reduce high cholesterol in people with heart disease, which are expected to be used in combination with other drugs.

"We are skeptical about the true market need of additional genetic medicines in these indications," BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said ahead of the deal, pointing to data from other cholesterol-lowering treatments developed by Merck and AstraZeneca.

Verve's lead therapies, which are in early-stage trials, use a form of gene editing known as base editing that causes one-time changes to the DNA, potentially turning off genes that contribute to high cholesterol levels.

Base editing is a next-generation form of gene editing which erases and rewrites a specific letter in a gene.

The company is studying its VERVE-102 therapy in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder that causes high levels of bad cholesterol and premature coronary artery disease.

Verve's gene-editing medicines target the PCSK9, ANGPTL3 and LPA genes responsible for regulating blood cholesterol.

Bitcoin was down by nearly 4% over the past 24 hours as President Donald Trump suggested in a social media post that the U.S. might assassinate Iran's supreme leader, escalating already inflamed tensions in the Middle East.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $103,630, its lowest level in five days, according to market data provider CoinGecko, though it has ticked back up above $104,000 as of this writing. BTC started edging down last Thursday as Iran and Israel began exchanging missile attacks.

Ethereum was recently changing hands at about $2,470, down nearly 6.5% over the past 24 hours. Smart contract platforms Solana and Cardano were both off about 7%, while the leading meme coin Dogecoin had dropped 6.7%.

                    Traditional DevOps tools won't be able to meet the demands of Web3. Our expert explains why crypto-native tools are necessary instead.
                

Not too long ago, blockchain was a fringe technology, but now it is firmly in the mainstream, powering Web3 and actively reshaping industries like finance and logistics. For developers, blockchain's explosive growth brings both opportunities and challenges, as traditional tools simply can't keep up.

As blockchain technology gains momentum, a new wave of DevOps practices must arise to meet the demands of a decentralized future: crypto-native DevOps. It's an exciting frontier where blockchain, cryptocurrency and open-source collaboration converge to drive a new level of transformation.

In the transition from Web2 to Web3, where decentralization rules, developers are no longer just building apps but crafting ecosystems. This responsibility comes with complex requirements that demand new solutions, however. Tools created specifically for blockchain enable developers to keep pace with the demands of these decentralized systems.

Blockchain operates on fundamentally different principles from centralized systems because it is distributed, immutable and governed by consensus. These attributes introduce technical challenges that standard development tools weren't designed to handle.

For example, blockchain apps must manage transactions across decentralized networks. When bottlenecks arise, traditional tools like legacy databases or performance monitoring solutions often struggle to address them. Developers need tools that can optimize workloads for distributed environments.

These new tools must also be able to debug complex smart contracts. Unlike traditional apps, smart contract failures can have irreversible consequences, including locked funds or compromised functionality. Debugging tools for blockchain must be built to handle the unique complexities of decentralized protocols.

Additionally, Web3 tools must be equipped to handle security risks across multiple chains. Blockchain is all about transparency, but this transparency creates vulnerabilities. Developers need blockchain-native security tools that can handle everything from real-time threat detection to cryptographic auditing.

 

Crypto-native DevOps is a new field that refers to developing operational practices and tools specifically for the challenges in blockchain ecosystems. Blockchain-specific tools are not just upgrades from traditional systems but represent entirely new approaches to development that help developers navigate the intricate nature of decentralized architectures and unlock the true potential of Web3.

These tools equip developers with optimized DevOps pipelines. In other words, next-gen DevOps approaches tailored for blockchain make it easy to deploy, scale, and manage decentralized applications (dApps). Tools designed for these ecosystems prioritize automation, providing developers the agility required for continuous integration and deployment.

Take Moralis, for example, which is essentially a backend-as-a-service for Web3. Instead of spending weeks setting up servers, syncing blockchains, and dealing with complicated infrastructure, developers can plug into Moralis and instantly launch their decentralized applications. Think of it as Shopify for Web3. It provides developers with all the tools to build quickly and scale easily, so they can use it to manage users, wallets, and even NFTs without getting bogged down in technical setup. It dramatically shortens the path from idea to execution, and that's gold for lean teams and startups.

Crypto-native tools also provide real-time analytics and monitoring. Distributed systems can experience fluctuations in transaction speeds, consensus mechanisms and node reliability. Blockchain-specific tools equipped with real-time analytics empower developers to maintain performance and anticipate issues before they escalate.

Tenderly is an example of a tool for real-time analytics and performance monitoring. It gives developers a real-time dashboard showing how their smart contracts behave on the blockchain, like a live EKG for their code. It helps them spot issues like failing transactions, high gas usage or unusual user behavior before they become expensive problems. For developers and founders, it's like having a 24/seven blockchain performance assistant — helping them sleep better at night.

Third, blockchain-specific tools give developers cross-chain compatibility. With the rise of multichain ecosystems, interoperability is a must. Blockchain-native tools simplify cross-chain API integrations, enabling developers to navigate the differences between platforms like Ethereum, Solana and Polkadot.

LayerZero is a good example of a tool for cross-chain compatibility. This tool acts like a universal translator for blockchains. Instead of building an app to work on just Ethereum or Solana, LayerZero allows developers to connect to these and many others seamlessly. As a result, users can interact with their dApp using assets and data from multiple blockchains without even realizing it. For businesses, this means more reach, less friction, and one unified experience across the fragmented blockchain world.

Finally, crypto-native tools offer user-friendly smart contract management. They allow developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts without worrying about introducing catastrophic bugs. Many blockchain suites integrate testing environments that simulate real-world deployment scenarios to ensure smooth execution. 

Foundry is an example of a developer toolkit that helps developers write smart contracts in Ethereum's programming language, Solidity. Best of all, it makes the process remarkably safe and efficient. It's like a sandbox where developers can stress-test their code, simulate edge cases and catch bugs before anything goes live. This capacity is crucial because even a minor mistake in smart contract code can result in substantial financial losses.

 

In traditional DevOps environments, collaboration can sometimes be hindered by proprietary constraints or organizational silos. On the other hand, crypto-native DevOps thrives on open-source principles, powered by transparent and trustless systems.

Cryptocurrency incentivizes many DevOps professionals for their contributions to open-source projects. These incentives reward individual effort and promote a culture of shared knowledge and collective innovation. Tokens and smart contracts can dynamically reassign rewards based on contribution metrics, enabling a self-regulating system that continuously drives open-source collaboration forward.

Platforms like Gitcoin and SourceCred are already leading the way. They use blockchain technology to allocate funding and recognition to contributors who consistently add value to open-source repositories. This alignment of economic incentives with collaborative development accelerates innovation and makes it likelier that the best ideas rise to the top.

Tools created for the new realm of blockchain lower the barrier to entry. User-friendly tools enable developers of all skill levels to contribute meaningfully to Web3 ecosystems. They offer plug-and-play integrations and simplified front-end access points critical for driving innovation forward.

Of course, blockchain development doesn't exist in a vacuum. It remains tied to the broader vision of enabling decentralized systems that empower individuals and businesses. With tools purpose-built for these tasks, developers are no longer hindered by the constraints of traditional systems. Instead, they're free to innovate, experiment and ultimately redefine what's possible.

In the near future, decentralization will reshape everything from our data sharing to trust mechanisms. Developers will be the architects of this transformation, but will need tools that do more than adapt to the blockchain to rise to this challenge. They need tools that were born for it.

sheridian, wyoming, June 17th, 2025, Chainwire



R0AR has launched its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that integrates token staking, liquidity provision, and NFT-based rewards into a single user interface. Designed to support long-term engagement, the platform streamlines participation while incorporating embedded security measures and time-based reward models.



Streamlined Staking and Liquidity Solutions

The R0AR Platform enables users to interact with three primary mechanisms:

All services are accessible via a unified dashboard compatible with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, and additional login methods.

Time-Based APY and Smart Engagement Logic

The SmartAPY system employed by R0AR replaces static returns and fixed lock-up models with a time-sensitive structure that increases rewards proportionally with the length of the stake. All liquidity and staking positions are subject to an 11-day minimum engagement window, enforced on-chain, with real-time visibility into countdowns for penalty-free withdrawal. (After 11 days their is no required lock periods letting you unstake at anytime while hitting APY tiers)



Security Infrastructure and Direct Token Access

The platform operates without reliance on third-party routing or aggregator services, reducing exposure to slippage and MEV-related risks. Smart contracts include embedded protections against unauthorized interactions and manipulation. Additionally, users can purchase $1R0R directly using ETH, Weth, USDC, or USDT via the platform, bypassing the need for centralized exchanges.

Practical Applications for NFTs

Beyond aesthetic or collectible use, ERS NFTs serve functional roles within the platform. When locked, they deliver increasing monthly payouts and can boost staking rewards when held alongside $1R0R in the same wallet. Bonus incentives are also available for verified users.

The NFTs include metadata designed to integrate with R0AR's upcoming AI tools, allowing the system to adjust experiences based on behavioral patterns without requiring active user input.

Ecosystem Integration and Technical Foundation

Each of the platform's core functions—staking, liquidity, and NFT utilities—contributes to a cohesive ecosystem. Built on the Optimism OP Stack, the R0AR Platform benefits from reduced transaction costs and scalability for future integrations, including real-world asset support and AI-enhanced personalization features.

Public Launch and Availability

The R0AR Platform is scheduled for public release on 6-16-2025 . Users will be able to access all staking, liquidity, and NFT functionalities (NFT staking to follow on the r0ar platform in the coming weeks after launch) at https://www.r0ar.io/platform.

About R0AR

R0AR is a decentralized finance platform offering token staking, liquidity solutions, and NFT-based engagement tools. Operating on the Ethereum Blockchain & R0AR's custom OP Stack Layer 2 chain, the platform emphasizes time-based rewards, user protection, and simplified participation across DeFi protocols.

The U.S. may soon go to war against Iran, and crypto markets aren't liking the prospect.

Bitcoin BTC$105,141.22 is down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, trading under $104,000 yet again. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, exchange coins and memecoins — lost 6.1% in the same period of time, with ether ETH$2,539.62 and solana SOL$150.21 both slumping 7% and sui SUI$2.90 dipping almost 10%.

Crypto stocks are also taking a hit, with Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and Circle (CRLC) all down 2%-3%, and bitcoin miners such as Bitdeer (BTDR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK), HIVE (HIVE) and Hut 8 (HUT) losing 6%-7%.

The market move came as President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. could soon get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump posted on social media, referring to Iranian head of state Ali Khamenei. “He is an easy target, but he is safe there - we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”

Trump also called for Iran to surrender unconditionally, and for residents of Tehran to evacuate the city. The national security council was convened, according to the White House, and Trump himself cut short a G7 summit to focus on the issue.

Odds of U.S. military action against Iran before July have soared to 65% on Polymarket.

“The sudden and severe escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict introduced a significant geopolitical risk premium, prompting an immediate flight from risk assets across the board, to which crypto has not proven immune,” said Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, Chief Investment Officer at XBTO.

“The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard; any credible de-escalation in the Middle East could serve as a significant risk-on catalyst, while a further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets,” he added.

Matteo Greco, senior analyst at Finequia, shared the same sentiment, adding that the war could end up having significant consequences on the U.S. economic outlook. “Should Israeli military actions impact Iran's oil production, a spike in oil prices could follow, fueling renewed inflationary pressures,” Greco said.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Ethereum is dead. Ethereum will be fine. The social media takes are flying on the state of the world's second most valuable blockchain. Conceived in 2013, Ethereum has experienced a series of dramatic ups and downs, including an existential hack in 2016 and a remarkable technological upgrade in 2022. But this year has brought unprecedented scrutiny of the current and future direction of the project.

A big part of this is due to the price of Ethereum, which is badly lagging Bitcoin. The world's most valuable cryptocurrency has notched a series of all-time highs and a flurry of interest from Wall Street investors. Meanwhile, as of Tuesday, Ethereum was trading around $2,500, about 50% lower than its all-time high, according to data from crypto exchange Binance. 





Ether's lackluster price movement has prompted some to proclaim Ethereum's end. “Ethereum died,” wrote Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin booster, on X. “It just hasn't been buried yet.”





This is an overstatement. But questions remain on whether Ethereum's price slump reflects a temporary stumble, or whether the blockchain—long hailed by boosters as the computer of the future—will never grow into its promise.





“Bitcoin has died many times… Ethereum has died several times,” Joseph Lubin, CEO of the blockchain technology firm Consensys and cofounder of Ethereum, told Fortune. “When there are challenges, we learn from them.”




Those challenges have been present since 2013, when a wiry 19-year-old from Canada named Vitalik Buterin had an idea for a new type of computer. Fearing that Big Tech firms had an unhealthy monopoly over cloud computing that could stifle developers, Buterin looked to blockchains instead. He and others came up with Ethereum—a decentralized blockchain-based computing platform where programmers' code was immune to the whims of corporate behemoths.





Developers soon flocked to Ethereum, but the increase in activity brought a rise in “gas fees.” Every time users send one another assets on Ethereum, they need to pay with cryptocurrency—in the same way Amazon requires users to pay dollars to use its cloud computing network. The only difference is that Ethereum's gas fees are distributed to the decentralized cohort of computers supporting the blockchain, instead of one corporate entity. In 2021, sending a few dollars of cryptocurrency to other users on Ethereum resulted in charges of sometimes hundreds of dollars, and developers looked for a solution.





That solution is what Ethereum's critics say has sapped the network of some of its financial value. Instead of immediately working to speed up Ethereum's core network, developers fostered a system of layer 2 blockchains, or L2s, built on top of Ethereum. These L2s—including Arbitrum, Optmism, and Polygon—package user data into one bundle and post that onto Ethereum, rather than ask the blockchain to process each transaction individually. 





If gas fees are any indication, that strategy has worked. Since a peak in mid-2020, transaction costs have plummeted more than 99% on Ethereum, according to data from Glassnode. 





But Kyle Samani, managing partner at crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital, believes this approach has made the core network of Ethereum less valuable. “It's my fundamental view that a network is not sustainable or valuable without direct user activity,” he told Fortune.




Users have moved to L2s and drained Ethereum of some of the activity that propped up its cryptocurrency's price, Samani, a noted supporter of the competing Solana blockchain, argued. 





However, Paul Brody, chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an advocacy group for the blockchain, said fixation on the price of Ether in the short term is missing the point. “Ethereum is the amazing world computer,” he told Fortune. “I don't think it can or should try to be all things, all people, and, especially, I don't think Ethereum should also try to be the best, most deflationary cryptocurrency.”





Ethereum's upgrades, not any explicit work to buoy Ether's price, should prompt a rise in demand for the cryptocurrency, said Brody. And that's what developers are working on, said Danny Ryan and Vivek Raman, cofounders of the Ethereum advocacy group Ethrealize—one of many wings of a robust technical and cultural community based around the blockchain that convenes at large annual get-togethers like ETHDenver in Colorado.





Programmers are now optimizing the speed of the layer 1 network, not just its ecosystem of layer 2 chains, say Ryan and Raman. Plus, the duo believe that the flood of Wall Street and Big Tech firms exploring blockchain technology will spur a rush to buy the cryptocurrency. “I don't think that we should pretend like the asset doesn't need to be valuable,” added Danny Ryan. His cofounder Raman even equated Ethereum to “digital oil.”





“When you ask institutions, when we go have our meetings and say, ‘Which is a civilizational infrastructure, which is the global, neutral infrastructure that you can actually deploy real assets with real trust?'” Raman added. “Ethereum is the obvious choice.”




But whether Wall Street titans decide to go with Ethereum, rather than competitors like Solana, remains to be seen. Still, proponents are hopeful. “If we do our job, and we become the first place for everybody to do business,” said Brody, “then the asset price is just something that takes care of itself.”

 Throughout the last 10 years, Bitcoin's price has remained resilient to war and armed conflict. 

As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, Bitcoin's (BTC) price has remained stable. 

A look back at previous conflicts shows a similar trend, with factors like adoption and institutional involvement playing a key role.

Analysts like André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise's ETP platform ETC Group, have argued that Bitcoin's price can suffer in the days following the outbreak of a conflict. While volatility in BTC's price is overall on a downtrend, it is still seen as a risky asset and is likely to be sold quickly when a war breaks out.

Still, as Mithil Thakore, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin L2 liquidity protocol Velar, previously told Cointelegraph, “Over the longer term, geopolitical conflicts raise the prospects of higher inflation rates globally due to factors like increased fiscal spending, looser monetary policy, supply-chain disruptions and commodity price spikes, which should all benefit Bitcoin.”

Looking at past events of geopolitical instability, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, but a lack of movement doesn't necessarily mean that Bitcoin is a hedge during times of uncertainty. 

Here's a look at a few instances where Bitcoin's price has reacted, or not reacted, to large-scale armed conflict in the world:

On June 13, Israel struck dozens of targets in Iran in the largest attack on the country since the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. The two countries, arch-rivals in the Middle East, have continued strategic missile strikes against each other over the following days.

Despite concerns over wider escalation, including calls by Israel to involve the United States, markets have largely shrugged off concerns. Bitcoin is no exception.

While the asset saw a brief drop immediately after the bombings began, the price has largely recovered. Crypto analyst Za said, “Bitcoin does not seem concerned about the Israel and Iran conflict (yet).”

Perhaps the most famous Bitcoin bull, Michael Saylor, is also unfazed. On June 16, his firm, Strategy, acquired 10,001 BTC for $1 billion. The purchase comes after Strategy's third Bitcoin-backed preferred stock, STRD, began trading on Nasdaq on June 11. 

On April 1, 2024, Israel struck an Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, killing several senior officials. In response, Iran seized the Israeli ship MSC Series and launched a series of attacks on Israel on April 13.

After both dates, the price of Bitcoin saw a brief downward movement, with BTC losing over 8% just after the April 13 retaliation.

Still, as markets became accustomed to the new norm, so did Bitcoin, and it continued moving upward.

On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas forces from Gaza struck targets inside Israel, killing over 1,000 Israelis and triggering a war and humanitarian crisis that is still ongoing. 

Israeli markets saw immediate dramatic losses, while major arms manufacturers like Lockheed Martin saw spikes in stock price. 

Bitcoin remained fairly unaffected, and 50 days after the initial attacks, it was performing well above where it started. 

Following the attacks, reports that Hamas had raised money in crypto led to renewed calls from regulators to tightly regulate the space, with the US Treasury sanctioning a Gaza-based crypto operator with alleged ties to the group.

Blockchain forensic firm Elliptic said there was “no evidence” to support claims of Hamas raising funds in crypto.

In early 2022, after eight years of war in the Donbas region of Ukraine, Russia initiated a full-scale invasion in what Moscow calls a “special military operation.” 

Global financial markets were immediately affected, with economies closest to Ukraine suffering the worst. Countering this trend, Bitcoin's price spiked upward and was up 16% just five days after the invasion. 

Exchanges within Russia and Ukraine saw crypto trading at eye-watering premiums as people fleeing abroad sought to skirt currency controls with cryptocurrency. 

One week after the start of the war, Ukraine had received over $70 million in cryptocurrency donations, mostly in Ether (ETH).

Bitcoin tanked later that year, but this was fueled by the collapse of the Terra stablecoin ecosystem and other market events, more than concerns over the war in Ukraine. 

While crypto may serve as a risk-off asset during times of conflict in some parts of the world, its price movements appear to ignore internal conflicts outside of those affecting traditional markets in Europe, the Middle East and North America. 

In November 2020, war broke out in the Tigray region of Ethiopia after years of tension between the left-wing ethno-nationalist Tigray People's Liberation Front and the federal governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia. 

The war, which left hundreds of thousands dead and millions internally displaced, was characterized by the Catholic Near East Welfare Association as underreported. A 2024 report from Geographical called it “the war the world forgot.” 

Bitcoin's price didn't take much notice either. The main narrative dominating the crypto market then was the assets' unprecedented bull run driven largely by inflation worries from the COVID-19 pandemic and institutional adoption by Block (then Square) and Strategy (then MicroStrategy).

Later that year, just months after the outbreak of the Tigray war, on Feb. 1, 2021, the Tatmadaw of Myanmar overthrew the National League for Democracy in a coup d'état, sparking a civil war, which is ongoing. 

A month later, Bitcoin's price would reach its then-all-time high of $69,000.

A key factor in the discussion of Bitcoin's reaction to conflict is the degree to which Bitcoin is adopted — i.e., has exposure or correlation to traditional markets. 

Some economists have noted the effect of the geographic proximity of conflict. Financial markets in countries closer to a conflict zone will see more volatility and losses. 

Overall crypto adoption is highest in developing nations, with India, Nigeria and Indonesia leading the pack, according to Chainalysis' 2024 Global Adoption Index. This index includes onchain crypto and retail value received by centralized services, and onchain crypto and retail value received by DeFi protocols.

Bitcoin, by comparison, is finding increasingly concentrated ownership among Western institutions and world governments. As of December 2024, 1% of Bitcoin was owned by ETFs alone, more than by Satoshi Nakamoto. 

The biggest holders are now ETF issuers like BlackRock, regulated crypto exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase and even the US government. 

Bitcoin has only recently enjoyed this degree of adoption and, therefore, exposure to traditional financial markets and institutional investment.

In 2013, Bitcoin went on what some consider its first major bull run. It started the year at $13, crossing $100 by April and $200 by October. The end of the year saw it close out over $1,000. 

A “crypto winter” started the next year, in addition to two armed conflicts: the Donbas war, including Russia's annexation of Crimea, and the 2014 Gaza war. 

During this time, crypto was still in a niche industry, and miners could use the graphics card on their gaming computers to mine Bitcoin. Kraken and Coinbase were only three and two years old, respectively.

Institutional involvement was next to nonexistent, and many regarded crypto as “magic internet money” suited only for accommodating illicit activity online. 

While the onset of both conflicts affected stock markets, both regionally and farther afield, there was no discussion in crypto media, such as it existed at the time, of the wars' effect on Bitcoin's price.

Now, with increasing institutional adoption, a crypto-friendly American government and international trade conferences drawing in thousands, Bitcoin's price may be more influenced by the negative forces armed conflict puts on markets. 

Almost all of the above conflicts, which saw Bitcoin prices quickly rebound, occurred before widespread institutional adoption. This paradigm shift has seen the narrative around Bitcoin change from a risk-off to a risk-on asset. BTC has more correlation to traditional financial markets than it did previously. 

Still, analysts are cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin in the current climate. QCP stated in a June 16 note that escalation could see oil prices spike, particularly an “Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz,” with potential US involvement disrupting global risk assets.

A trader on decentralized derivatives exchange HyperLiquid has turned an unrealized $10 million profit into a $2.5 million loss, seemingly caught by the same trap that tripped up a person using the alias James Wynn, who blew up a $100 million account in May, after bitcoin BTC$105,141.22 fell 4% from Monday's high.

The trader, known as AguilaTrades on X, entered a bitcoin long position at $106,000, and sat through at Monday's high of $108,800 before the largest cryptocurrency took a tumble to trade recently around $104,000.

Bitcoin volatility has been relatively low for months, with the price ranging between the $100,000 level of support and record highs around $110,000. That hasn't perturbed derivatives traders, who are continually betting on upside with leverage, subsequently getting chopped in a tight range.

It's not the first time AguilaTrades has recorded a losing trade at these levels. Last week they were up $5.8 million on a BTC long before losing $12.5 million, according to Lookonchain.

On paper the trade has credentials because BTC has managed to remain above $100,000 despite escalating conflict in the Middle East, which is typically a catalyst for downside in risk assets.

However, remaining agnostic to price action in this range and simply buying support and selling resistance would have yielded far greater results. Bitcoin has been trading in this range since May 9 with numerous attempts at breaking support and resistance along the way.

 Bitcoin order book liquidity spoofing is back as analysis says that a key BTC price event is still "brewing" — can bulls protect $104,000? 

Key points:

BTC price weakness accelerates after the Wall Street open as analysis warns of a “rug pull” at $104,000.

Bitcoin bulls have done their best to avoid panic reactions to downside volatility triggers.

US dollar strength eyes a comeback after hitting new three-year lows.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke below $105,000 on June 17 as analysis warned that a “big move” was yet to come.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting intraday lows of $104,401 after the Wall Street open.

A rare 11 red hourly candles in a row kept bulls firmly in check, with order book analysis warning that downside could easily snowball.

“This is what manipulation looks like in the $BTC order book,” trading resource Material Indicators summarized on X, referring to shifting bid liquidity as price fell. 

Liquidity “spoofing,” as Cointelegraph previously reported, is a common phenomenon on crypto markets when large-volume traders wish to influence price trajectory.

“If bulls can push above $108k, the door to $110k is open,” Material Indicators acknowledged the day prior.

Discussing overall market strength, popular trader Skew was fairly optimistic. Bitcoin traders, he noted, were demonstrating more restraint than during other recent market pullbacks despite considerable geopolitical pressure.

Volatility, he warned, was nonetheless around the corner.

“For a 3% or so pullback so far market isn't panicked yet, although on LTF there's clear hedge bias Previous dips were 5% or so but had aggressive shorting, spot selling & uptick in volatility with sell momentum/Volume,” part of an X post read.

With gold falling and US dollar strength showing signs of bullish divergence, perspectives on the Middle East conflict were far from panicked.

In ongoing X analysis, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter dismissed the idea that Israel-Iran tensions could spiral into a global war.

‘While gold is strong, it continues to paint a consistent narrative: We are not on the brink of World War 3,” it concluded on the day. 

The US dollar index (DXY), which traditionally trades inversely to Bitcoin, teased a recovery from multiyear lows.

“Asset managers are heavily short on the USD. The last time positioning was this bearish, the DXY staged a notable rally,” trader and market strategist Guilherme Tavares reported.

Ether (ETH) ETH$2,539.62 traded at $2,555.77 on Tuesday, down 3.7% over the past 24 hours after a sharp rejection near the $2,673 level triggered a wave of selling. The downturn follows several sessions of declining momentum and increasing volatility, culminating in a major sell-off late Monday that broke through initial support and left prices trending downward for most of the day.

Despite this weakness in price action, on-chain data suggests that larger market participants continue to treat the pullback as an opportunity to accumulate. According to Glassnode, daily net whale accumulation has exceeded 800,000 ETH for nearly a week, with total holdings in 1,000 to 10,000 ETH wallets rising above 14.3 million. The largest single-day inflow occurred on June 12, when whale wallets added more than 871,000 ETH — the biggest net inflow of 2025 so far.

This accumulation trend mirrors behavior last seen in 2017, underscoring the scale and intensity of recent large-holder buying. The whale buying spree has coincided with Ethereum's retreat from $2,700 levels and may reflect strategic positioning ahead of further developments in institutional flows or ETF-related catalysts.

While technicals remain under pressure in the short term, the magnitude of this buying activity signals growing conviction among large entities. With prices hovering just above key support, traders and analysts are watching closely to see whether this whale-driven accumulation translates into a near-term reversal or simply cushions further downside.

With the full outbreak of the digital economy today, the threshold for traditional cryptocurrency mining is being continuously lowered. Mining machines that used to require high investment and complex operation and maintenance have now been replaced by smarter methods – you can easily participate in the mining process of mainstream currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum with just a smartphone. All this is due to the leapfrog development of cloud mining technology.

The so-called cloud mining refers to renting computing power resources from remote data centers, and the platform completes the mining process on behalf of the platform, and users receive daily currency dividends in the form of contracts. You don't need to buy expensive mining machines or bear high electricity bills. You only need to choose a suitable computing power package on the platform to automatically start mining and enjoy daily income.

In layman's terms, it's like you entrust a professional company to mine for you, and you can receive mining income on time without doing it yourself. This “worry-free, labor-saving, zero-maintenance” model is becoming the mainstream choice for global crypto investors to obtain passive income.Blockchain Cloud Mining Advantages

BitMEX co-founder and Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes is known for making big, bold — and sometimes controversial — Bitcoin price predictions, and says it doesn't faze him when he gets it wrong. 

“Nothing really happens,” Hayes tells Magazine, who asked if he worries about backlash when his Bitcoin predictions fall flat. 

The youngest African-American crypto billionaire in history is the first to admit that most of his price calls don't land. “I get it wrong, and I've gotten most of them wrong,” he laughs.

“I don't know why people are hesitant to do it; it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.”

“If you're generally correct, you're okay,” the 40-year-old former investment banker adds. 

Hayes is pretty upfront with his calls; he doesn't hide them if he's right or wrong.

In September, Hayes — now the chief investment officer at the VC firm he co-founded, Maelstrom Fund — made a short-term bearish call on Bitcoin, linking it to the sliding Japanese yen. However, things didn't unfold as he had expected over that particular weekend, and Bitcoin held strong.

Fair play to Hayes; he later owned it on X, posting, “I was wrong.”

“Time to trade some dogshit memecoins,” Hayes said. Similarly, on March 24, Hayes said that Bitcoin would hit $110,000 before it retests $76,500. But just a month later, on April 9, Bitcoin sank to $76,500.

Of course, credit where it's due; Hayes gets it right too sometimes. In December, Hayes predicted a crypto downturn and a “vicious sell-off” after US President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration…and he was spot on.

Probably because over the years, the New York-raised Bitcoin OG has developed a super-secret method to come up with his end-of-year price targets:

“Pick round numbers that humans like.” 

His latest call is that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of this year and is confident that Bitcoin won't see another $70,000 drawdown on the way there.

“I really don't see there's going to be sort of a big binary risk-off at the moment that could spook the markets, and people will dump risks that would get us down to those levels again anytime soon,” Hayes says.

That said, Hayes isn't on board with the super-bullish $1 million Bitcoin calls that some Bitcoiners, like Jan3 founder Samson Mow, think are possible by the end of the year. 

“I think it'll happen before the end of 2028; I don't think it'll happen this year,” Hayes says.

However, he's not rushing to make any short-term predictions anytime soon. “I don't know, we'll see, it's really dependent,” he says. “I usually try to make those if there's a setup where everyone thinks one way and I think another way,” he says.

Unlike most of the wannabe trading geniuses on Crypto X, Hayes actually knows his stuff — he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2008 with a BA in economics. Just six years later, in 2014, he was just 28 when he co-founded the crypto derivatives giant BitMEX alongside Ben Delo and Samuel Reed.

In 2020, Hayes stepped down from BitMEX after the US Department of Justice charged him, along with Delo, Reed and Gregory Dwyer, for allegedly violating the Bank Secrecy Act.

Ethereum is eating the world — ‘You only need one internet'

Hayes and Delo pleaded guilty in February 2022, admitting they “willfully fail[ed] to establish, implement and maintain an Anti-Money Laundering program” at the exchange. 

He ended up spending six months in home detention, confined to his house. It was a rough time, but Hayes also saw the positives. 

“It sucked having to be one place you couldn't leave and all that for six months, but I was in Miami; thankfully, it wasn't a jail cell,” Hayes laughs.

In March, US President Donald Trump pardoned the four former BitMEX executives.

Despite the whole legal mess, Hayes remains one of the most respected Bitcoiners in the world. He's treated like an A-list celebrity at crypto conferences, and even with his hit-or-miss track record, people still pay serious attention when he makes a price prediction.

Hayes can afford to make bold predictions because, unlike many crypto executives who stick to safe predictions, he's already a multi-billionaire living life on his own terms.

And that was Hayes' plan all along.

“I always got into this game trying to have control of my time,” he says. Hayes admits his life is pretty comfy at the moment. “I work out like two to three hours a day, read a lot of books, and then, you know, write here and there,” he says.

While Hayes does the heavy lifting in the gym, he says his team at Maelstrom Fund does most of the firm's heavy lifting, “scouring the world for decent stuff to do.” 

He admits he does work here and there for the fund, but he loves living the high life.

“I know I'm perfectly happy that I'm able to, you know, play tennis when I want to, go skiing, all that kind of stuff,” he says, adding:

“It's not really about how many Bitcoins I have or how much, you know, cash in my bank account or in my wallet. It's really, you know, can I go pay for my friends or go skiing for six months if I want to.”

It was only fitting to ask Hayes what his numerical prediction was for the US government actually buying Bitcoin for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which Trump signed off on in March.

“I'd say it's a 1% chance,” he says. 

“I'm still of the same opinion that they're not going to sell the 200,000 Bitcoin that they seized, but I don't see the US government printing money to buy Bitcoin,” he adds.

Even if other countries adopt a Bitcoin reserve, Hayes says 200,000 BTC is already worth “how many billions of dollars.”So, from the US perspective, it probably won't trigger much FOMO compared to other nations.

“Everyone else, China probably has a similar amount, but they mined it. So I think more likely countries will mine Bitcoin rather than print money and then go take printed money and buy Bitcoin, assuming they're a deficit nation,” he says.

“It's a bit different if you actually generate income as a nation,” he says.

Surprisingly, Hayes has never been an advocate for the US Bitcoin Reserve. On May 1, Hayes said in an interview that he is “not really into the whole Strategic Reserve situation.” 

At the time, he said it is hard to imagine any “properly elected” politician openly announcing that the government plans to print money to buy Bitcoin when the popular narrative is a bunch of Bitcoin bros going to the club.”

Hayes also shared his forecast on Bitcoin treasury companies, speculating that the newer firms will become more redundant.

“I think that they're going to become less and less important as these trades get a bit more saturated,” Hayes says.

“Every subsequent one of these treasury companies, at least if it's in a market that already has one, they don't do so well, but it's harder to generate a non-dilutive accumulation of Bitcoin,” Hayes explains.

He says most treasury companies will do a rights offering that decreases the ownership percentage per share, and then use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin, which is a “very dilutive strategy.”

“It's hard to keep replicating that, especially in an almost saturated market like the US, maybe in other markets where they don't have a MicoStrategy, then you'll be able to do this a few times,” he says.

Hayes is more bullish about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds; however, he doesn't have a prediction of how much money will flow into the ETFs by the end of the year.

“I think it will continue to have inflows just because it's the easiest way for anyone who's got, like traditional fiat assets, to deploy into crypto,” Hayes says.

“They don't have to worry about custody. It's a one-for-one replicate.”

He predicts that since fund managers trust spot Bitcoin ETFs — and more regulators and banks are letting funds invest in them — they'll “obviously suck capital” away from Bitcoin treasury companies.

“As a retail [investor], [they'll be thinking] well, is that another sucker who's going to pay a premium to do the simplest thing of buying Bitcoin,” he says.

When asked if he sees any near-term risks to Bitcoin's price, Hayes points to the possibility of a worldwide conflict erupting.

“Obviously, if there's some sort of global war,” Hayes says. But if a full-scale world war broke out, he's uncertain whether the price would rise or fall.

“Bitcoin could do really well or could do pretty poorly. Who knows what will happen in that situation?” Hayes says.

He brushes off the common fear among many Bitcoiners that quantum computing could break Bitcoin's security.

“I think there's so many people focused on that particular problem that I don't think that's going to be ultimately an issue for Bitcoin,” he says.

Which altcoin delivers the right mix of utility, upside, and long-term scalability in today's crypto market? The first half of 2025 has exposed a clear separation between speculation-driven assets and those building real-world frameworks.

Qubetics, for instance, is drawing attention for its multi-layered development tools, while Quant is setting enterprise standards in blockchain interoperability. Maker continues stabilizing decentralized finance through DAI, and Bitcoin Cash is re-emerging with renewed retail relevance. With renewed buying interest and functional narratives defining the altcoin market, buyers are no longer just chasing hype—they're focusing on real value.

Across the board, these four tokens – Qubetics ($TICS), Quant ($QNT), Maker ($MKR), and Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) – have demonstrated a combination of resilience, technical progress, and growing adoption. Each protocol addresses a specific segment of the blockchain space: Qubetics, currently priced at $0.3370, is redefining interoperability and utility through its cross-chain infrastructure and enterprise-grade tools; Quant is enabling institutional-grade interoperability across private and public blockchains; Maker remains the backbone of DeFi stability with DAI; and Bitcoin Cash continues to offer peer-to-peer payment functionality with real-world traction.

Qubetics is a structured blockchain infrastructure protocol. Central to its framework is QubeQode, a powerful no-code/low-code integrated development environment (IDE) designed for fast-track deployment of dApps. Whether onboarding business solutions, cross-chain smart contracts, or consumer-grade dApps, QubeQode makes it simpler for non-technical users to engage with decentralized architecture. The Qubetics IDE eliminates the traditional barriers of Web3 development—by letting applications tap into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other Layer-1 networks without needing to bridge or rewrite base-level code.

This seamless interoperability, combined with intuitive tooling, positions Qubetics among the best altcoins to buy now. As the demand for accessible blockchain solutions grows, platforms like Qubetics—offering built-in scalability, multichain compatibility, and user-friendly development interfaces – are gaining significant traction. By removing friction from dApp creation and enabling deployment across major networks from a single interface, Qubetics empowers businesses, creators, and institutions to adopt blockchain faster. This practical utility, paired with its performance-first architecture, firmly anchors Qubetics as one of the best altcoins to buy now for long-term utility and ecosystem expansion.



With the current $TICS token priced at $0.3370, Qubetics is currently in its final crypto presale phase, having raised over $18 million and sold more than 515 million tokens across 28,000 holders.  Given its reduced supply model (cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion tokens), scarcity will likely amplify post-listing demand.

Why did this coin make it to this list?

Qubetics delivers more than potential – it's executing. Between its all-in-one IDE, no-code dApp builder, and robust developer toolkit, the protocol is solving real onboarding and scalability problems in blockchain. That's what makes it the best altcoin to buy now for high-utility buyers.

Quant has always been synonymous with one thing: interoperability. Its Overledger operating system allows multiple distributed ledgers to communicate, enabling applications to run across different chains simultaneously. From banking to supply chain logistics, Quant is facilitating seamless integration between Web2 institutions and decentralized Web3 environments. With governments and financial institutions exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), Overledger has positioned Quant to become an infrastructure backbone in regulated crypto environments.

Enterprise clients are now piloting cross-chain settlements, KYC-compliant identity validation systems, and asset transfers between blockchains using Quant. Unlike other projects, its ecosystem isn't just open-source hobbyism -it's targeted at real contracts and institutions with compliance mandates. Quant is often less volatile compared to other altcoins. It attracts backers looking for stability, backed by a clear business case and seasoned leadership. That alone makes it stand out among many speculative tokens.

Why did this coin make it to this list?

Quant's enterprise-grade interoperability isn't just theory—it's implementation at scale. With increasing regulatory alignment and institutional adoption, it remains one of the best altcoins to buy now for those focused on infrastructure and compliance.



Maker is the decentralized autonomous organisation (DAO) behind DAI, a stablecoin widely used in DeFi lending, borrowing, and liquidity strategies. It's a critical building block of Ethereum-based DeFi and is known for its fully collateralized design. What makes Maker powerful in 2025 is its ability to manage DAI's peg during volatile market cycles while expanding integrations across chains.

Its recent upgrade includes enhanced vault strategies, synthetic yield modules, and integration with liquid staking derivatives, allowing users to collateralize staked assets for minting DAI. That feature alone has driven protocol TVL upwards, with many buyers recognising $MKR as more than governance, it's a yield-generating engine.

With centralized stablecoins facing rising scrutiny, DAI's decentralized mechanics could pull increased attention, adding tailwinds to $MKR's valuation.

Why did this coin make it to this list?

Maker isn't speculative – it's fundamental. As the DeFi backbone stabilizing value flow, it remains the best altcoin to buy now for backers looking to participate in decentralized economies through a mature, functional protocol.

Bitcoin Cash has seen a resurgence due to its renewed focus on peer-to-peer payments and point-of-sale integrations. Originally created as a scalable alternative to Bitcoin, BCH continues to maintain fast, cheap transaction capabilities. What's changed is adoption: retail merchants, online platforms, and e-commerce processors are giving BCH a second look.

Multiple point-of-sale networks in emerging markets are re-integrating Bitcoin Cash for instant micro-transactions. With rising fees on Ethereum and Bitcoin networks, BCH provides a cost-effective alternative, especially for daily payments under $50. This kind of real-world usage is what drives BCH's recent relevance. Its cyclical pattern has broken slightly with this recent surge, suggesting increasing demand and transaction volume on-chain.

Why did this coin make it to this list?

Bitcoin Cash makes peer-to-peer crypto work in the real world. With retail applications scaling, it stands out as a best altcoin to buy now based on adoption—not just price movement.

As 2025 progresses, the market is shifting decisively toward functionality over flash. Speculative narratives are giving way to real-world solutions, and the projects making headlines are those delivering long-term infrastructure and meaningful adoption. Qubetics stands out with its multi-layered development stack, real-time cross-chain capabilities, and developer-first toolkit—positioning it as a frontrunner among the best altcoin to buy now. Quant continues to serve as a trusted bridge between enterprise systems and blockchain architecture. Maker reinforces its role as DeFi's backbone through stablecoin stability and protocol-level yield generation. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash is making crypto payments viable again with growing retail traction.

For backers seeking real returns in a maturing digital asset environment, these projects aren't just well-positioned—they're purpose-built. Whether it's onboarding global payments, powering institutional-grade infrastructure, or creating the rails for decentralized finance, each one represents a high-utility, long-term value play. In a market crowded with noise, these four names are setting the standard for what qualifies as the best altcoin to buy now.

R0AR has launched its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that integrates token staking, liquidity provision, and NFT-based rewards into a single user interface. Designed to support long-term engagement, the platform streamlines participation while incorporating embedded security measures and time-based reward models.

Streamlined Staking and Liquidity Solutions

The R0AR Platform enables users to interact with three primary mechanisms:

All services are accessible via a unified dashboard compatible with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, and additional login methods.

Time-Based APY and Smart Engagement Logic

The SmartAPY system employed by R0AR replaces static returns and fixed lock-up models with a time-sensitive structure that increases rewards proportionally with the length of the stake. All liquidity and staking positions are subject to an 11-day minimum engagement window, enforced on-chain, with real-time visibility into countdowns for penalty-free withdrawal. (After 11 days their is no required lock periods letting you unstake at anytime while hitting APY tiers)

Security Infrastructure and Direct Token Access

The platform operates without reliance on third-party routing or aggregator services, reducing exposure to slippage and MEV-related risks. Smart contracts include embedded protections against unauthorized interactions and manipulation. Additionally, users can purchase $1R0R directly using ETH, Weth, USDC, or USDT via the platform, bypassing the need for centralized exchanges.

Practical Applications for NFTs

Beyond aesthetic or collectible use, ERS NFTs serve functional roles within the platform. When locked, they deliver increasing monthly payouts and can boost staking rewards when held alongside $1R0R in the same wallet. Bonus incentives are also available for verified users.

The NFTs include metadata designed to integrate with R0AR's upcoming AI tools, allowing the system to adjust experiences based on behavioral patterns without requiring active user input.

 Editor's Note: This article was updated at 10:30 a.m. EST with comments from a 23andMe spokesperson. 

 The United Kingdom's top data privacy regulator on Tuesday fined the embattled personal genomics company 23andMe more than $3 million over allegedly poor cybersecurity practices and a slow response to a devastating 2023 data breach. 

 The breach, which revealed the genetic data of millions of the firm's customers, spanned several months during which 23andMe failed to act, the Information Commissioner's Office said in a press release announcing the £2.31 million fine ($3.14 million). 

 The news comes on the heels of Friday's announcement that the TTAM Research Institute — a nonprofit recently founded by 23andMe's former CEO, Anne Wojcicki — won a bankruptcy auction to take control of the company.

 The ICO noted that 23andMe failed to require additional verification measures for users to “access and download their raw genetic data.” The regulator conducted its investigation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. 

 The genetic testing firm broke several U.K. laws, the ICO said, including by failing to require multifactor authentication (MFA), secure passwords and hard to predict usernames. 23andMe also did not have systems in place to monitor, detect and respond to cyber threats, they said. 

 A 23andMe spokesperson, who did not directly address the regulator's fine, said that “by the end of 2024, 23andMe had implemented multiple steps to increase security to protect individual accounts and information.” 

 The so-called credential stuffing attack began in April 2023, and a few months later the hacker logged into a free account more than a million times throughout the course of one day, the ICO said, as part of an attempt at “profile transfers.”  

 The extreme number of logins caused the company's platform to shut down, the ICO said. Later that month, the hacker again tried to trigger profile transfers in 400 separate accounts, they said.  

 23andMe probed the incident at that point but did not realize it was part of a much bigger and long-running hack, the regulator claimed. The following month, the genomics company dismissed claims of data thefts impacting more than 10 million users as untrue.  

 By September, the hacker intensified the credential stuffing scheme, the regulator said, but 23andMe did not launch a full investigation until October 2023, when one of its employees became aware that stolen company data was being peddled on Reddit. 

 At that point, six months after the attack started, 23andMe confirmed the breach. 

 It took until the end of 2024 for the company's security improvements to become “sufficient,” the ICO alleged. The hacker obtained personal data belonging to nearly 156,000 U.K. residents, and in some cases family trees and health conditions were exposed, the regulator said. 

 “As one of those impacted told us: once this information is out there, it cannot be changed or reissued like a password or credit card number,” U.K. Information Commissioner John Edwards said in a statement. 

 “23andMe failed to take basic steps to protect this information. Their security systems were inadequate, the warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond.” 

 According to the 23andMe spokesperson, as part of TTAM's agreement to buy the company, it has made “several binding commitments to enhance protections for customer data and privacy, including allowing individuals to delete their account and opt out of research at any time [and] notifying customers via email at least 2 days prior to the closing of the acquisition about details on TTAM's role.”

As Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market show tentative signs of recovery following the most recent correction, a crypto analyst has made a bold statement suggesting that the market may have already reached its peak. 

BladeDeFi, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), warned followers that a significant downturn could be on the horizon, predicting a challenging summer ahead for the crypto space.

Crypto Pump Or Trap?

In his post, BladeDeFi emphasized that “crypto has already PEAKED” and forecasted a potential slump where alternative cryptocurrencies could see declines of up to 95%. He indicated that most indicators are flashing red, suggesting that the market is on the brink of a significant downturn. 

According to him, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high early in the current cycle and is now trapped in a “slow-motion downtrend,” with each subsequent bounce becoming weaker than the last.

The analyst pointed out a concerning trend: retail investors are becoming exhausted, while larger institutional players have begun to exit the market. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and MicroStrategy are reportedly rotating their investments and hedging their positions, often without making their actions overtly public. 

The analyst suggests that this shift leaves retail investors vulnerable, potentially left holding depreciating assets as liquidity in the market continues to dwindle.

BladeDeFi also criticized the current market dynamics, warning that sudden price increases or “green candles” are often deceptive, serving only to entice late buyers into traps that lead to further losses. 

He noted that without new capital inflows—such as fresh stimulus or significant investment—the recent price pumps lack sustainability. The absence of liquidity means that any upward movements are likely to be fleeting, and the overall trend remains downward.

Bitcoin Poised For Year-End Peak?

Adding to the bearish sentiment, another analyst, Peppeso, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the top of the 2025 bull market has already been established. 

Peppeso observed historical patterns in previous market cycles, noting that while bull markets have become longer, bear markets have shortened and softened in their impact. 

Despite this, Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs in the final months of each cycle, reinforcing Peppeso's expectation of a peak around November or December 2025.

The current market environment is further complicated by macroeconomic factors, including rising interest rates and increasing geopolitical risks. With uncertainty clouding the outlook, many investors are adopting a risk-off approach, leading to a sustained downtrend in the crypto market. 

Even popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant declines of 9% and 7% in the past week alone respectively, indicating that the hype surrounding these assets is fading.

The American banking giant JPMorgan has just filed a mysterious trademark application named “JPMD” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This initiative fuels speculation about a potential new stablecoin. But what is really behind this discreet move?

On June 15, 2025, JPMorgan Chase officially submitted its trademark application “JPMD” to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

This file precisely describes “trading, exchange, transfer, and payment services of digital assets” issued on blockchains. The Office recorded the application without definitively approving it.

The document never mentions the term “stablecoin” nor explicitly describes the issuance of a digital asset pegged to the US dollar. 

However, the listed services — from transaction reconciliation to digital currency transmission — perfectly match the typical functionalities of stablecoins.

The “D” in the acronym JPMD hints at “JMorgan Dollar,” aligning with the naming convention of other popular tokens like Circle's US Dollar Coin. 

This hypothesis makes even more sense since the bank already has solid expertise in this area with its JPM Coin, used for institutional settlements.

On X, a member of Aptos Labs, under the pseudonym zacharyr0th, ironically summarizes the paradox: “It's not like Wall Street is buying all the coins, but they certainly want to adopt the technology (sometimes gritting their teeth)”.

This initiative fits perfectly with JP Morgan's blockchain strategy, embodied by its Kinexys platform (formerly Onyx). 

Launched in 2020, this blockchain unit has already processed more than $2 billion in daily transaction volumes, establishing JP Morgan as one of the pioneers of distributed ledger technology among major American financial institutions.

The timing of this trademark filing is no coincidence. It coincides with the progress of the Genius Act in the US Congress, a bill aimed at creating a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. This legislation, expected to be adopted this summer, promises to significantly increase stablecoin use by banks and financial institutions.

This regulatory evolution explains why several companies are already positioning themselves in this rapidly growing market. BitGo announced the launch of its USDS stablecoin, while the World Liberty project, backed by the Trump family, recently launched USD1, a dollar-backed token supported by US Treasury bonds.

JP Morgan's initiative is part of a broader dynamic of stablecoin adoption by traditional financial institutions. 

This shift can be explained by the tangible advantages these digital assets offer: reduced transaction costs, faster cross-border payments, and simplified cash flows on a global scale.

The market continues to grow at an impressive rate. In 2024, stablecoins generated $27.6 trillion in transactions, surpassing the combined volumes of Visa and Mastercard. To date, more than 161 million people worldwide hold stablecoins — a figure that alone illustrates the scale of the phenomenon. 

Faced with this massive adoption, even the most cautious institutions have no choice but to adjust. In May 2025, JP Morgan took a symbolic step by allowing its clients to buy bitcoin, despite its CEO Jamie Dimon's persistent criticisms.

The potential emergence of JPMD therefore appears as a logical step: a strategic lever to support this new demand while consolidating its position in an increasingly competitive digital ecosystem. 

While companies like Amazon and Walmart are actively exploring their own stablecoin solutions, JP Morgan intends to maintain its lead in this profound transformation of monetary infrastructures.

Crypto asset investment products experienced another challenging week as capital outflows continued for a second consecutive period. According to the latest report from CoinShares, a total of $584 million exited crypto-focused investment vehicles, pushing the two-week cumulative outflows to $1.2 billion.

This movement coincides with investor uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year, which James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, believes is contributing to waning sentiment in the market.

Butterfill attributed the investor pullback to growing skepticism about macroeconomic policy shifts, particularly rate reductions. At the same time, exchange-traded product (ETP) activity hit a new low, with global ETP volumes falling to just $6.9 billion, marking the weakest weekly trading volume since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Bear the Brunt of The Crypto Outflows

Bitcoin accounted for the majority of this week's outflows, with $630 million leaving BTC investment products. Despite the significant movement of funds out of long Bitcoin positions, short Bitcoin products also recorded outflows totaling $1.2 million.

This suggests that investors are not currently betting heavily on downside exposure, opting instead to stay on the sidelines amid uncertain market conditions. Ethereum similarly saw negative flow activity, with $58 million in outflows, continuing the trend of cautious investor behavior across major assets.

The report also highlighted geographical breakdowns, noting that the United States led all regions with $475 million in outflows, followed by Canada at $109 million. Germany and Hong Kong recorded smaller outflows at $24 million and $19 million, respectively.

In contrast, Switzerland and Brazil stood out as exceptions to the broader trend, bringing in net inflows of $39 million and $48.5 million, respectively. This divergence suggests that local factors or institutional strategies in those regions may be driving different investment behaviors.

Altcoins Draw Selective Support

While sentiment remained bearish for large-cap assets, some altcoins managed to attract capital inflows. Solana, Litecoin, and Polygon saw modest but notable gains of $2.7 million, $1.3 million, and $1 million, respectively.

These inflows may reflect opportunistic positioning by investors seeking exposure to assets that have underperformed recently. Additionally, multi-asset investment products, which spread exposure across various cryptocurrencies, recorded $98 million in inflows.

This signals that some investors are using recent price weaknesses to gain diversified access to the market rather than concentrating bets on single tokens.

The continued divergence in fund flows highlights the complex sentiment currently influencing crypto markets. With macroeconomic uncertainty still dominating investor outlooks, digital asset markets remain reactive to both global monetary policy signals and evolving regional investment trends.

Ethereum (ETH) briefly crossed above $2,600 on Monday following a switch to accumulation in the top altcoin's exchange reserve and $583 million in inflows into ETH investment products last week.

Ethereum resumed bullish action on Monday after its exchange reserve flipped back to a downtrend, declining from 18.72 million ETH on Saturday to an all-time low of 18.57 million ETH over the past 24 hours. As the total value of exchange reserves drops, it indicates rising buying pressure.

During the period, ETH's total value staked also grew by 80K ETH, signifying a stronger bullish sentiment among investors, according to data from Beaconcha.in.

The shift toward accumulation in ETH follows a strong week of institutional buying pressure, which pushed net inflows in global Ethereum products to $583 million last week, according to CoinShares data.

The buying pressure was spearheaded by $528.12 million inflows into US spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), their highest weekly performance since December 2024. The products recorded a 19-day run of net inflows before breaking the streak on Friday, with mild outflows of $2.18 million following the escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

"Ethereum's recovery is being supported by the 'digital oil' narrative and ecosystem fundamentals, like the Pectra upgrade and increased stablecoin activity, with almost 50% of all stablecoins on the Ethereum network," said Tracy Jin, COO of crypto exchange MEXC.

"It's also good to see that the rules around staking and new stablecoin-related ETFs are coming into effect, which is helping to boost investor confidence," she added.

Despite the positive developments surrounding ETH recently, Jin maintained a cautious end-of-year price prediction for ETH.

"ETH could be between $2,800 and $3,600 by the end of the year, with the possibility of going even higher if ETF staking and network developments speed up," Jin said.

Ethereum experienced $134.04 million in futures liquidations, with long and short liquidations totaling $70.55 million and $63.49 million, respectively, over the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data.

ETH held support near $2,500 through the weekend and tested the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as dynamic resistance before experiencing a rejection. The top altcoin could test the $2,850 key resistance if it flips the 200-day SMA support. A rejection at $2,850 will imply a double-top formation.

On the downside, if the $2,500 support fails, ETH needs to hold the lower boundary of a key channel, strengthened by the 50-day SMA, to prevent a decline to the $2,260 to $2,110 support range.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above its neutral level and could test its moving average line, while the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) is below its neutral level. A successful crossover above in both indicators will strengthen the bullish momentum.

An international team of scientists has published a new report that moves towards a better understanding of the behaviour of some of the heaviest particles in the universe under extreme conditions, which are similar to those just after the big bang. The paper, published in the journal Physics Reports, is signed by physicists Juan M. Torres-Rincón, from the Institute of Cosmos Sciences at the University of Barcelona (ICCUB), Santosh K. Das, from the Indian Institute of Technology Goa (India), and Ralf Rapp, from Texas A&M University (United States).

The authors have published a comprehensive review that explores how particles containing heavy quarks (known as charm and bottom hadrons) interact in a hot, dense environment called hadronic matter. This environment is created in the last phase of high-energy collisions of atomic nuclei, such as those taking place at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The new study highlights the importance of including hadronic interactions in simulations to accurately interpret data from experiments at these large scientific infrastructures.

The study broadens the perspective on how matter behaves under extreme conditions and helps to solve some great unknowns about the origin of the universe.

Reproducing the primordial universe

When two atomic nuclei collide at near-light speeds, they generate temperatures more than a 1,000 times higher than those at the centre of the Sun. These collisions briefly produce a state of matter called a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a soup of fundamental particles that existed microseconds after the big bang. As this plasma cools, it transforms into hadronic matter, a phase composed of particles such as protons and neutrons, as well as other baryons and mesons.

The study focuses on what happens to heavy-flavour hadrons (particles containing charmed or background quarks, such as D and B mesons) during this transition and the hadronic phase expansion that follows it.

Heavy particles as probes

Heavy quarks are like tiny sensors. Being so massive, they are produced just after the initial nuclear collision and move more slowly, thus interacting differently with the surrounding matter. Knowing how they scatter and spread is key to learning about the properties of the medium through which they travel.

Researchers have reviewed a wide range of theoretical models and experimental data to understand how heavy hadrons, such as D and B mesons, interact with light particles in the hadronic phase. They have also examined how these interactions affect observable quantities such as particle flux and momentum loss.

"To really understand what we see in the experiments, it is crucial to observe how the heavy particles move and interact also during the later stages of these nuclear collisions," says Juan M. Torres-Rincón, member of the Department of Quantum Physics and Astrophysics and ICCUB.

"This phase, when the system has already cooled down, still plays an important role in how the particles lose energy and flow together. It is also necessary to address the microscopic and transport properties of these heavy systems right at the transition point to the quark-gluon plasma," he continues. "This is the only way to achieve the degree of precision required by current experiments and simulations."

A simple analogy can be used to better understand these results: when we drop a heavy ball into a crowded pool, even after the biggest waves have dissipated, the ball continues to move and collide with people. Similarly, heavy particles created in nuclear collisions continue to interact with other particles around them, even after the hottest and most chaotic phase. These continuous interactions subtly modify the motion of particles, and studying these changes helps scientists to better understand the conditions of the early universe. Ignoring this phase would therefore mean missing an important part of the story.

Looking to the future

Understanding how heavy particles behave in hot matter is fundamental to mapping the properties of the early universe and the fundamental forces that rule it. The findings also pave the way for future experiments at lower energies, such as those planned at CERN's Super Proton Super Synchrotron (SPS) and the future FAIR facility in Darmstadt, Germany. ​​​​​​​

What else is hiding down there?

On October 14, 2024, NASA's Europa Clipper launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for Jupiter's fourth largest moon. Its mission is to assess the moon's potential to host life in the vast ocean beneath its icy crust. While the Europa Clipper is a milestone in humanity's ability to study the oceans of other worlds, Earth's oceans still hold many mysteries yet unsolved by science. 

Without leaving Earth, scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) and the Universidad de Concepción in Chile have discovered new life themselves—a previously unknown, active predator in one of the deepest trenches in the world. Four specimens were collected nearly 8,000 meters below sea level (which is almost as deep as Mount Everest is tall), and scientists named the crustacean “Dulcibella camanchaca”—a reference to the word for “darkness” in the languages of peoples living in the Andes region. 

Although its white carapace gives it a ghostly, almost Facehugger-from-Alien feel, the name is fitting if you consider that this predator lives out its life 7,000 meters below the aphotic zone, where absolute darkness reigns. The researchers described this new species late last month in the journal Systematics and Biodiversity. 

The Atacama Trench, also known as the Peru-Chile Trench, stretches about 3700 miles (6,000 kilometers) along the coast. However, off the coast of northern Chile, the trench plunges to almost 25,246 ft (8,000 m) below the surface—well within the deepest part of the ocean, known as the Hadal zone. 

Scientists have long been interested in exploring this zone, and the discoveries haven't disappointed. In 2023, the Instituto Milenio de Oceanografía (IMO)—based at Universidad de Concepción in Chile—carried out a deep ocean survey aboard the research vessel Abate Molina, which was originally donated to Chile by the Japanese government in the early 90s. Once the specimens were recovered, they were frozen for preservation and subsequently underwent genomic analysis.

"Most excitingly, the DNA and morphology data pointed to this species being a new genus too, emphasizing the Atacama Trench as an endemic hotspot,” Johanna Weston, lead author of the study and expert on the Hadal zone from WHOI, said in a press statement. 

True to its Alien-like appearance, D. camanchaca has a spine-tingling way of devouring its prey—using its raptorial appendages to essentially clamp down on other, smaller crustaceans. (Remind you of anything?) Because of its deep ocean environment, this mighty crustacean, which is only roughly four centimeters in length, can also withstand pressures up to 800 times stronger than pressures found on land. 

“This finding underlines the importance of continued deep-ocean exploration, particularly in Chile's front yard,” IMO's Carolina González, co-lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “More discoveries are expected as we continue to study the Atacama Trench.”

If something so small can persevere in conditions as adverse as those in the Hadal zone, maybe Europa Clipper has a non-zero shot at finding conditions that could support life in the vast, salty ocean of a whole different world.

What Greenland's Ancient Past Reveals about Its Fragile Future

The collapse of the world's second-largest ice sheet would drown cities worldwide. Is that ice more vulnerable than we know?

By Jeffery DelViscio edited by Jen Schwartz & Seth Fletcher

Expedition members Caleb Walcott-George and Arnar Pall Gíslason use a hand drill to pull rock cores out of an outcropping, called a nunatak on the Greenland ice sheet in May 2024. The samples they extract could help solve a much larger climate puzzle: When was the last time that Greenland was green?

Inside a tent fastened to the surface of Greenland's ice sheet, the members of the GreenDrill expedition huddled around a drilling rig. The machine whined and shook as it spun. For days the drillers had been inching through ancient, solid ice to reach the rock below.

Outside, the sun burned down through a cloudless sky. The wind, having tumbled down 4,000 feet of elevation from the domed summit of the ice sheet hundreds of miles to the west, charged over the surface in wavelike pulses. The tent shuddered like some mad bouncy house at the end of the world. The nine members of the expedition—ice and rock engineers, scientists, polar-survival specialists—knew they should be close to bedrock. But Forest Harmon, the driller working the handwheel, said he still couldn't feel the core break—the moment when the metal catcher inside the drill head separates the bedrock core from its earthly tomb.

The GreenDrill site sat on the frozen edge of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, or NEGIS, a massive, moving tongue of ice that drains 12 to 16 percent of the ice sheet into the ocean. Upended and laid atop the contiguous U.S., it would look like a flowing mountain range more than a mile and half tall at its highest point and 20 to 30 miles across, extending from Boston to Washington, D.C. If the entire Greenland ice sheet melted, global sea levels would rise by about 24 feet. The NEGIS is how a good deal of that planet-altering flood would enter the sea.

The sheet won't melt all at once, of course, but scientists are increasingly concerned by signs of accelerating ice-sheet retreat. A recent report showed that it has been losing mass every year for the past 27 years. Another study found that nearly every Greenlandic glacier has thinned or retreated in the past few decades. The NEGIS itself has extensively sped up and thinned over the past decade.

Elliot Moravec, the mechanical engineer monitoring the drill-fluid pressure gauge, smiled, but only slightly. It seemed like something was about to go right, finally—in an expedition where almost nothing had before the team made it to the ice. So much in the weeks leading up to this moment had been uncertain. There were logistical delays and failed landings by military cargo planes. A more ambitious plan, which included a much larger drill and two different sample sites, had been scrapped. The project's two principal investigators were both forced to forfeit the field season at the last minute. One of them had come all the way to Greenland only to have to turn around. The other made the painful decision to not even try to make it to the ice. The rest of the team was marooned for weeks in Kangerlussuaq, a staging location on Greenland's southwestern coast, about 850 miles from the drill site. Then it had taken more than 10 flights over seven days to get them and tens of thousands of pounds of gear onto the ice.

But at this moment, with just two weeks remaining in the expedition, their bit sat at the edge of discovery. The zone below was thought to hold within it a revelation: frozen in stone was a picture of this place but ice-free. Knowing the last time this area was actually green would help scientists answer a question of enormous consequence: Is the Greenland ice sheet even more fragile than we know?

Since President Donald Trump announced his administration's desire to “get” the world's largest island, Greenland has been the subject of sudden global attention. Climate change is exposing land formerly covered by ice, heightening political tensions on the island nation—and in the waters surrounding it as sea ice also disappears. But although the administration's plan to extract Greenland's natural resources is new, the American desire to occupy it, and pull value from underneath its frozen heart, is not.

In 1956 and 1957 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment, or SIPRE, recovered the first long ice cores from Greenland. Europeans and Americans alike had been trying to cross and dig into the ice sheet for decades before then. The “father of continental drift” himself, Alfred Wegener, is still entombed there. Wegener made four expeditions to study Greenland's ice in his lifetime. During his final expedition, in 1930, he died out on the ice. Just before he became a part of the ice record, he wrote: “We are approaching a new era of polar exploration characterized by the successful utilization of new technologies in a rational manner. Everything that we want to and can measure must be measured on the ground.”

In 1956 American scientists were doing exactly that, but the reason they were there at all had as much to do with the cold war as it did with the cold ice. The government's real mission was to build Arctic capabilities so it could both operate and listen from somewhere much closer to the Soviet Union. The location where SIPRE pulled those first deep ice cores from was called Site 2, and despite its public science mission, it was also a top-secret radar installation watching 24-7 for Soviet threats. But the tense geopolitics allowed a scientific discovery that, until then, had seemed impossible: the recovery of deep ice cores that kicked off an international race to recover and interrogate deeper and deeper ice. Those ice cores, and all that would be collected after them, became a kind of high-resolution climatological bedrock on which much of our understanding of rapid climate change rests.

Daniel P. Huffman

Although it is difficult to count the number of ice cores in existence, adding up the length of ice in just the freezers owned by Denmark (Greenland is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark) and the U.S. gives you more than 21 miles of ancient ice. Researchers have dated them, measured the pressure of their enclosed air bubbles, characterized the structure of their snow, detected ancient volcanic cataclysms in their particulate content, and more. The results have given us an indirect way to track the timing of large and abrupt shifts in climate as far back as 123,000 years ago in the case of Greenland and 1.2 million years ago for ice extracted from Antarctica. “They are basically a backbone of climate science in terms of giving us these continuous, high-resolution climate records,” says Joerg Schaefer, GreenDrill's co-principal investigator.

I have a personal 25-year history with one of these backbones. As an undergraduate researcher, I lived for a month on an oceanographic research vessel off Baja California. The mission was to collect sediment cores from the ocean floor. I spent hours and hours taking measurements—more than 30,000 of them—with my face pressed close to stinking, methane-rich mud.

Like ice cores, the sediment cores had visible horizontal bands. Ice cores' bands come from seasonal variations in snowfall; in this marine mud, the winter sediment from above showed up one color, the summer sediment another. I used a measurement technique that allowed me to pull a climate signal out of the alternating light and dark bands. But to confirm that those climate wiggles were real, I had to try to match what I saw with other records that climatologists were really sure showed a strong connection to the hot and cold climate swings of the past; enter Greenland's ice cores.

In 1999, when I was doing my research, the gold standards for such climate-record wiggle matching were ice cores from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) or from the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP). These two projects were a kind of friendly arms race between two different teams—one led by scientists in the U.S. (GISP2), the other by researchers in Europe (GRIP)—but without all the cold war skulduggery. Starting at nearly the same time (the Americans got a one-field-season jump on the Europeans), the two projects, less than 20 miles from each other near the summit of the Greenland ice sheet, raced to the bottom of the ice.

In July 1992 Europe won. That team reached the bed nearly 10,000 feet below the surface and stopped at the end of the ice. When the U.S. group finished a year later, not only did its core reach deeper than 10,000 feet, but the scientists were also able to collect a five-foot-long core of some of the rarest rock in the world—rock from under an ice sheet.

These two deep climatic records became standards to benchmark other records against. My mud record stretched from the present back to about 52,000 years ago. I could take that record of wiggles from dark (cold world above) to light (warmer world above) and see whether the same temperature-related wiggles pulled from the ice core matched up. They did.

Many other climate researchers saw the same thing. In the three decades since these two cores were pulled from the ice sheet, tree rings, coral, cave deposits, other sediments and ice cores from across the world have all been successfully wiggle-matched to the records.

But in all the years researchers spent hunting for ice and finding out all they could about its nature, they mostly neglected to interrogate the stuff the ice is sitting on. That is a critical gap in our knowledge that is just waiting to be closed. “Those bed materials, whether it's sediment or hard bedrock contained within it, are the words, the stories of the history of the ice sheet—it's a book of information down there that we want to read,” says Jason Briner of the University at Buffalo, the other co-principal investigator of GreenDrill. “The bedrock under ice sheets is the least explored remaining zone on Earth's surface,” Schaefer says. “These are moon rocks for us—the most rare and the most hard-to-drill surface rocks anywhere on Earth—and we have practically no direct observations.”

Schaefer and Briner have spent more than a decade fixated on this deep gap in climate science. What they have already found is sobering. “I have, for the first time ever in my career, datasets that take my sleep away at night,” Schaefer says. “They are so direct and tell me this ice sheet is in so much trouble.”

The data that terrify him come from the rock collected in 1993 under the GISP2 ice core. The ice core went off to be immortalized in thousands of research papers as a centerpiece of climate science. The bedrock went into cold storage in the U.S. ice-core repository in Colorado. There it sat for almost two decades. In 2016 Schaefer, Briner and their collaborators exhumed the rock core and read it like a buried history book. They published a research paper in Nature entitled “Greenland Was Nearly Ice-Free for Extended Periods during the Pleistocene.”

The Pleistocene, a period that includes the last ice age, stretched from around 2.6 million to 11,000 years ago, when woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats and the first modern humans roamed over earth and ice. From that one sub-ice rock core, the researchers learned that during that epoch there were periods—at least one, possibly many—when the ice sheet was completely gone or nearly so. “You do one data point, bedrock underneath the thickest part of the Greenland ice sheet, so you basically have to melt the entire ice sheet to make that spot ice-free,” Schaefer says. “Even there the bedrock was telling us, ‘Hell, yes, I was ice-free a lot over the last geological period.'”

“It started what some people like to call the fragile Greenland hypothesis,” says Paul Bierman, an author and geoscientist at the University of Vermont. Bierman and others have found additional evidence to support the worrying idea. In 2023 he and his colleagues published a study that showed “multiple lines of evidence” indicating much of northwestern Greenland was ice-free around 400,000 years ago. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere then was less than 300 parts per million. Today we're at 428 parts per million.

The GreenDrill team is preparing to publish new findings that are even more unnerving for humanity. Caleb Walcott-George, soon to be an assistant professor in the department of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Kentucky, was a graduate student during the first two field seasons of the project. At a recent academic conference, he presented solid evidence that an area in northwestern Greenland three times the size of New York City and currently covered by ice a third of a mile thick was either completely or nearly completely ice-free as recently as about 7,000 years ago. That corresponds with a time called the Holocene Thermal Maximum, when temperatures were just a few degrees warmer on average than they are now. Walcott-George says that's within the range of warming we might experience by 2100.

Not long after Moravec sensed that the drilling rig was on the verge of core break, the team pulled its first sample of the season up from 165 feet below. Minutes later the core sat inside the capped inner core barrel, ready for inspection.

Walcott-George and Allie Balter-Kennedy of Tufts University stood shoulder to shoulder in a small, blacked-out tent originally designed for spearfishing pike over a frozen lake. The only light was a dim tangerine glow coming from a single LED strip taped to the ceiling. Balter-Kennedy and Walcott-George screwed off the drill head at the end of the barrel, tipped the tube up at an angle and gently shook it to get the material inside to slide out into the tray. This rock could tell them when it last saw the light of day. It also “remembered” how long it had been buried. But that memory was delicate, and even a flash of sunlight could throw it off.

Certain minerals in the rock act like batteries by “charging” when they are buried. Radioactive decay in elements surrounding the grains strips their electrons, causing the grains to luminesce, although the rocks don't visibly glow. “We can determine essentially the charge rate, and by doing this we can figure out how long these quartz and feldspar grains have been buried,” Walcott-George says. But even seconds of sunshine can reset this signal, so every time a piece of rock is unearthed from below the ice sheet, they return to the blacked-out tent.

There is another source of stored memory in a subglacial stone, and it originates inside the hearts of dying stars. The cataclysmic explosions that mark the death of a star throw cosmic rays across the galaxy. Those rays blast their way to Earth, creating a cascade of elementary particles that buffet the planet's surface. “When they interact with rocks, they create these nuclear reactions that create isotopes or nuclides that we don't otherwise find on Earth,” Balter-Kennedy explains. “We know the rate at which those nuclides are produced. If we can measure them, we can figure out how long that rock has been exposed to these cosmic rays—or, in our field, how long that rock has been ice-free.”

It's called surface exposure dating, and it works by revealing the total amount of rare isotopes in the rock sample. Over time, periods of sun exposure and burial create on/off spikes in the total amount of nuclides in the rock, with exposed being “on” and covered being “off.”

Allie Balter-Kennedy, now at Tufts University, and Walcott-George, soon to be at the University of Kentucky, measure and package a core sample in a blacked-out fishing tent. The samples have to be protected from contaminating sunlight, which would throw off the climate signal the researchers are trying to extract.

Jeffery DelViscio

If researchers take two of these nuclides—say, beryllium-10 and aluminum-26—and measure their relative levels along many feet of a rock core, they get what's called the decay clock. This clock runs down as each isotope decays at a different, predictable rate. When scientists see parts of the rock record where the clock has gained time, they know that the surface saw the sun. When the sample is buried, the clock slowly loses time in a countdown to zero cosmogenic nuclides.

The two methods allow the scientists to interview the bedrock, so to speak. “You ask: When have you been ice-free? For how long? And how many times have you been ice-free in the recent geological past?” Schaefer says. But that day in the tent it appeared that there might be no bedrock to interview. The core they had pulled up wasn't quite right.

“Where's that smooth bed?” Walcott-George asked, referring to the solid bedrock pay dirt they were looking for.

“I feel like it's gravelly ice, and then ...” Balter-Kennedy trailed off.

“Dirty ice,” Walcott-George said, completing the thought.

They decided they'd try again tomorrow.

Approximately 5,500,000,000,000 tons. That is how much water weight the Greenland ice sheet has lost to the ocean since just 2002. Sequentially dumped into Olympic-size natatoriums, it would provide a personal 660,000-gallon lap pool for every person living in Africa and Europe—all 2.2 billion of them.

But how, exactly, future melt will bring more green to Greenland is one of the biggest questions that science has yet to answer. “The scientific community right now does not know how the Greenland ice sheet disintegrates,” Briner says. “We don't know what the mechanisms are and how long it takes for the ice sheet to get to its teeny-tiny state.”

In discussions of Antarctica, the word “collapse” is now often associated with the loss of ice through ice shelves such as the Thwaites, a floating extension of the Antarctic ice sheet. Nearly 75 percent of Antarctica's coastal ice is in ice shelves floating in water. But the fate of Greenland is believed to be tied to that of its ice streams, which are more like small tongues that ring the island and are confined by deeply carved fjords.

Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, a Danish ice-core climatologist, first came to the Greenland ice sheet in 1981. Back then, “no one was talking about global warming,” she says. When she told people she was drilling ice cores for climate research, they assumed she was investigating when the next ice age would arrive. In her four decades of working on this ice sheet, Dahl-Jensen has seen changes happen in real time. One day in 2012 she was on the ice—and it rained. “I saw it as a very pure sign of global warming that we actually got rain on the center of the Greenland ice sheet,” she says.

Some of the displayed drill bits for the Winkie Drill system are best for drilling through ice; some are for cutting through bedrock.

More recently Dahl-Jensen led research for the East Greenland Ice-Core Project, which in 2023 managed to pull a 1.5-mile-long ice core (and some subglacial mud and stone) from close to where the NEGIS begins. The entire process had taken eight years. “When you look at the balance of the ice sheet and how much it has lost, half of the extra loss is from melt along the coast of Greenland, but the other half is from acceleration of the ice in the streams,” she says. Dahl-Jensen knows that ice streams are a big factor in sea-level rise, but she's also aware that we don't yet know how they behave. “We are not capable of modeling them properly into our ice-sheet models,” she explains.

That is why the GreenDrill team wanted to get bedrock underneath the NEGIS from a site much closer to where it meets the coast. Measurements from each of these projects will feed into the mathematical models, which attempt to simulate how the real world works. “We have so many gaps in our physical understanding of how an ice sheet actually responds,” Schaefer says, noting that current models have big error margins.

Ice-sheet models work much like the climate models we use all the time—the ones that predict tomorrow's weather. They use mathematics to simulate the interactions among real atmospheric phenomena: wind, pressure, moisture, thermodynamics, and lots more. They are reasonably trustworthy over hours to days because they are loaded with real data: historical data; measurements from weather satellites and balloons; and observations from land, sea and commercial aircraft.

Improving the ability of ice-sheet models to accurately predict how the sheet will respond to the warming it is experiencing now—and that yet to come—is no different. The models need data-based gut checks to make sure their predictions are informed and constrained by as much reality as we can feed into them.

Schaefer believes reducing the error will make ice-sheet models better tools for adapting to climate change. “If you are a politician and you want to make New York City—or any city that is close to the ocean—sea-level safe, you need precise predictions of what is going to happen,” he says. And those predictions will become increasingly vital as the world moves deeper and deeper into its climate-warmed future—a future that those who study Greenland fear will be societally altering.

“Think about the mass migration that will happen if we melt all of the Greenland ice sheet,” Bierman says. “That's not tomorrow—that's centuries from now and even millennia from now—but when that happens, that will be the biggest movement of humans ever because they'll lose their farms, they'll lose their cities, they'll lose their homes,” he says. “It will be creeping and slow, but it will happen.”

The day after the heartbreak in the fishing tent, the team hit solid rock. It was what they had come for, and they found it just in time. A blizzard blew through camp hours later, shutting down drilling for the next two days.

When the work resumed, the team decided to try for a second core. This one would be half as deep as the first, so, the researchers reasoned, maybe they could get even more precious rock from under the ice to interrogate in half the time it took to get the first sample. All work had to be wrapped up within a week to leave them enough time to pack up for extraction. With good-enough weather, the twin-engine ski plane would be landing at the site, and it wasn't going to wait for anything.

Over the next two days they made good progress. Rather than setting up the drill tent all over again, they decided to chance a mostly unprotected drill hole. A small wind break was all that separated them from the wind and blowing ice. While Moravec, Harmon and Tanner Kuhl, the third and most experienced ice-drilling engineer, started again, the others fanned out onto the nunataks, dark peaks that broke through the ice-bound oblivion like the heads of whales surfacing through the ocean of ice. There Walcott-George, Balter-Kennedy and Arnar Pall Gíslason, the team's survival guide, used backpack-size rock drills to take a core from the surface of a nunatak. The rock was constantly exposed to sun and cosmic rays, and the luminescence signal and cosmogenic nuclides pulled from it would provide the baseline against which the under-the-ice-sheet rock cores would be compared. Just as it started to look like they might have this victory-lap sampling in the bag, a second blizzard blasted through the site.

“Let's get the hell out of here,” yelled Matt Anfinson, the camp mechanic. He emerged from the drill tent into a whiteout. The storm was still picking up. The drill tent, the only refuge aside from the mess and sleeping tents, was bowing ominously in the 50-mile-per-hour winds. It was time for the team to grope its way back to camp with only a line of red flags to guide it through the nearly zero-visibility conditions.

For the past three hours the group had been involved in a kind of mechanical open-heart surgery. The patients were two backpack drills that had stopped working during sampling on the nearby nunatak. The team had brought two to be safe; both had died. The drills lay on the worktable, guts exposed. After fiddling with the ignition coils, Anfinson ripped on the starter pulls. As one drill spun into high gear through smoke and sputter, he looked like an ice-field Dr. Frankenstein, gleefully and maniacally gazing on his reincarnation. It was a rare victory amid a “weather daze,” as Harmon, the driller, called it.

Living through blizzards like these feels like what you'd expect inside a sensory-deprivation white-noise machine. This latitude sees no darkness in May and June, but without a break in the gale-force winds, the conditions outside are both bright and blinding. Wind-sculpted snowdrifts grow through the field camp like giant, icy fingers. They block the doors of sleeping tents and make walking treacherous; you either trip on a three-foot-tall snow wall that wasn't there hours before or fall off one into three feet of powder.

There was a cruel monotony to the continuous winds. They forced the crew into smaller and smaller circles of living—sleep tent to mess tent to bathroom tent and back. Barbara Olga Hild, the polar bear guard, fought through the long, bright nights to keep the electrified wire fence around the camp from being covered by drifting snow. Walcott-George sat in the mess tent brewing carafe after carafe of strong coffee and engaging in Arctic self-care, using superglue to seal his dry, cracked fingers against drilling fluid. Balter-Kennedy patched punctures and tears in her favorite polar bib and pored over her core-sample logbooks. Moravec and Harmon played cribbage for hours. Everyone skulked outside into the whiteout on rotation to fill an orange five-gallon cooler with snow to be melted on a camp stove for water (it is ironic how much effort it takes to make drinkable water when we are surrounded by ice).

Perversely, it was during the weather's harshest moments that people used to working on the ice opened up about why they seek out the cold and the isolation of polar work. “The reason people go to the Arctic is [that] you can hear the silence,” Hild said. Dahl-Jensen, the Danish ice-core scientist, told me that the months of near-complete isolation from the rest of the world have become a prized part of the experience, worth any amount of cold and discomfort. “We live in our camp and do our research, and the time where you can only focus on one thing is really wonderful,” she said. That feeling—of slowing down, of concentration—is something many on the team told me they miss when they're off the ice. “I always dread the end of a field season,” Balter-Kennedy said. On the other side is the stark return to normal life, the avalanche of unanswered e-mails, the fact that things are different than when you left them.

When the storm finally cleared after three days, the team practically launched through the tent opening to get back to work. Because of the blizzard, they had just two full days to complete the new drill hole. The first core took a week to get, and that was without any weather delays. Everything had to go right now.

Just one day later the entire team was standing around the drill and taking in the last sample before packing up. The drill had burned through almost 70 feet of ice. The weather was sunny. The day felt unseasonably warm—about 15 degrees Fahrenheit above freezing—and the team easily cranked through the last drilling run. As the last rock core entered the bottom of the barrel, the sounds of the rock band Ween floated out onto the open ice.

The core came up clean. The team closed the hole with a cheer and a small pour of the Danish liqueur Gammel Dansk, or, as it was better known here, “driller's fluid.” It wasn't for the crew. “You were a good hole,” Harmon said as Moravec poured booze down to the bedrock.

Walcott-George hoisted the final rock core like a prize striped bass. Then, as they had done all season, he and Balter-Kennedy noted its lengths and features and stored it for transport, not yet knowing what story of Greenland's ice-free past, and our flooded future, it might tell.

We might miss our shot at observing the first stars to ever exist. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Mega-constellations of satellites are connecting more and more of the world to the internet, beaming it down to Earth on an unprecedented scale. Unfortunately, in that process, they seem to be putting other scientific efforts at risk. 

With over 7,600 small satellites hovering in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and a total of 12,000 (with an extension to a possible 36,000) planned, SpaceX's Starlink is without a doubt the largest satellite mega-constellation bringing internet to the masses. But it comes at a cost—while Starlink is in compliance with regulations intended to keep it from interfering with scientific observations, unintentional leakage of radio waves from thousands of its satellites has reached a level that could severely interfere with observations of faint radio sources going back to the early days of the universe. 

SpaceX has managed to prevent some interference by switching off beams that transmit internet when their satellites pass over telescopes, but that hasn't cancelled out the entire problem.

Astronomer Steven Tingay of Curtin University's International Center for Radio Astronomy Research in Australia is concerned. He and colleagues Dylan Grigg and Marcin Sokolowski investigated the types of emissions that were leaking from Starlink satellites, how much of these emissions were being released, and in what ways the mega-constellation could have a negative impact on Earth-based radio observations. He previously used the SKA-Low prototype station to analyze satellite constellation impacts on radio astronomy.

“A small fraction of the radio spectrum across the SKA-Low's bandwidth has protection for radio astronomy,” Tingay, Grigg, and Sokolowski said in a study recently posted to the preprint server arXiv. “Although these protections exist, a succession of research has shown that an increasing number of satellites are being detected transmitting unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR) outside their designated downlink frequencies, and sometimes at these protected frequencies.”

Some of SKA-Low's bandwidth—3.7 percent, to be exact—is protected by the International Telecommunications Union's Radiocommunication. But 3.7 percent is proving not to be enough. Starlink launches were already problematic when Tingay and his team conducted the study, with 477 satellites being sent to space during the four months they were collecting data. The two frequencies being released by many of the satellites in the constellation were 137.5 MHz and 159.4 MHz, which are two of the same radio frequencies at which astronomical observations are made.

Tingay's team conducted the largest survey of Starlink satellites at SKA-Low frequencies. While there are there different models of satellite producing varying emissions, most of the ones that were leaking the problematic radio waves were type v2-mini-Ku (though, some v2-mini DTC and v1.5 models were also emitting waves at these frequencies). Starlink owns 75% of the v2-mini-Ku satellites in orbit, meaning that the company has the greatest responsibility when it comes to leakage from from these particular models.

Leakage may go beyond interference in certain domains, even going so far as to potentially block observations that go all the way back to the Epoch of Reionizaiton—about a billion years after the Big Bang. This was when most of the electrically neutral hydrogen in the universe was charged by rising levels of radiation from the most ancient massive stars, known as Population III or Pop III stars (no Pop III stars have been detected yet). If left unchecked, radio emissions from Starlink satellites could get in the way of monumental discoveries.

“Future mitigation of the UEMR from Starlink satellites will be key for ultra-sensitive experiments with the SKA,” the researchers said. “SpaceX has made significant progress liaising with astronomers in the optical domain, and we hope to keep this dialogue open in the radio domain.”

What Is Your Cat Trying to Say? These AI Tools Aim to Decipher Meows

AI is shedding new light on the 12,000-year conversation between cats and their humans, suggesting that house cats wield a far richer vocabulary than once thought

By Deni Ellis Béchard edited by Dean Visser

Meeaaaoow rises like a question mark before dawn. Anyone living with a cat knows their sounds: broken chirrups like greetings, low growls that warn, purrs stitched into sleepy conversation. Ethologists have organized feline sounds that share acoustic and contextual qualities into more than 20 groupings, including the meow, the hiss, the trill, the yowl and the chatter. Any individual meow belongs, academically speaking, to a broad “meow” category, which itself contains many variations. The house cat's verbal repertoire is far greater than that of its largely silent wild cousins. Researchers have even begun to study whether cats can drift into regional dialects, the way human accents bend along the Hudson or the Thames. And just as humans gesticulate, shrug, frown and raise their eyebrows, cats' fur and whiskers write subtitles: a twitching tail declares excitement, flattened ears signal fear, and a slow blink promises peace. Felis catus is a chatty species that, over thousands of years of domestication, has pivoted its voice toward the peculiar primate that opens the fridge.

Now imagine pointing your phone at that predawn howl and reading: “Refill bowl, please.” Last December Baidu—a Chinese multinational company that specializes in Internet services and artificial intelligence—filed a patent application for what it describes as a method for transforming animal vocalizations into human language. (A Baidu spokesperson told Reuters last month that the system is “still in the research phase.”) The proposed system would gather animal signals and process them: it would store kitten or puppy talk for “I'm hungry” as code, then pair it not only with motion-sensing data such as tail swishes but also with vital signs such as heart rate and core temperature. All of these data would get whisked through an AI system and blended before emerging as plain-language phrases in English, Mandarin or any other tongue.

The dream of decoding cat speech is much older than deep learning. By the early 20th century meows had been recorded on wax cylinders, and in the 1970s John Bradshaw, a British anthrozoologist, began more than four decades of mapping how domestic cats tell us—and each other—what they mean. By the 1990s he and his then doctoral student Charlotte Cameron-Beaumont had established that the distinct domestic “meow,” largely absent between adults in feral colonies, is a bespoke tool for managing humans. Even domestic cats rarely use it with each other, though kittens do with their mothers. Yet for all that anecdotal richness, the formal literature remained thin: there were hundreds of papers on bird song and dozens on dolphin whistles but only a scattering on feline phonology until machine learning revived the field in the past decade.

One of the first hints that computers might crack the cat code came in 2018, when AI scientist Yagya Raj Pandeya and his colleagues released CatSound, a library of roughly 3,000 clips covering 10 types of cat calls labeled by the scientists—from hiss and growl to purr and mother call. Each clip went through software trained on musical recordings to describe a sound's “shape”—how its pitch rose or fell and how long it lasted—and a second program cataloged them accordingly. When the system was tested on clips it hadn't seen during training, it identified the right call type around 91 percent of the time. The study showed that the 10 vocal signals had acoustic fingerprints a machine can spot—giving researchers a proof of concept for automated cat-sound classification and eventual translation.

Momentum built quickly. In 2019 researchers at the University of Milan in Italy published a study focused on the one sound aimed squarely at Homo sapiens. The research sliced the meow into three situational flavors: “waiting for food,” “isolation in an unfamiliar environment” and “brushing.” By turning each meow into a set of numbers, the researchers revealed that a “feed me” meow had a noticeably different shape from a “where are you?” meow or a “brush me” meow. After they trained a computer program to spot those shapes, the researchers tested the system much as Pandeya and colleagues had tested theirs: it was presented with meows not seen during training—all hand labeled based on circumstances such as hunger or isolation. The system correctly identified the meows up to 96 percent of the time, and the research confirmed that cats really do tweak their meows to match what they're trying to tell us.

The research was then scaled to smartphones, turning kitchen-table curiosity into consumer AI. Developers at software engineering company Akvelon, including a former Alexa engineer, teamed up with one of the study's researchers to create the MeowTalk app, which they claim can translate meows in real time. MeowTalk has used machine learning to categorize thousands of user-submitted meows by common intent, such as “I'm hungry,” “I'm thirsty,” “I'm in pain,” “I'm happy” or “I'm going to attack.” A 2021 validation study by MeowTalk team members claimed success rates near 90 percent. But the app also logs incorrect translation taps from skeptical owners, which serves as a reminder that the cat might be calling for something entirely different in reality. Probability scores can simply reflect pattern similarity—not necessarily the animal's exact intent.

Under the hood, these machine-learning systems treat cat audio tracks like photographs. A meow becomes a spectrogram: one axis represents time, the other indicates pitch, and colors or brightness show loudness. Just as AI systems can pick out a cat's whiskers in a photograph, they can classify sound images that subtly distinguish specific kinds of meows. Last year researchers at Duzce University in Türkiye upgraded the camera: they fed spectrograms into a vision transformer, a model that chops them into tiles and assigns weights to each one to show which parts of the sound give the meow its meaning.

And in May 2025 entrepreneur Vlad Reznikov uploaded a preprint to the social network ResearchGate on what he calls Feline Glossary Classification 2.3, a system that explodes cat vocabulary categorizations to 40 distinct call types across five behavioral groups. He used one machine-learning system to find the shapes inside each sound and another to study how those shapes change over the length of a single vocalization. Howls stretch, purrs pulse and many other distinct vocalizations link together in varying ways. According to Reznikov's preprint, the model had a greater than 95 percent accuracy in real-time recognition of cat sounds. Peer reviewers have yet to sharpen their pencils, but if the system can reliably distinguish a bored yowl from a “where's my salmon?” warble, it may, if nothing else, save a lot of carpets.

As for Baidu, the blueprint for its patent says its approach adds new kinds of information rather than deeper sound analysis. Imagine a cat with a fitness tracker and a baby monitor, as well as an AI assistant to explain what it all means. Whether combining these data will make the animal's message clearer or add confusion remains to be seen.

Machine learning is increasingly being used to understand other aspects of animal behavior as well. Brittany Florkiewicz, a comparative and evolutionary psychologist, uses it to identify how cats mimic one another's facial expressions and to track the physical distance between them to infer relationships. “Generally speaking, machine learning helps expedite the research process, making it very efficient and accurate, provided the models are properly guided,” she says. She believes the emergence of apps for pet owners shows how much people are thinking about innovative ways to better care for their pets. “It's positive to see both the research community and everyday pet owners embracing this technology,” she says.

Interest in animal vocalization extends not just to cats but to one of their favorite menu items: mice. DeepSqueak, a machine-learning system devised by psychologist Kevin Coffey and his team, does for rodents what the other systems do for cats. “Mice courtship is really interesting,” Coffey says—particularly “the full songs that they sing that humans can't hear but that are really complex songs.” Mice and rats normally communicate in an ultrasonic range, and machine learning decodes these inaudible chirps and whistles and links them to circumstances in which they occur in the lab.

Coffey points out, however, that “the animal communication space is defined by the concepts that are important to [the animals]—the things that matter in their lives.... A rat or a mouse or cat is mostly interested in communicating that they want social interaction or play or food or sex, that they're scared or hurt.” For this reason, he's skeptical of grandiose claims made by AI companies “that we can overlap the conceptual semantic space of the animal languages and then directly translate—which is, I think, kind of total nonsense. But the idea that you can record and categorize animal vocalizations, relate them to behavior, and learn more about their lives and how complex they are—that's absolutely happening.” And though he thinks an app could realistically help people recognize when their cat is hungry or wants to be petted, he doubts it's necessary. “We're already pretty good at that. Pet owners already communicate with their animal at that level.”

Domesticated animals also communicate across species. A 2020 study found that dogs and horses playing together rapidly mimicked each other's relaxed open-mouth facial expressions and self-handicapped, putting themselves into disadvantageous or vulnerable situations to maintain well-balanced play. Florkiewicz believes this might be partly a result of domestication: humans selected which animals to raise based on communicative characteristics that facilitated shared lives.

The mutual story of humans and cats is thought to have begun 12,000 years ago—when wildcats hunted rodents in the first grain stores of Neolithic farming villages in the Fertile Crescent—so there has been time for us to adapt to each other. By at least 7500 B.C.E., in Cyprus (an island with no native felines), a human had been interred with a cat. Later the Egyptians revered them; traders, sailors and eventually Vikings carried them around the world on ships; and now scientists have adapted humans' most sophisticated technology to try to comprehend their inner lives. But perhaps cats have been coaching us all along, and maybe they'll judge our software with the same cool indifference they reserve for new toys. Speech, after all, isn't merely a label but a negotiated meaning—and cats, as masters of ambiguity, may prefer a little mystery.

Postgraduate students are vulnerable in academic settings. Roughly 6% of 160 PhD-level respondents to a 2023 survey in England reported having experienced unwanted behaviours of a sexual nature in the previous year (see go.nature.com/4ke6pv9). One-third of those were not sure how to report their experience to the university, or where to seek support. Similar, or higher, rates were found in studies in Australia (some 30,000 participants) and the United States (more than 180,000 participants).

As a scholar and activist working to address sexual harassment in higher education, I have seen how devastating it is for students when faculty members abuse their power. In 2016, the resignation of feminist scholar Sara Ahmed from Goldsmiths College, University of London, in protest at the lack of action against sexual harassment rocked the UK higher-education community. I co-founded a campaigning organization, The 1752 Group, dedicated to redressing the situation. The group's name reflects the meagre amount of money that Goldsmiths invested in our first conference on tackling the issue — £1,752 (US$2,380). This stopgap approach is emblematic of academia's reluctance to engage with the problem.

The huge toll of PhDs on mental health: data reveal stark effects

The huge toll of PhDs on mental health: data reveal stark effects

At last, nearly ten years on, England is taking action. From 1 August, England's national regulator for higher education, the Office for Students, will require institutions to protect students from harassment or sexual misconduct.

This is a welcome step. But the guidelines must include specific protective measures for PhD students. As researchers, they work in environments distinct from those of students in taught programmes. They are more likely to be targeted by staff members, both at their institution and outside it. This is partly because of their close relationship with advisers and mentors, and partly because of academia's deeply hierarchical, gender-unequal culture.

Any form of harassment can disrupt people's lives, careers, professional networks, and physical and mental health. Some people report experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder or a loss of confidence. Those targeted sometimes change fields or leave academia altogether.

My research has shown that the main reason students report sexual harassment by a member of staff is to keep themselves and others safe. But too often, they receive little to no commitment from universities that they and others will be shielded from perpetrators.

How PhD students and other academics are fighting the mental-health crisis in science

How PhD students and other academics are fighting the mental-health crisis in science

Many institutions are still building systems and expertise to address sexual harassment. A change in attitude is crucial. Even now, I hear that such misconduct is rare, or not that serious. Other barriers persist. In Europe, data privacy regulations can hinder efforts to keep people safe. Distinct disclosures about the same alleged perpetrator, for example, aren't usually linked.

Metrics details

Over recent decades the Amazon region has been exposed to large-scale land-use changes and global warming. How these changes affect Amazonia's hydrological cycle remains unclear as meteorological data are scarce. We use tree ring oxygen isotope records to confirm that the Amazon hydrological cycle has intensified since 1980. Diverging isotopic trends from terra firme and floodplain trees from distinct sites (approximately 1000 km apart) in Western Amazon indicate rainfall amounts increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season at large-scale. Using the Rayleigh distillation model, we estimate that wet season rainfall increased by 15–22%, and dry season rainfall decreased by 8–13%. These diverging trends provide evidence, independent from existing climate records, that the seasonality of the hydrological cycle in the Amazon is increasing. Continuation of the observed trends will have a pervasive impact on Amazon forests and floodplain ecosystems, and strongly affect the livelihoods of the regional riverine communities.

There is growing concern about the future of the Amazon forests with several recent reports1,2 suggesting the system could be close to a ‘critical transition', interpreted as irreversible large-scale forest loss due to the interactive impacts of deforestation, heat and drought on local climate. Given Amazonia's importance for global biodiversity3, terrestrial carbon stocks4 and livelihoods5 it is important to evaluate these concerns. Large-scale deforestation could cause reductions in precipitation6 and land surface temperature increases7 which are further affected by fossil fuel burning induced climate change8 and by reductions in precipitation recycling due to vegetation responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations9,10. Early estimates by General Circulation Models (GCMs) studying the combined effects of deforestation and climate indicated a severe drying of the Amazon, resulting in widespread dieback of the Amazon forests11. While more recent modelling predictions suggest such an extreme scenario may be unlikely, there is still considerable variation in rainfall projections for the Amazon varying from drying to wetting, and critical transitions could result12.

Rainfall changes are thought to be a central component for potentially causing an irreversible transition of Amazonia's forests2,6,11. Obtaining more reliable data on changes in rainfall over recent time is thus a pre-requisite to understand in what direction the system is heading, and to determine which global climate model predictions are consistent with observations and thus more likely to be realistic. Observational evidence indicates that the hydrological cycle of the Amazon has been changing in the past few decades with trends varying between regions and seasons. Some studies suggest that the south of the Amazon is getting dryer13,14,15,16, while others show wetting in large parts of the basin15,17,18, with increased frequency of severe droughts and floods19,20. A reliable quantification of these changes is needed to understand contributions of anthropogenic drivers (i.e. deforestation and climate change) versus natural climate variability and to assess risks for the future21. However, these efforts are hampered by a lack of meteorological data. Rain gauge stations are sparsely distributed across the basin (only one station per 150,000 km2), their operation is often discontinuous, and methodologies are changing over time22,23. Remote sensing and data assimilation are becoming increasingly more accurate and reliable, but time series are relatively short and there is still disagreement between these products18,23,24. River level data may offer a more reliable, long-term record, but the varying seasonality of river levels of the many tributaries of the Amazon River may mask the timing and strength of the changes, especially for the dry season25. Thus, more information to evaluate the response of the Amazon basin to climate change is needed.

New information to aid our understanding of past variability of the hydrological cycle can be obtained from natural climate proxies. Different archives can be used for this purpose including ice cores26, lake sediments27, speleothems28, and tree rings29. In forested regions, tree rings can provide climate proxies with annual resolution, but finding suitable tropical species that form reliable annual rings can be difficult. In addition, growth of tropical trees in moist and warm climates is generally not very sensitive to inter-annual climate variation29. An approach that partly overcomes these challenges is the analysis of stable oxygen isotopes in the cellulose of tree rings. This approach results in excellent signal strength, thus allowing more reliable reconstructions with fewer samples compared to standard ring-width chronologies30,31. Oxygen isotopes in tree rings (δ18OTR) to a large degree reflect the δ18O of source water (mostly rainfall)32,33, which for the Amazon basin is controlled by the depletion of heavier isotopes in water vapor due to rainout of heavier water molecules (H218O) during moisture transport over land (i.e. Rayleigh distillation of water in the atmosphere)34,35,36. Due to this mechanism, δ18OTR from western locations in the Amazon have been found to closely reflect the amount of rainfall over large regions of the Amazon basin and provide data representative of climate variability at large scale30,31,37,38.

Annual ring formation in tropical trees is generally triggered by the annual cessation of cambial growth during a distinct dry season, restricting growth to the wet season39. An exception to this is trees from Amazon floodplains, where annually recurring multi-month floods create anoxic soil conditions, that impede cambial activity and restrict the growth of floodplain trees to the terrestrial (i.e. non-flooded) phase40. For many regions in the Amazon, the terrestrial phase of floodplain forests coincides with the local and Amazon-wide dry season (Supplementary Fig. 1). As a result, growth of floodplain and terra firme trees (i.e. non-flooded) are out of sync, occurring during the dry and wet seasons respectively (Fig. 1). These differences should allow for a seasonal reconstruction of the regional hydrological cycle at large-scale. Here, we pioneer this approach to reconstruct changes in rainfall seasonality from 1980 to 2010 by comparing tree ring oxygen isotope series (δ18OTR) from a floodplain species (Macrolobium acaciifolium) and terra firme species (Cedrela odorata) from the western and south-western Amazon, with a climatic footprint that largely coincides with the Amazon-wide region and climate (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3).

Color shading indicate the upwind regions of moisture transport from each site, derived from the HYSPLIT back trajectories (see Supplementary Fig 3 and Methods section). b Schematic diagram showing the seasonal phenological differences between terra firme and floodplain environments. c Seasonal variation of the local river level at the floodplain site, rainfall for the Amazon Basin, and local rainfall at the terra firme site. d Images of the annual growth rings of Macrolobium acaciifolium and Cedrela odorata tree species used in this study, with red arrows indicating ring boundaries. In (c), Arrows indicate the growing seasons of the trees, and vertical lines indicate the seasonal boundaries defined by rainfall and river levels. Vertical dotted lines extends the boundaries of the Amazon-wide seasons (bottom panel) for a visual comparison of how they overlap with the local growing seasons at each of the sites. Note that for calculations using rainfall data, we disregarded the shoulder months of those seasons, i.e. the months immediately next to the black vertical lines (details in Methods).

The interannual variation of δ18OTR of both species is negatively related to the interannual variation in Amazon-wide precipitation during their respective growing seasons (Fig. 2). Peak rainfall correlations for the floodplain δ18OTR chronology occurred from August to November, within the growing season for M. acaciifolium which extends from July to November (Fig. 2a-c), while the terra firme δ18OTR chronology correlations peak from January to May, almost entirely within the growth season for C. odorata which extends from November to April (Fig. 2e–g). Correlations that extend outside the trees'growing seasons are generally weaker, which could be due to interannual variation in the growing season length of the trees.

Bars indicate the Pearson's r between δ18OTR and 3-monthly means of rainfall or river levels. Filled bars indicate significant correlations with 95% confidence interval. Shaded areas show seasonal variation in precipitation in the Amazon region (a,b,c,e,f,g) or Amazon river levels at Obidos (d,h). Dotted lines and arrows indicate the growing season of the floodplain and terra firme trees. The x-axis spans the full hydrological year, and therefore extends across two calendar years. Months January to May in the three-month periods on the right-hand side of the x-axis correspond to the year after the onset of the ring formation.

Climate correlations for the record of M. acaciifolium are for a shorter seasonal window. This could reflect the short, non-flooded period during which this species mainly grows40, or be due to differences in methodology as we only used the middle portion of the rings for this species to avoid interference of river water δ18O and capture climate signals of the peak growing season41. Correlations for the C. odorata record cover a longer period coinciding with the longer growing season of this species30. The correlations for this record lag the onset of the species' growing season by one month probably due to a lag between leaf flush, the start of cambial activity and xylogenesis42.

The two δ18OTR records also show close correlations with Amazon River level records measured at Obidos (Fig. 2d, h). The periods of significant correlations correspond very well with the months of low river levels for M. acaciifolium, and with the months of high river levels for C. odorata. Because of lag times between Amazon precipitation and river level43, these correlations are ca. 3-5 months later than the rainfall-δ18OTR correlations. All correlations with climate were very similar when we averaged rainfall over the Amazon region or over the estimated regions of moisture transport (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). This large scale climatic footprint of the δ18OTR records is further evidenced by spatial correlation analyses of δ18OTR with gridded precipitation datasets (Supplementary Fig. 6).

The two δ18OTR chronologies show diverging long-term patterns, with a positive trend (p < 0.05) in the M. acaciifolium record and a negative trend (p < 0.1) in the C. odorata since the mid 1970s. The divergence between the two records since mid 1970s is greater than at any other time in the period covered (Supplementary Fig. 7). The trend in the M. acaciifolium record starts a few years earlier than the trend in the C. odorata record. To estimate the magnitude of changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, or moisture influx required to explain the trends in the δ18OTR records, we used a Rayleigh distillation model (Eq. 3, Fig. 3, see Methods for details). For these estimates we calculate changes for the period of 1980-2010, when there was an increase of 1.14‰ in the dry season record for M. acaciifolium and a decrease of 0.90‰ in the wet season record of C. odorata (Fig. 3c).

[1]), with green and blue lines indicating the expected effects of increasing evapotranspiration (E) and precipitation (P), respectively. c δ18OTR chronologies, with blue lines showing the wet season record obtained from C. odorata trees from terra firme forests, and red line showing the dry season record obtained from M. acaciifolium trees from floodplain forests. Straight lines indicate significant trends at 90% confidence interval. d, e Inferred changes in rainfall since 1980, calculated from a Rayleigh distillation framework based on the Δδ18OTR trends (see methods). Lighter vertical stippled lines indicate an evapotranspiration change scenario corresponding to 0% and ±5% over the entire analysed period, and shading indicates possible variations arising from uncertainties in estimates of evapotranspiration, moisture flux and vapor δ18O (see also Table 1). Note that in (c), the δ18O axis is inverted.

In the simplest version of this model, we assumed that there were no changes in moisture influx into the basin, or evapotranspiration along air parcel paths, and thus attributed all observed changes in δ18OTR to changes in precipitation along the water vapour path. This results in an estimated increase in wet season precipitation of 5% per decade (i.e. ΔP/ΔPi, 15.5% since 1980 C.E.) (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig 8b, Table 1) and an estimated decrease in dry season precipitation of 4.4% per decade (−13.5% from 1980–2010 C.E.) (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig 8a, Table 1).

These estimates however are sensitive to various assumptions. Firstly, this model version assumes no trend in the coastal (i.e., initial) air column water vapour content (Ni). However, observed sea surface temperatures have increased by approximately 0.5oC since 1980 C.E. over the tropical North Atlantic, which would result in an 4% increase in air water holding capacity according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for saturated vapour pressure (i.e., 7% for each oC44). Assuming the change in mass of water in atmospheric inflow is linearly proportional to the ratio of saturated vapor pressures in 2010 and in 1980, accounting for this increase in water vapour in the Rayleigh model (i.e., changing Nf - Ni, or ΔN, see Eqs. 2, 3) results in larger estimates for increases in wet season precipitation (i.e. 5.9% instead of 5% per decade) and weaker drying trends for the dry season (i.e., −3.6% instead of −4.4% per decade, Case 1 in Table 1). Independent records from ERA5 indicate that wet season (Nov-March) water vapour inflow increased by 8%, but show no support for dry season changes in vapour inflow (Supplementary Fig. 3ef). Using the changes from ERA5 would result in a larger difference between wet and dry season trends.

We further assumed there are no changes in the total evapotranspiration of the forest. In our estimates, we considered that evapotranspiration recycles 40% of total dry season rainfall and 32.5% of total wet season rainfall45. Deforestation or CO2-induced stomatal closure may result in decreases in evapotranspiration6,46, while warming induced vapour pressure deficit may increase evaporative demand47. These opposing effects may offset each other48, which could explain why no changes in evapotranspiration are evident within a variety of dataset types and sources for the Amazon49. While the extent of shifts in evapotranspiration at large-scale in the Amazon remains uncertain47, recent evidence suggests that Amazon evapotranspiration may have decreased by approximately 6% in the past 30 years50. The contribution of total evapotranspiration to rainfall can influence the degree of Rayleigh distillation effect during moisture transport (Fig. 3b) and thereby add uncertainty to our estimates (Eqs. 3 and 4). We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess variations in our estimates under different scenarios of changes in evapotranspiration during the analysed period. This sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates of precipitation changes are not very sensitive to the effects of changes in evapotranspiration on the Rayleigh distillation: the Rayleigh model shows that a 1-1.5% change in evapotranspiration per decade has only a minor (±0.5 to 0.8% per decade) effect on our estimates of precipitation changes for the two seasons (Fig. 3, Table 1, case 5). Our analysis further shows that these estimates are insensitive to assumed condensation temperature of water vapour in the clouds (Table 1, case 6).

Additional smaller uncertainties in our estimates arise from possible changes in the contribution of leaf water enrichment to δ18OTR, evaporative enrichment of soil water, in the isotopic composition of water vapor entering the basin, in rainfall type or intensity, and from uncertainties related to the magnitude of the continental difference of δ18Ocoast to δ18Osite, and the assumed recycling ratio of evapotranspiration over precipitation, \({r}_{E:P}\). See Table 1 for all quantified uncertainties arising from these factors, and supplementary materials for a full discussion of how these factors may affect our estimates.

Our results show that floodplain and terra firme trees record the climate for different seasons at large-scale (Fig. 2). When analysed together these records provide more detailed, seasonally resolved climate reconstructions for the Amazon compared to using one single species. To the degree that δ18OTR accurately reflects rainfall δ18O, these trends are due to long-term changes in the rainout of heavy water (H218O) along the air parcel trajectory from the tropical north Atlantic to the site of precipitation34,35. Previous analysis for C. odorata from the terra firme site has shown that the total cumulated precipitation over the air parcel path over land is a very strong predictor of inter-annual variation in δ18OTR31 giving confidence that the signal is governed by Rayleigh distillation during moisture transport over land. Analysis of atmospheric back trajectories of moisture transport for the two study sites show that they have similar paths that cover a large portion (60-70%) of the Amazon basin, with a climatic footprint that is highly representative of Amazon-wide rainfall (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. 2-5). This large-scale spatial footprint is further confirmed by spatial correlation analyses of these records with gridded precipitation datasets (Supplementary Fig. 6). The diverging long-term trends in δ18OTR are therefore interpreted to reflect diverging seasonal trends in precipitation for the same central region of the Amazon basin.

Taking identified uncertainties into account (see Table 1, Fig. 3, Supplementary Discussion), we estimate wet season rainfall to have increased by between 5 to 7.1% per decade (15.5-22% since 1980) and dry season rainfall to have decreased by 1.9 to 4.4% per decade (5.8-13.5% since 1980, Fig. 3c). This provides evidence for increases in precipitation seasonality using a record that is independent from current climate records, and that integrates variability in rainfall over a large area within the Amazon basin. Our analysis is based on a mechanistic understanding of the association between climate and δ18OTR and overcomes some of the limitations of spatial and temporal scarcity of meteorological data in the Amazon22.

To what degree are tree ring estimates of Amazon precipitation changes consistent with observations? To evaluate this question, we compared our δ18OTR to rainfall and river stage records for the two seasons (Fig. 4). Interannual variation and long-term trends in δ18OTR are well correlated with variation in precipitation and with river level (see Fig. 4, please note the inverted scale for oxygen isotopes). Our estimates from tree ring oxygen isotopes suggest rainfall reductions in the dry season (−1.9 to −4.4% per decade) are largely within the range of those derived from the different gridded precipitation datasets used here (CRU: −0.3%, CHIRPS: −6.3%, MSWEP: −1.6% per decade), but imply stronger rainfall increases during the wet season ( + 5 to +7.1% per decade) than estimated from all three datasets (CRU: +1.6%, CHIRPS: +1.6% and MSWEP: +0.3%, per decade). This discrepancy in the estimates of rainfall changes may possibly be caused by differences between the footprint of the tree ring isotope series (i.e. the region of moisture transport from coast to sampling sites, Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) and the spatial distribution of the stations that these climate records relied on. The difference in the estimates from different gridded datasets also highlight the uncertainties arising from their use to assess long-term climate trends in the Amazon region. Despite this difference, our estimates of rainfall changes largely agree with the few published estimates of precipitation changes in Amazonia, which consider different datasets. Few studies report similar magnitudes to what we found here, with a reduction of up to 4.4% per decade in the dry season and an increase of up to 10% per decade in the wet season depending on region17,19,51, and one recent study (based on observations and reanalyses) reports an increase of 6% per decade in rainfall seasonality, given by the difference between maximum and minimum rainfall amounts per year, since 197952. Diverging seasonal trends have also been detected regionally, with up to ~5% (per decade) dry season drying in the south and similar wet season wetting in the north portion of the basin53,54. Interestingly, these results seem to go in the same direction of ours, even though the spatial footprint of our records does not capture all of the southern Amazon during the dry season. Here we cannot make any inference regarding spatial heterogeneity of the trends, but it is possible that to some extent our integrated measure of the regional hydrological cycle reflects spatially heterogeneous climate changes in the region.

Time series of (a, b) oxygen isotopes in tree rings from floodplain and terra firme trees, respectively. (c–f) hydrological variables for the peak of the dry season (left panels) and wet seasons (right panels) since 1975 C.E shwing (c, d) Amazon River levels and (e, f) Amazon-wide rainfall from CRU, MSWEP (scale on left axis) and CHIRPS (scale on right axis). Solid and dotted straight lines indicate trends that are significant within confidence intervals of 95% and 90%, respectively. The significance of trends was tested by means of linear regression, with p values shown at each graph. The Pearson's correlation coefficient of the hydrological variable with oxygen isotopes from tree rings is also shown on (d, e, rδ18O). Note that in (c), the δ18O axis is inverted.

In all, our tree ring trends provide strong support for a substantial increase in the seasonality of Amazon rainfall, with the wet season becoming wetter and the dry season drier. We find no support for previous GCM predictions for a general drying of the Amazon basin11,55,56,57, or for a general wetting58. Instead, our results point to an increased seasonal cycle, as observed before in both precipitation and river level records13,17,19,52,53,59. These latter authors have analysed possible drivers for these trends, and find changes are related to differences between the tropical north Atlantic and Pacific SST anomalies, in part associated with natural variability, but a more rapid warming in the Atlantic is likely to continue due to anthropogenic forcing59. These large-scale changes have led to an increase in the upwelling of the Walker cell branch over Amazonia59,60.

Existing tree ring records from the Amazon provide some support for the increase in wet season precipitation suggested by our records. An extended δ18OTR record (1980 to 2020) from Cedrela odorata located in the nearby Brazilian southwest Amazon61 shows a similar upward trend in precipitation up to 2020, despite the strong 2015 El Niño (i.e. dry anomaly). Tree ring-widths from south-west Amazon-Andes also capture this wetting trend locally62, and one study from eastern Amazon points out that climate signals in the tree rings became weaker after 1990's63, which can be an indication that growth limitation by rainfall is decreasing, even in the absence of trends. Other ring-width studies from different parts of the Amazon don't seem to capture this change64,65,66,67. The reasons why tree ring-width do not capture these changes may vary. Firstly, trees growing in humid conditions during the wet season may not be limited by the precipitation ammounts, and thus don't benefit from the increase in rainfall. Secondly, tree ring studies often focus on the high-frequency variability, and may not reproduce multidecadal trends. In addition, detecting trends in ring-width series requires consideration of several ontogeny and other biases due to demography or field sampling strategies, which are often not considered39,68,69. In comparison to tree ring widths, δ18OTR records are superior proxies for hydroclimate as the signal in these two sites arises predominantly from variation in precipitation δ18O and is thus relatively independent of plant physiological effects30,41 and do not require detrending to correct for ontogenetic effects.

Though the climate changes inferred from the δ18OTR chronologies may seem large, the severity of recent climate extremes is consistent with expected consequences of climate change21, and trends have persisted over time. Our records only extended to 2010 and 2014, but extreme floods of the Amazon River have continued to happen with high frequency. The four highest flood-season river levels (2021, 2012, 2009 and 2022) and three lowest dry-season river levels (2024, 2023, 2010) all occurred during the last 15 years70. Of those, the most extreme levels for the entire 122-year record at the port of Manaus were recorded in the past 3 years, indicating that the intensification of the hydrological cycle is persistent, with increased rainfall seasonality leading to more frequent droughts and floods19,20. As a result, the maximum flood area of the Amazon River has extended by 26% since 198071, while intensified dry seasons have facilitated the spread of wildfires72,73. These changes cause extensive social, economic and health impacts74, including damages to agriculture5, hydropower generation75, and respiratory health76. For the forests, floods, droughts and fires may lead to widespread tree mortality, both in floodplains and non-flooded areas77,78, and impact on forest biodiversity79, structure80, and resilience1.

Our support for the existence of diverging long-term changes in rainfall amounts during the wet and dry seasons has important implications for proxy-based studies in this region. Commonly used proxy records such as ice-cores rarely contain seasonal climate information26, while cave speleothems28 usually integrate signals over periods of three or more years. Such records will conceal diverging seasonal patterns as detected here, and thus fail to provide an accurate picture of the full climate response. Tree rings do provide information about seasonal climate variability, but in the tropics such information is often restricted to the wet season39. The approach we used here overcomes such limitations, and exploits differences in growing seasons between species to permit seasonally explicit climate reconstructions. This approach is limited only by the maximum age of tropical trees, which may reach up to few hundred years in these ecosystems81.

To conclude, we find diverging time trends in these two δ18OTR records since ca. 1980, with increasing δ18OTR in the species growing during the dry season and decreasing δ18OTR for the species growing during the wet season. These diverging trends are indicative of approximately 5 to 7.1% per decade (15.5–22% since 1980) increase in wet season rainfall and by 1.9 to 4.4% per decade (6–13.5% since 1980) decrease in dry season rainfall at large-scale in the Amazon. Our analysis highlights that traditional climate proxies may hide seasonally diverging trends as observed here. We find no support for a general drying or general wetting of the Amazon basin and instead find an increase in the seasonal cycle. Our conclusions are largely independent from any climate data, relying only on the well-known relationship between rainfall and the δ18O signals in rainfall as recorded by tree rings. The results provide a benchmark for testing the realism of climate predictions for this region and confirm a trend in seasonality that is larger than assumed so far. These changes have severe and widespread implications for human livelihoods and ecosystems in the Amazon.

To reconstruct seasonally resolved δ18O from the Amazon basin, we used tree ring records from Cedrela odorata from terra firme forests in the Southwestern Amazon31,82 (10°5′S, 66°18′W), and from Macrolobium acaciifolium from floodplain forests in the Western Amazon37 (74°05′ W, 4°29′ S, Fig. 1). C. odorata grows during the local wet season, defined as the period of the year with rainfall exceeding 100 mm month-1 (which is October to April at this site)31, and the δ18OTR chronology (i.e. the average of δ18O records obtained from trees belonging to the same local population of trees) of this species thus reflects past variability of wet season rainfall in the Amazon. The inter-annual and decadal scale variation is in close agreement with similar chronologies obtained from trees of the same species growing at other locations in the western Amazon basin82. Macrolobium acaciifolium is a typical floodplain species, that grows only during the non-flooded (terrestrial) period40, which is between July and November for this site. As this period coincides with the Amazon-wide dry season, the chronology reflects rainfall variability for the dry season. Though the two sites are distant from each other, the large-scale atmospheric processes associated with Rayleigh distillation during moisture transport result in wide spatial coherence of tree ring δ18O even at distant locations38. This can be illustrated by the large overlap of the regions of moisture transport to each of our sampling sites (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3).

Both chronologies consist of oxygen isotope ratios in the cellulose extracted chemically from the tree rings using the procedure described in ref. 83. For C. odorata, 890 rings from 9 trees were separated prior to cellulose extraction, while for the M. acaciifolium trees we first extracted cellulose from cross-section laths and then separated 384 rings from 6 trees84. As these species grow in tropical warm climates which favour rapid drying of the soils and constant recharging with new rainfall85,86, long soil water residence times are generally not expected87,88, and we consider that trees use mostly recent rainfall as their main source water. Still, for M. acaciifolium trees only the middle section (of three segments) for each ring was used to avoid using wood produced at the start and end of the growing season, when river water (which has longer residence times) are close to trees' rooting zones. After extraction, tree ring cellulose samples were homogenized, freeze dried, packed into silver capsules and pyrolyzed with an Element Analyzer coupled to a Sercon 20/20 IRMS for analysis of their stable oxygen isotope ratios, with a precision of 0.2‰. All isotope ratios are expressed relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), in permille (‰) units. The mean δ18OTR chronologies for each species were produced by taking the mean δ18OTR of all trees for each calendar year. The average of Pearson's correlation coefficients of all pairwise combinations of trees in each chronology was 0.58 for M. acaciifolium and 0.63 for C. odorata.

We use the following Rayleigh distillation model89

to relate changes in the oxygen isotope values to changes in precipitation, moisture content in air entering the basin and evapotranspiration in Amazonia. Here, \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}\) and \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) (‰) are relative deviations of isotope ratios from a standard ratio at the site and coast respectively, P and E (dimensions of mass per area) are the cumulated rainfall and evapotranspiration along an air parcel trajectory from the coast to the site, respectively, N (mass per area) is the total amount of water of the air column when air enters the basin, and Nsite is the water mass left in the air column at the end of the trajectory, α = 1.010744 the water-vapor equilibrium fractionation factor for a condensation temperature of 10 °C90 corresponding approximately to 700hPa altitude91, and f is the fraction of water vapour in the air column at the site relative to water vapor in air entering the basin, or ‘remaining fraction'.

Our Rayleigh model assumes that (a) there have been no changes in the type of precipitation (i.e. convective vs stratiform) and intensity of precipitation, and (b) that temperature does not affect δ18O strongly at these locations, and (c) that the isotopic ratio of vapor entering the basin does not change over time.

Using Eq. 1, the long-term change over time in δ18O as a result of long-term changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration and changes in water content of air entering the basin is then given by

Here the subscript ‘i' stands for initial and the subscript ‘f' for final in time (in our case 1980 and 2010). Equation 2 can be rewritten as a function of relative changes \(\Delta P\equiv \frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}-{P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{{P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}\), \(\Delta E\equiv \frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}-{E}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{{E}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}},\,\Delta N\equiv \frac{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}-{N}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}\) using the identities \({P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}=\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{\left(1+\Delta P/{P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}\right)}\) for P and similar for E and N to obtain

Equation 3 permits, in principle, to determine which combinations of relative changes in precipitation and evaporation are compatible with the observed difference of the heavy isotope ratio in precipitation between 2010 and 1980 inferred from our tree ring records. Nonetheless, to use Eq. 3 for this purpose we need (i) an estimate of present \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) and (ii) estimates of the ratios \(\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}},\,\frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}\) and their uncertainties. We estimate the former using the observations at Belém from Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), for which rainfall δ18O data is available for the years of 2014 and 2015. From these years, we used the months from August to October for the peak dry season and from November to March for the peak wet season. These periods disregard the shoulder months from the growing season of the trees, to avoid an effect of year-to-year variability in the growing season length on our results.

To estimate the latter we express them as functions of remaining water vapor fraction, f, in an air parcel arriving at the site at the end of the period considered (here 2010) and a recycling ratio \({r}_{E:P}\equiv \frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}\), the ratio of cumulated evaporation to cumulated precipitation along the air parcel path from the coast to the site. The ratios \(\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}},\,\frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}\) expressed as functions of f and \({r}_{E:P}\) are \(\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}=\frac{1-f}{1-{r}_{E:P}},\,\frac{{E}_{f}}{{N}_{f}}=\frac{f-1}{1-\frac{1}{{r}_{E:P}}}\). f we estimate from observed \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}-{\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) at the end of the period considered, inverting Eq. 1:

For our best estimate we used \({r}_{E:P}=0.325\) for the wet season and \({r}_{E:P}=0.4\) for the dry season45. To estimate \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}-{\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) we used measurements made at the GNIP stations Iquitos (Peru) for \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}\) and Belém (Brazil) for \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\), and data for Riberalta (Bolivia), from a monitoring led by the authors of this study (Brienen and Gloor). For details see Supplementary Table 1 in supplemental information.

In order to obtain plausible ranges of relative changes of Pf and Ef we vary estimates of using two different estimates of \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}-{\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) (one based on observations from GNIP, and one based on a isotope enabled version of the Hadley Climate model HadAM392, and by varying α over a plausible condensation temperature range. Separately we also vary \({r}_{E:{P}}\) by ±10%.

As we know that tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature increased by 0.5 °C (80−15 W, 8−22 N, HadSST data from ref. 93) we also examined the sensitivity of our best estimate of the attribution of the observed isotopic time trends to these changes. We did this by varying the water vapor content and the isotopic ratio of incoming air (see Supplementary Discussion for details).

We related the δ18OTR chronologies to large-scale precipitation obtained from three different gridded datasets, Climate Research Unit (CRU TS 4.07)94, from CHIRPS95 and from MSWEP96. We used CRU as it is based on station data. CHIRPS and MSWEP are more recent products that combine both station and satellite data and might provide better spatial representation. Large-scale rainfall was obtained by averaging rainfall over the Amazon Basin region during the trees' respective growing seasons (Fig. 1a, gray outline97). To assess the regions of influence of trends in both chronologies, we calculated for both sites the daily air mass trajectories using HYSPLIT98,99 (Supplementary Fig. 3ab) and then calculated the latitudinal range covered by >95% of all trajectories for every 0.25 degrees longitude, using a smoothing spline to remove noise. This provided the northern and southern limits of the regions of moisture transport to each sampling site (Fig. 1a). We then averaged rainfall within this region (upwind region rainfall). The rainfall series obtained by doing so is highly correlated with the rainfall time series obtained for the Amazon Basin region (Supplementary Fig 2).

We also correlated the δ18OTR with Amazon River level recorded at Obidos, approximately 600 km from the Amazon delta. River levels at this location corresponds to nearly 80% of the water drained within the Basin100, thus providing a second measure of large-scale hydrology within the Basin. The presence of trends in the δ18O chronologies and climate data over the past 30 years was assessed using linear regression analyses and t-tests.

There might be a paradox in the biology of ageing. As humans grow older, their metabolisms tend to slow, they lose muscle mass and they burn many fewer calories. But certain cells in older people appear to do the exact opposite — they consume more energy than when they were young.

These potential energy hogs are senescent cells, older cells that have stopped dividing and no longer perform the essential functions that they used to. Because they seem idle, biologists had assumed that zombie-like senescent cells use less energy than their younger, actively replicating counterparts, says Martin Picard, a psychobiologist at Columbia University in New York City.

How to kill the ‘zombie' cells that make you age

How to kill the ‘zombie' cells that make you age

But in 2022, Gabriel Sturm, a former graduate student of Picard's, painstakingly observed the life course of human skin cells cultured in a dish1 and, in findings that have not yet been published in full, found that cells that had stopped dividing had a metabolic rate about double that of younger cells.

For Picard and his colleagues, the energetic mismatch wasn't a paradox at all: ageing cells accumulate energetically costly forms of damage, such as alterations in DNA, and they initiate pro-inflammatory signalling. How that corresponds with the relatively low energy expenditure for ageing organisms is still unclear, but the researchers hypothesize that this tension might be an important driver of many of the negative effects of growing old, and that the brain might be playing a key part as mediator2. As some cells get older and require more energy, the brain reacts by stripping resources from other biological processes, which ultimately results in outward signs of ageing, such as greying hair or a reduction in muscle mass (see ‘Energy management and ageing').

Source: Ref. 2

Picard and his colleagues call this concept the ‘brain–body energy-conservation model'. And although many parts of the hypothesis are still untested, scientists are working to decipher the precise mechanisms that connect the brain to processes associated with ageing, such as senescence, inflammation and the shortening of telomeres — the stretches of repetitive DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes and protect them. This work, some researchers say, is also beginning to illuminate how psychological stress can accelerate ageing at a molecular level. Although once at the fringes of ageing research, this idea is now becoming mainstream, says Alessandro Bartolomucci, a biologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “The science speaks for itself. The field cannot dismiss it.”

Some of the earliest pieces of evidence pointing to the brain's role in ageing came from studies that revealed the effects of psychological stress on individual cells.

In the early 2000s, Elissa Epel, who was then a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), set out with her colleagues to examine whether chronic stress could leave behind a cellular signature. At the time, there was already a “very impressive literature” linking long-term stress to poor health, says Epel, who is now a health psychologist at UCSF. “But we didn't know as much about what was happening at the cellular level.”

So, the researchers decided to look at telomere length. Telomeres progressively shorten over the lifespan of an organism, and this process has been linked to senescence and other forms of age-related changes in cells.

The team recruited a group of 58 healthy women: 19 of whom had a healthy child; and 39 of whom had a child with a chronic illness. The researchers reasoned that the latter group often experienced increased levels of stress compared with the women who had healthy children3. Epel's team found that the women with a chronically ill child had shorter telomeres than those who did not — and that telomere length correlated with the number of years spent as a carer. These findings suggested that exposure to chronic stress can introduce molecular changes that are important for ageing, says biologist Noah Synder-Mackler at Arizona State University in Tempe.

Since then, teams have also found evidence of telomere shortening in people exposed to other stressors, such as adverse experiences in childhood and work-related exhaustion4. Although some of the results have been mixed when it comes to telomere length, researchers have also amassed evidence linking stress to other molecular markers of ageing.

For example, Anthony Zannas, a physician–scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and his colleagues have shown, through studies of large cohorts of people, that high levels of stress throughout life were associated with signs of accelerated ageing in the epigenome, the patterns of chemical modifications to the genome, such as DNA methylation, that help to regulate what genes are expressed. These changes might be mediated by stress hormones such as cortisol. Zannas's team found that, in women, higher levels of cortisol were linked to lower levels of DNA methylation, as well as an increase in the expression of the gene coding for tumour necrosis factor (TNF), a signalling molecule associated with inflammation5.

Others have been studying these processes in animals. Although animal models of stress have their limitations — for one, humans stressors are much more complex and can include a variety of social, psychological and biological factors — this work has provided mechanistic insights that are difficult to obtain in human studies. Bartolomucci and his team have discovered that chronic social stress in rodents, such as being subjected to aggressive behaviour from a dominant animal, can damage heart health and lead to a shorter lifespan6. They've also found that exposure to this type of adversity is linked to an increase in age-related molecular changes, such as a build-up of signals associated with senescence.

For example, in one 2024 study of male mice, Bartolomucci's team demonstrated that social stress during a relatively brief period in early life led to an increase in levels of a key marker of cellular senescence, called p16, in the brain, fat tissue and immune cells7. These changes occurred only in response to social stress: animals exposed to stress in the form of physical restraint, which involved placing them in small tubes for three hours per day for a month, did not experience a build-up of p16.

Hacking the immune system could slow ageing — here's how

Synder-Mackler's team have been conducting similar studies in rhesus macaques. These animals tend to form hierarchies within groups, with newcomers dropping to lower social ranks. So, by sequentially introducing animals into groups, the researchers were able to examine the effects of social status on health. They found that social stress affects the immune system in multiple ways. In the immune cells of monkeys with lower social status, it led to an increase in the expression of inflammation-associated genes8. These effects were at least partially reversible: when the animals' social rankings were rearranged, the gene expression patterns in their immune cells also changed to match their standings. The team has yet to look at how these alterations affect lifespan — macaques can live for around 30 years, which makes it difficult to address this issue, Synder-Mackler says.

Metrics details

Geometry and topology endow mechanical frames with unusual properties from shape morphing to phonon wave manipulation, enabling emerging technologies. Despite important advances in macroscopic frames, the realization and phonon imaging of nanoscale mechanical metamaterials has remained challenging. Here we extend the principle of topologically engineered mechanical frames to self-assembled nanoparticle lattices, resolving phonon dynamics using liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. The vibrations of nanoparticles in Maxwell lattices are used to measure properties that have been difficult to obtain, such as phonon band structures, nanoscale spring constants and nonlinear lattice deformation paths. Studies of five different lattices reveal that these properties are modulated by nanoscale colloidal interactions. Our discrete mechanical model and simulations capture these interactions and the critical role of effects beyond nearest neighbours, bridging mechanical metamaterials with nanoparticle self-assembly. Our study provides opportunities for understanding and manufacturing self-assembled nanostructures for phonon manipulation, offering solution processability, transformability and emergent functions at underexplored scales of length, frequency and energy density.

Scientists have developed a low-cost, durable, highly-sensitive robotic 'skin' that can be added to robotic hands like a glove, enabling robots to detect information about their surroundings in a way that's similar to humans.

The researchers, from the University of Cambridge and University College London (UCL), developed the flexible, conductive skin, which is easy to fabricate and can be melted down and formed into a wide range of complex shapes. The technology senses and processes a range of physical inputs, allowing robots to interact with the physical world in a more meaningful way.

Unlike other solutions for robotic touch, which typically work via sensors embedded in small areas and require different sensors to detect different types of touch, the entirety of the electronic skin developed by the Cambridge and UCL researchers is a sensor, bringing it closer to our own sensor system: our skin.

Although the robotic skin is not as sensitive as human skin, it can detect signals from over 860,000 tiny pathways in the material, enabling it to recognise different types of touch and pressure - like the tap of a finger, a hot or cold surface, damage caused by cutting or stabbing, or multiple points being touched at once - in a single material.

The researchers used a combination of physical tests and machine learning techniques to help the robotic skin 'learn' which of these pathways matter most, so it can sense different types of contact more efficiently.

In addition to potential future applications for humanoid robots or human prosthetics where a sense of touch is vital, the researchers say the robotic skin could be useful in industries as varied as the automotive sector or disaster relief. The results are reported in the journal Science Robotics.

Electronic skins work by converting physical information - like pressure or temperature - into electronic signals. In most cases, different types of sensors are needed for different types of touch - one type of sensor to detect pressure, another for temperature, and so on - which are then embedded into soft, flexible materials. However, the signals from these different sensors can interfere with each other, and the materials are easily damaged.

"Having different sensors for different types of touch leads to materials that are complex to make," said lead author Dr David Hardman from Cambridge's Department of Engineering. "We wanted to develop a solution that can detect multiple types of touch at once, but in a single material."

"At the same time, we need something that's cheap and durable, so that it's suitable for widespread use," said co-author Dr Thomas George Thuruthel from UCL.

Their solution uses one type of sensor that reacts differently to different types of touch, known as multi-modal sensing. While it's challenging to separate out the cause of each signal, multi-modal sensing materials are easier to make and more robust.

The researchers melted down a soft, stretchy and electrically conductive gelatine-based hydrogel, and cast it into the shape of a human hand. They tested a range of different electrode configurations to determine which gave them the most useful information about different types of touch. From just 32 electrodes placed at the wrist, they were able to collect over 1.7 million pieces of information over the whole hand, thanks to the tiny pathways in the conductive material.

The skin was then tested on different types of touch: the researchers blasted it with a heat gun, pressed it with their fingers and a robotic arm, gently touched it with their fingers, and even cut it open with a scalpel. The team then used the data gathered during these tests to train a machine learning model so the hand would recognize what the different types of touch meant.

"We're able to squeeze a lot of information from these materials - they can take thousands of measurements very quickly," said Hardman, who is a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of co-author Professor Fumiya Iida. "They're measuring lots of different things at once, over a large surface area."

"We're not quite at the level where the robotic skin is as good as human skin, but we think it's better than anything else out there at the moment," said Thuruthel. "Our method is flexible and easier to build than traditional sensors, and we're able to calibrate it using human touch for a range of tasks."

In future, the researchers are hoping to improve the durability of the electronic skin, and to carry out further tests on real-world robotic tasks.

The research was supported by Samsung Global Research Outreach Program, the Royal Society, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Fumiya Iida is a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.

The Apollo astronauts didn't know what they'd find when they explored the surface of the moon, but they certainly didn't expect to see drifts of tiny, bright orange glass beads glistening among the otherwise monochrome piles of rocks and dust.

The beads, each less than 1 mm across, formed some 3.3 to 3.6 billion years ago during volcanic eruptions on the surface of the then-young satellite. "They're some of the most amazing extraterrestrial samples we have," said Ryan Ogliore, an associate professor of physics in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, home to a large repository of lunar samples that were returned to Earth. "The beads are tiny, pristine capsules of the lunar interior."

Using a variety of microscopic analysis techniques not available when the Apollo astronauts first returned samples from the moon, Ogliore and a team of researchers have been able to take a close look at the microscopic mineral deposits on the outside of lunar beads. The unprecedented view of the ancient lunar artifacts was published in Icarus. The investigation was led by Thomas Williams, Stephen Parman and Alberto Saal from Brown University.

The study relied, in part, on the NanoSIMS 50, an instrument at WashU that uses a high-energy ion beam to break apart small samples of material for analysis. WashU researchers have used the device for decades to study interplanetary dust particles, presolar grains in meteorites, and other small bits of debris from our solar system.

The study combined a variety of techniques -- atom probe tomography, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy -- at other institutions to get a closer look at the surface of the beads. "We've had these samples for 50 years, but we now have the technology to fully understand them," Ogliore said. "Many of these instruments would have been unimaginable when the beads were first collected."

As Ogliore explained, each glass bead tells its own story of the moon's past. The beads -- some shiny orange, some glossy black -- formed when lunar volcanoes shot material from the interior to the surface, where each drop of lava solidified instantly in the cold vacuum that surrounds the moon. "The very existence of these beads tells us the moon had explosive eruptions, something like the fire fountains you can see in Hawaii today," he said. Because of their origins, the beads have a color, shape and chemical composition unlike anything found on Earth.

Tiny minerals on the surface of the beads could react with oxygen and other components of Earth's atmosphere. To avoid this possibility, the researchers extracted beads from deep within samples and kept them protected from air exposure through every step of the analysis. "Even with the advanced techniques we used, these were very difficult measurements to make," Ogliore said.

The minerals (including zinc sulfides) and isotopic composition of the bead surfaces serve as probes into the different pressure, temperature and chemical environment of lunar eruptions 3.5 billion years ago. Analyses of orange and black lunar beads have shown that the style of volcanic eruptions changed over time. "It's like reading the journal of an ancient lunar volcanologist," Ogliore said.

Bad news, folks: we all went to sleep, woke up, and the Trump phone is still here. That means a couple of things. For one, it means the T1 phone wasn't the result of a spicy, food-fueled fever dream or a bad batch of crazy-style mushrooms—it's a real phone that costs real money, made by a real president, who thinks “fox in the henhouse” is an allegory for how to win bigly in the U.S. government. It also means something else depressing, and it's got nothing to do with making America great and everything to do with undermining your privacy.

There are a lot of bad things about the Trump phone. There's the gaudy, I-hate-poor-people gold aesthetic; the “long life camera” that I assume is supposed to mean “long-life battery” that is actually not long-life at all; and the fact that it's masquerading as an American-made device, though it clearly is not being made in America and likely never will be. My personal favorite is the fact that it's 5G enabled, which, as we all know, may not jibe well for a certain subsect of people whose conspiratorial cult (QAnon) thinks 5G caused COVID-19. But all of that could be trivial when you unpack how disastrous a Trump phone (at least in theory) could really be.

As I mentioned yesterday, after the T1's announcement, phones aren't just any product; they're kind of conduits into your whole life. You do everything on your phone: banking, talking to friends and family, browsing the web, and shopping. And beyond that, you do stuff that might be of even more interest to someone who's directly involved in politics—registering to vote, espousing or denouncing political views, and donating to campaigns. What's to prevent, say, I don't know, someone who works in government with direct access to that information from collecting and using that data for their own purpose? There's a reason why the government doesn't own the platforms we compute on, and it starts with “c” and ends in “onflict of interest.”

Some actual specs for the upcoming Trump Phone:-5000mAh long life camera (?)-under "Processor & RAM" it reads "Storage 12GB RAM", so maybe the next phone will have a processor-two of the three rear cameras are 2MP pic.twitter.com/PzPQtHGZsk

Sure, I know that our devices are already a privacy minefield to begin with, and doubly so are the platforms that we access through them, but something tells me that encoding politics directly into our devices isn't going to skew those privacy pitfalls in a positive direction. No technology is completely agnostic at the end of the day, but that doesn't mean we should just give up on making our hardware as safe and as neutral as possible.

I don't want to be an alarmist here; Trump's phone likely won't end up being a threat to that already-tenuous digital privacy for several reasons. One is that this phone sucks, and I don't think many people will be tempted to buy it, let alone use it every day or throw their most personal information into it. Secondly, even if this thing did sell, only the most hardcore Trump supporters would be using it, so the privacy pitfalls would only affect Trump's voting base. Lastly, I have my doubts that this thing is even real. There's a high chance, if I were a betting man, that Trump's family never even gets their shit together enough to make this monstrosity a reality, especially if initial attempts to purchase it are any indication.

But despite all of that, the idea is enough for me to take a breath, pause, and ask, “Wait, what the hell is going on here?” Trump may be the first U.S. president to try and sell the American public a smartphone, but the precedents he sets have a pesky way of resetting standards for the worse. The T1 feels like exactly the kind of slippery slope that could send you and your poor brittle tailbone straight to the emergency room—sans adequate health insurance. Phones aren't shoes; they're not memeocins; they're not NFT Christmas ornaments or commemorative coins—they're people's lives, for better and often worse. So, let's all make the right call here and agree that we should leave our most crucial gadgets to the Tim Apples of the world.

It's going to be a beast.

Yesterday, it emerged that Intel's next-generation Core Ultra 9 'Nova Lake-S' processors for desktops will feature as many as 52 cores, which makes them quite formidable contenders both for gaming and for performance-demanding applications. It turns out that the whole Nova Lake-S platform will be quite beastly too, as it will support DDR5-8000 memory and will feature as many as 32 PCIe 5.0 lanes, according to Jaykihn, a blogger with an excellent reputation when it comes to Intel's plans.

Intel's range-topping Core Ultra 9 'Nova Lake-S' processors for desktop PCs are set to pack 16 high-performance Coyote Cove cores, 32 energy-efficient Arctic Wolf cores, and four low-power Arctic Wolf cores. Memory subsystem of the new CPU will feature two channels supporting up to one DDR5-8000 memory module per channel, though it is unclear whether Intel plans to support regular DDR5-8000 DIMMs, or DDR5-8000 CUDIMMs with a clock driver chip.

There is a small catch, though, as each pair of Nova Lake's high-performance cores will feature a shared 2MB L2 cache, according to HXL. Using shared L2 cache will affect the performance of Coyote Cove cores, though this is a necessary tradeoff to pack up to 52 cores into next-generation Core Ultra 9 and up to 42 cores into next-generation Core Ultra 7 CPUs, as well as double the number of high-performance cores in high-end CPUs. Hopefully, support for high-speed DDR5 memory will offset the smaller L2 cache, and the performance of Coyote Cove will not be lower than the performance of Lion Cove cores.

Furthermore, Intel's Nova Lake CPUs will feature 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes: x16 lanes for graphics cards (which can be bifurcated to two x8 or to four x4 lanes) as well as two x4 lanes for SSDs. In addition, the chipset will support eight PCIe 5.0 lanes and 16 PCIe 4.0 lanes for peripherals, which could enable rather monstrous systems with loads of storage and plenty of add-in cards and accelerators.

Intel's next-generation Core Ultra 'Nova Lake-S' processors for desktops will reportedly use the all-new LGA1954 packaging and a new socket, so those who want to have up to 52 cores will have to upgrade to a new platform.

I'm in the midst of putting together a buying guide of indoor vertical gardening systems, and the Gardyn—the 30-plant Home 4.0, to be exact—was the first tester to arrive at my house. I had it unboxed and set up within a couple of hours, lights on and water pump running. I'm already a pro! I thought.

Sure enough, within a couple of weeks, all of Gardyn's proprietary seed-filled yCubes had sprouted, and a couple of weeks after that, I was harvesting bowlfuls of herbs and salad greens. Even though from setup to harvest the Gardyn required the use of about five brain cells, I was quite pleased with myself, despite having long ago given up gardening outdoors due to deer, rabbits, and my own incompetence with anything other than starts from the big-box store.

What I failed to understand, but would come to grasp with subsequent systems, was that indoor hydroponic gardening is just as hard in some ways as outdoor gardening. I had no way of knowing this, however, because Gardyn's pricey add-on app and AI gardening assistant, “Kelby,” had been doing all the real work via a network of sensors and live-view cameras (two on the larger Home model, one on the smaller Studio).

My new friend Kelby had been gathering data in order to set its own watering times, schedule its 60 LED lights, and send me the occasional customized task that never took longer than 10 minutes. And this customized maintenance isn't just helpful for convenience, as mold, bacteria, or roots clogging up the plumbing are extremely common in hydroponic gardening. Kelby told me when to add the needed nutrients (included) and how much to add, when and how to attend to the plants' roots, and even when to harvest.

There's also remote monitoring, of course, and a vacation mode that keeps the plants in a sort of stasis. Most of the work on my end was simply me admiring my plants, and admire them I did. The first time I ever saw a Gardyn was a couple of years ago, in a Parade of Homes show house, adjacent to a floor-to-ceiling wine cabinet. “Wow, what is THAT?! I want one!” announced nearly every person who shuffled by in their paper booties. Even in a $2 million spec house, the lit-up display of lush herbs, flowers, and vegetables was a showstopper.

When I began testing other systems, I was feeling quite big for my britches. At this point, I had successfully grown sunflowers, lemon balm, and even an entire kohlrabi. I've got this! Within five minutes of opening the other systems' boxes and finding pH test strips and vials, manual-dial timers, and multiple bags of supplements, however, I realized I did not have this. In fact, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Gardyn had only made me think I knew what I was doing. And, according to founder FX Rouxel (pronounced F-X, like the initials), that's Gardyn's entire raison d'être.

You might expect the founder of a hydroponic gardening system to have an agricultural background (perhaps even a certain kind of agriculture), but Rouxel is a tech guy. Though he did once work for the French version of the Environmental Protection Agency, his most recent pre-Gardyn gig was at French IT company Capgemini, deploying cloud, automation, and AI technologies. Although he is also a parent, cook, and Ironman athlete, his passion lies in using technology to lower the entry barrier to growing your own food.

“With other systems, they're basically a pump on a timer," Rouxel told me during a recent interview. “You need to know what you're doing. We looked at, ‘Can we use AI to actually solve this problem?' Unlike our competitors, we have a big chunk of the company that is just engineers." They make sure the Gardyn app is constantly adjusting through data collected via the system's two cameras and sensors that track water usage, humidity, temperature, and plant growth. If the system identifies an issue, it will send the user a specific task through the app to fix it.

Note that I did find the cameras to be slightly glitchy during the seven weeks I've been using the Gardyn, requiring periodic resets of the system to keep them both online. It didn't seem to affect any of my tasks or plant stats, but I found it irritating nonetheless. Though if I weren't using the Kelby feature, it wouldn't matter, as the cameras are essentially useless otherwise.

Another plus with the Gardyn is its shape. The footprint is significantly smaller than comparable systems—the 5-gallon recirculating water tank (it comes with a bottle of plant food designed to keep a balanced pH) takes up a rectangular 2 square feet for the Home, 1.4 for Studio. The PVC-like pipes (three on the Home, two on the Studio) have holes that are pointed at different angles, both to prevent crowding and to allow plants to grow tall, whereas on other systems, height is limited by overhead lights. Gardyn's lights instead run on rails in front of the plants. To take maximum advantage of the clearance, Gardyn also sells add-on trellises if you want to grow vining plants like cucumbers or miniature pumpkins.

I also like that Gardyn's yCubes use rockwool as a growth medium. I didn't think much of this until I began testing other systems that use peat pellets and learned the hard way that peat has a tendency to attract fungus gnats. The rockwool cubes come prestocked with one of about 120 different varieties of fruit, vegetable, herb, and flower seeds—from stevia and snapdragons to shishito peppers, lime basil, and wasabi microgreens. New GMO-free and heirloom varieties specially tested for the Gardyn are constantly being added to the lineup, Rouxel said. (Gardyn does have by far the most plant varieties among its competitors.)

Gardyn Studio comes with a 16-cube starter set, and Gardyn Home comes with 30—buyers can select either salad greens, flowers, or “chef faves.” I chose the latter, which included a lot of brassicas along with bunching onions, lettuces, and some interesting greens like sorrel. If one of the cubes doesn't sprout, Gardyn will replace it for free.

The downside to all this ease and automation is, of course, the Kelby-containing “membership” subscription, which is on top of the price of the unit itself. And it's a doozy—$408 a year, or $686 for two years. You can buy the Gardyn without it, but you won't have the automation or any of the ease-of-use features that guarantee success. The membership also includes 10 credits per month with free shipping to “buy” yCubes (which range from about one to three credits, or around $5 each), more plant food, accessories, or spare parts.

People do forgo the membership to jury-rig their own setups with their own seeds—Amazon sells 3D-printed knockoff yCubes for cheap—but judging from posts in the Gardyners Facebook group, problems abound with wilting, premature bolting, and pests. Upon creating an account in the app, there's a 30-day free trial of the membership, so there's at least the option to try the membership. As well as a 60-day return policy if you decide the whole shebang just isn't for you. (If you do, the warranty is two years.)

As for the cost, Rouxel said, Gardyn is actively trying to get it down, but in the meantime, the company is subsidizing a 0 percent APR on Affirm and Klarna: “We're actually paying the difference so everyone can get up to three years.”

Veteran hydroponic gardening nerds will scoff so hard at the idiot-proof Gardyn they might hurt themselves (like the one Redditor who declared it a toy for “coastal elite fart sniffers”), but I think there is a place for making the act of growing your own food as accessible as possible for every level of gardener, whether they live in an apartment with no yard or in an area where they can't grow food year round. And, of course, if you're a parent or caregiver, there's endless value in showing kids where their food comes from.

“I'm really amazed at the impact it has had on people's lives,” Rouxel said. “I'm a parent; I have two boys. What I want is for them to grow up as healthy adults with the right habits. And you know, when my boys left for college, they asked for a Gardyn for their dorms—that's when I knew I was doing something right.”

Godzilla's been having a comics cameo queen moment for a while now, and Marvel has been celebrating the Big G's 70th anniversary in style with a series of fun one-issue crossovers with a whole host of Marvel heroes, from the Fantastic Four to Spider-Man. But the fun's over now: Godzilla's here to stomp over the Marvel Universe for real, and as things get from bad to worse for heroes and villains alike, it's almost time for mutantkind to enter the fight to save Earth.

Gerry Duggan and Javier Garron, and Paco Medina's Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe is set to kick off next month, and we've already had a few tempting teases of just how bad things are going to get as Godzilla reawakens in Marvel's Manhattan, forcing heroes and villains alike to unite in a desperate gambit to stop the King of All Monsters.

Our first teases for August's second issue of the five-issue mini have already teases that Godzilla might become even more dangerous by bonding with the Venom symbiote, but io9 has your first exclusive look the solicit for issue 3 of the series–as the X-Men hope to survive the experience that is a battle with Godzilla himself!

Check out the solicit for Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe #3 below, as well as your first look at all covers for the issue.

As Godzilla's wave of desolation arrives on the shores of Madripoor, the X-Men join the fight for the planet's survival! As they struggle to hold the line against the King of the Monsters, Professor Xavier fights his own mental battle as he attempts to penetrate and pacify the mind of the Kaiju–but when he discovers what lurks in the mind of the rampaging Godzilla, all bets are off! Plus, the Hulk enters the fray with an earth-shattering entrance that sends ripples felt across the world, including in Wakanda, where Black Panther is done waiting to be the next victim of the kaiju's frenzy. If Godzilla insists on fighting, Wakanda will prove the kaiju isn't the only one capable of bringing the destruction!

Issue 3 will feature a main cover from Marvel stalwart Mark Brooks, depicting Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Storm, Gambit, and Rogue alongside Godzilla, as well as a series of variant covers, including an action-figure style cover by John Tyler Christopher (featuring classic Godzilla kaiju Hedorah the Smog Monster), a “Marvelized” Godzilla cover by Dave Wachter depicting an Iron Man/Mechagodzilla mashup, and a gorgeous variant from Jeremy Wilson showcasing Cyclops and Godzilla blasting it out.

But perhaps our favourite is a bold cover by Jeehyung Lee that asks the ultimate question: who will win, one giant kaiju, or one very small, angry Canadian? Check them all out below!

Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe #3 is set to hit comic book stores September 24, 2025. Check out where you can find a store to add a copy to your pull list at Comic Shop Locator.

It really pays to have a good portable power station these days. Whether you're going camping for a long weekend, spending all day at the beach, or you just want a backup in case something happens to the power grid, having one of these devices around can be a huge help. They're very expensive normally though, so you're nearly always best off waiting for a really good deal.

See at Amazon

Well, we just so happen to have found a really good deal today, and on a really good brand. The Anker Solix C1000 Portable Power Station is a mighty option, and while it'd normally set you back $799 on Amazon, it's currently a massive 44% off, making it just $449 right now. This is a limited-time deal though, so we're not expecting it to last long. If you want this for this price, make sure you act quickly to avoid missing out.

This portable power station has a lot of stuff going for it. One of the best things about it is that it has an incredibly fast charge time. In just 43 minutes of charging, this thing will have 80% of its battery capacity. It's durable too, and can manage 3,000 battery cycles over a 10-year period, meaning it should be good for even the most hardcore outdoorsy types.

It can also deliver up to 2400W of output, which means it can comfortably power the vast majority of appliances, and it has 11 ports and can charge multiple devices at once if it needs to. It just means it can do basically everything you need it to, so you won't need a second one. If you do want to upgrade though, then getting some solar panels can allow it to passively charge throughout the day, and makes for a great way to stay powered-up even on longer trips.

You can even customize how it delivers power using the Anker app, meaning it's easier than ever to really fine-tune it to your own needs. It's a small benefit that not everyone is going to use, but those who want to will adore being able to really take control of this device. That's an awful lot of good for just $449 (-44%), but just keep in mind that it's unlikely to stay at this price for very long because of how Amazon's limited-time deals work. Make sure you grab this one now if you like the look of it.

Food distribution giant United Natural Foods (UNFI) said it is making “significant progress” in recovering from a cyberattack that occurred almost two weeks ago, as grocery stores across North America reliant on the distributor continue to report food shortages.

UNFI said in an update on Sunday that it was restoring its electronic ordering systems, which its customers use to place orders for their grocery stores and supermarkets.

The company, which provides more than 30,000 stores across the United States and Canada with fresh produce and other products, was hit by a cyberattack on June 5, which the company disclosed several days later. 

UNFI has not yet described the nature of the cyberattack, though it told investors last week that it had shut down its entire network to contain the incident. The ongoing outage is preventing the company from fulfilling and distributing customer orders at scale.

One of the largest grocers affected is Whole Foods, which relies on UNFI as its “primary distributor.” Several Whole Foods stores, including one visited by TechCrunch last week and others in the New York area, are experiencing shelf shortages amid the UNFI outages. One employee at a Whole Foods in California told TechCrunch about the supply issues at their store, saying they had not seen some products for days. 

Whole Foods previously told TechCrunch that it was working to restore its shelves “as quickly as possible,” but did not say when shipments would return to normal.

People working at local grocery stores and big-chain supermarkets alike have told TechCrunch that they continue to experience disruption of varying degrees. Some said that other distributors are providing some supplies, while others are still reporting issues with ordering products from UNFI. 

The outages are also affecting grocery stores run by the U.S. Defense Department for active duty personnel and retired veterans. One employee at a grocery store run by the Defense Commissary Agency said they were seeing empty shelves and delayed shipments.

Kevin Robinson, a spokesperson for the Defense Commissary Agency, confirmed the UNFI cyberattack was affecting dozens of its stores.

“This incident has affected deliveries across multiple grocery chains, including 53 Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) stores,” said Robinson. “The DeCA supply chain team has worked closely with UNFI to implement manual workarounds that have effectively minimized in-store disruptions.”

UNFI has not yet provided a timeline for recovery.

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that often causes sudden and intense shortness of breath. The disease impacts around 339 million people worldwide, and in the U.S. nine people on average die from asthma every day.

Researchers in the U.K. have found that women who work night shifts are more likely to have moderate or severe asthma than women who work during the day. The study, published Monday in the journal ERJ Open Research, does not reveal any such tendency in men working nightshifts, and could hold important implications for public health guidance.

The team had previously shown that permanent night shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from moderate-severe asthma compared to day workers. Scientists also know that asthma is more prevalent and severe in adult women than adult men. “Since increasing numbers of females are becoming shift workers it is important to determine if shift work-associated asthma risk is higher in females,” the researchers wrote in the study. Shift work refers to scheduled working periods that fall outside of traditional daytime hours. “Our main aim was to investigate sex differences in the association between shift work and asthma.”

The researchers did so by analyzing data belonging to over 274,541 working people from the U.K. Biobank, a biomedical database open to health researchers. From this initial pool, they found that 5.3% had asthma, and 1.9% of those had moderate or severe asthma. The team then looked into whether the people in these categories worked during the day, during nightshifts, or a mix of both.

The researchers found that female shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from asthma, and women who only work nightshifts have 50% higher likelihood of developing moderate or severe asthma than female daytime workers. Furthermore, the risk increases “with both number of monthly night shifts and longer lifetime duration of night shift work,” they explained. Interestingly, the data did not reveal any differences in the prevalence of asthma in men based on their work schedule.

“This type of research cannot explain why shift work and asthma are linked,” Robert Maidstone, a co-author of the study and a researcher at the University of Manchester's School of Biological Sciences, said in a university statement. “However, it could be because shift work disrupts the body clock, including the levels of male and female sex hormones. High testosterone has previously been shown to be protective against asthma, and so lower testosterone in women could play a role. Alternatively, men and women work different types of shift jobs, and this could be a factor.”

Among women not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT, a treatment for menopausal symptoms), postmenopausal women working only night shifts were almost twice as likely to have moderate-severe asthma than female day workers. This suggests that HRT might protect nightshift workers from asthma, though the researchers admit that more studies are needed to confirm this.

“This research suggests that working nightshifts could be a risk factor for asthma in women, but not in men. The majority of workers will not have an easy option of switching their shift pattern, so we need further research to verify and understand this link and find out what could be done to reduce the risk for women who work shifts,” explained Florence Schleich from the European Respiratory Society, who was not involved in the study.

Moving forward, the researchers aim to investigate how sex hormones might influence asthma prevalence among shift workers. Perhaps this line of research will also shed light on what drives the respiratory disease, given that the exact cause remains a mystery.

Other divisions will face similar reductions.

The first reports about Intel's plans to cut workforce in its manufacturing division starting mid-July emerged last Friday. However, the report lacked specifics, which appear to be quite dramatic as the chipmaker reportedly plans to eliminate between 15% to 20% of its Intel Foundry personnel, which will affect over 8,170-10,890 people globally, reports OregonLive.

Naga Chandrasekaran, the head of Intel Foundry, informed staff that the layoffs are necessary to address cost-related challenges and the company's financial position. He stated that reductions would be guided by business priorities, individual evaluations, and decisions around which projects to continue funding.

As of December 28, 2024, Intel's workforce comprised 108,900 people, down from around 124,800 people from the previous year. Intel's Silicon Forest Oregon facilities were not spared from layoffs last year, cutting approximately 3,000 jobs while still retaining roughly 20,000 employees.

Intel has 15 wafer fabs in production worldwide at 10 locations. Intel does not disclose exactly how many of its employees work in production and related services, though the company says that approximately half of its workforce handles production or production services. The remaining half is distributed across R&D, design, sales, administrative roles, client, data center, and other business units. Keep in mind that other divisions are to face similar 15% to 20% cuts this year.

Assuming that around 50% of Intel's personnel are involved in fab operations, that means around 54,450 people. Eliminating 15% to 20% of them means that from 8,170 to 10,890 personnel will be eliminated worldwide.

Intel will not offer buyouts or voluntary departures this year, opting instead for selective terminations in an attempt to keep the best employees with the company, the report says. When the 2025 layoffs were announced this spring, the company emphasized that its intention was to reduce the number of management layers and bureaucracy within the company. However, the new report indicates that affected roles may span a range of positions, from technicians working directly on factory floors or under them to tool operators and support personnel.

Key roles, such as engineers working on cutting-edge process technologies and skilled technicians managing EUV and High-NA EUV lithography equipment, are vital and unlikely to face layoffs. However, Intel may trim positions made redundant by automation or organizational efficiency. While reducing non-essential roles helps cut costs while maintaining critical expertise in the company, it may also reduce operational agility, slow responses to equipment problems, and increase pressure on remaining employees, which lowers morale and could result in costly downtime.

OregonLive notes that federal and state funding are also in question. Intel secured $7.9 billion from the CHIPS Act, receiving $1 billion last year. But the rest of the subsidy package remains uncertain, as the new Trump administration is reviewing ongoing allocations. Separately, Oregon pledged $115 million in public funds, but those are conditional on meeting future hiring and tax revenue targets. If hiring or revenue projections are missed, state funding could be withdrawn.

Dev also touts image quality improvements after ‘significant architectural improvements.'

Another killer update has been unleashed by the developer of the Lossless Scaling utility. For those on the lookout for an alternative game upscaling solution, the new LSFG 3.1 update comes with image quality and performance gains, potentially delivering “up to 2x GPU load reduction,” according to the developer.

The headlining 2x GPU load reduction comes courtesy of this tool's new Performance Mode. According to the release notes, the new mode delivers this boost, depending on hardware config and settings, “with a slight reduction in image quality.” So, as is often the case with these kinds of tools, there can be a trade-off.



In some cases, it is noted that the new Performance Mode can, conversely, “improve image quality by allowing the game to achieve a higher base frame rate.” So, this is yet another graphical tweak that gamers will need to explore on a per-hardware-config, per-game, and per-preference basis.

Sticking to the topic of quality, the developer has announced that the following improvements have been introduced with the new LSFG 3.1 update:

Developed by a one-man band, the Lossless Scaling utility is a GPU-agnostic tool that provides an alternative graphics upscaling technology at the one-off bargain price of $6.99.

If your GPU doesn't support technologies like DLSS, FSR, or XeSS, you may be attracted to Lossless Scaling to fill the gap with admirable performance and configurability. The tool has found a lot of fans within the PC gaming community, especially among those who sometimes find the best GPU they have at hand is an older discrete card or integrated graphics. But it has other use cases.

As well as offering up its own built-in upscaling options (like LS1, Nearest Neighbor, xBR, Bicubic CAS, and Anime 4K), Lossless Scaling can work its magic via AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution or Nvidia Image Scaling.

Like other upscalers, Lossless Scaling isn't without its issues, particularly apparent when pixel peeping, or in games where frame gen latency is a no-no.

Though flagged as a “major update” and containing “significant architectural improvements” the Lossless Scaling tool version is only incremented by 0.1, to 3.1. Our inner marketeer would have perhaps suggested that LSFG move to version 4 to look more competitive against DLSS4 and FSR4. It already features machine learning enhanced upscaling. But for all we know, there may be even more significant updates and feature introductions in line to push the version up a whole number.

Last month, Suzanne Smith-Darley felt fantastic. She had just bought a used Chanel handbag from a Japanese seller on eBay for $800—a steal compared to the original asking price of $1,400. About a week later an email arrived that crushed her: DHL was demanding a $142 fee for US tariffs before it would deliver the well-worn medallion tote to Smith-Darley's Atlanta doorstep. “It goes to Japan, has a whole life, and it could be in the trash literally,” she says. “I'm willing to pick it out of the trash, and I get this huge tariff. It's ridiculous.”

Tariffs imposed this year by President Donald Trump have triggered higher prices and decreased selection, and some shoppers have been surprised to learn that the taxes apply to used goods.

Several online marketplaces, including eBay and Vestiaire Collective, have been urging lawmakers and officials in Washington, DC, to exempt used items from import duties, including those recently imposed by President Trump, according to industry executives. “We're still a maturing industry, but we are the future,” says Rachel Kibbe, CEO of American Circular Textiles, an advocacy group that represents about 30 organizations, including Vestiaire Collective, that make, fix, rent, sell, recycle, or resell clothes. “We would just like preferential trade treatment for secondhand imports.”

But a carve-out for used items does not appear to be in the works, according to a person close to the White House who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions. An exemption would likely lead importers to try to pass off new items as used, creating an additional enforcement burden for a government that's already stretched thin by Trump's “government efficiency” efforts.

Historians say used imports, from ancient jewelry to outdated smartphones, have always been subject to US tariffs. They note that the concept of duties on pre-owned wares dates back to at least medieval-era trade. But Trump has applied tariffs to many more countries and raised rates to historically high levels. The combination has prompted people to question the benefits of tariffs and has led to increased calls for reprieves. “We've never had a situation like this before,” says Andrew Wender Cohen, a historian at Syracuse University who studies trade history.

Trump has described his policies as necessary to increase domestic manufacturing, and it's possible to see how, over time, fees that discourage the import of new clothing and gadgets could prompt some companies to shift at least part of their manufacturing to the US. It's far more challenging to envision a payoff from applying those same tariffs to used goods that are destined for new homes instead of landfills.

Cohen says a reasonable approach would be to maintain tariffs on used items but at lower rates that would be commensurate with the risk posed to domestic manufacturing.

Some secondhand items have no alternatives; new versions may not be appealing, or the product may be discontinued. Looking overseas may also be unavoidable for niche items, like trading cards and used handbags. Circular economy advocates contend that reuse, even when it involves an item crossing national borders, still may produce some environmental benefit by cutting waste. “There should be policies that encourage people to choose used items first,” says Liisa Jokinen, founder of the vintage clothing app Gem.

As consumers seek out products that are more sustainable for the environment and their wallets, a new supply chain has emerged. Merchants now refurbish and resell used items such as clothing and electronics, and a growing number of online marketplaces have made it easier for Americans to source these items from almost anywhere in the world.

Earlier this year, eBay's Japanese unit disclosed surging demand for secondhand cameras as people panic-shopped before Trump's tariffs took effect. Worldwide, about 40 percent of eBay's gross sales come from what it calls “pre-loved and refurbished items.”

Previously, imports under $800, whether used or new, were not subject to tariffs. This “de minimis” exemption benefited eBay sellers as well as China-based ultrafast services like Temu and Shein. Trump eliminated the exemption for Chinese goods, contributing to some of the sticker shock buyers have been experiencing.

People accustomed to buying goods such as pre-owned, luxury accessories that are above the de minimis threshold weren't as surprised by the higher fees. Trump, though, has added an additional minimum tariff of 10 percent globally. That's forced people to adapt, whether by accepting higher prices or by getting creative.

Isaac Panzarella, who co-owns the Brooklyn, New York, shop Raleigh Vintage with his wife, says increased shipping costs and greater pressure to source the right items have led the couple to visit Europe more frequently, personally selecting merchandise to stock their racks. He believes there should be an exemption for items older than say, 20 years, making them free from tariffs. “At that point, it's not really displacing production or jobs in the US,” he says. “If anything, we're creating jobs.”

Having tariffs on used items has arguably benefitted the US economy during certain periods. Scott Reynolds Nelson, a historian at the University of Georgia, says that in the early 1800s, the US imposed high tariffs on used military surplus items including woolen jackets and metal pots and pans from the UK. Cheap imports had been hurting US merchants, he says. “There is a good reason for taxing things that are used if there is some necessary industry to protect,” he explains.

In the end, the eBay shopper Smith-Darley paid the tariffs for her coveted Chanel bag, which she believes was made in Italy, rather than requesting a return that could have left her bagless and out $800. But this week, Smith-Darley says she learned that DHL had failed to hold her package while she was out of town and that it will be sent back to Japan. It's unclear what refunds, if any, she might receive. DHL didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. “This is a nightmare,” Smith-Darley says.

In a way, the tariffs may be working as intended. Vestiaire Collective is nudging US shoppers to select used options from domestic sellers, and customers are buying them up, says US CEO Samina Virk. Smith-Darley, for her part, isn't slowing down her hunt for vintage goods—she's just making sure the ones she buys are sourced from the US. “I just walked in there like an idiot before,” she says. “I'm much more careful now.”

Octa-core CPU and at least RTX 3080 / RX 6800 XT recommended. Price starts at $70, up to $130 for Super Deluxe Edition.

The pricing, availability, and minimum and recommended PC specs for Borderlands 4 were unveiled on Monday. Today, it is very clear to see that Borderlands fans aren't happy about several aspects of the announcement, particularly the PC recommended specs and the pricing tiers.

Fans of the franchise are quite furious about the PC requirements and the pricing structure they are now looking at.

On Reddit, a very spicy thread calls into question the necessity for recommended hardware such as an octa-core CPU, and at least an RTX 3080 / RX 6800 XT, to enjoy Borderlands 4. We also note that 32GB of RAM is recommended, and this game will eat up to 100GB of SSD storage at launch.

Interestingly, even the recommended RTX 3080 may struggle. This card originally launched with 10GB on board, but was refreshed with 12GB. However, small print under the recommended specs listing asserts that “12GB+” is required. We wonder if VRAM might become an issue with GPUs like the new RTX 5070.

From its origins, Borderlands set itself apart in visual style using a ‘cel-shading' graphical style, using thick outlines and stylized textures throughout.

While this simpler-than-nature representation of characters and 3D worlds should have made the game less demanding in the 3D stakes, layering on all sorts of enhancing graphical enhancements and particle effects worked against this. Actually, the initial trio of Borderlands games made use of Nvidia PhysX to render its best dynamic cloth, explosive debris, and particle effects.

Borderlands 3 moved away from dedicated GPU PhysX, handling the same style of visual effects in a more GPU-agnostic manner. And now we have Borderlands 4 set to arrive in a few months, packing the latest Unreal Engine 5 – a notoriously demanding foundation for PC games.

PC gaming stalwarts may also not be surprised to see that Borderlands 4 is also going to feature potentially performance-impacting DRM. The product page says it will arrive laced with Denuvo and Symbiote.



The pricing for the ‘Standard Edition' of the new game at $69.99 isn't the source of much resentment on social media. That price is in line with the BL3 launch. However, the Deluxe ($99.99) and Super Deluxe ($129.99) editions have been criticized for ‘paywalling' day-1 content.

Indeed, it is apparent there aren't just cosmetics and the like stuffed into the more expensive editions. The Deluxe adds “4 unique areas, missions, & bosses,” as well as some new gear and weapons, and four new vehicles.

Moving up to the Super Deluxe edition, gamers are most upset by there being “2 new playable Vault Hunters” exclusively included at this price. Vault Hunters are the characters you play in this franchise, and each has their own unique character, abilities, and skill trees, boosting game fun and replayability.

Hopefully, Gearbox, the dev team behind the franchise, can do some optimization between now and September 12 to ensure Borderlands 4 can run more smoothly and slickly on lesser hardware. We shall have to wait and see. For those who care very deeply about price, patience will usually be rewarded.

Borderlands 4 releases simultaneously on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on PC, as well as on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles. Switch 2 gamers will have to wait a little longer.

US Customs and Border Protection experienced a sharp rise in reports about potential tariff evasion after President Donald Trump abruptly imposed new duties on over 100 countries earlier this year, according to data the agency shared with WIRED. From March through May, CBP's official e-Allegations tipline received 542 complaints about alleged duty dodging, an almost 160 percent increase from the same three months in 2024.

Importers have long tried to evade tariffs and lower their costs by mislabeling the origin, value, and nature of the products they bring into the country. But the new data suggests that Trump's policies may have pushed more firms to adopt these kinds of legally risky tactics. Over the same recent period, CBP fielded 242 tips about other types of potential violations, such as the import of counterfeit or unsafe items, an increase of just 42 percent. Submissions can be made anonymously, and trade experts say they often come from a company's former employees or competitors.

Trade attorney Jennifer Diaz says her law firm files “tons of e-Allegations” on behalf of clients, and she has found that CBP often does take them seriously. It takes up to half a year for the agency to vet a claim, but the wait can be worth it. When CBP catches wrongdoing, it can “help level the playing field,” says Diaz, including by wiping out artificially low prices from a market.

Whether CBP is equipped to handle the surge in tips is unclear. Congress has yet to finalize legislation known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would increase border staffing and resources for countering smuggling. As of April, CBP was on track to conduct roughly the same number of audits and issue about as many penalties for alleged trade violations as it had in recent years, according to public data.

Last year, a US Department of Treasury inspector general audit report concluded that CBP had not adequately tracked the outcomes of e-Allegations tips and called for new training and oversight measures to be put in place. From October 2018 through September 2020, CBP confirmed 68 out of over 900 duty evasion tips it received, the report found. But out of an estimated $65 million in unpaid duties, CBP did not know how much it ended up collecting. The agency responded that it was already rolling out improvements.

Data on tips and penalties are important because, unless Trump's tariffs are sufficiently enforced, they may fall short of the president's stated goals of increasing revenue and US manufacturing. Some companies also could grow frustrated with his administration if illegal conduct by their competitors goes unpunished. Businesses reluctant to engage in evasion could lose market share to those more willing to gamble as tariffs go up. Violators can face a variety of charges and be on the hook for multiples of the amount they evaded.

CBP spokesperson Trish Driscoll declined to comment on the number of duty evasion investigations happening at US ports and whether they have increased, citing law enforcement sensitivities. In general, she says that the agency uses a combination of “advanced data analytics, risk-based targeting, inspections, audits, investigations, and coordination with government agencies to identify patterns of evasion.”

Since Trump began announcing sweeping new tariffs in February, importers have been filling online forums with questions and advice about tactics that could help them reduce their tariff burdens. Consultants who help importers previously told WIRED that clients have received unsolicited offers from foreign business partners to skirt tariffs using dodgy tactics.

Companies can legally obtain lower tariff rates by shifting their manufacturing operations to other jurisdictions or changing the components, materials, and features of their products. But those maneuvers can be costly. More quick and affordable options, though, may violate the law. They include lying about the price of an item or shipping products to the US through a country subject to lower tariffs. Another common tactic is to misrepresent the type of item being imported on customs declarations, since tariffs can vary by product.

Whistleblowers can earn a reward of up to $250,000 through the e-Allegations program. They can receive higher sums by filing what's known as a qui tam lawsuit under the False Claims Act, though that process includes jumping through extra legal hoops. The lawsuits are initially filed under seal, so it may not be evident for years whether there has been an increase recently, says Gregg Shapiro, an attorney who specializes in the False Claims Act.

Even given the recent increase in tips, many tariff violations may be going unreported, according to trade experts. CBP processes roughly 10 million customs declarations every three months, covering goods with a collective value in the hundreds of billions of dollars. During the seven months from last October through this April, the agency collected about $82 billion in tariffs and related fees. About $14 billion in assessed tariffs stemmed from Trump's new policies, but the total lost to evasion will likely never be known.

It is going to get hot.

The power consumption of AI GPUs has steadily increased in recent years and is expected to continue rising as AI processors incorporate more compute and HBM chiplets. Some of our sources in the industry have indicated that Nvidia is looking at 6,000W to 9,000W for thermal design power for its next-generation GPUs, but experts from KAIST, a leading Korean research institute, believe that the TDP of AI GPUs will increase all the way to 15,360W over the next 10 years. As a result, they will require rather extreme cooling methods, including immersion cooling and even embedded cooling.



Until recently, high-performance air-cooling systems, which involved copper radiators and high-pressure fans, were sufficient to cool Nvidia's H100 AI processors. However, as Nvidia's Blackwell increased its heat dissipation to 1,200W and then Blackwell Ultra increased its TDP to 1,400W, liquid cooling solutions became almost mandatory. Things are going hotter with Rubin, which will increase its TDP to 1,800W, and with Rubin Ultra, which will double the number of GPU chiplets and HBM modules, along with a TDP that will go all the way to 3,600W. Researchers from KAIST believe that Nvidia and its partners will use direct-to-chip (D2C) liquid cooling with Rubin Ultra, but with Feynman, they will have to use something more powerful.

Researchers from KAIST predict that AI GPU modules (particularly Nvidia's Feynman) will dissipate 4,400W, whereas some other sources from the industry believe that Nvidia's Feynman Ultra will increase its TDP to 6,000W. Such extreme thermals will require the usage of immersion cooling, where entire GPU-HBM modules are submerged in a thermal fluid. In addition, such processors and their HBM modules are expected to be introduced through thermal vias (TTVs), vertical channels in the silicon substrate dedicated to heat dissipation. These will be paired with thermal bonding layers and temperature sensors embedded in the HBM module base die for real-time thermal monitoring and feedback control.

Immersion cooling is expected to be good enough till 2032, when post-Feynman GPU architectures will increase per-package TDP to 5,920W (post-Feynman) or even 9000W (post-Feynman Ultra).

It is necessary to note that the main power consumers in a GPU module are compute chiplets. However, as the number of HBM stacks increases to 16 with post-Feynman, and per-stack power consumption increases to 120W with HBM6, the power consumption of memory will be around 2,000W, which is around 1/3 of the whole package.

Researchers from KAIST theorize that by 2035 power consumption of AI GPUs will increase to around 15,360, which will call for embedded cooling structures both for compute and memory chiplets. The experts mention two key innovations: thermal transmission lines (TTLs) that move heat laterally from hotspots to cooling interfaces, and fluidic TSVs (F-TSVs) that allow coolant to flow vertically through the HBM stack. These methods are integrated directly into the interposer and silicon to maintain thermal stability.

By 2038, fully integrated thermal solutions will get even more widespread and advanced. They will use double-sided interposers to enable vertical stacking on both sides, with fluidic cooling embedded throughout. Also, GPU-on-top architectures will help prioritize heat removal from the compute layer, while coaxial TSVs assist in balancing signal integrity and thermal flow.

The man who allegedly assassinated a Democratic Minnesota state representative, murdered her husband, and shot a state senator and his wife at their homes in a violent spree early Saturday morning may have gotten their addresses or other personal details from online data broker services, according to court documents.

Suspect Vance Boelter, 57, is accused of shooting Minnesota representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, in their home on Saturday. The couple died from their injuries. Authorities claim the suspect also shot state senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman in their home earlier that night. The pair are currently recovering and are “incredibly lucky to be alive,” according to a statement from their family.

According to an FBI affidavit, police searched the SUV believed to be the suspect's and found notebooks that included handwritten lists of “more than 45 Minnesota state and federal public officials, including Representative Hortman's, whose home address was written next to her name.” According to the same affidavit, one notebook also listed 11 mainstream search platforms for finding people's home addresses and other personal information, like phone numbers and relatives.

The addresses for both lawmakers targeted on Saturday were readily available. Representative Hortman's campaign website listed her home address, while Senator Hoffman's appeared on his legislative webpage, The New York Times reports.

“Boelter stalked his victims like prey,” acting US attorney Joseph Thompson alleged at a press conference on Monday. “He researched his victims and their families. He used the internet and other tools to find their addresses and names, the names of their family members.” Thompson also alleged that the suspect surveilled victims' homes.

The suspect faces several charges of second-degree murder.

Privacy and public safety advocates have long argued that the US should regulate data brokers to guarantee that people have better control over the sensitive information available about them. The US has no comprehensive data privacy legislation, and efforts to regulate data brokers from within federal agencies have largely been quashed.

“The accused Minneapolis assassin allegedly used data brokers as a key part of his plot to track down and murder Democratic lawmakers,” Ron Wyden, the US senator from Oregon, tells WIRED. “Congress doesn't need any more proof that people are being killed based on data for sale to anyone with a credit card. Every single American's safety is at risk until Congress cracks down on this sleazy industry.”

In many cases, basic information like home addresses can be found through public records, including voter registration data (which is public in some states) and political donations data, says Gary Warner, a longtime digital scams researcher and director of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm DarkTower. Anything that isn't readily available through public records is almost always easy to find using popular “people search” services.

“Finding a home address, especially if someone has lived in the same place for many years is trivial,” Warner says. He adds that for “younger people, non-homeowners, and less political people, there are other favorite sites” for finding personal information.

For many in the general public as well as in politics, Saturday's violent crime spree brings new urgency to the long-standing question of how to protect sensitive personal data online.

“These are not the first murders that have been abetted by the data broker industry. But most of the previous targets were relatively unknown victims of stalking and abuse,” alleges Evan Greer, deputy director of the digital rights group Fight for the Future. “Lawmakers need to act before they have more blood on their hands.”

A new research paper was published in Volume 16 of Oncotarget on June 10, 2025, titled "Exceptional responders to immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer: A multi-institutional case series of a rare occurrence."

The study, led by first author Kavin Sugumar and corresponding author Jordan M. Winter, from University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, reports on a rare group of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients who responded remarkably well to immunotherapy, a treatment typically considered ineffective for this cancer type. The analysis, which includes data from 14 patients across multiple U.S. institutions, identifies outcomes that could help refine treatment strategies for one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of cancer.

"Between 2020–21, 471 oncologists from 91 major cancer centers in the United States were contacted."

Pancreatic cancer has among the lowest survival rates and few effective therapies. While immunotherapy has transformed the treatment landscape for several other cancers, it generally offers little benefit for pancreatic cancer. However, this study highlights a small but important group of patients who experienced significant and sustained responses to immune-based treatment without chemotherapy. Most had advanced or metastatic disease and had already progressed after standard treatments.

Among the 14 patients, 82% had partial tumor shrinkage, and nearly one-third had a notable decrease in tumor markers. The median progression-free survival was 12 months, and most patients were still alive at follow-up, with survival rates of 80% at one year and 70% at two years. These outcomes contrast sharply with standard therapies, which often provide only a few months of benefit for similar patients.

Interestingly, while some patients had high microsatellite instability (MSI-high)-a known marker for immunotherapy success-more than half did not, suggesting other biological mechanisms may be involved. This result highlights the need for new biomarkers to be discovered to predict treatment response in future studies.

This case series is the largest focused exclusively on exceptional immunotherapy responders in pancreatic cancer. By excluding patients who received chemotherapy, the study isolates the effects of immune-based drugs, including PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, CTLA-4 inhibitors like ipilimumab, and agents targeting macrophages.

While the sample size is small, the findings challenge the assumption that immunotherapy is ineffective for nearly all pancreatic cancer patients. The study suggests that, under certain biological conditions, this treatment can be remarkably successful. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.

This work supports the need to reconsider how clinical trials are designed for pancreatic cancer and who is eligible for immunotherapy. Broader criteria and more personalized molecular profiling could help uncover hidden opportunities for treatment in this highly lethal cancer.

A new McGill University-led study suggests that disrupting the body's internal clock during adolescence can alter how the brain responds to an in-utero risk factor linked to certain brain disorders.

Previous research has shown that a mother's infection during pregnancy, such as the flu, can increase a child's risk of developing conditions like schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders later in life. Irregular sleep patterns – often a sign of circadian rhythm disruption – are also associated with these conditions.

To investigate how these factors interact, researchers exposed mice to either a prenatal infection, circadian disruption during adolescence (via constant light exposure), both or neither. They found that each factor caused some changes on its own, but the combination altered memory, anxiety, social behaviour and gene activity in brain regions associated with the disorders.

"While more research is needed, our findings suggest that people exposed to multiple risk factors may need to be especially mindful of their daily rhythms," said lead author Tara Delorme, who conducted the research as a PhD student at the Douglas Research Centre.

Surprisingly, the combined effects didn't always make outcomes worse.

We assumed the effects would be additive. But in some cases, disruption of biological rhythms actually reduced the impact of prenatal infection. That suggests these factors may interact in unexpected ways."

Nicolas Cermakian, senior author, professor in McGill's Department of Psychiatry

The researchers focused on adolescence because it's a sensitive period for brain development.

"Adolescents are vulnerable," said Cermakian. "Their internal clocks tend to run later than the rest of the population, but school still starts early. On top of that, evening exposure to screens and artificial light can further delay their biological rhythms, leading to what we call social jet lag."

This mismatch between the body's internal clock and daily schedules has been linked to a range of health issues, he added.

The research team, including McGill psychiatry professors and Douglas researchers Lalit Srivastava and Patricia Silveira, is now investigating the gene changes the researchers saw in mice to see what they might reveal about how the human brain develops.

Researchers from the George Washington University have uncovered promising evidence in an animal study that shows setmelanotide, an FDA-approved medication for a rare genetic obesity disorder, may offer a pathway for treating a life-threatening form of sleep-disordered breathing called Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome.

People with this syndrome don't breathe deeply or frequently enough, especially during sleep, which leads to a buildup of carbon dioxide in their bodies even when they're awake. 

Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome which affects an estimated five to 10 million Americans commonly coexists with obstructive sleep apnea. While positive airway pressure machines like CPAP and BiPAP are standard treatments used to help keep airways open while sleeping they provide limited help to people with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome.

Our research addresses a critical gap in treatment options for Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. Our findings could be the first step toward a much-needed treatment for a life-threatening condition that impacts millions."

Vsevolod Polotsky, professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine at GW's School of Medicine and Health Sciences

Polotsky and postdoctoral researcher Mateus Amorim used the FDA approved drug setmelanotide to see if it could help improve breathing in obese mice. Researchers targeted a protein found on certain neurons in the brain called MC4R pathway that helps the brain control how much mammals and humans eat, how much energy they burn and even how they breathe. 

Key Findings: 

Just one dose of setmelanotide improved breathing and helped the mice respond better to high levels of carbon dioxide - something that's often impaired in Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome.

Setmelanotide improved breathing more than would be expected just from boosting metabolism, meaning it likely acts directly on brain regions that control breathing.

When using special tools to turn on MC4R neurons, they found breathing improved. But when those same neurons were turned off, breathing got worse - even when setmelanotide was given. 

They also discovered that MC4R neurons connect directly to other brain cells that control the diaphragm, the main muscle used for breathing.

This is the first direct evidence that the MC4R pathway plays a critical role in how the brain controls breathing in obesity. Setmelanotide may be able to treat Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome by bypassing the leptin (a hormone made by fat cells that helps regulate breathing) which is common in people with obesity.

While more studies of setmelanotide for Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome are still needed, this research represents a major advance in understanding how the brain controls breathing in obesity.

The study, "Targeting melanocortin 4 receptor to treat sleep disordered breathing in mice" was published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.

People who have metabolic and bariatric surgery are significantly less likely to develop psychiatric disorders compared to those who take weekly injections of GLP-1 anti-obesity medications, according to a new study presented today at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting. Over a five-year period, the risk of developing cognitive deficits was 54% lower and 18% and 17% lower for anxiety disorders and substance use disorders, respectively.

The study shows metabolic and bariatric surgery confers a strong protective effect against common mental health disorders in a head-to-head comparison with GLP-1 pharmacotherapy. The data supports embedding psychiatric screening and support within both surgical and medical obesity programs to help reduce the potential mental health burden after treatment. Further investigation is needed, however, to determine why the psychological impact is so different between treatment modalities."

Shauna Levy, MD, MS, study co-author, Assistant Professor, Chief, Division of MIS/Bariatric Surgery, Tulane University School Medicine

Researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of metabolic and bariatric surgery patients and patients on GLP-1 agonists, semaglutide, liraglutide, and dulaglutide, using the TriNetX database. After propensity score matching to balance demographic and clinical characteristics, 33,600 surgical patients and 33,600 pharmacotherapy patients were compared for the incidence of new psychiatric disorders. The follow-up period lasted up to five years.

"Maintaining mental health is important regardless of treatment choice. Even small differences can impact quality of life, so patients and their doctors should be proactive about monitoring mood, cognition, and substance use after starting any obesity therapy. Mental health is just as important as physical health and must be considered along with any treatment," said Ann M. Rogers, MD, MD, ACS FASMBS, President, ASMBS, who was not involved in the study.

Black patients are more likely to experience minor complications after metabolic and bariatric surgery than White patients, according to new study presented today at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

Researchers from the Yale School of Medicine found Black patients had a higher overall incidence of minor complications such as dehydration, trips to the emergency department (ED) and infections in each of the seven years, growing from 10.2% in 2016 to 15% in 2023 versus 7.6% to 12.1% for White patients. Post-operative visits to the ED not requiring hospital admission, increased from 6.1% to 9.1%, and IV treatments for hydration, from 3.7% to 4.6%. Serious complication (0.4%) and mortality rates (0.1%) remained low throughout the seven years and were about the same for both patient groups.

We were surprised the minor complication rate increased year after year and that racial disparities persisted. More work is needed to identify what's causing the uptick and how it can be reversed. A focus on enhanced discharge education and an action plan surrounding postoperative hydration may be beneficial."

Safraz Hamid, MD, study co-author, Yale School of Medicine

Researchers reviewed the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database to identify 1,106,419 patients (75% White patients, 25% Black patients) who had either primary laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) between 2016 and 2023. Surgical complications were ranked for severity using the Clavien-Dindo system and rates of complications were compared between the two patient groups.

"The study underscores the safety of metabolic and bariatric surgery but also suggests a need to focus more attention on identifying patients at higher risk for minor complications so that we can take measures to prevent them," said ASMBS President Ann M. Rogers, MD, MD, FACS, FASMBS, who was not involved in the study. "This study reveals a trend that we should work to understand better and need to reverse."

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of obesity and severe obesity is 40.3% and 9.4%, respectively. Studies show the disease can weaken or impair the body's immune system and cause chronic inflammation and increase the risk of many other diseases and conditions including cardiovascular disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.

The higher a person's body mass index (BMI), the higher their risk for complications after bariatric surgery, especially those with BMI of 50 or more, according to a new study presented today at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

Researchers found that the rate of complications increased by an average of 5.56% and serious occurrences rose 3.21% from the lowest BMI category to the highest, with people with a BMI 50 or more the most likely to experience complications of any kind.

The study gives new insights into the risks associated with each BMI category and identifies the inflection point for increased risk of morbidity and mortality, which occurs when patients pass BMI 50," said study co-author John Scott, MD, FACS, FASMBS, Chief for the Division of Minimal Access and Bariatric Surgery for the Prisma Health Dept. of Surgery in Greenville, SC. "Obesity itself is a risk factor in surgeries of all kinds, but in bariatric surgery the risks remain relatively low."

The retrospective study involved a review of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database for patients with obesity (BMI 30 or more) who had either sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between 2020 and 2023. A total of 665,047 cases were included.

"While complication rates are generally low, this study provides granular data not previously reported that can help with pre-operative counseling and to make surgery even safer and patient outcomes even better," said Richard M. Peterson, MD, MPH, FACS, FASMBS, President-elect, ASMBS, and Professor of Surgery, UT Health San Antonio, who was not involved in the study.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello, everyone. This is Dr Bishal Gyawali, from Queens University, Kingston, Canada. I'm back again in this Skills Lab Series on Medscape. 

Thank you for joining us in the past few lectures. Today is going to be the last lecture regarding surrogate endpoints. We will discuss how physicians and patients understand surrogate endpoints. Do they clearly understand, and do they make the right clinical decisions based on their understanding of surrogate endpoints? 

First, let's talk about patient understanding of progression-free survival (PFS), the most commonly used endpoint in advanced cancer drug trials. In fact, colleagues from the FDA conducted a fantastic study, in which they asked participants about their understanding of surrogate endpoints, and how they did this was very clever. 

They showed a direct-to-consumer television advertisement about a cancer drug, and the advertisement mentioned that the drug improved progression-free survival. It did not mention anything about overall survival (OS) or anything else. It just said that the drug improved progression-free survival. 

There were almost 1000 participants in this study and, after watching that advertisement that mentioned improved progression-free survival, more than 90% of the participants thought that the drug improved survival. There was no mention of overall survival, but just by hearing that it improved progression-free survival, they assumed that the drug improved overall survival, which is quite telling.

The researchers went one step further. They did a fantastic intervention. Now the participants saw the same advertisement again, but this time the advertisement specifically mentioned that the survival data were unknown. It improved progression-free survival, but we don't know whether it improves [overall] survival.

Even after that disclosure, 40% of the participants continued to believe that the drug improved survival, and I think this is because we call it progression-free survival. When we call it that, they hear the last word, "survival," and they inherently assume that if a drug improves progression-free survival, it improves their survival. Even after disclosing that survival effects are unknown, 40% of the participants continued to believe that the drug improves survival. 

One more very interesting study was conducted in 100 patients with advanced cancer in Canada. These were actual patients who were receiving treatment for cancer. PFS and OS were explained to these patients, and they were given a hypothetical scenario about a drug that improved PFS and had some toxicities but did not improve OS. 

In this experiment, 17% of the patients said they would prefer to receive the drug even if there was no PFS benefit. This is similar to what we see. Some of our patients just want something. They just want a drug. Even if there is no PFS or OS benefit, they just do not want to give up. 

Of the patients, 26% said they would want the drug for some PFS benefit, within the range of 3-9 months. If the drug improved PFS between 3 and 9 months, even if it did not improve OS, patients would still want to get the drug. However, the majority of them, 51%, would decline the drug, regardless of PFS benefit. 

This is important. What this is telling us is that if the drug does not offer any OS advantage, more than half of our patients would decline a drug with toxicities, irrespective of how big the magnitude of the PFS benefit is.

Therefore, we wrote a paper in The Lancet Oncology back in 2022, in which we called on the community to change the name of progression-free survival because it is confusing, and patients assume it is a survival advantage when it's actually not. If a drug does not improve survival, then they would probably not want a drug with PFS benefit alone. 

We said that it's time for a new name, and we proposed that instead of PFS, progression-free survival, we should call it PFI — progression-free interval — because it gets rid of the word "survival" and patients won't be confused. 

Now, let's talk about physicians' understanding of surrogate endpoints. Do physicians understand this well? This is a very recent paper that we published in ESMO Open. This was a mixed-methods study of oncologists' perceptions on endpoints, benefit, price, and value of cancer drugs. 

We conducted this study among oncologists in India, so there might be some limitations about how applicable it is elsewhere, but I don't think the results we found are very different from what we would find in any other country. 

First, we found that 20% of oncologists rarely use cancer drugs that improve only response rate but not survival. Almost an equal percentage said that they would often use drugs that improved response rate but not survival. In regard to PFS, 20% of oncologists rarely used cancer drugs that did not improve survival and only improved PFS, but 48% of them often used such a drug.

We asked them the reasons for this. First, let's talk about response rate. Among the oncologists who said they would not use a drug that improves only response rate, the most common reason was lack of any effect on survival or quality of life because the drug just shrinks the tumor. It does not help patients live longer or better, so what's the point? The second was toxicity, and the drug will definitely have many side effects. That was the reason why they did not want to use a drug with response alone. 

Among oncologists who said they would use the drug based on response rate alone, when we asked why, the most common answer was for symptom relief or improved quality of life. This is quite interesting because there are no data to say that response rate leads to improved quality of life or symptom relief. If it is in a tricky location, then it can, but there is no evidence that, in general, shrinking a tumor leads to improved quality of life. This indicates that oncologists' understanding of surrogate endpoints is also not optimal.

The second most common reason was to downstage disease, which is understandable. The third one is also very interesting because they said "something is better than nothing." That means they know that response rate does not lead to improved clinical outcomes, but they can't just do nothing for their patients. They have to do something and the patient wants something, so something is better than nothing. 

The fourth one is very interesting. They talk about the impact of drug approval and having it included in guidelines. Even if they know that it's based on response rate alone and they don't want to use the drug, if it's approved and if it's in the guidelines, then they feel like they're forced to use it.

Some of the oncologists also said that it's on a case-by-case basis. For example, if they have a drug that is cheaper or a biosimilar for a drug that improves response rate alone, they would use it. For rare cancers or where there is no other option, as we discussed, they would use such a drug. 

The most common reason for not using a drug based on PFS alone was the lack of effect on survival because it was not known whether the drug improved survival or not, which is very appropriate. Reasons in support of PFS were very interesting. The number-one reason here was cost. Oncologists said that a drug that improves PFS costs less than a drug that improves OS. The patients cannot afford the expensive drug, so they're using a cheaper drug. 

Again, this is very interesting because that's not true, especially in the context of the United States, Canada, and other high-income countries where we have done these studies. There is no correlation between whether the drug is approved based on PFS or OS and the price of the drug. A drug approved based on PFS can cost even more than a drug that is approved based on OS. 

The second reason was the impact of medical literature. If, in the editorials, commentaries, and CMEs, people are promoting a drug that is based on PFS alone, then that leads to their use. Then, on a case-by-case basis, people also talk about cost-effectiveness and for rare cancers or lack of alternatives.

Overall, I'm trying to show that when oncologists understand that it's only response rate or PFS, they still use these drugs based on some misguided assumptions that delaying PFS or improving response rate leads to improved quality of life, which is objectively untrue, and that drugs approved based on surrogate endpoints cost less than drugs approved based on OS, which is also untrue.

It's also interesting that we have this culture of always trying to do something rather than having that difficult discussion about end of life. Doing something is always easier than doing nothing, so we end up prescribing these drugs, although we know that it does not benefit patients. I think these findings are quite interesting, and I want our entire oncology community to be aware of these biases within ourselves. 

To close the loop, we also asked these oncologists about whether magnitude and price matter. They said that, for a drug that impacts only PFS, they would want to see at least a 4.5-month improvement in PFS, with the range of answers from 1.5 to 12 months, so quite a big range there. The price is interesting. This is not applicable to high-income countries. This is applicable only in the Indian context. They said that 120 USD per month was appropriate for such a drug.

For OS, again, they wanted an improvement of 4.5 months, with a range of 2-24 months. They said 360 USD per month was justified.

It's not about the exact number, but what they are telling us here is that a drug that improves OS can cost up to three times more than a drug that improves PFS alone. If you think about it the other way around, a drug that only improves PFS but not OS should be costing one third of the drugs that improve OS. That's not the case in reality. 

We talked about all the surrogate endpoints in these lectures and today is the end of this topic. To clarify, just because a trial's endpoint is overall survival does not necessarily mean that the benefits are meaningful. 

There can be several other issues, which we'll discuss in our subsequent lectures. The next few lectures will talk about statistical analysis, sample sizes, power calculations, and so on. Stay tuned.

Thank you.

A new ICES study has found that 1.74 million patients in Ontario are attached to family physicians aged 65 or older, and that many of those patients are elderly and have complex medical needs. 

The study, published in Canadian Family Physician, explored key trends in the characteristics of comprehensive family physicians (FPs)-those providing care for a broad range of ages and health needs-and the patients attached to them. 

The researchers found that for the first time, there was no growth of the comprehensive FP workforce, and an overall decline in the number of early career physicians (under 35 years old.) 

A major challenge Ontario faces is an aging family physician workforce that is nearing retirement. Although we found family physicians are practicing longer than expected – into their 70s, in fact – as these physicians retire, the number of patients without a family doctor will increase, especially as fewer early career physicians are choosing family medicine."

Dr. Kamila Premji, a family physician, ICES fellow, assistant professor in family medicine at the University of Ottawa, and PhD candidate in family medicine at Western University's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry 

The study included over 11 million Ontario patients as of March 2022, and 9,375 comprehensive FPs. This was an updated analysis of similar cohorts from 2008, 2013, and 2019. 

Along with a decline in the overall growth of the FP workforce and greater proportion at retirement age, the findings also showed that females made up the majority of the comprehensive workforce. Overall, a declining proportion of FPs are practicing comprehensiveness, from 77% in 2008 to 65% in 2022. 

A recent study by some of the same researchers showed that many FPs are choosing to work in hospitals instead of practicing comprehensive family medicine. 

"The data helps us to better understand the shortages we are facing, and informs strategies like team-based care, which can better support family physicians who provide comprehensive care and can reduce burnout," says Premji. 

Compared to the overall FP workforce, the authors found that near-retirement FPs were caring for a higher proportion of patients aged 65 or older, and many with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and frailty. 

"Looking to the future, we are concerned that the primary care system may not be able to absorb these medically complex patients who are attached to retiring family physicians, which will only exacerbate the current crisis," says senior author Dr. Bridget Ryan, adjunct scientist at ICES and an associate professor at Western's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry.

Mursla Bio, a leader in Extracellular Vesicle (EV) science on a mission to advance precision diagnostics and significantly improve cancer outcomes for at-risk patients, today announced the commercial launch of its AI Precision Medicine Platform, alongside a pre-print reporting the first validated method for isolating hepatocyte EVs from plasma for organ-specific proteomic and miRNA profiling. Mursla Bio is engaging with potential partners to apply its Platform to additional disease areas, biomarker discovery and IVD translation programs.

The Platform addresses a major gap in liquid biopsy and precision medicine: enabling non-invasive access to organ-specific molecular information from blood with high spatial and biological resolution. Mursla Bio's Platform is built on its ability to isolate and analyze EVs which are secreted by specific organs into the bloodstream. The Platform reduces non-target background by up to five orders of magnitude compared to standard bulk EV isolation and significantly improves data structure, enhancing prediction model generalization.

The pre-print presents the first multi-layered validation of hepatocyte EV isolation in humans, confirming liver origin through proteomic and nucleic acid markers. Key supporting proteomics data was generated in collaboration with Evotec International GmbH. Patient samples were provided by University College London, with Professor Brian Davidson, a global leader in liver disease surgery and clinical research, contributing as a co-author. The study shows that Mursla Bio's method yields robust, organ-specific multi-omics data using minimal blood volume, offering a novel scalable approach for biomarker and AI development.

Mursla Bio's Platform incorporates optimized multi-omics workflows, embedded AI pipelines, and IVD translation processes to convert complex biological signals into practical, regulatory-grade assays. These assays are deployable on standard commercial instruments using patented, PCR and ELISA-like steps designed for clinical adoption. The Platform also underpins the development of EvoLiver™, the Company's lead clinical program for liver cancer surveillance in cirrhotic patients. Built on multi-omics data from over 300 patients, EvoLiver achieved 86% sensitivity and 88% specificity on a locked, IVD-compatible assay for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma detection², and has received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA³.

EVs are nature's native signal enrichment system for long-distance communication between cells and organs. Our platform harnesses this biology to non-invasively access organ-specific, multi-omics data from just a small blood sample. It produces structured, biologically labeled datasets that are optimized for AI and ready to support diagnostic translation. EvoLiver is our first proof point of real-world clinical impact, and we are now expanding access to the platform to advance our pipeline and enable partnerships across other disease areas."

Pierre Arsène, Founder and CEO, Mursla Bio

Mursla Bio is expanding its pipeline and collaborations, with additional organ programs underway in cardiometabolic, lung, and neurological indications. The Platform will support pharma development through dynamic patient stratification, therapeutic response monitoring, surrogate markers and molecular phenotyping across complex disease biology.

World Wellbeing Week is a global awareness event recognized annually during the last week of June. Launched in 2019 by Wellbeing World, the event promotes physical, mental, emotional, social, and environmental wellbeing in workplaces, communities and homes. Bedfont® Scientific Limited, a medical breath analysis device manufacturing company with over 48 years of experience, actively promotes workplace wellbeing and welcomes this year's World Wellbeing Week.

With an estimated 776,000 workers in Great Britain suffering from work-related stress, depression, or anxiety in 2023/24, companies must do better to ensure employee wellbeing. Bedfont® has a dedicated team of Wellbeing Warriors who work tirelessly to ensure a healthy work/life balance for all employees. Various activities and events are held throughout the year for staff, such as healthy breakfasts and lunches, stress-busting activities, active challenges, and weekly walks, all designed to encourage staff to step away from their desks and take a break.

Prioritizing wellbeing in the workplace is not just a moral responsibility, it's a strategic driver of performance and culture. Employees who feel supported, healthy, and valued are more engaged, motivated, and resilient. However, the true impact of any wellbeing initiative depends on leadership. When the senior management team actively supports and champions wellbeing, it sends a powerful message. That commitment filters through every company level, creating a culture where care, productivity, and purpose thrive together.”

Claire Dadswell, Wellbeing Manager, Bedfont®

Bedfont's dedicated Wellbeing Garden, which opened in 2023, offers staff a tranquil space to take time out, relax, and reflect. The wellbeing room is another space for staff to take time out, play games, or use the red light therapy machine and CELLER8® Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) device. Red light therapy and PEMF therapy support wellbeing by enhancing cellular function, reducing inflammation, and promoting relaxation, recovery, and overall energy balance.

"At Bedfont®, wellbeing is more than a policy, it's a daily priority.” Said Jason Smith, CEO at Bedfont®. “We genuinely care about how our people feel, and that's why we've introduced things like red light and PEMF therapy, a Wellbeing Garden, and flexible work options. When our team feels supported and balanced, they can perform at their best, individually and collectively."

Earlier this month, the most recent team-building event saw the Bedfont® office close for the afternoon, and staff were treated to various activities and relaxation at St Andrews Lake. This is just one of many initiatives arranged by the Wellbeing Warriors, which give staff a much-needed wellbeing boost.

By embedding wellbeing into its culture and daily operations, Bedfont® has seen the positive impact, and other organizations can benefit from a similar approach.

A new modeling study finds that replacing a single serving of fruit with berries each day dramatically improves anthocyanin and fiber intake, offering a simple, cost-effective upgrade to American diets.

Study: Effect of replacing commonly consumed fruit in the United States with berries in the USDA healthy Dietary Patterns: a modeling analysis. Image Credit: Sabino Parente / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Annals of Medicine, a group of researchers evaluated the nutritional effects of substituting commonly eaten fruits with berries in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) dietary models.

Why do most Americans eat the same fruits every day, like apples, bananas, and grapes, even though a wide variety is available? According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), most adults in the US do not eat fruit every day, and when they do, they often rely on just a few types. This limited variety may reduce exposure to important nutrients and bioactive compounds such as anthocyanins, which are especially rich in berries.

Anthocyanins are associated with cardiovascular benefits and may improve vascular function and metabolic health, although clinical intake recommendations are not yet established. Despite these potential benefits, berries are under-consumed in typical American diets. Further research is needed to understand how incorporating more berries into daily fruit intake can improve overall nutritional quality.

Fruit categorization matters: Unlike vegetables, which have official subgroups in dietary guidelines, fruits lack targeted categorization, potentially limiting nutrient diversity in American diets.

The researchers used the USDA food pattern modeling method to explore the nutritional effects of replacing one daily serving of commonly consumed fruit like apple, banana, or grape, with one serving of berries. This substitution was tested in three USDA dietary models: Healthy Mediterranean-Style (HMS), Healthy United States-Style (HUS), and Healthy Vegetarian (HV). Each model was designed for a 2,000-calorie daily intake over a 7-day menu. Each day included two servings of fruit, with the intervention replacing seven of the fourteen weekly servings of common fruits with berries.

Nutrient analysis was conducted using the Elizabeth Stewart Hands and Associates (ESHA) Food Processor software version 11.14.x. The software utilized data from multiple databases, including the USDA FoodData Central and the USDA Database for Flavonoid Content of Selected Foods, Release 3.3. Over a 7-day menu, berry servings included three cups of blueberries and four cups of a mixed blend (blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries), with one cup consumed daily in place of a commonly eaten fruit.

The researchers evaluated changes in energy, macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), dietary fiber (total and soluble), vitamins, minerals, and anthocyanins. Food cost estimates were derived from Walmart retail prices in Grand Junction, Colorado, which reflected average pricing in the US market.

Anthocyanin intake is low: Current US adults consume just 13.8–16.4mg anthocyanins daily; berry substitution nearly doubled this intake in the models.

Replacing one daily serving of commonly consumed fruit with one serving of berries led to a 93.8% increase in anthocyanin intake across all three dietary models. This major gain in bioactive compounds was achieved without significant changes in calorie count, fat, protein, or cholesterol, suggesting that the substitution was nutritionally balanced.

In the HUS model, total dietary fiber increased by 5.1% and soluble fiber by 10.1%. Vitamin C rose by 16%, while vitamin E and vitamin K increased by 6.0% and 5.4%, respectively. Sugar intake dropped by 8.1%, and total carbohydrates decreased by 3.1%. Protein and fat values remained nearly the same. The weekly cost of food increased by $7.28, a 10.4% rise compared to the baseline menu. Potassium decreased by 3.3%, while other minerals changed by less than 2%.

The HMS model showed similar trends, with total fiber increasing by 4.7% and soluble fiber rising by 5.3%. Vitamin C increased by 13.9%, vitamin E by 5.3%, and vitamin K by 4.7%. Sugar intake declined by 8.1%, and carbohydrates showed a modest decrease. The weekly cost of food increased by $6.72, marking a 9.2% increase. Potassium decreased slightly by 1.2%, with minimal changes in other minerals.

In the HV model, soluble fiber rose by 10.2%, and total fiber increased by 1%. Vitamin C rose by 11.9%, vitamin E by 5.4%, and vitamin K by 5.1%. Carbohydrate intake dropped by 4.6%, and sugar fell by 9.2%. Potassium decreased slightly by 3.8%, while other minerals showed minimal changes. The cost of food increased by $6.97 per week, a 10.5% rise.

Berry seeds hold hidden value: Beyond flesh nutrients, berry seeds may offer understudied vitamin E benefits, adding to their nutritional profile.

These results suggest that incorporating berries into the USDA dietary patterns enhances nutritional quality without compromising calorie or macronutrient balance. The increase in fiber and key vitamins is particularly relevant, given the widespread deficiency of these nutrients in American diets. The weekly grocery cost increased by about 10%, yet remained within the USDA's moderate-cost food plan range ($73.90–$87.60 per week for adults aged 19–50 in 2024).

These nutrient gains may justify the added cost, particularly for households aiming to improve diet quality through small, sustainable changes. However, the authors noted that because this was a modeling analysis, the findings may not accurately reflect actual individual food intake.

To summarize, replacing one serving of commonly eaten fruit with a serving of berries in the USDA dietary models led to notable improvements in nutrient density. Anthocyanins, fiber, and key vitamins, including vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin K, increased significantly, while calorie and macronutrient levels remained stable.

These benefits were observed in all three USDA dietary patterns. While food costs increased by approximately 10%, they remained comparable to those outlined in the USDA's moderate-cost weekly food plan.

This modeling analysis suggests that including berries as a daily fruit option may offer nutritional benefits without compromising dietary balance or affordability. Including berry subgroups in future federal dietary recommendations may offer a practical strategy for improving public health nutrition.

Researchers uncover subtype-specific effects of tea, soda, and pesticides on Parkinson's disease, revealing how lifestyle and environment can shape motor symptom severity long after diagnosis.

In a recent article published in the journal npj Parkinson's Disease, researchers investigated how lifestyle factors and environmental exposures affect the severity of motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease over time.

They found that the consumption of black tea was linked to milder motor symptoms in one form of the disease. At the same time, pesticide exposure and the consumption of caffeinated soda have been implicated in worsening motor symptoms in another disease type.

Sugar's role hinted: Diet caffeinated soda, which lacks the high sugar of regular soda, showed no link to motor severity. This suggests sugar might be the key driver behind regular soda's negative effects.

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder currently affecting about 12 million people worldwide, with cases rising by over 60% from 1990 to 2021. The lack of a cure means the burden on society continues to grow.

Around 15% of Parkinson's cases are caused by single gene mutations or strong risk factors, with the LRRK2 G2019S variant being the most common for autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (LRRK2-PD).

Previous research suggests that LRRK2-PD patients often have more pronounced motor issues but less severe non-motor symptoms compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) patients.

Environmental and lifestyle factors also play a significant role in the development and progression of this condition. Pesticide exposure is a well-established risk factor, linked to earlier disease onset and faster progression.

Other environmental risks, like air pollution, solvents, and heavy metals, show mixed results. Drinking coffee and smoking consistently appear protective, delaying onset in both iPD and LRRK2-PD, whereas caffeinated soda may hasten onset in LRRK2-PD.

However, the effect of these factors on motor severity over time remains unclear, especially for smoking and caffeine intake. Cross-sectional studies hint that smoking could worsen symptoms post-onset, creating a paradox where a factor that protects against developing the disease might be harmful after diagnosis.

Therefore, more robust longitudinal studies using large cohorts are needed to clarify how environment and lifestyle impact motor symptom progression, particularly distinguishing between LRRK2-PD and iPD.

Sex-specific vulnerability: Women with iPD who drank caffeinated soda experienced a much stronger worsening of motor symptoms than men.

This study used data from two large online cohorts. Participants with Parkinson's disease were recruited and followed through routine online assessments of non-motor and motor symptoms, as well as detailed questionnaires on lifestyle habits and environmental exposures.

Ethical approval and informed consent were secured for both cohorts.

To ensure consistency, only participants with an age at onset of over 25 years, a disease duration of under 50 years, and at least three motor assessments were included. This resulted in 5,134 iPD patients and 81 LRRK2-PD patients.

Motor symptom severity was measured using a cumulative score, consistently collected in both cohorts. Follow-up lasted up to 35 months for one cohort and 60 months for the second, divided into discrete periods for analysis.

Environmental and lifestyle factors, including pesticide exposure, smoking, and caffeine intake, were measured using standardized Parkinson's disease Risk Factor Questionnaires.

Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the relationship between these factors and motor symptom progression over time. The models adjusted for age at onset, disease duration, experience of OFF episodes, and sex, with the patient's identification number as a random effect.

Significance thresholds were adjusted for multiple comparisons in pesticide exposure analyses; other analyses were exploratory. This approach ensured a robust, longitudinal assessment of how environment and lifestyle may influence Parkinson's disease motor outcomes.

Unique vulnerability of LRRK2-PD: The beneficial effect of black tea was specific to LRRK2-PD, with a significant interaction between PD type and tea consumption (p=0.045), meaning black tea didn't just help, it helped differently in this genetic subtype.

Across multiple assessments, motor symptoms worsened gradually in both groups, but iPD patients generally showed more severe progression than LRRK2-PD patients.

Notably, exposure to pesticides at work was linked to greater motor severity in iPD patients in the PPMI-Online cohort, with a similar but non-significant trend observed in the Fox Insight cohort. This association persisted after adjusting for sex. No such association was found in LRRK2-PD patients.

Smoking was also associated with increased motor symptom severity over time in iPD patients. This effect was significant in the PPMI-Online cohort, but only a subtle trend was observed in the Fox Insight cohort. This effect held after controlling for sex.

Regarding caffeinated drinks, black tea consumption did not influence motor severity in iPD but was linked to milder symptoms in LRRK2-PD patients. While the authors caution that this subgroup was small, they strengthened this preliminary finding by replicating it in a second, independent cohort of LRRK2-PD patients.

Conversely, caffeinated soda consumption was associated with more severe motor symptoms in iPD patients and showed a similar trend in LRRK2-PD, though less robustly. The paper notes that caffeinated diet soda, which lacks high sugar content, showed no such association.

Interestingly, the link between caffeinated soda intake and worse motor symptoms was stronger among women than men with iPD. Consumption of coffee and green tea showed no clear impact on motor symptom progression in either group.

This study highlights the impact of environmental and lifestyle factors on the progression of Parkinson's disease. It found that pesticide exposure and caffeinated soda intake were linked to worse motor symptoms in iPD, while smoking showed a weaker association that was not consistent across both study cohorts.

For LRRK2-PD, black tea consumption appeared protective, though this effect was not seen in iPD, suggesting subtype-specific impacts. This finding is notable because it was observed in two independent cohorts, although both were small.

The study's strengths include its large sample size, long follow-up period, and use of two independent cohorts, which support robust findings. However, small LRRK2-PD samples limit generalizability, and other monogenic forms have not been thoroughly examined. Lack of data on medication doses, dietary details (such as sugar intake), and potential recall bias are additional limitations.

Despite these, the study emphasizes that environmental exposures, which are harder to control than lifestyle choices, can worsen Parkinson's symptoms even after disease onset. The findings also underscore how a factor like smoking can be protective before onset but potentially harmful after, and suggest how ingredients like sugar in soda may play a role separate from caffeine.

Future research should confirm these results in larger, diverse genetic groups and use objective measures of exposure. Understanding these relationships may help tailor prevention and management strategies for different Parkinson's disease subtypes.

A new proteomics study reveals that even short-term COVID-19 in children can leave behind blood markers of cardiovascular risk, particularly in those with MIS-C, challenging the notion that children recover unscathed.

Observational accounts have led many clinicians to believe that, unlike their adult counterparts, children generally experience milder outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the underlying metabolic effects have not been fully characterized. In a recent study in the Journal of Proteome Research, a collaborative research team from the Australian National Phenome Centre and Harvard analysed blood plasma samples (n = 147) from pediatric patients to investigate these effects.

Advanced blood characterization tools identified acute disruptions in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, known markers of long-term cardiovascular risk. During acute COVID-19 infections, children exhibit plasma signatures similar to those observed in adults with severe COVID-19, which contain markers associated with long-term cardiovascular risk. This study challenges the assumptions of a universally mild pediatric COVID-19 and calls for further investigation and monitoring in children to mitigate future cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

Children have long been considered largely untouched by COVID-19's long-term consequences, especially concerning heart health. However, the emergence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), alongside broader reports of persistent symptoms in pediatric long COVID cases, has shattered these perceptions, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can spark life-threatening systemic inflammation weeks after recovery from mild COVID-associated respiratory illnesses.

MIS-C is a rare but severe condition characterized by potentially life-threatening multi-organ inflammation across cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and mucocutaneous systems. A growing body of evidence suggests shared metabolic pathways between some post-COVID illnesses and the severe inflammatory response seen in MIS-C.

Unfortunately, given the relative novelty of COVID-19 and the prevailing scientific views on child-associated SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, only a handful of studies have explored the lingering metabolic effects of pediatric COVID-19. Data from blood-based biomarker analyses, particularly those that identify previously undetected, long-term cardiovascular risks, are lacking.

The present study aims to address existing scientific knowledge gaps by conducting a comprehensive suite of advanced biochemical and proteomic assays on children during acute COVID-19 and MIS-C.

Study data were obtained from the Massachusetts General Hospital Pediatric COVID-19 Biorepository, Boston, US, and included sociodemographic information and medical health records. Biometric measures and plasma samples were collected once from each participant during their acute illness.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions were used to classify the study participants into three categories: 1. Healthy children who had never been infected by SARS-CoV-2 (healthy), 2. Acute COVID-19 (COVID-19), and 3. Confirmed MIS-C cases (MIS-C). All participant plasma samples were subjected to high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to facilitate the identification of a broad spectrum of metabolites.

To obtain a detailed metabolic fingerprint, researchers used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data to identify and quantify cholesterol and its derivatives, triglycerides, and inflammatory markers. They then compared these metabolic profiles to those from a previously studied cohort of adults with COVID-19.

Statistical analyses included principal component analyses (PCAs) to identify the primary sources of data variation, random forest data imputation (for missing data), and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) for elucidating infection-associated data variance. The data were subsequently analyzed and visualized using multivariate analyses, adjusted for demographics and other confounding factors.

The final study sample cohort comprised 147 children. CDC guidelines classified these participants into three groups: 1. 66 healthy children (no SARS-CoV-2 infections), 2. 55 with acute COVID-19 infections (25% severe), and 3. 26 with MIS-C. MIS-C patients exhibited symptoms involving the cardiovascular, mucocutaneous, and gastrointestinal systems.

Study findings revealed several alarming outcomes:

Children with COVID-19 (particularly those with MIS-C) demonstrated marked alterations in lipid metabolism during their acute illness. These include elevated triglyceride levels indicative of pediatric hypertriglyceridemia, marked reductions in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations, and increased inflammatory lipoproteins, as well as certain low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles.

Elevated triglycerides and specific LDL particles are hallmarks of early cardiovascular disease, while HDL cholesterol is a known protective factor against cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. These findings hence suggest that children with acute COVID-19 (especially MIS-C patients) exhibit a profile that may place them at increased risk of chronic CVD outcomes.

Lipoprotein analyses revealed that the inflammatory lipoproteins in children with COVID-19 and MIS-C showed a strong similarity to those seen in adults with severe COVID-19.

The authors also noted a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in the patient cohorts, which they suggest could be a contributing factor that exacerbates the observed lipid abnormalities and future cardiovascular risk.

Notably, individuals in the healthy control group did not mirror any of these findings, suggesting a COVID-19-specific metabolic shift in childhood patients.

The present study debunks the comforting assumption that children experience mild COVID-19 infections without lasting consequences. It highlights that children with acute COVID-19 and MIS-C develop metabolic profiles closely resembling those containing markers of future cardiovascular risk. MIS-C patients, in particular, showed significant metabolic disruption, foreshadowing potential long-term cardiovascular risk.

These insights underscore the need for further investigation into the lasting effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pediatric health. Clinicians and public health officials must now consider that follow-up beyond respiratory recovery may be warranted to facilitate timely treatment and mitigate potential long-term health implications.

While neither will be playing for their country this summer, all eyes are on the American duo and the Italian giant that they play for

According to FIFA, there are 42 Americans lining up at the Club World Cup, the fifth-most of any country. The two best? They'll be wearing black and white, hoping to lead Juventus back towards a mountaintop that the club has fallen off of in recent years.

U.S. internationals Weston McKennie and Tim Weah can't do that alone, nor can they do it all this summer. Juventus, once Serie A's most dominant club, has fallen back towards the pack. The Old Lady are no longer Italy's dominant force, their last Serie A win came in 2020, but they remain one of the world's biggest teams. That's why this summer means so much. As they prepare to kickstart their run at the Club World Cup, Juventus are fighting for more than just a trophy; they're fighting for legitimacy, not just on the field but off of it.

So, too, are McKennie and Weah. Both missed out on this summer's Gold Cup to take part in this tournament, and considering the U.S. Men's National Team's ongoing controversy surrounding Christian Pulisic, it is safe to assume all players, even the team's biggest stars, have to constantly fight for their place. Meanwhile, at Juve, no one is ever safe, as McKennie knows particularly well, and both will be among the players fighting to earn new coach Igor Tudor's trust. Tudor was brought in late last season to guide Juventus towards the Champions League. He did that, and now this Club World Cup is his chance to really show his ideas as Juve boss.

This summer is vital for McKennie and Weah on multiple levels, and as they head into this Club World Cup, they do so with a big picture in sight.

Teams fail to find cutting edge in scoreless draw

MetLife Stadium half-full for noon kick-off

Borussia Dortmund and Fluminense played out a 0-0 draw in the Club World Cup on Tuesday in rainy conditions at MetLife Stadium.

The match kicked off at noon local time, so it was perhaps unsurprising that the stadium was only half full. New York/New Jersey has a significant Brazilian population, and the crowd of 34,763 was tilted toward Fluminense, with fans waving flags and singing for their team.

Fluminense's best scoring chance came in the 58th minute on a left-footed shot by Agustín Canobbio that was saved by Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel.

Dortmund's new signing Jobe Bellingham, the brother of Real Madrid star Jude, made his debut for Dortmund in the 59th minute as a substitute for Pascal Gross.

The German club qualified for the Club World Cup with a top-four finish in the Bundesliga, while Fluminense qualified as the 2023 Copa Libertadores champion.
 Fluminense played more aggressively, and had 14 shots to Dortmund's seven. The Germans held the possession advantage at 54.5%.

Fluminense next play on Saturday evening against South Korea's Ulsan Hyundai at MetLife. Dortmund face South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday afternoon in Cincinnati.

Fans were quick to react after watching Jobe Bellingham's Borussia Dortmund debut against Fluminense at the Club World Cup.

Jobe, 19, joined Borussia Dortmund on a five-year contract until June 2030 last week.

Sunderland are due to receive a fee of around £26.96m plus £4.2m in add-ons.

Of course, by joining Dortmund, Jobe has drawn comparisons with his older brother Jude, who also played for the German side before joining Real Madrid in 2023.

And on Tuesday (June 17), the younger of the pair made his debut for his new side during the Club World Cup group stage.

Jobe was introduced 59 minutes into Dortmund's 0-0 draw against Brazilian outfit Fluminense at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Fans were quick to give their thoughts on his performance.

Advert

One said: "Awesome debut! Jobe Bellingham looks sharp in that Dortmund kit, making his mark at the Club World Cup. Can't wait to see more from him!"

Another added: "He's just swinging side passes like proper EFL midfielder - nothing special about him!"

A third commented: "Uncanny resemblance with his brother."

While a fourth explained: "There's nothing special except the media PR. This guy is bang average and is only carried by the hype that's also carrying his Real Madrid brother. Stop this rubbish!"

Advert

Jobe explained how it was an "incredible feeling" to sign for the German side when he spoke to the club's website last week.

“It's an incredible feeling," said Jobe. "It's a great privilege, because it's the dream of many players - and for a few weeks now it's been my dream too. I'm very happy to be here.”

He added: "The last three weeks have honestly been incredible for me. There have been so many great moments. This is one of them, of course. Signing for Borussia Dortmund, but of course the final and the whole of the play-offs at my previous club were something that meant a lot to me. It was very special and I was happy that I was able to finish with that result."

Advert

It is still unclear exactly what role the England youth international will play in Nico Kovac's side, given the fact that he is making a huge step up from the English Championship to the German top flight. But if his brother's progression is anything to go by, Jobe should develop into a fine midfielder.

The U.S. defeated Trinidad and Tobago to snap a four-game losing streak as it eyes next year's World Cup, which the U.S. is co-hosting.

The pressure on the U.S. men's national soccer team couldn't be higher. The world of American soccer has a rare, priceless opportunity arriving a year from now: the 2026 FIFA World Cup, to be hosted largely on U.S. soil.

But the sentiment around the U.S. men's national team isn't one of excitement or optimism. Instead, it has been doom and gloom among fans and pundits alike after a series of disappointing losses and an escalating drama between the team's biggest star, Christian Pulisic, and its new, top-dollar head coach, Mauricio Pochettino.

"It's a storm," veteran defender Tim Ream said last Friday of the negativity. "You can either run from it, you can hide from it, or you put yourself back out there and say, 'Okay, we're going again.'"

Even players will admit that it's been a tough stretch for the national team. Last year's embarrassing group stage elimination in the Copa America tournament led to the firing of then-coach Gregg Berhalter. The team hired Pochettino to acclaim in the fall, but soon followed that with the U.S.'s first four-game losing streak since 2007.

Two defeats came in March to Panama and Canada, followed by a one-goal loss to Türkiye and a 4-0 pounding by Switzerland last week. All four are the caliber of team the U.S. would likely need to beat in order to advance in next year's World Cup.

"I don't think there's any denying that some of our performances have fallen short over the past year to 18 months," said defender Walker Zimmerman earlier this month. "It's something that, us as players, we obviously aren't satisfied with."

It hasn't helped that some of the team's top players have been absent from the recent games due to injury, like Sergiño Dest. Others' club teams declined to make them available this summer due to participation in the FIFA Club World Cup, including Weston McKinnie and Tim Weah.

But one conspicuous absence was neither: Christian Pulisic, the 26-year-old star and face of the USMNT — who reportedly chose to sit out in order to rest.

His absence, coupled with the team's poor showings on the field, sparked criticism from some former national team players, including Landon Donovan. During a TV broadcast of the UEFA Nations League Final between Portugal and Spain, Donovan praised the participation of the 40-year-old Portuguese national team legend Cristiano Ronaldo to make a point about, it seemed, Pulisic.


                American star Christian Pulisic, shown here last month playing for AC Milan in Italy, reportedly decided to sit out the Gold Cup for the USMNT to rest. His decision has sparked criticism from former players.

"[Ronaldo]'s tired. He's out there grinding," Donovan said. "And I can't help but think about some of our guys who are on vacation right now, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's pissing me off."

Now, both Pulisic and Pochettino have spoken publicly about Pulisic's absence, escalating the drama with each response.

Last week, Pulisic appeared on the CBS Sports Golazo America podcast to air his side. Toward the end of the soccer season in Europe, he felt that he was at risk of injury if he continued to play through the summer, especially in the Gold Cup, in which the U.S. could play in as many as six games.

"I had to make the best decision for myself and in the long run for my team, even though some people haven't seen it that way," Pulisic said on the podcast. "I did want to be part of at least the two friendlies [against Turkiye and Switzerland]. I did speak with the coaches, and I did ask to be part of the team in whatever capacity they could. They said no. They said they only wanted one roster. But it is what it is."

At a press conference Saturday, Pochettino responded bluntly.

"Players don't need to understand or not understand. Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan," the coach said.

To earn their place on the World Cup roster, players, including Pulisic, will have to perform well, Pochettino said — not simply say "'I want to be, I want to play, I want to this, I want to that,'" he added.

"When I signed my contract with the federation, I am a head coach. I am not a mannequin," Pochettino said.

For the players on the team this month, it has been "a chaotic time," said John Tolkin, a 22-year-old defender who recently made his fifth appearance with the national team.

"What you see online, all that media, all the opinions, it's impossible this day not to see it," Tolkin told reporters Friday.

The absence of Pulisic and other key veterans has meant there are valuable game minutes up for grabs for younger players, like Tolkin, who are eager to prove themselves to Pochettino for a spot on the World Cup roster next summer.

Their opportunity is this month's Gold Cup, a biannual tournament for national teams in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. This summer's edition also includes Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. opened play in the tournament Sunday with a dominating 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago, the No. 100 team on FIFA's international rankings.

The star of the match was 23-year-old forward Malik Tillman, who scored two goals.

Afterward, he told reporters that it felt "amazing" and like "a relief" to have a good game amid the external negativity. "After those two friendlies, it's been a tough, more disappointing period," he said.

The U.S. has two more games in the Gold Cup group stage — a tilt against Saudi Arabia on Thursday, followed by Haiti on Sunday. A second win would assure the U.S. advances to a knockout round with as many as three more games.

A title in the tournament, with a win or two over quality opponents like Mexico or Canada, could completely change the narrative.

"That's the blessing and a curse that comes with playing a professional soccer player and ultimately representing a nation," said forward Patrick Agyemang after Sunday's win. "For us, each day we take at a time."

But one conspicuous absence was neither: Christian Pulisic, the 26-year-old star and face of the USMNT — who reportedly chose to sit out in order to rest.

His absence, coupled with the team's poor showings on the field, sparked criticism from some former national team players, including Landon Donovan. During a TV broadcast of the UEFA Nations League Final between Portugal and Spain, Donovan praised the participation of the 40-year-old Portuguese national team legend Cristiano Ronaldo to make a point about, it seemed, Pulisic.

"[Ronaldo]'s tired. He's out there grinding," Donovan said. "And I can't help but think about some of our guys who are on vacation right now, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's pissing me off."

Now, both Pulisic and Pochettino have spoken publicly about Pulisic's absence, escalating the drama with each response.

Last week, Pulisic appeared on the CBS Sports Golazo America podcast to air his side. Toward the end of the soccer season in Europe, he felt that he was at risk of injury if he continued to play through the summer, especially in the Gold Cup, in which the U.S. could play in as many as six games.

"I had to make the best decision for myself and in the long run for my team, even though some people haven't seen it that way," Pulisic said on the podcast. "I did want to be part of at least the two friendlies [against Turkiye and Switzerland]. I did speak with the coaches, and I did ask to be part of the team in whatever capacity they could. They said no. They said they only wanted one roster. But it is what it is."

At a press conference Saturday, Pochettino responded bluntly.

"Players don't need to understand or not understand. Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan," the coach said.

To earn their place on the World Cup roster, players, including Pulisic, will have to perform well, Pochettino said — not simply say "'I want to be, I want to play, I want to this, I want to that,'" he added.

"When I signed my contract with the federation, I am a head coach. I am not a mannequin," Pochettino said.

For the players on the team this month, it has been "a chaotic time," said John Tolkin, a 22-year-old defender who recently made his fifth appearance with the national team.

"What you see online, all that media, all the opinions, it's impossible this day not to see it," Tolkin told reporters Friday.

The absence of Pulisic and other key veterans has meant there are valuable game minutes up for grabs for younger players, like Tolkin, who are eager to prove themselves to Pochettino for a spot on the World Cup roster next summer.

Their opportunity is this month's Gold Cup, a biannual tournament for national teams in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. This summer's edition also includes Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. opened play in the tournament Sunday with a dominating 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago, the No. 100 team on FIFA's international rankings.

The star of the match was 23-year-old forward Malik Tillman, who scored two goals.

Afterward, he told reporters that it felt "amazing" and like "a relief" to have a good game amid the external negativity. "After those two friendlies, it's been a tough, more disappointing period," he said.

The U.S. has two more games in the Gold Cup group stage — a tilt against Saudi Arabia on Thursday, followed by Haiti on Sunday. A second win would assure the U.S. advances to a knockout round with as many as three more games.

A title in the tournament, with a win or two over quality opponents like Mexico or Canada, could completely change the narrative.

"That's the blessing and a curse that comes with playing a professional soccer player and ultimately representing a nation," said forward Patrick Agyemang after Sunday's win. "For us, each day we take at a time."

We're not even a week into the Club World Cup, and the prevailing theme has to be embarrassing for FIFA.

Concerns about poor ticket sales have been realized across the country as fans haven't been turning up in huge numbers to watch the inaugural edition of the expanded club tournament. The images of near-empty stadiums have been so sad that many fans are already declaring the tournament a failure.

But really, FIFA only has its own arrogance to blame with puzzling scheduling decisions. Some common sense could have changed the tournament's entire perception in the early going.

As we covered in the lead-up to the tournament, ticket sales were poor due, in part, to the high prices and lack of overall prestige. But the game times and venues have also been a major factor in this initial embarrassment.

For Monday's game between the Premier League's Chelsea and MLS' LAFC, kickoff was set for 3 p.m. local time at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium — a time when people are largely at work. So, the idea of filling a 71,000-seat stadium at 3 p.m. on a Monday was silly — especially for a match that didn't include a local team. Mind you: Atlanta United leads MLS in average attendance. It wasn't an "Atlanta doesn't like soccer" issue.

That led to a scene like this at kickoff.

That looks bad, sure. But the announced crowd was still 22,000, which actually isn't awful for a 3 p.m. Monday match. If you put that crowd in any soccer-specific MLS stadium, FIFA would have been looking at a sellout and a totally different conversation about the tournament.

The same went for Tuesday's match between Bundesliga giant Borussia Dortmund and Brazilian side Fluminense. FIFA decided to hold that match at noon on a Tuesday at 82,500-seat Metlife Stadium. So, you had a crowd that looked like this:

If FIFA had instead opted to hold the match at Sports Illustrated Stadium (formerly Red Bull Arena in New Jersey), that's a packed stadium. It's that simple.

And sure, some matches have been able to draw impressive crowds at NFL or college football stadiums. The PSG-Atletico Madrid match drew 80,000 at the Rose Bowl. Miami's Hard Rock Stadium has also seen some solid crowds. But those were either weekend matches or taking place at night.

FIFA really should have considered the time and venue. It's a new tournament. People have work, and international fans aren't clamoring to travel to America in this political climate. That's not the recipe for a successful tournament.

FIFA only has itself to blame.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Before the Club World Cup even began, at 5 p.m. on a scorching Saturday, the perils of summer soccer in the United States became apparent. Hundreds of fans packed into a narrow, shadeless corridor here waiting to enter Hard Rock Stadium. An elderly man, struggling in 92-degree heat, staggered toward a chair; a preteen boy later keeled over and doused himself with water. “We're gonna pass out,” one woman said, as she pleaded with security to open locked gates, to no avail.

And they weren't the only ones melting; players are, too.

After Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 win over Atlético Madrid the following day in Pasadena, California, PSG coach Luis Enrique said, “The teams are suffering.”

Atlético midfielder Marcos Llorente told reporters: “It's impossible, it's terribly hot. My toes were sore, my toenails were hurting, I couldn't stop and start. … It's unbelievable."

His PSG counterpart Vitinha said: “I'm all red. It was really difficult.”

All involved, including 80,000 fans at the Rose Bowl, got previews of an inescapable danger at the 2026 World Cup, which will also be staged at 11 stadiums across the U.S., plus two in Canada and three in Mexico. Five of those 16 stadiums have roofs; but the rest are open-air and susceptible to weather. And of the 11 outdoor venues, seven are scheduled to experience “extreme” humidity and temperatures in the 90s over the coming week — the same June window in which the World Cup will be played next summer.

In the immediate term, that's a concern for the Club World Cup. Temperatures are projected to rise into the mid-90s as Juventus and Wydad kick off at noon in Philadelphia on Sunday; and as Benfica and Bayern Munich battle at 3 p.m. in Charlotte on Tuesday. There are highs of 98 and 100 in East Rutherford, N.J., and Philly respectively early next week, when night games are scheduled between Al Ahly and Porto, and Esperance Tunis and Chelsea.

Even in the low 90s, at noon and 1 p.m. in Southern California on Sunday, fans and players struggled to cope. "No European team is used to competing in such high temperatures," Llorente said.

And even goalkeepers have been affected. “It's difficult. First time in my life I felt heat like this,” Benfica's Anatoliy Trubin said after Benfica's draw with Boca Juniors in 90-degree, humid Miami Gardens.

In Pasadena, Enrique said: "The match was clearly influenced by the temperature. … It's impossible to perform at a very high level for 90 minutes.”

Enrique also noted the issue was the noon PT start. “The timing is great for European fans, but the teams are suffering,” he said.

That will be the tension at the heart of FIFA's 2026 World Cup scheduling. It tends to prioritize broadcasters and TV viewers, sometimes at the expense of players and match-going fans. It schedules three or four games per day and spreads them out into exclusive windows. Some, therefore, must go in the afternoon, when there is often no reprieve from the summer sun — but when it's prime time in Europe and Africa.

Players are afforded one water break per half — during which they've draped ice-cold towels over their heads and neck — but some experts worry that's not enough. At last summer's Copa América, Uruguay defender Ronald Araújo exited a game at halftime feeling “dizzy.” An assistant referee collapsed and was hospitalized, having “suffered from dehydration,” according to organizers.

Those scares led many to wonder how FIFA would adapt to avoid such danger. But its Club World Cup schedule placed afternoon games in Cincinnati, Pasadena, Miami, North Jersey, Philadelphia, Orlando, Charlotte, Nashville and Washington, D.C.

FIFA did not immediately respond to an email seeking information on what extra precautions, if any, are being prepared for the heat wave expected to hit some of those cities later this week.

In the meantime, players say they're adapting, and “trying to recover as much as possible,” Vitinha said. “Because at this point in the season, it can be decisive."

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. — There's a possibility Real Madrid will begin the FIFA Club World Cup without its biggest star.

French World Cup champion Kylian Mbappé did not practice with his teammates n Tuesday because of a fever, a Real Madrid spokesman told USA TODAY Sports.

New Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso will have a press conference Tuesday afternoon, and will likely address Mbappe's condition before the club's opener in the tournament.

Real Madrid will play against Saudi Arabian standouts Al Hilal at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Wednesday at 3 p.m. ET.

Mbappe is undoubtedly the biggest star in the Club World Cup field outside of Argentine World Cup champion and Inter Miami star Lionel Messi.

If Mbappe is unable to play, Real Madrid will rely on a slew of other stars like Brazilian standouts Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo, English star Jude Bellingham and Croatian Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modrić.

Real Madrid newcomers center back Dean Huijsen (Spain) and right back Trent Alexander-Arnold (England) practiced Tuesday, and could make their club debuts Wednesday.Real Madrid and Al Hilal are in Group H of the Club World Cup with Mexican standouts Pachuca and FC Red Bull Salzburg from Austria.

Kylian Mbappé is now a doubt to play in Real Madrid‘s FIFA Club World Cup opener against Al Hilal, it has emerged.

The Frenchman missed the team‘s final training ahead of Wednesday‘s fixture due to sickness. MARCA report Mbappé has come down with a fever and remained at the team hotel while Xabi Alonso worked with his new squad in the Miami heat.

Real Madrid are carefully monitoring Mbappé‘s condition and do not want the forward “overexerted”, especially given the warm weather in Florida. The club will reassess his condition in the hours leading up to its match against Al Hilal and make a decision then.

It goes without saying that losing Mbappé would be a huge blow for Real Madrid. The France captain led the team in scoring last season, bagging 43 goals across all competitions. He also took home the Pichichi Trophy and the European Golden Boot in his debut campaign in a white shirt. 

Without Mbappé or the injured Endrick, Alonso could be forced to manage his first match in charge of the biggest club in the world without a striker.

The good news for the new boss and Real Madrid is that Mbappé is not dealing with an injury, and therefore should not be out of the action for too long. Even if he is unable to feature in Los Blancos‘ opening match of the FIFA Club World Cup, he will likely be fully recovered from his sickness in time for the team's fixture against Pachuca on Sunday, June 22.

USA Soccer legends Alexi Lalas and Aly Wagner speaks after Volkswagen announced a partnership with USA Soccer at the 2019 North American International Auto Show at Cobo Center in Downtown Detroit Monday, Jan. 14, 2019. Tanya Moutzalias | MLive.com

Every few years, ex-U.S. soccer star Alexi Lalas, 55 — who attended Rutgers from 1988-91 — scapegoats diversity for the team's recent struggles despite teams like France, that won the 2018 World Cup with a roster comprised of players of different ethnicities and backgrounds, proving him wrong.

Club World Cup

FIFA has decided not to show any videos, signage or marketing assets in venues hosting the Club World Cup in the United States which explicitly mention challenging racism or discrimination.

According to multiple sources briefed on FIFA's planning for the tournament, the world football governing body did develop promotional materials in the months leading up to the tournament for their “no racism” and “no discrimination” campaign but it has not been visible during the opening round of fixtures at the tournament in stadiums or on social media platforms.

This approach represents a significant change from previous competitions, such as the Women's World Cup in 2023 in Australia and New Zealand and the men's World Cup in 2022 in Qatar when messages were shown in the stadium on big screens and on social media.

FIFA has also not performed any announcements within its stadiums explaining the anti-racism protocols or the organisation's “universal anti-racism gesture” which was rolled out in September last year and was supposed to be applied to all competitions.

FIFA did not respond when asked if it consulted competing clubs in the Club World Cup over its strategy on these matters.

The reasons for FIFA's apparent change of policy are not known. Earlier this year, the NFL Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles marked the first time since February 2021 that “End Racism” was not included as a message in the back of a Super Bowl end zone. This was widely interpreted as a nod to the current climate in the U.S. where many corporations and institutions are abandoning their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

FIFA's President Gianni Infantino has developed a close bond with President Donald Trump's administration, even attending a Trump pre-inauguration rally, the inauguration itself and visiting the White House. FIFA did not respond when asked if the current political climate in the U.S. played any part in their decision. They did point to their statutes, which say “FIFA remain neutral in matters of politics.”

At the Women's World Cup in 2023, FIFA also rolled out a series of social causes, with armbands at the Women's World Cup such as “Unite for Inclusion” and “Unite for Indigenous Peoples”, “Unite for Gender Equality”, “Unite for Peace”, “Unite for Education for All”, “Unite for Zero Hunger”, “Unite for Ending Violence Against Women” and “Football is Joy, Peace, Love, Hope & Passion”. These messages were visible on captain's armbands, as well as being shared on LED advertising boards around the stadium. They were also present on giant screens and on flags.

In Qatar, FIFA blocked a small number of European nations from wearing a ‘OneLove' armband, which was perceived to be challenging homophobia in a country that criminalises same-sex relations, but FIFA's own campaigns during the tournament included the following slogans: No Discrimination, Save the Planet, Protect Children, End Hunger, Education for All and Be Active.

At this tournament, the only visible signs have been the non specific “Football Unites the World” slogan, which has been present on captain's armbands, and a Dance Cam, partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO), which includes the strapline “Be Active.” FIFA have maintained their partnership with the WHO but President Trump has signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the organisation.

There has been no Twitter messaging at all on the official FIFA Club World Cup account about FIFA's no discrimination or no racism campaigns.

FIFA have been asked whether the World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada in 2026, will include messaging about its anti-discrimination and anti-racism campaigns but they did not answer the question.

Only last month, FIFA President Infantino urged policy makers and legislators globally to join FIFA in the fight against racism and discrimination by imposing criminal penalties on offenders, claiming FIFA cannot win the battle alone.

He said: “FIFA's Global Stand Against Racism called for the football world to take action, to educate, to raise awareness and, when necessary, to punish,” he said.

“Racism and discrimination — they are not just wrong, they are crimes.”

In a statement to The Athletic, FIFA did not explain why they have reduced their in-tournament messaging for this competition in the United States.

A FIFA spokesperson said: “FIFA has a firm, zero-tolerance stance against all forms of discrimination and racism. This commitment was recently reinforced through the unanimous approval by the FIFA Council of the revised FIFA Disciplinary Code, which introduces new measures to fight racist abuse — including increased minimum bans for racist incidents and enhanced financial penalties as duly informed to the 75th FIFA Congress in Asuncion in May 2025.”

They also said their three-step anti-discrimination procedure is in effect should incidents occur, while also saying a social media protection service is available to players and match officials, which helps hide abuse from their social media channels.

The FIFA Club World Cup is underway as 32 teams from across the globe battle it out in the U.S. in the new-look tournament.

Revamped to mimic that of a World Cup, the financially lucrative tournament in its new format features the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Juventus, Bayern Munich and more. Major League Soccer is also represented with Inter Miami, LAFC and the Seattle Sounders. Some of the top stars in the sport fight for the honor of not only lifting the trophy, but winning top scorer honors.

Check out the top Club World Cup scorers from this year's event and a look at the all-time top scorers in the competition's history. Though, given the format, the history books could change quite a lot come the trophy lift in July.

Bayern's 10–0 trouncing of Auckland City in the group stage puts Jamal Musiala well in the conversation for top scoring honors. Vincent Kompany's Bundesliga champions are a favorite to go deep in the competition given the talent available. 

The likes of Kylian Mbappé, Erling Haaland and others should also challenge heavily for the award. Harry Kane surprisingly wasn't on the scoresheet against Auckland City, though he remains one of the most prolific scorers in the world. 

There's been early success for South American sides at the tournament, and Botafogo's Igor Jesus may be an outside contender for Golden Boot honours should his team enjoy a deep run. Miguel Merentiel has also been in fine form for Boca Juniors in 2025, and he netted their opening goal of the Club World Cup in a chaotic 2–2 with Benfica. 

Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea won to nil on Matchday 1, although their respective 4–0 and 2–0 triumphs boasted no multi-scorers.

Luis Suárez is also tied with Lionel Messi and César Delgado as well with five goals scored for Barcelona. 

Given the revamped tournament format, it's not out of the realm of possibility that someone this year takes the mantle from Cristiano Ronaldo. Jamal Musiala stands a real shot if he keeps up his scoring ways after putting three past Auckland City. The only players inside the top six competing in this year's tournament are Messi and Suárez. Benzema and Ronaldo did not qualify for the tournament while Bale and Delgado are both retired.

FIFA claimed the Club World Cup would change football ‘for the better', but the tournament has endured an underwhelming start.

When the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 opened on Saturday, Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest footballer, weaved his magic on the field as a cluster of former stars – David Beckham, Ronaldo, Kaka, Bebeto, Roberto Baggio and Javier Zanetti – watched on from their VIP seats at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

While Messi was unable to score any goals in Inter Miami's 0-0 draw against Egyptian club Al Ahly, football fans turned up in their thousands to watch the Argentinian lead his team in what could have been a goal-fest for the home side.

The organisers, led by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, appeared pleased with the tournament opener and would have hoped for the goals, spectators and popularity to increase as the Club World Cup progressed.

Infantino has treated the tournament as his personal project and aimed to bring the biggest names in football to the United States, one of the co-hosts for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

From the unusual last-minute addition of Messi's Inter Miami to the main draw, to his attempts at luring Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo to sign for a participating club and increasing the winner's prize money by a whopping $35m, the FIFA chief has pulled out all the stops to support his grand proclamation that the Club World Cup is “the start of something historic that will change our sport for the better”.

However, three days in, the tournament, billed by FIFA as the most elite global club competition, has failed to match the hype created by the sport's governing body.

Here's what's gone wrong with the Club World Cup thus far:

Kickoffs scheduled at noon and 3pm local time on scorching hot summer days have led to players dealing with difficult conditions. Some of these teams have finished full league and cup competition seasons in their respective countries and confederations.

Others – from the US, South America and Oceania – have hit pause on their regular seasons and will return to their respective leagues after the Club World Cup.

The tournament has been subject to criticism from regional football bodies and players' unions long before the first kick of the opening game.

“The decision today to schedule the FIFA Club World Cup between June 15 and July 13 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives,” players' union FIFPRO said in a statement when the tournament schedule was released in 2024.

“The extreme mental and physical pressures at the pinnacle of the game is the principal concern of players with multiple club and national team competitions, leading to exhaustion, physical injuries, mental health issues, diminished performance, and risks to career longevity,” the statement added.

FIFPRO called for the consideration of player health and safety regulations as a “matter of urgency” but that failed to deter FIFA from tinkering with the schedule.

Auckland City, a club made up of amateur players with full-time day jobs, opened their campaign against six-time European champions Bayern Munich and were handed a 10-0 thumping.

The 34-time German champions, fielding a full-strength team, scored four goals in the first 21 minutes of the game in front of a hapless Auckland defence.

Add to it the fact that the fixture seemed more of a practice outing than a challenge for the Bundesliga side, with Bayern coach Vincent Kompany saying: “The next game against Boca Juniors will be the highlight of the group stage.”

While minnows and favourites are often pitted together in global tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, Oceania champions Auckland will also face Argentinian powerhouse Boca Juniors and Portuguese side Benfica in an incredibly tough draw for the team from New Zealand.

It seems unfair for the team rated 4,957th in the world in the Opta Power Rankings to take on opponents ranked sixth (Bayern Munich), 24th (Benfica) and 131st (Boca Juniors).

While Messi-mania brought the crowds in the tournament opener in Miami on June 14, and European champions PSG thrashed Atletico Madrid in front of 80,000 Los Angeles fans at the famous Rose Bowl a day later, the same cannot be said for some of the other fixtures.

Monday's Chelsea vs LAFC encounter at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta was played out in front of less than one-third of the stadium's capacity.

The US-based side are often able to draw close to full-capacity crowds at their home venue in Los Angeles, and Chelsea rarely play in front of so many empty seats, whether at home or away.

The stark contrast from the fervent fan support at their Stamford Bridge home in London prompted Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca to say the atmosphere in Atlanta was “a bit strange.”

The 71,000-capacity venue saw the 3pm kickoff match play out in front of 22,137 spectators.

“I think the environment was a bit strange,” Maresca said after the game.

Of the remaining 36 group-stage games, 13 will be afternoon kickoffs on a weekday and the low ticket sales for the first phase of the tournament could mean that organisers will struggle to fill up the venues.

Strict security measures, which include the presence of border patrol officials and presenting passports as proof of identity, may also deter fans from thronging the venues.

TOPICS:

In the weeks leading up to this summer's Gold Cup, storylines around U.S. Soccer have been dominated by the team's star player, Christian Pulisic, opting to sit out the tournament in favor of resting and recuperating for the season ahead.  Last week, on the Call it What You Want podcast, Pulisic elaborated on his decision saying that he had offered to participate in the team's two pre-tournament friendlies against Türkiye and Switzerland, a decision which U.S. Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino rejected.  Pulisic said that he “didn't understand” Pochettino's rejection prompting Pochettino to respond by saying "Players need to listen and to stick with our plan.  They cannot dictate the plan.”



On the latest episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, the two former American soccer stars shared their thoughts on the brewing controversy with Donovan looking at the situation from the manager's perspective.  “In [Pochettino's] mind, he must think this is absolutely crazy,” Donovan said. “He probably literally cannot believe some of the stuff he's reading and hearing.  He's the coach. He will tell you if you're getting called in, when you're getting called in, if you're playing. You don't decide which games you get to choose to play for your national teams. That's what [Pochettino's] saying.”

Howard believes that this incident is indicative of a cultural shift within U.S. Soccer towards players holding more control, a shift that Pochettino could be trying to reverse.  “Pochettino has walked into that,” said Howard.  “And what he's trying to do now is regain some of that power. And I think he was doing that in a quiet way until he was called out in the Christian Pulisic interview. And now I think for the first time, you know, U.S. Soccer, has a bit of an issue. They have an issue because, you know, Pochettino, who's the manager and is getting paid $6 million a year and is a big manager and his star player now are seemingly at odds.”

Following their 4-0 defeat on June 10th against Switzerland, the U.S. Men's National Team had lost four consecutive matches for the first time since 2007, a streak which they snapped on Sunday with their emphatic 5-0 Gold Cup opening win against Trinidad & Tobago.  While the win may have helped to temporarily settle a tense situation, Howard says that current national team players should not expect blind support from former national team players.

“I've heard from people on the inside, friends of ours on the inside of U.S. Soccer, and there's this feeling going around that they should be supporting us. ‘They' [meaning] you [Landon Donovan] and I, other folks on the outside, should be supporting [the team].  U.S. Soccer and the players within U.S. Soccer want a free pass for being average. You don't get a free pass for being average.”

The Americans next Gold Cup match comes Thursday night against Saudi Arabia at the Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas.

Xabi Alonso will take charge of his first Real Madrid game, and it's straight into the fire as a competitive one. Los Blancos will take on Al-Hilal in their first group-stage game of the Club World Cup.

The Spaniard has new signings Dean Huijsen and Trent Alexander-Arnold to choose from, as well as players returning from long-term injuries. Defenders Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao are available, but are they ready to start after missing 6-8 months of the 2024-25 season?

🔵⚔️🟢 pic.twitter.com/pqKGTnKodg

Alonso has had time to address who could start the first game, with a good performance vital. Here is the predicted lineup for the match against Al-Hilal.

GK: Thibault Courtois - The Belgium stopper is a guaranteed starter if he is fit, with Alonso putting out his strongest team available.

RB: Trent Alexander-Arnold - The former Liverpool man could be in line to make his debut, with Dani Carvajal just recently back from injury. 

CB: Antonio Rudiger - The veteran center-back will likely partner one of the younger players, with Eder Militao likely not yet ready to start.

CB: Dean Huijsen - The second signing, Huijsen, could also make his debut, but Raul Asencio is also available. Both could play if Alonso believes Rudiger has not fully recovered from his injury.

LB: Fran Garcia - The left-back situation is unclear at the club under Alonso, but Garcia could be the starter for this game, having played the final games of last season.

CDM: Aurélien Tchouaméni - The Frenchman played a lot at center-back at the end of last season but should revert to his original position in midfield.

CDM: Federico Valverde - Valverde also played a lot out of position during the final months of the season, but he is one of the best at his position, center midfielder.

RM: Arda Guler - The young Turkish player capitalized on the injury to Rodrgyo in the final three games, playing exceptionally well. The Brazilian is back, but Guler could still start in front of him.

CM: Jude Bellingham - Bellingham hasn't been in great form over the last few games, but a new chapter under Alonso may help find his feet again.

LM: Vinicius Jr. - The Brazilian has put in the air miles recently with his national team but looks in good form, so he should start.

ST: Kylian Mbappé - The European Golden Boot winner will hope his goalscoring form continues in the tournament and that he has the opportunity to be the top scorer in this tournament.

Hayes gives players ‘much-needed' rest

Just months into the job, head coach Emma Hayes pushed the U.S. women's national team nearly to the brink at the Olympics — she even referenced the ultramarathon ideology of the “pain cave.” But like any good leader, Hayes understands balance. This year she's giving key players a “much-needed break.”

Advertisement

Roughly 10 days out from the next USWNT camp, we are still waiting for the roster. But Hayes revealed in an interview with ESPN that she plans to give the Europe-based players the next summer window off. This includes two games against Ireland in Denver and Cincinnati next week and one versus Canada in Washington, D.C., on July 2.

With the 2027 World Cup in Brazil two years away and her core group starting to take shape, Hayes said that “player welfare” and “rest and recovery” are important, especially considering number of games played, the length of seasons and the frequency of games since the 2023 World Cup. The camp will help key players returning from injury, too.

📺 Hayes has handed out nearly two dozen first-time call-ups already. Watch former USWNT midfielder Sam Mewis share who she thinks should be next.

A tale of 2 teams

I won't reference the U.S. men often in this newsletter, but I think there is too stark of a juxtaposition between the teams right now not to. (And with Midge Purce pointing out the drama, it only felt right.) For those who don't know, here's what the men have been up to:

The situations aren't identical, and we won't know if Hayes' approach will pay off until 2027, but it does appear she's getting ahead of any future tension by considering her players' workload before competitive matches pick back up.

US Women's million-dollar goal scorer

Evelyn Shores was still jetlagged from her trip to Germany when she scored the goal worth $1 million for the US Women at The Soccer Tournament last week.

The 20-year-old Atlanta native had a breakout year after consecutive injuries sidelined her during her senior year of high school and freshman season at UNC — the school she'd dreamed of attending since eighth grade.

 

 

A post shared by TST (@tst7v7)



Unfortunately for Shores, NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes from accepting prize money. However, she wasn't in it for that.

“Playing one-v-one in practice with Carli Lloyd the day after flying in from Germany? That was insane,” she told Asli. “They made us feel like equals. That was the craziest part.”

Could she be the next U.S. player called into the senior team?

The less said about Angel City's last-gasp loss at home to the North Carolina Courage the better for Angel City fans. However, the events happening off the pitch at BMO Stadium went beyond soccer this weekend and took center stage in the NWSL, following a week of immigration raids and resulting protests in Los Angeles.

The club distributed 10,000 T-shirts reading “Immigrant City Football Club” and “Los Angeles is for everyone / Los Ángeles es para todos” to players, staff, supporters and fans. They are also available in their online shop, with net proceeds going to a local legal service for immigrants.

“The fabric of this city is made of immigrants. Football does not exist without immigrants. This club does not exist without immigrants,” Angel City wrote on a message card handed out on Saturday night. Founding investor and recording artist Becky G also read it out before the match.

It was an affirmative, if not outright earnest, reply from Angel City as a club and as a part of the Los Angeles community to the fear and uncertainty stemming from the week's events. The NWSLPA also released a joint statement with the WNBA players association, and Chicago Stars FC pointed to local resources in a brief statement.

The league itself has yet to address the topic, however, even if it was clear how the NWSL community as a whole appreciated Angel City's willingness to step up and meet the moment.

Lyonnes in talks with USWNT teen star

Lily the Lyonne might have to become a thing.

Ajax and USWNT midfielder Lily Yohannes, who recently celebrated her 18th birthday, may soon be the latest signing of OL Lyonnes, joining French striker Marie Antoinette Katoto and incoming head coach Jonathan Giráldez, making the eight-time Champions League title holders look even more ferocious next season.

Last week, Tamerra reported that Ajax, where Yohannes signed her first professional contract, and the French powerhouse were in talks over a potential summer transfer, introducing a bit of a plot twist to the recent reports that the Springfield, Va., native might be headed to Chelsea. A source said Ajax's talks are currently focused on OL Lyonnes, though nothing has been signed yet. Trust and believe Chelsea fans will be processing this as a loss if the deal goes through.

World Cup 2031 check-in

With all this talk about the men's World Cup next year, we asked Asli to get the lowdown on the women's tournament the U.S. is hosting alongside Mexico in 2031.

U.S. Soccer kicked off its city selection process last month. Twenty-nine cities, including 11 cities that will host the 2026 men's World Cup, received the information packets. The list is not exclusive, meaning if another city wants to throw its hat in the ring, it can. But time is running short. The deadline to submit detailed proposals is September, and formal bids must be submitted to FIFA at the end of November, according to sources. 

The timing is notable: 2026 host cities haven't even had a chance to evaluate the full impact of hosting the men's tournament before committing to 2031. That's a big risk given that economic, logistical and reputational risks can be significant. They'll need to secure additional funding and make sure FIFA's infrastructure demands have been taken care of.

Inaugural champions: The other Division I league in the U.S., the USL Super League, wrapped its first season Saturday with a 1-0 championship victory for the Tampa Bay Sun over Fort Lauderdale United. Captain Jordyn Listro joined “Full Time” to talk about the special win.

Scary situation: I was horrified to read about Seattle Reign forward Jordyn Huitema's experience with a high-profile home invasion and moved by the trust and care with which Susie Rantz told her story: “She had broken her back the year before, and as she sat behind the door, she made peace with the idea that if she had to break it again to keep the door shut, she would.”

Before we go … check out who joined Meg at the Vermont Green women's exhibition games last week. (Spoiler: It's fellow Vermonter, Ilona Maher, Olympic bronze medalist in Rugby Sevens.)

The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team will host its first-ever College Talent ID Camp, and a handful of local players received an invitation.

Presley Freeman (BYU), Abby Sine (BYU), Lucy Kesler (BYU midfielder), Kunie Hirai (Utah State), and Austin Miller (Utah State) were the locals to be invited.

Forty-two players have been called up to a first-of-its-kind Women's College Talent ID Camp taking place in June.

Freeman is a sophomore defender from Atlanta, Georgia. In high school, she was named the Georgia Gatorade Player of the Year, Region 7A Player of the Year, and helped lead her school to the 2024 7A GHSA State Championship.

In her freshman year with the Cougars, Freeman played 1,658 minutes and logged two assists and five shots.

Sine is a sophomore defender from Coppell, Texas. Coming out of high school, she was a four-star recruit and ranked as the No. 2 prospect in the state of Texas by PrepSoccer.

In 2024, Sine played in nine games and had one shot attempt.

Kesler is a sophomore midfielder from American Fork, Utah. As a three-time varsity starter at American Fork High School, she was named to to the Deseret News First Team All-State, the Deseret News offensive MVP, and was also a 2024 6A American Fork State Champion finalist.

In her freshman campaign, Kesler played in 19 games with 12 starts and 1,335 minutes on the pitch. She finished the year with one goal, three assists, and 19 total shots. Those stats earned her a spot on the All-Big 12 All-Freshman Team.

Hirai is a freshman forward from Boise, Idaho. She was a four-year letterwinner at Boise High School and helped lead the team to a 2022 state championship. In each of the other three years, Boise was the runner-up in the 5A division.

Miller is a sophomore forward from Providence, Utah. She was a first-team all-state and all-region player in 2021 and 2022 and helped lead the Green Canyon Wolves to their first-ever state championship in 2023.

In her freshman year with the Aggies, Miller played in all 24 games, recorded four goals and five assists, and was put on the Mountain West All-Newcomer team.

According to a press release, 42 players from 28 different colleges will head to Atlanta from June 18 to 22.

The camp's purpose is to “increase programming opportunities for college-specific players and expand the U.S. Under-18, Under-19 and Under-20 Women's National Team player pools.”

Nicole Lukic, U.S. Soccer's Director of Talent ID for women and girls, said that the idea of the camp originally came up in January meetings.

“The project initially arose from the January WNT Way meetings, where we held interactive workshops and brainstorming with all departments, to look at everything we do through a female-specific lens,” Lukic said. “When looking at player scouting through a female-specific lens, our Women's Talent ID team recognized an opportunity to adapt our strategy to continue to expand our player pools in the older age groups.”

Lukic went on to say that the program felt it was a good time to “further develop our female-specific scouting strategy, dive deeper into our data and analysis of scouting pathways, and create this unique camp opportunity.”

BYU and Michigan State are the schools with the most players invited with three each.

Man given restraining order in Dubai on ticket waiting list

All England Club employ fixated threat specialists

Emma Raducanu's stalker has been blocked from buying tickets for this month's Wimbledon Championships in the public ballot, it has emerged.

Security staff at the All England Club discovered that the man, who has never been named, was on the waiting list when they did a re-sweep of the ballot, after he was given a restraining order in Dubai in February.

The authorities in Dubai acted after the British No 1 was forced to hide in tears behind the umpire's chair when the “fixated” admirer was removed from the stands and detained by police during her second-round match against Karolina Muchova.

The previous day the man had given Raducanu a letter and asked for a photograph in a coffee shop. The 22-year-old had also been aware of his presence at tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha in preceding weeks.

Speaking after the incident, Raducanu told reporters: “I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, ‘I don't know how I'm going to finish'. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, ‘I need to just take a breather.' I'm always with someone and always being watched.”

Raducanu, who shot to global fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021, said that her behaviour had changed since the incident in Dubai.

“I'm obviously wary when I go out,” she said. “I try not to be careless about it because you only realise how much of a problem it is when you're in that situation and I don't necessarily want to be in that situation again.”

Raducanu has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home.

On Tuesday, Britain's No 2, Katie Boulter, said that she had received abuse and death threats on social media and had been followed around London by an unknown vehicle.

Sally Bolton, chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, said that security measures would be tight at Wimbledon this year.

“We're liaising with the tours, with the Met Police, with other security agencies right through the year to think about the types of risks we need to look at and adjusting what we put in place,” she said.

“I would say to them [players] they should have confidence when they're here and if they are concerned on any basis they should come and talk to us about that because we can put bespoke arrangements in place.”

Wimbledon will also have police and military personnel in the grounds, as well a team of fixated threat specialists

Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning champion at Roland Garros, is gearing up for his next challenge on the ATP circuit: Wimbledon. Alcaraz aims to defend his title in the UK and is determined to succeed in this prestigious tournament. He seeks to join the elite group of players who have captured two or more Grand Slam titles in the same calendar year. Additionally, he has his sights set on the US Open, marking the season's final Grand Slam event.

After securing his first victory at the Queen's Club Championships on Tuesday, Alcaraz reflected on the recent announcement from the US Open organizers. The organization revealed on social media that they would feature mixed doubles teams comprising top-ranked male and female players.

In preparation for August's main event, the US Open has paired one man and one woman per team, promising thrilling mixed doubles action with a grand prize of $1 million for the victors. Alcaraz expressed his excitement over the announcement and shared his thoughts on his partner for this special event.

Alcaraz is set to partner with Emma Raducanu, a player eager to make a strong comeback in the upcoming tournaments. “She's going to be the boss,” Alcaraz said with a smile. “The US Open approached us with the opportunity to play mixed doubles, and I'm super excited about it. I think it's going to be a fantastic addition to the tournament.“ Alcaraz shared. 

Alcaraz expressed his excitement about competing in the tournament alongside Raducanu, even making a surprising request to the US Open organizers. During his discussion, he highlighted Raducanu's impressive form on the WTA circuit.

“I've known Emma for a long time; we have a really good relationship,” Alcaraz remarked after his first victory at the Queen's tournament. “It's just going to be interesting.”

Alcaraz continued, “The organizers mentioned the mixed doubles, and I thought I couldn't have a better partner than Emma. So, I asked her if she wanted to play doubles with me. Yes, that was my special request.“

Alcaraz also shared Raducanu's reaction to his unexpected invitation, showcasing the strong friendship they maintain off the court. “She took a little while,” Alcaraz said with a chuckle. “Well, not too long. Of course, she had to think and ask around a bit, but it didn't take a minute,” he explained about Raducanu's response to his offer.

The All England Club's security system highlighted the man's name as red-flagged and blocked his attempt to enter the public ballot; follow scores and reports and watch action from the ATP and WTA on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Tuesday 17 June 2025 19:29, UK

A man who was given a restraining order for stalking Emma Raducanu has been caught trying to apply for Wimbledon tickets.

The All England Club's security system highlighted the man's name as one that had been red-flagged after an incident in Dubai in February that left the British tennis star in tears.

His attempt to enter the public ballot was blocked.

Raducanu revealed she "couldn't see the ball through tears" and could "barely breathe" during the stalking ordeal that took place at the Dubai Open.

The 22-year-old approached the umpire's chair in tears just two games into her defeat to Karolina Muchova after receiving repeated unwanted attention from a "fixated" man before and during the second-round match.

Raducanu disclosed she had previously been approached twice by the man off-court.

The man, who was removed from the stands, was subsequently given a restraining order by Dubai police and his name was circulated around tennis authorities.

Raducanu opted not to press charges but the individual has been banned from future tournaments.

"I was obviously very distraught," Raducanu said at the time. "I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to finish. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe.

"I was like, I need to just take a breather here."

Speaking to BBC Sport a month on from the incident in Dubai, Raducanu said that she is happy with the level of protection she is now receiving, saying: "[It] could have been dealt with better. Since that incident I have definitely got increased attention and greater security.

"All we can do is look at what happened and react to it in a better way, in a more positive way, rather than looking back and blaming the situation. Now it is being dealt with better, so for me that's important.

"I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I'm always with someone and always being watched."

Emma Raducanu spotted the man in the crowd in Dubai before he was removed from the court

The man who was given a restraining order for stalking British tennis player Emma Raducanu earlier this year has been caught trying to apply for tickets for this month's Wimbledon Championships.

BBC Sport can reveal the All England Club's security system highlighted the man's name had been red-flagged, and blocked his attempt to enter the public ballot.

British number one Raducanu was left in tears after seeing a man who had followed her to four successive tournaments in the stands during a match at the Dubai Tennis Championships in February.

The man, who was removed, had given Raducanu, 22, a letter and asked for a photo in a coffee shop the previous day.

He was given a restraining order by Dubai police and his name was circulated around tennis authorities.

Raducanu was approached by the man near the player hotel in Dubai the day before her second-round match with Karolina Muchova.

He gave her a letter and took her photo, which unnerved Raducanu, who had been aware of his presence at tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha in preceding weeks.

Although she reported it to a member of her team, the information was not passed on to the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) or the tournament until the following day.

The Briton hid behind the umpire's chair two games into her defeat when she spotted him in the crowd.

The man who "exhibited fixated behaviour" was removed from the stands and detained by local police.

Speaking after the incident, Raducanu told reporters: "I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, 'I don't know how I'm going to finish'.

"I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe.

"I was like, 'I need to just take a breather'."



Raducanu shot to worldwide fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021.

She told BBC Sport soon after the incident in Dubai that it "could have been dealt with better" but that lessons have been learned.

"Since that incident I have definitely got increased attention and greater security," the 22-year-old said.

"I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more.

"I'm always with someone and always being watched."

Raducanu has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home.

Sally Bolton, chief executive of All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) said they spend a lot of time on ensuring security measures are tight at Wimbledon.

"We're liaising with the tours, with the Met Police, with other security agencies right through the year to think about the types of risks we need to look at and adjusting what we put in place.

"I would say to them [players] they should have confidence when they're here and if they are concerned on any basis they should come and talk to us about that because we can put bespoke arrangements in place."

While Wimbledon bosses have confidence in their security provisions, which are reviewed annually, the issue has come into sharper focus this year.

It is estimated that around 1,000 people work in the field of security to some extent across the Championships.

In addition to the screening around the ballot, there are also more checks and balances when it comes to those in the queue.

Anyone gaining entry to the Championships that way will have to be registered with Wimbledon - meaning they've had to provide personal information.

In the grounds, as well as police and military personnel, there are other discreet members of the security team.

A team of fixated threat specialists are hired in and can assist the player escort team.

There are also behavioural experts who are trained to spot people acting strangely.

There is significant CCTV coverage on site, and if there are concerns around a particular player then a specific CCTV sweep will be done of the seats near to the player and their box.

On court, protection officers are positioned near the players, with more on Centre Court and No.1 Court.

If something spontaneous happens on site, there are response teams walking round the grounds who can come and support staff.

Security teams are also in regular contact with the referees' office to discuss issues like scheduling.

Jack Draper began his pursuit of grass-court glory with a dominant victory over Jensen Brooksby, claiming 10 of the last 11 games in a performance that had the Queen's faithful gasping at his best shots.

This is Draper's first summer as the undisputed main man of British tennis, following Andy Murray's retirement last year, but he showed little sign of feeling burdened by expectation.

Well, actually, Draper might have been a little tight early on. In the opening game or three, he responded slowly to Brooksby's 110mph first serves – which are milk floats by the super-powered standards of the modern tour – and snatched at forehands too early in rallies.

But as soon as Draper became used to Brooksby's conservative positional tennis, and realised that there were no big surprises here to ambush him, he relaxed and began to show his class. Winner after winner zipped off the baseline and slammed into the backboard as Draper dashed to a 6-3, 6-1 victory in only 77 minutes.

After the match, Draper was asked about his new role as the British tennis figurehead. “Does it enter my mind that I'm highly ranked and that I am probably in that position? Of course. Like anyone would do, I feel that a little bit. But I also take it in my stride.

“Since I was a young guy, I have always wanted to be at the top of the game, and I knew eventually that [expectation] would come with it. I feel confident, happy. I feel this is exactly where I want to be, regardless of any external noise.” 

If Draper remains a well-kept secret within British sport, despite his recent ascent to the heady heights of No 6 in the world rankings, that is probably because he has never made a deep run at Wimbledon.

Drawn against defending champion Novak Djokovic on his SW19 debut in 2021, Draper lost to Alex de Minaur in the second round a year later, then missed 2023 entirely with a nasty shoulder injury.

He should have done better than another second-round exit last summer, but then came up against a regular practice partner in Cameron Norrie – a fellow British left-hander who knew his game inside out.

Despite this indifferent Wimbledon record of two wins from five outings to date, Draper has improved so much in the past year that the bookies are listing him as fourth favourite to lift this summer's title. Only the new Big Two of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, plus seven-time champion Novak Djokovic, stand ahead of him on the list.

Tuesday delivered the ideal start to Draper's campaign. Beneath a burning sun and a full set of stands, the support may have been warm rather than vociferous. But then Queen's is an old-fashioned venue with a famously polite crowd. The well-heeled denizens of Baron's Court, west London, tend to murmur rather than scream.

Brooksby – a 24-year-old from California – made for an unconventional opponent. His serve is particularly unusual, starting with him holding his racket behind his left shoulder like a bather with an oversized backscratcher.

Off the court, Brooksby has a fascinating story. Diagnosed with severe autism as a small child, he was non-verbal until the age of four. But an intensive programme of therapy helped him develop coping skills, and the woman who oversaw that programme – Michelle Wagner – recently said that he had shifted to the “mild end of the spectrum”, calling this an “unusual and unique outcome”.

Draper will be back on the Andy Murray Arena on Wednesday, facing an opponent who could not be more different to the understated Brooksby. Alexei Popyrin, a rangy and raw-boned Australian, won last year's Canadian Open in Montreal with his dynamic, first-strike game. His serve has been clocked at over 150mph, which puts him in the outside lane of the tennis autobahn.

Here is a high early hurdle for Draper, but he might as well get used to it, because this Queen's field is stacked with quality. He needs to reach at least the semi-finals to give himself a shot at a top-four seeding for Wimbledon, and thus protect himself from a possible quarter-final showdown with one of Alcaraz or Sinner.

Asked whether he had consulted former British flag-bearers such as Murray or Tim Henman, Draper said that – to date – he had not felt the need.

“I know I have got both of their support,” Draper replied. “They've done an incredible job over the years of being the leading British player [but] everyone deals with things a bit differently.

“To play at home, that helps. I remember Andy always saying that it's obviously more pressure, but at the same time you've got the crowd with you, you have your people around. I'm happy to be home. I feel confident. Everything is good and I'm lucky that I've got those guys to lean on if I need it.”

Carlos Alcaraz ensured that, however, he spent the days after his Roland Garros epic against Jannik Sinner, there would be no upset at the start of the grass court season, with a straight sets win over lucky loser Adam Walton.

Having reacted to winning in Paris with an annual tradition excursion to Ibiza, Alcaraz was not faultless against Australian Walton ranked 86th in the world, despite winning 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).

Almost exactly a year ago, Alcaraz arrived at Queen's tired from his break in Ibiza, and his Queen's title defence did not go as planned when he was beaten in under 100 minutes by Jack Draper.

Against Walton, understandably, the tennis was not as smooth as it might have been two weeks ago, and there were a number of baseline exchanges that could have been won earlier.

After four exchanges of serve in the opener, Alcaraz broke. It might have been later than he should have; he had come to the net earlier in the game and missed what could have been a decisive drop shot.

But third time lucky, Alcaraz won the break point, when Walton fired a backhand into the net, with the Spaniard celebrating with a fist pump.

In the second set, Walton's serves might have lacked power but the 110-115mph efforts were well-placed and often wide which left Alcaraz reaching.

At one point trying to race back to get the ball, Alcaraz even tried a ‘tweener' a shot in between the legs to get the ball back over the net, it didn't come off, the shot was too low, but it entertained the mostly full Andy Murray Arena.

This close to one of the Points of the Year 🤏What a point from both players 👏#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/Cxu5TJRagX

Walton had two chances to take the game to a decider, but facing the danger brought out the best of world No. 1 Alcaraz, saving both with an ace and another strong serve.

For Alcaraz, it is very much: first hurdle of the grass court season down, many more to come as he targets a Wimbledon title defence.

... is the winner of Jordan Thompson and Jaume Munar, which is ongoing as we speak. 

I feel at home I feel loved so thank you. First match on grass never easy to get used to the competition, get used to the grass.

He has played a few matches already on grass so I think he's more experienced this year on grass. I'm really happy with the performance today, I feel great, a lot of things to improve and a lot of things to work on to feel more comfortable but in general I'm happy to get through.

Winning is a habit 🙌@carlosalcaraz wins his first match since his epic Roland-Garros final 6-4 7-6 over Walton!#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/md5Jkrm1lz

Walton return long, 4-3. Walton second serve but Alcaraz nets a forehand return, 4-4. Cat and mouse rally, Walton doesn't do enough with his volley and Alcaraz punishes him with a volley down the line, 5-4.

Walton backhand into the net, 6-4. Two match points...

Alcaraz gets Walton on the run, opens up the court and flicks a forehand winner into the space, 7-4.

GAME SET MATCH ALCARAZ!!!!

Alcaraz backhand into the net, 0-1. Alcaraz drop shot winner, 1-1. First serve into the body unreturned by Walton, 2-1. Wild forehand long by Alcaraz, 2-2. Alcaraz return into the net, 2-3. Walton return flies long, 3-3.

Facing those two set points seems to have sparked Alcaraz into life. 

On his next service game, he plays two exquisite drop shots including a feint, that Walton can only watch.

Into a tie-break we go as Alcaraz holds with an exquisite half volley winner. Shades of Roger Federer with that touch.

Courtside with Carlitos 🤩@QueensTennis | #HSBCChampionships | @carlosalcaraz pic.twitter.com/FYnOayOS2N

Problems for Walton after his backhand sits up nicely for Alcaraz to drill a backhand winner down the line, 15-30. Much needed first serve for Walton is unreturned, 30-30. 

Frustration for Alcaraz as he makes a surprising error on his backhand, pushing the ball long, 40-30. Walton books himself a tie-break when Alcaraz slices a defensive forehand into the net.

Loss of focus from Alcaraz as a third double fault of the match makes it 15-30. Deep return by Walton and Alcaraz nets, two set points for Walton. 

Alcaraz goes to his tried and trusty wide first serve, which is unreturned. Second break point... First serve in from Alcaraz and Walton's return is long. To deuce.

Two more first serves, two more unreturned balls and Alcaraz sees out the danger. Almost felt like Alcaraz wanted to feel a little danger.

You would expect the pressure to hit Walton but not yet. He holds with a blistering forehand winner down the line that catches the outside of the sideline.

Alcaraz will serve to stay in the set next.

WALT a hit 🚀@AdamWalton99 #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/mQXrJRB3yO

So reminiscent of Rafael Nadal when Alcaraz skips to his left to run around his backhand and whip a forehand down the line. It's a beautiful shot to see. 

And he finishes the love game with a deft drop volley winner. He's having fun out there in the sun.

High volley winner by Alcaraz makes it 30-30. Big point coming up. Walton finds his first serve and Alcaraz nets his return. Another backhand into the net by Alcaraz and Walton holds. 

On we go!

When Alcaraz injects more pace to his shots, he continues to earn cheap errors from Walton. Alcaraz holds again as we enter the business end of the set and you can be sure he will want to get a break soon.

Walton is clearly favouring his forehand side, which in turn is leaving him exposed by just how far he has run around the ball to take it on the forehand.

That being said, his serve might lack power by the standards of the majority of those in the top 30 on the tour, but his 110-115mph efforts are well-placed and difficult to return.

Lovely hands by Walton in the forecourt to react to Alcaraz's backhand down the line with an angled half volley winner. Not an easy finish, but he finished that like prime Pat Cash.

Serve continues to be king in this set as Alcaraz holds to love with a trademark forehand winner down the line. The best forehand in men's tennis?

Both players using the serve out wide very effectively to earn cheap points. Another strong hold by Walton to stay in the lead in this set. Can he make any inroads on Alcaraz's serve in this match?

Feels as though Alcaraz is using this as practice. Taking risks on serve, working on his slice and striking the ball early. He completes another service hold routinely.

Good response by Walton to losing the first set by holding here. Very unlikely he will win this match but the level he is showing is far above his current ranking and his game looks well suited to grass.

Alcaraz shakes off the rustiness to bring up two set points at 40-15. And he sees out the set with a second serve ace.

A very controlled and clinical display.

In typical British fashion, there is a strong contingent of support for Walton, the Australian underdog in his first-ever match against Alcaraz.

Alcaraz, on the other han,d has allowed him back into games that he should have wrapped up two or three points earlier. Maybe we are seeing a bit of rustiness in his first match on grass of the season.

Double fault by Walton makes it 0-30. Three first serves in a row rescue the Australian and move him to 40-30. Gorgeous footwork by Alcaraz to run around a Walton slice and blast a forehand winner down the line, deuce. Gasps from the crowd as he hit that.

Deep Alcaraz return and Walton's reply is into the net, set point. Wild forehand by Alcaraz after an extended rally, back to deuce. Blocked return down the line and into the net for a volley winner by Alcaraz, second set point. Walton survives again after Alcaraz nets.

Warm applause for Walton as he holds and asks Alcaraz to serve for the set.

Ferocious Forehand 🔥@carlosalcaraz #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/Pe38dlsnLH

Alcaraz's class is beginning to tell but Walton shows him that he's not going away with a forehand return winner, 30-15. Efficient service hold for Alcaraz completed when a swinging first serve is unreturned.

Refreshment break between the matches is well and truly over and the stands of the Andy Murray Arena are almost as full as they were for home favourite Jack Draper around 40 minutes previously.

Alcaraz has been in decent touch so far in these almost Spanish-like conditions that earlier caused one spectator to faint, leading to a brief pause in Draper's match.

Nice play by Walton to send Alcaraz the wrong way with a cross court flick, 30-15. He then whips a forehand into the corner that Alcaraz gives up running for, 40-15. The Aussie is playing some inspired stuff.

But a couple of errors keep Alcaraz in the game, and then a double fault coughs up a break point for the Spaniard. Relief for Walton as Alcaraz's return drifts long. 

Routine forehand into the net by Walton as Alcaraz ramps up the pressure. Break point. Alcaraz on the attack, Walton scrambles to stay in the point, Alcaraz comes into the net but pushes his volley long. Another chance for Alcaraz to break comes after his forehand return is too good for Walton.

Not enough first serves for Walton to give him cheap points and the pressure finally tells when he nets a backhand. Alcaraz breaks.

Alcaraz is looking equally comfortable on serve so far amd he holds to love with a vintage forehand winner down the line.

Clutch Carlitos combo 🥊Drawing in with the slice, finishing off with the lob 🆙@carlosalcaraz #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/mkJXV4QfLg

Emma Raducanu will team up with French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz in the mixed-doubles at the US Open, with a prize of $1 million for the winners.

The new doubles team – which can expect to be given a portmanteau nickname of either “Alcaranu” or “Raducaraz” – is one of several eye-catching partnerships that will make their debut in New York in August.

Read more here.

Walton is doing everything right at the moment. He is keeping Alcaraz on the move, pushing him left and right and making enough first serves to avoid pressure. A very shapr start for the Australian, who got a late call to play as a lucky loser.

This is the first meeting between the two players. Walton won't have faced a player of his calibre before but she's standing his ground so far and making things awkward for Alcaraz. 

Impressive athleticism by Alcaraz to stretch and hit a backhand overhead smash. Walton gets to the ball and his flick into play drifts wide.

So we join this match at 1-1 after both players held serve to start the match. It will be interesting to see how Alcaraz adapts, in what is his first match since that epic victory at the French Open, earlier this month.

The Spaniard partied in Ibiza last week so hopefully he's recovered and can put on a show. Walton holds here to maintain his lead.

... is top seed and world No 2 Carlos Alcaraz where he meet Australia's Adam Walton.

Feels amazing, no place I'd rather be. We travel the world playing tennis, never get to come home or spend much time with my family but to be on this court in front of you guys, my people, my family, thank you.

It's tricky coming onto the grass after clay, to adapt, I'm hitting the ball a bit late not on time. The more matches and time I have on practice courts I'll get better and better and it's definitely a surface I really enjoy playing on and obviously a win helped as well.

So proud, obviously coming back here a year later is a testament to the hard work from me and my team and all the people who have supported me to be a better player and person. I'm excited to see how I can get on this week I feel excited I feel ready and I want to do my best.

Sealed with an ACE ☄️@jackdraper0 storms through at the #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/AQF6LZhRrk

Draper can just explode on his shots when Brooksby pushes him out wide as he does when he moves out to his forehand and powers a forehand cross court that is too hot for his opponent, 30-15.

Rare serve and volley from Draper but he nets the volley on the stretch, 30-30. First serve unreturned brings up a match point. Boom! Ace down the T and it's GAME SET MATCH DRAPER!!!

Brooksby is caught out by a deep Draper return and flicks his backhand wide to give the Briton a break point. Draper's weight of shot proves too much for Brooksby again, who nets a forehand.

Draper breaks and will serve for the match.

Ever since Draper's opening service games, Brooksby has had little joy and his screams out in anger after another first serve from the Briton is too much for him.

After an eight minute stoppage, play resumes with Brooksby leading 30-0 but Draper gets on the board with a crushing backhand winner down the line. 

Draper continues to be all over the Brooksby second serve and he fires a forehand return winner down the line. Brooksby saves a break point with a much needed first serve. 

Draper finds the line with a dipping top spin forehand down the line. Gutsy play by Brooksby as he sneaks into the net and hits a cute a volley that Draper reaches but can't get over the net.

Big first serve by Brooksby and Draper's return drifts wide, allowing him to hold.

Delay in play due to an incident in the crowd. It's a warm day in west Kensington. The players are advised to take a seat which they do while treatment is administered. 

Sloppy start by Draper as he slips to 0-30 He responds with a perfect swinging ace. Ideal placement from him. Brooksby then lets him off the hook with a backhand into the tramlines.

Wide ace from Draper and he holds again.

Brooksby sees his forehand clip the net cord and fly wide and that gives Draper a break point. Draper gets a look at a second serve and his return is deep and puts Brooksby in trouble. The American gets the ball back in play but Draper steps in and whips a forehand into the corner to break.

Six games in a row for Draper.

Draper's maintain his momentum with another routine hold. With his serve clicking the way it is, Brooksby's hopes today look very slim.

Brooksby is an awkward customer and Draper looked anxious and short of feel in the early stages. Fortunately, he was able to fall back on his lethal leftie serve. During that set, he won 14 out of 15 points behind his first delivery.

Once Draper began to settle in, he reeled off the last four games in assured style. You could tell he was feeling comfortable when he went for a 100mph return winner down the line. He missed – but the very fact that he had the confidence to try it suggested a positive mental state.

As far as opening points go...@jackdraper0 starting as he means to go on 🚀#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/4S3YEoSCjo

Draper is taking the ball early and putting pressure on Brooksby's serve which has gone AWOL. Brooksby forehand long and Draper earns his first set point. 

Brooksby serve and volleys, then hits an overhead which Draper chases out to reach but can't get the ball into play, deuce. Another chance for Draper to close out the set when Brooksby nets a forehand. Too good from Draper. The depth on his shots means Brooksby is forced to hit half volleys on the baseline. After a series of big hits, Draper breaks through with a vicious forehand winner down the line.

Draper's first serve followed by his forehand is an unstoppable combo. Nothing Brooksby can do about in this game and Draper holds to love to consolidate the break. Draper is all business so far. There's an aura about him out on the court.

Brooksby handles what looked like an awkward volley very well and the ball spins away from Draper's reach. 30-15. Brooksby has missed three first serves in a row but Draper isn't doing enough to apply pressure on the second, the slowest being 69mph.

Good defence by Draper to retrieve a Brooksby overhead and the American nets a forehand, break point. Brooksby sees off the danger with a wide ace. Another chance to break comes Draper's way and this time he gets it when Brooksby dumps a backhand into the net.

Draper's serve is starting to fire up and Brooksby's frustration builds after a couple of missed returns. A fifth ace of the match for Draper and he holds again.

A few too many errors from Draper. He's just pushing it at the moment when a little more patience is required. Brooksby comes through another service game untroubled.

After two months grinding on the clay and needing to hit extra balls to finish points, Draper will be pleased to be on the grass again and see his shots fly away from opponents. His power is one of the big reasons why he is a major contender for Wimbledon and he holds here to 15 comfortably.

The reason for Brooksby's strange looking serve is the multitude of injuries he has had on his wrist and shoulder over the years. So fair play for finding something that works for him. Draper is yet to get to grips with it and Brooksby holds to love to take the lead.

Draper's forehand is fine fettle so far. He drills a forehand down the line that's too hot for the advancing Brooksby, 15-15. Andy Murray Arena is not completely full. Plenty of empty seats at this stage of the match. 

First double fault for Draper takes the game to deuce. But he holds with another powerful forehand down the line.

The American has the honour of serving first and we get a glimpse of his very unique service motion. He starts with the racket resting on the back of his neck and releases once the ball is tossed into the air. 

It is the type of service action that you'd see at the park or local club. But it is clearly working for him as he holds to 15.

It's not Wimbledon so players can play in whatever colour they want and Draper comes out in a red and burgundy number. 

The warm up has started and play should start very soon.

Daily sport newsletter

Hello and welcome to coverage from Queen's Club as Jack Draper gets his campaign under way.

The Briton arrives at Queen's as the second seed at an ATP 500 tournament for the first time and will undoubtedly be a leading contender to challenge for the title.

“I look back on my clay court season as a whole and as someone who hasn't done that well on the clay I thought I embraced the surface very well and I improved a lot on it,” Draper reflected in his press conference ahead of the HSBC Championships.

“I got home, had a couple of days off then got on the grass. I was happy to get on a faster surface to be honest. In tennis you have to have a short term memory, you have to understand why you lost certain matches.  

“I take it in my stride and obviously feel good coming into these next few tournaments.”

With Wimbledon less than two weeks away, Draper will want to have a strong week in west Kensington to boost his preparation.

“I think there's no secret I'd love to do amazingly well this week but Wimbledon would be a priority for me. I think it's always an interesting one, that first match or tournament on the grass, there's a lot of players who maybe aren't amazingly prepared.

“We've just come from a surface where we're grinding out points, having to win the point seven times on the trot to get one point. So, coming onto a fast surface, the margins are small but I'm feeling good and I'm ready to compete as hard as possible.

“It's a home tournament for me as well, so that's an added motivation for me to do well here as well.”

Jack Draper began his pursuit of grass-court glory with a dominant victory over Jenson Brooksby, claiming 10 of the last 11 games in a performance that had the fans gasping at his best shots.

This is Draper's first summer as the undisputed main man of British tennis, following Andy Murray's retirement last year, but he showed little sign of being burdened by expectation.

Well, actually, Draper might have been a little tight early on. In the opening game or three, he responded slowly to Brooksby's 110mph first serves – which are milk floats by the super-powered standards of the modern tour – and snatched at forehands too early in rallies.

But as soon as Draper became used to Brooksby's conservative positional tennis, and realised that there were no big surprises here to ambush him, he relaxed and began to show his class. Winner after winner zipped off the baseline and slammed into the backboard as Draper dashed to a 6-3, 6-1 victory in just 77 minutes.

Unleashing off the backhand wing 💥@jackdraper0 #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/wJhsgNVmu8

There will be sterner tests ahead, but Draper looks ready to introduce himself to floating sports fans over the next few weeks. If he remains a well-kept secret within British sport, despite his recent ascent to the heady heights of No 6 in the world rankings, that is probably because he has never made a deep run at Wimbledon.

Drawn against defending champion Novak Djokovic on his SW19 debut in 2021, Draper lost to Alex de Minaur in the third round a year later, then missed 2023 entirely with a nasty shoulder injury.

He should have done better than the second round last summer, but then he came up against a regular practice partner in Cameron Norrie – another left-hander who knew his game inside out.

This year, the opportunity is there for Draper – who could earn a top-four seeding with a deep run this week – to show what he can do on this surface. A glorious first outing at Queen's, beneath a burning sun and a full set of stands, made for the ideal start.

Carlos Alcaraz ensured that, however, he spent the days after his Roland Garros epic against Jannik Sinner, there would be no upset at the start of the grass court season, with a straight sets win over lucky loser Adam Walton.

Having reacted to winning in Paris with an annual tradition excursion to Ibiza, Alcaraz was not faultless against Australian Walton ranked 86th in the world, despite winning 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).

Almost exactly a year ago, Alcaraz arrived at Queen's tired from his break in Ibiza, and his Queen's title defence did not go as planned when he was beaten in under 100 minutes by Jack Draper.

Against Walton, understandably, the tennis was not as smooth as it might have been two weeks ago, and there were a number of baseline exchanges that could have been won earlier.

After four exchanges of serve in the opener, Alcaraz broke. It might have been later than he should have; he had come to the net earlier in the game and missed what could have been a decisive drop shot.

But third time lucky, Alcaraz won the break point, when Walton fired a backhand into the net, with the Spaniard celebrating with a fist pump.

In the second set, Walton's serves might have lacked power but the 110-115mph efforts were well-placed and often wide which left Alcaraz reaching.

At one point trying to race back to get the ball, Alcaraz even tried a ‘tweener' a shot in between the legs to get the ball back over the net, it didn't come off, the shot was too low, but it entertained the mostly full Andy Murray Arena.

Alcaraz backhand into the net, 0-1. Alcaraz drop shot winner, 1-1. First serve into the body unreturned by Walton, 2-1. Wild forehand long by Alcaraz, 2-2. Alcaraz return into the net, 2-3. Walton return flies long, 3-3.

Facing those two set points seems to have sparked Alcaraz into life. 

On his next service game, he plays two exquisite drop shots including a feint, that Walton can only watch.

Into a tie-break we go as Alcaraz holds with an exquisite half volley winner. Shades of Roger Federer with that touch.

Problems for Walton after his backhand sits up nicely for Alcaraz to drill a backhand winner down the line, 15-30. Much needed first serve for Walton is unreturned, 30-30. 

Frustration for Alcaraz as he makes a surprising error on his backhand, pushing the ball long, 40-30. Walton books himself a tie-break when Alcaraz slices a defensive forehand into the net.

Loss of focus from Alcaraz as a third double fault of the match makes it 15-30. Deep return by Walton and Alcaraz nets, two set points for Walton. 

Alcaraz goes to his tried and trusty wide first serve, which is unreturned. Second break point... First serve in from Alcaraz and Walton's return is long. To deuce.

Two more first serves, two more unreturned balls and Alcaraz sees out the danger. Almost felt like Alcaraz wanted to feel a little danger.

You would expect the pressure to hit Walton but not yet. He holds with a blistering forehand winner down the line that catches the outside of the sideline.

Alcaraz will serve to stay in the set next.

WALT a hit 🚀@AdamWalton99 #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/mQXrJRB3yO

So reminiscent of Rafael Nadal when Alcaraz skips to his left to run around his backhand and whip a forehand down the line. It's a beautiful shot to see. 

And he finishes the love game with a deft drop volley winner. He's having fun out there in the sun.

High volley winner by Alcaraz makes it 30-30. Big point coming up. Walton finds his first serve and Alcaraz nets his return. Another backhand into the net by Alcaraz and Walton holds. 

On we go!

When Alcaraz injects more pace to his shots, he continues to earn cheap errors from Walton. Alcaraz holds again as we enter the business end of the set and you can be sure he will want to get a break soon.

Walton is clearly favouring his forehand side, which in turn is leaving him exposed by just how far he has run around the ball to take it on the forehand.

That being said, his serve might lack power by the standards of the majority of those in the top 30 on the tour, but his 110-115mph efforts are well-placed and difficult to return.

Lovely hands by Walton in the forecourt to react to Alcaraz's backhand down the line with an angled half volley winner. Not an easy finish, but he finished that like prime Pat Cash.

Serve continues to be king in this set as Alcaraz holds to love with a trademark forehand winner down the line. The best forehand in men's tennis?

Both players using the serve out wide very effectively to earn cheap points. Another strong hold by Walton to stay in the lead in this set. Can he make any inroads on Alcaraz's serve in this match?

Feels as though Alcaraz is using this as practice. Taking risks on serve, working on his slice and striking the ball early. He completes another service hold routinely.

Good response by Walton to losing the first set by holding here. Very unlikely he will win this match but the level he is showing is far above his current ranking and his game looks well suited to grass.

Alcaraz shakes off the rustiness to bring up two set points at 40-15. And he sees out the set with a second serve ace.

A very controlled and clinical display.

In typical British fashion, there is a strong contingent of support for Walton, the Australian underdog in his first-ever match against Alcaraz.

Alcaraz, on the other han,d has allowed him back into games that he should have wrapped up two or three points earlier. Maybe we are seeing a bit of rustiness in his first match on grass of the season.

Double fault by Walton makes it 0-30. Three first serves in a row rescue the Australian and move him to 40-30. Gorgeous footwork by Alcaraz to run around a Walton slice and blast a forehand winner down the line, deuce. Gasps from the crowd as he hit that.

Deep Alcaraz return and Walton's reply is into the net, set point. Wild forehand by Alcaraz after an extended rally, back to deuce. Blocked return down the line and into the net for a volley winner by Alcaraz, second set point. Walton survives again after Alcaraz nets.

Warm applause for Walton as he holds and asks Alcaraz to serve for the set.

Ferocious Forehand 🔥@carlosalcaraz #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/Pe38dlsnLH

Alcaraz's class is beginning to tell but Walton shows him that he's not going away with a forehand return winner, 30-15. Efficient service hold for Alcaraz completed when a swinging first serve is unreturned.

Refreshment break between the matches is well and truly over and the stands of the Andy Murray Arena are almost as full as they were for home favourite Jack Draper around 40 minutes previously.

Alcaraz has been in decent touch so far in these almost Spanish-like conditions that earlier caused one spectator to faint, leading to a brief pause in Draper's match.

Nice play by Walton to send Alcaraz the wrong way with a cross court flick, 30-15. He then whips a forehand into the corner that Alcaraz gives up running for, 40-15. The Aussie is playing some inspired stuff.

But a couple of errors keep Alcaraz in the game, and then a double fault coughs up a break point for the Spaniard. Relief for Walton as Alcaraz's return drifts long. 

Routine forehand into the net by Walton as Alcaraz ramps up the pressure. Break point. Alcaraz on the attack, Walton scrambles to stay in the point, Alcaraz comes into the net but pushes his volley long. Another chance for Alcaraz to break comes after his forehand return is too good for Walton.

Not enough first serves for Walton to give him cheap points and the pressure finally tells when he nets a backhand. Alcaraz breaks.

Alcaraz is looking equally comfortable on serve so far amd he holds to love with a vintage forehand winner down the line.

Emma Raducanu will team up with French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz in the mixed-doubles at the US Open, with a prize of $1 million for the winners.

The new doubles team – which can expect to be given a portmanteau nickname of either “Alcaranu” or “Raducaraz” – is one of several eye-catching partnerships that will make their debut in New York in August.

Read more here.

Walton is doing everything right at the moment. He is keeping Alcaraz on the move, pushing him left and right and making enough first serves to avoid pressure. A very shapr start for the Australian, who got a late call to play as a lucky loser.

This is the first meeting between the two players. Walton won't have faced a player of his calibre before but she's standing his ground so far and making things awkward for Alcaraz. 

Impressive athleticism by Alcaraz to stretch and hit a backhand overhead smash. Walton gets to the ball and his flick into play drifts wide.

So we join this match at 1-1 after both players held serve to start the match. It will be interesting to see how Alcaraz adapts, in what is his first match since that epic victory at the French Open, earlier this month.

The Spaniard partied in Ibiza last week so hopefully he's recovered and can put on a show. Walton holds here to maintain his lead.

... is top seed and world No 2 Carlos Alcaraz where he meet Australia's Adam Walton.

Feels amazing, no place I'd rather be. We travel the world playing tennis, never get to come home or spend much time with my family but to be on this court in front of you guys, my people, my family, thank you.

It's tricky coming onto the grass after clay, to adapt, I'm hitting the ball a bit late not on time. The more matches and time I have on practice courts I'll get better and better and it's definitely a surface I really enjoy playing on and obviously a win helped as well.

So proud, obviously coming back here a year later is a testament to the hard work from me and my team and all the people who have supported me to be a better player and person. I'm excited to see how I can get on this week I feel excited I feel ready and I want to do my best.

Sealed with an ACE ☄️@jackdraper0 storms through at the #HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/AQF6LZhRrk

Draper can just explode on his shots when Brooksby pushes him out wide as he does when he moves out to his forehand and powers a forehand cross court that is too hot for his opponent, 30-15.

Rare serve and volley from Draper but he nets the volley on the stretch, 30-30. First serve unreturned brings up a match point. Boom! Ace down the T and it's GAME SET MATCH DRAPER!!!

Brooksby is caught out by a deep Draper return and flicks his backhand wide to give the Briton a break point. Draper's weight of shot proves too much for Brooksby again, who nets a forehand.

Draper breaks and will serve for the match.

Ever since Draper's opening service games, Brooksby has had little joy and his screams out in anger after another first serve from the Briton is too much for him.

After an eight minute stoppage, play resumes with Brooksby leading 30-0 but Draper gets on the board with a crushing backhand winner down the line. 

Draper continues to be all over the Brooksby second serve and he fires a forehand return winner down the line. Brooksby saves a break point with a much needed first serve. 

Draper finds the line with a dipping top spin forehand down the line. Gutsy play by Brooksby as he sneaks into the net and hits a cute a volley that Draper reaches but can't get over the net.

Big first serve by Brooksby and Draper's return drifts wide, allowing him to hold.

Delay in play due to an incident in the crowd. It's a warm day in west Kensington. The players are advised to take a seat which they do while treatment is administered. 

Sloppy start by Draper as he slips to 0-30 He responds with a perfect swinging ace. Ideal placement from him. Brooksby then lets him off the hook with a backhand into the tramlines.

Wide ace from Draper and he holds again.

Brooksby sees his forehand clip the net cord and fly wide and that gives Draper a break point. Draper gets a look at a second serve and his return is deep and puts Brooksby in trouble. The American gets the ball back in play but Draper steps in and whips a forehand into the corner to break.

Six games in a row for Draper.

Draper's maintain his momentum with another routine hold. With his serve clicking the way it is, Brooksby's hopes today look very slim.

Brooksby is an awkward customer and Draper looked anxious and short of feel in the early stages. Fortunately, he was able to fall back on his lethal leftie serve. During that set, he won 14 out of 15 points behind his first delivery.

Once Draper began to settle in, he reeled off the last four games in assured style. You could tell he was feeling comfortable when he went for a 100mph return winner down the line. He missed – but the very fact that he had the confidence to try it suggested a positive mental state.

As far as opening points go...@jackdraper0 starting as he means to go on 🚀#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/4S3YEoSCjo

Draper is taking the ball early and putting pressure on Brooksby's serve which has gone AWOL. Brooksby forehand long and Draper earns his first set point. 

Brooksby serve and volleys, then hits an overhead which Draper chases out to reach but can't get the ball into play, deuce. Another chance for Draper to close out the set when Brooksby nets a forehand. Too good from Draper. The depth on his shots means Brooksby is forced to hit half volleys on the baseline. After a series of big hits, Draper breaks through with a vicious forehand winner down the line.

Draper's first serve followed by his forehand is an unstoppable combo. Nothing Brooksby can do about in this game and Draper holds to love to consolidate the break. Draper is all business so far. There's an aura about him out on the court.

Brooksby handles what looked like an awkward volley very well and the ball spins away from Draper's reach. 30-15. Brooksby has missed three first serves in a row but Draper isn't doing enough to apply pressure on the second, the slowest being 69mph.

Good defence by Draper to retrieve a Brooksby overhead and the American nets a forehand, break point. Brooksby sees off the danger with a wide ace. Another chance to break comes Draper's way and this time he gets it when Brooksby dumps a backhand into the net.

Draper's serve is starting to fire up and Brooksby's frustration builds after a couple of missed returns. A fifth ace of the match for Draper and he holds again.

A few too many errors from Draper. He's just pushing it at the moment when a little more patience is required. Brooksby comes through another service game untroubled.

After two months grinding on the clay and needing to hit extra balls to finish points, Draper will be pleased to be on the grass again and see his shots fly away from opponents. His power is one of the big reasons why he is a major contender for Wimbledon and he holds here to 15 comfortably.

The reason for Brooksby's strange looking serve is the multitude of injuries he has had on his wrist and shoulder over the years. So fair play for finding something that works for him. Draper is yet to get to grips with it and Brooksby holds to love to take the lead.

Draper's forehand is fine fettle so far. He drills a forehand down the line that's too hot for the advancing Brooksby, 15-15. Andy Murray Arena is not completely full. Plenty of empty seats at this stage of the match. 

First double fault for Draper takes the game to deuce. But he holds with another powerful forehand down the line.

The American has the honour of serving first and we get a glimpse of his very unique service motion. He starts with the racket resting on the back of his neck and releases once the ball is tossed into the air. 

It is the type of service action that you'd see at the park or local club. But it is clearly working for him as he holds to 15.

It's not Wimbledon so players can play in whatever colour they want and Draper comes out in a red and burgundy number. 

The warm up has started and play should start very soon.

Daily sport newsletter

Hello and welcome to coverage from Queen's Club as Jack Draper gets his campaign under way.

The Briton arrives at Queen's as the second seed at an ATP 500 tournament for the first time and will undoubtedly be a leading contender to challenge for the title.

“I look back on my clay court season as a whole and as someone who hasn't done that well on the clay I thought I embraced the surface very well and I improved a lot on it,” Draper reflected in his press conference ahead of the HSBC Championships.

“I got home, had a couple of days off then got on the grass. I was happy to get on a faster surface to be honest. In tennis you have to have a short term memory, you have to understand why you lost certain matches.  

“I take it in my stride and obviously feel good coming into these next few tournaments.”

With Wimbledon less than two weeks away, Draper will want to have a strong week in west Kensington to boost his preparation.

“I think there's no secret I'd love to do amazingly well this week but Wimbledon would be a priority for me. I think it's always an interesting one, that first match or tournament on the grass, there's a lot of players who maybe aren't amazingly prepared.

“We've just come from a surface where we're grinding out points, having to win the point seven times on the trot to get one point. So, coming onto a fast surface, the margins are small but I'm feeling good and I'm ready to compete as hard as possible.

“It's a home tournament for me as well, so that's an added motivation for me to do well here as well.”

Taylor Fritz has made a fantastic start to his grass court season, having just won the Boss Open in Stuttgart.

World number four Fritz has now won four grass court titles on the ATP Tour, with his current focus now turning to Queen's.

His latest victory comes after a miserable venture at the French Open, where Fritz lost his first round match against Daniel Altmaier.

Fritz says he thinks really well on court, with that skill having clearly helped him enjoy a successful run in Stuttgart.

The American second seed beat Quentin Halys, Marton Fucsovics and Felix Auger-Aliassime before a final win over top seed Alexander Zverev.

It is, however, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz who have dominated the ATP Tour in terms of Grand Slams once again this year.

Speaking of the duo, Fritz told Tennis Channel: “They're showing time and time again that they're just a level above right now, and everyone else is going to have to catch up.

“But I think it's motivating for a lot of us to see that level and know what we have to compete against and what we have to work towards.

“On a slow surface like Roland Garros with the slow ball, I think in those conditions, it really does look like a level up across the board.

“I mean, there are certain shots and specific things that people can do better or compete with, but I mean I absolutely like my chances more on a grass court than on a slow clay court.”

Sinner triumphed at the Australian Open at the start of the year, defeating Zverev to successfully defend his title.

Then at the French Open, the world number one was beaten in the final by Alcaraz, who also defended his title.

The Spaniard will also enter Wimbledon as a two-time defending champion, while Sinner will look to defend his US Open crown later this year.

It was at Flushing Meadows in 2024 where Fritz enjoyed his best-ever Grand Slam finish, having lost the US Open final to Sinner.

But hard court tennis will be at the very back of his mind right now, with a firm focus on grass needed for the coming weeks.

And it is a surface which Fritz has thrived on throughout his career, having won four of his nine ATP titles on grass.

His other five have arrived on hard courts, with the American set to be glad to see the back of the clay-court season.

But even on one of his stronger surfaces, Fritz is very likely going to need to beat Sinner or Alcaraz – or potentially both – in order to triumph at the likes of Wimbledon.

World No 1 downplayed American's victory

Sabalenka says she did not intend to attack opponent

Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologise for the “unprofessional” comments she made after her loss to the American in the final of the French Open.

Speaking to Eurosport Germany, Sabalenka said her remarks after her defeat by Gauff at Roland Garros this month were a mistake. In her post-match press conference in Paris, Sabalenka had suggested that the result was more due to her own errors than to Gauff's performance.

“I think she won the match not because she played incredible,” Sabalenka said at the time. “Just because I made all of those mistakes, if you look from the outside, from kind of easy balls.”

However, Sabalenka now says she regrets those remarks. “That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka told Eurosport Germany. “I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then. You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward – not immediately, but recently.”

Sabalenka hit 37 winners but finished the final with 70 unforced errors. Gauff had 30 winners and 30 unforced errors. The Belarusian, the world No 1, said she wrote to Gauff to apologise and “make sure she knew she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her”.

“I never intended to attack her,” Sabalanka added. “I was super-emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I'm not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realised a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?”

Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff in the 2023 US Open final, where she also won the first set. “I kept getting so emotional,” Sabalenka said. “So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn't be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.”

Recently, Nadal's uncle and former coach Toni Nadal suggested that his nephew would return to tennis to play exhibition matches with Federer.

"I know him [Rafa] well enough to know that he is excited about the idea of playing exhibition matches with Federer," Toni said.

He added: "Probably, in the coming months or in 2026, he will train hard again to be ready for these exhibitions.

"Tennis has been vital in his life and that cannot be erased overnight."

Nadal has no desire to swap watching from the sidelines for a return to action, however, with the 39-year-old content with his decision to hang up his racket.

"I do not feel like I would have preferred being there on the court," he stated.

Jack Draper laid down an impressive opening marker at the HSBC Championships on Tuesday, when he dispatched American Jenson Brooksby 6-3, 6-1 to reach the second round in west London.

The British No. 1 has earned victories against Jannik Sinner (2021) and Carlos Alcaraz (2024) at the ATP 500 grass-court event in the past and returned to The Queen's Club this week at No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Draper is just the fourth British player to be a top-two seed at the tournament but he did not let the pressure faze him in a dominant first-round performance against Brooksby. The 23-year-old won 93 per cent (27/29) of his first-serve points and did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

"My preparation has not been unbelievable. I have had a couple of niggles," Draper said. "I was thinking I haven't played too much on grass either after a long clay-court season, trying to adapt to that surface and it is a challenge. I am enjoying being at home and staying in my own bed."

Draper leads Brooksby 4-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having defeated the 24-year-old en route to the Indian Wells title in March. The lefty, who is 4-0 in opening rounds at The Queen's Club, will next play Alexei Popyrin. The Australian defeated countryman Aleksandar Vukic 6-2, 6-7(9), 7-3(3).

Draper is chasing his second tour-level title on grass, after winning in Stuttgart last season.

"The court is good, it has held up well. It is amazing that the girls got to play here in London,"Draper added when talking about the WTA event held at The Queen's Club. "Queen's is one of the best tournaments in the world... I am really happy to be on the centre court again this year."

Jiri Lehecka upset former finalist and fifth seed Alex de Minaur 6-4, 6-2 to earn his third Top 20 win on grass. The 23-year-old Czech missed the grass swing last year due to injury but has fond memories on the surface, highlighted by his fourth-round run at Wimbledon in 2023.
Lehecka competed on grass last week in Stuttgart, where he advanced to the quarter-finals. De Minaur was playing on the surface for the first time this season and looked uncomfortable in periods during the 77-minute clash in west London. The Australian won just 68 per cent of his first-serve points and committed 14 winners to 28 unforced errors.
The World No. 30 Lehecka will meet Billy Harris or Gabriel Diallo in the second round.

But while Sabalenka relaxed away from prying eyes, some of her other post-defeat comments continued to get high-profile play in the press.Her off-the-cuff press-conference claims that she played "terrible tennis," and that Iga Swiatek would've beaten Gauff in the final, were a centerpiece of discussion from *Good Morning America* to sports talk shows. While Gauff took the high road, repeatedly, in responding to the line of questioning, Sabalenka was forced to issue a statement in an effort to stem the tide of public opinion before her out-of-office stint."You all know me ... I'm always going to be honest and human in how I process these moments," she wrote in an Instagram story the day after the final. "I made over 70 unforced errors, so I can't pretend it was a great day for me."But both things can be true," she added. "I didn't play my best, and Coco stepped up and played with poise and purpose."Read more: Aryna Sabalenka clarifies controversial Coco Gauff claim: "Can't pretend it was a great day"

The tennis calendar is so unforgiving that it almost forces players and fans to move on from what might have been the most exciting or crushing matches of their lives.

This month's French Open final marks the perfect example.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner played out the most extraordinary match in recent memory; a five-set epic where the former came from two sets to love down to claim the title.

The tennis world and beyond stopped to watch in awe history unfolding before their very eyes.

And yet, less than two weeks on, the grass-court season is in full swing, with clay a thing of the past.

Some, like Darren Cahill and his team, might find it harder than others to move on.

Speaking on the Served with Andy Roddick podcast, they could not get Cahill on without touching on that legendary showdown earlier this month.

Speaking about these two superstars, destined to dominate for the next decade and beyond, the Aussie claimed: 'And with that, they have great self-awareness. I think Carlos has it as well. I think he's very aware of his surroundings, very aware of his success and his popularity. And Jannik is as well, and all at the same time, he's able to keep his feet on the ground.

‘So what you see from the outside, you know, we were so damn proud of him, regardless of whether he won or lost that match. Obviously, we wanted him to win that match, we were heartbroken not to win it, but you send a player on the court, the one thing you ask for is for that player to give them everything you have. That's it as a coach, and he gave us more than that.

‘So, when you look at a tennis match, the way it was played, how good it was, how well those two guys competed, no toilet breaks, no physios, no trainers, no complaining, just pure five and a half hours of brilliant tennis, business-like tennis, great respect between the two players. You can't ask for anything more as a coach.

‘So, regardless of the result, I take my hat off to Carlos. He's an amazing young man, we have an incredible respect for him, but believe it or not, I've been with Jannik for over three years now. I have more respect for him now watching after that match in the Roland Garros final than I had before that, and that's hard to say because I know him pretty damn well. So, for me, that was the biggest takeaway from that French Open final.'

Carlos Alcaraz revealed what so many people have told him about the French Open final, which should offer some solace to Sinner.

Sinner has already proven his unflinching mentality throughout a sparkling short career thus far, and whilst this will surely be the most crushing defeat yet, there's no doubt that he'll bounce back from this too.

Fortunately, the French Open's finish offers little time for skulking around, as redemption is just around the corner.

Wimbledon starts in less than two weeks.

There, the 23-year-old will be handed the perfect opportunity for revenge, to exorcise the Philippe Chatrier demons that will haunt him for years to come.

Nobody ever really forgets these kinds of defeats, but the measure of an elite player is how they recover.

The world will be watching Sinner's response with eagerness, first at Halle this week, and then at Wimbledon later this month.

Sabalenka lost to Gauff in three sets at Roland-Garros, with the American coming back from a set down to win her first French Open title.

Speaking with reporters after the loss, the 27-year-old said the match was "the worst final I've ever played".

"I don't think she won the match because she played incredibly well, but because I made all those mistakes."

In an interview with Eurosport broadcast on Tuesday ahead of this week's WTA tournament in Berlin, the Belarusian said the comments were "simply completely unprofessional of me".

"I let my emotions guide me. I absolutely regret what I said back then," she added.

Sabalenka is the number one seed in the German capital and could face second seed Gauff again in the final.

Aryna Sabalenka has apologised to Coco Gauff for her comments after losing the French Open final to the American. Sabalenka said that she wrote to Gauff, who beat her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 at Roland Garros earlier this month, and expressed her regret for her “unprofessional” comments.

Sabalenka had suggested in her post-match comments that Gauff's victory was more due her own errors than the latter's performance. “That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka said. “I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then. You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward — not immediately, but recently.”

The Belarusian World No.1's comments at the time were rooted in some reality, she hit 37 winners but finished the final with a whopping 70 unforced errors — compared to Gauff's 30, her comments were largely seen as a way of putting down her opponent's achievement. This was 21-year-old Gauff's second Grand Slam win, having earlier beaten Sabalenka in the 2023 US Open final.

Sabalenka said that she told Gauff that it was never intention to “attack her”. The Belarusian said that she wanted to make sure Gauff knew that she “absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her.”

“I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I'm not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realized a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?” Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff in the 2023 U.S. Open final, where she also won the first set.

“I kept getting so emotional,” Sabalenka added. “So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn't be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.”

This was World No.1 Sabalenka's first French Open final and she was gunning for a fourth Grand Slam singles title, having the won successive Australian Open titles in 2023 and 2024 and the 2024 US Open. Additionally, Sabalenka has also won the doubles title at the 2019 Australian Open and 2021 US Open partnering Elise Mertens.

Ben Shelton's girlfriend, Trinity Rodman, and sister, Emma Shelton, were full of praise of the American tennis star as he broke into the top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time in his pro career. This progress has been made due to his consistent display of commendable performances, notably throughout this season.

Shelton is one of three Americans ranked in the top 10, alongside Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul. Andre Agassi, James Blake, and Andy Roddick were the last Americans to achieve this feat in April 2006.

Shelton even boasts a rich family history in the sport, being the son of the former World No. 55, Bryan Shelton, who now serves as his head coach.

His soccer star girlfriend, Trinity Rodman, who is the daughter of former Chicago Bulls star Dennis Rodman, showered the tennis star with love on his achievement as shared the news on Instagram stories and wrote:

Ben Shelton's sister Emma also shared the news on Instagram, accompanied by emoticons indicating her excitement in receiving the big news.

Ben Shelton, who is next set to compete at the Queen's Club Championships, expressed his elation on receiving the news.

Ben Shelton expressed his excitement at being able to be a part of the extraordinary group of tennis stars, as he climbed up the world ladder and snatched the 10th spot in the PIF ATP Rankings. It was only three years ago that Shelton had cracked into the top 500 and since then, his career has taken a leap.

However, speaking during his on-court interview at the Stuttgart Open on Friday (June 13), he expressed his excitement and how honored he was on being able to achieve this milestone, which marks a momentous moment in his career.

The tennis star will be looking to rise further up the table, hopeful of delivering some notable performances during the grass stint of the season. He will be in action against Arthur Rinderknech at the HSBC Championships on Tuesday, June 17.

Wimbledon is the next big tournament for the ATP stars to look forward to, and for many, it's the only Grand Slam that truly matters. 

The English major has a tradition like none of the others, and it won't be long before the players are donning the whites and taking to SW19 for a fortnight of tennis. 

Yesterday, Alejandro Tabilo was ruled out of Wimbledon, and that's opened the door for former finalist Marin Cilic to take a place in the main draw at this year's event. 

American tennis is on the rise, with Taylor Fritz up to world number four again after his win in the BOSS Open on Sunday against Alexander Zverev. 

However, for one of Fritz's compatriots, it's hard luck as he's been forced to pull out of Wimbledon amid an injury that has hampered his year. 

For Korda, it's proved a heartbreaking decision, but ultimately, as a young player, he has to do what is right for himself going forward. 

The 24-year-old lost to Frances Tiafoe at the recent French Open but hasn't played since and has now made the decision not to take part in Wimbledon this year. 

It's been confirmed today that Korda has now forfeited his place in the competition, with American player Christopher Eubanks now the fortunate one to benefit. 

The suggestion is that he's still struggling physically and having not played a match on grass, he's decided to pull out in agonising circumstances.

The talented player isn't short of confidence and in 2023, he suggested that he was one of the players in the mix to claim the title. 

His confidence was somewhat blind as he lost in the first round to Czech player Jiri Vesely in four sets. 

Going into the tournament, Korda told Tennis TV: “I'm very confident in myself on a grass court. I'm an aggressive player, like to come to the net, I have good hands and I definitely feel as if I'm one of the favourites at Wimbledon.”

Korda has only ever had a run to the fourth round once at Wimbledon and that came all the way back in 2021. 

Now, he will have to wait another year to improve on that with the American world number 26 making the tough decision to withdraw from this year's Wimbledon.

Patrick Mouratoglou has revealed the biggest factor in Carlos Alcaraz's win in their epic French Open final was their forehands, backhands or serves.

The sporting world was enthralled by the sensational Roland Garros showdown between Alcaraz and Sinner, with the Spaniard saving three match points before winning a decisive fifth set tie breaker.

Now Mouratoglou, who is the current coach of Naomi Osaka and former coach of Serena Williams, has given his verdict on the Paris epic, as he gave his views on a detailed LinkedIn post.

“That Roland-Garros final was the best we've ever seen,” declared Mouratoglou.”Not because of the scoreline, or the hype, but because of the level.

“Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner played the highest level of tennis you can expect from two players today.

“Physically, mentally, tactically; everything was there. For over five hours, the intensity never dropped.

“It took me some time to reflect on this final. I wanted to step back, absorb the emotions, and listen to what others had to say before sharing mine.

“Now, eight days later, one thing still stands out to me: the mental aspect of this final.”

Mouratoglou recently released a book looking at the mental side of tennis and sport in general and he suggested the final set was a triumph for both players, even though Alacarz eventually came out on top.

Sinner could have crumbled after he lost three match points at 5-3 in the fourth set, but he responded impressively and was close to victory again in the final game before the deciding tie-break.

“Every time one of them was close to losing, they found another gear. That happened again and again, from both sides,” said Mouratoglou.

“At two sets to one, Sinner was leading 5-3, 0-40. He had the match in hand. He didn't convert, got broken, and lost the set.

“But he didn't collapse. He came back in the fifth, still competing at the same intensity. That says a lot about who he is.

“As for Alcaraz, he knew exactly when it mattered most. In the super tiebreak, you could feel it: this is the moment. He went for it. And that's what made the difference.

“This wasn't just a final; it was a reminder of how far tennis has come. And how much of it is played in the mind.”

The two top players in men's tennis are back in action this week as they start their grass court campaigns ahead of Wimbledon, with Alcaraz admitting he has looked back on clips of his Roland Garros win against Sinner after he took a break from the game following his Paris heroics.

“I have seen a lot of videos from that match, that moment from match point down,” he said.

“I still watch it sometimes and can't believe I came back from that moment. Sometimes it is difficult to realise that I am in this position, that I won Roland Garros. I still watch the videos and am still in shock sometimes.

“To put it into words is really difficult honestly. To come from two sets down against the world No. 1, the level that he was playing, it is unbelievable.

“It was the first time that I have come back from 2-0 down and honestly I just put my heart into it. I just tried to keep it going, not thinking about the result.

“I think to say it was one of the best finals in the history of the Grand Slams is really high status. I have to say, there have been better finals.

“I am going to say one, Novak against Rafa in the final of the Australian Open. I think that level of final is pretty high, I am just really happy to put my name in one of the best finals.”

...

World number one Aryna Sabalenka has again apologised for controversial remarks after losing the recent French Open final against Coco Gauff, naming her behaviour "completely unprofessional."

Gauff won the June 7 final at Roland Garros in three sets, and Sabalenka told reporters post-match that Gauff didn't win because she had played well but rather because of her own mistakes.

Sabalenka apologised for the statements the next day, and now told Eurosport Germany at this week's Berlin Open that she "absolutely regrets" them, and has written to Gauff to apologise.

"That was just completely unprofessional of me. I let my emotions get the better of me," she said.

"I absolutely regret what I said back then. You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life.

"I think we all have those days when we lose control. The difference with me is, the world is watching. I get a lot more hate for what I did than other people."

Sabalenka and Gauff are both playing in Berlin and could meet in the final of the tune-up event for Wimbledon which starts on June 30.

The star-studded Berlin field boasts nine players from the top 10 in the rankings.

Aryna Sabalenka says she wrote to Coco Gauff to apologise for her "completely unprofessional" remarks after the American beat her in the French Open final.

World number one Sabalenka put in an error-strewn performance in a 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 6-4 loss to Gauff earlier this month.

The Belarusian said afterwards it was the "worst final I ever played", adding: "I think she won the match not because she played incredible [but] just because I made all of those mistakes."

Speaking 10 days on from the Paris final, Sabalenka said she "absolutely regretted" her remarks.

"That was just completely unprofessional of me. I let my emotions get the better of me," the 27-year-old told Eurosport Germany., external

"I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. 

"I wrote to Coco afterwards - not immediately, but recently."

Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam singles champion, has lost both of the major finals she has reached this year.

She lost to Madison Keys in the Australian Open final, where she was two-time defending champion, before the defeat by Gauff.

She committed 70 unforced errors against Gauff, one of the best defenders on the women's tour, and struggled to keep her composure.

"I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference," Sabalenka added.

"It took me a while to revisit it, to approach it with open eyes and to understand.

"I realised a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals? I kept getting so emotional.

"So it was a tough but very instructive lesson for me."

Sabalenka begins her grass-court season at the Berlin Open, where she is the top seed, before Wimbledon gets under way on 30 June.

Alcaraz – Davidovich Fokina: 17.06.2025 16:00 CEST
H2H: 2-0

Carlos Alcaraz has won 13 straight matches. His last match was at the French Open when he made an epic comeback against Sinner in the final. His last grass court match was at Wimbledon last season when he defeated Djokovic in the final in straight sets.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has lost three of his last five matches. His last match was at the French Open when he lost in four sets against Lehecka in the second round. His last grass court match was last season in London when he lost in three sets against Tabilo in the opening round.

According to the bookies, Alcaraz is the big favourite in this matchup, and we partially agree. However, after winning the French Open title, Alcaraz partied in Ibiza and stayed away from the tennis courts. On the other hand, Davidovich Fokina is prepared for the upcoming tournaments, and we expect him to keep this match tight.

That said, Davidovich Fokina covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Alejandro Davidovich Fokina +5.5 games handicap @1.91 @bet365

Thompson – Munar: 17.06.2025 16:00 CEST
H2H: 1-1

Jordan Thompson has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Hertogenbosch, Thompson lost in the second round against Diallo in three tight sets. Last season in London, Thompson reached the semifinals at the Queen's Club, eventually losing to Musetti in three sets.

Jaume Munar has lost three of his last five matches. His last match was at the French Open when he lost against Fils in five tight sets. His last grass court match was at Wimbledon last season when he lost against de Minaur in straight sets in the second round.

According to the bookies, Thompson is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is a way better grass-court player than Munar. The Spaniard never succeeded on grass courts. We expect Thompson to dominate.

That being said, Thompson covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jordan Thompson -3.5 games handicap @1.80 @bet365

Diallo – Harris: 17.06.2025 17:30 CEST
H2H: 0-1

Gabriel Diallo has won five straight matches. Last week in Hertogenbosch, Diallo surprisingly won the title. He defeated Bergs in the final in straight sets and secured his maiden ATP title. With his recent solid performances, Diallo also secured a top 50 ranking.

Billy Harris has lost four of his last five matches. Last week in Ilkley, Harris lost against Pinnington Jones in the second round of the Challenger tournament. This week in London, Harris has been granted a wild card.

According to the bookies, Harris is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. Diallo has just won his maiden ATP title and will be emotionally exhausted coming into this match. On the other hand, Harris is a solid grass-court player, and we expect him to keep this match tight.

That being said, Harris covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Billy Harris +3.5 games handicap @1.61 @bet365

Fresh from climbing to the historic world No. 1 ranking, Italian tennis sensation Jannik Sinner remains the sport's dominant force.

This emphatic right-hander has carved an impressive path on the ATP Tour, highlighted by three Grand Slam triumphs – including consecutive Australian Open titles – and a victory at the ATP Finals.

While his career has seen remarkable highs, it has also seen tough times, including a notable doping controversy.

Whilst his next appearance is due to be at the Halle Open next week, Tennis Head has everything you need to know about Sinner.

As of May 2025, Jannik Sinner confirmed that he is single. He was previously in a relationship with fellow tennis player Anna Kalinskaya.

Their romance, although kept private, became public in May 2024, when Sinner confirmed they were together during the French Open, and they were often seen supporting each other at tournaments.

However, they broke up in late 2024. There have been rumours linking him to Russian model Lara Leito, but Sinner has publicly said that he is not in a relationship.

As of June 10, 2024, Jannik Sinner holds the world No. 1 ranking in men's singles according to the ATP.

He achieved this career-high position on this date, making him the first Italian male tennis player to ever reach the top spot in the ATP rankings.

His ascent to world No. 1 follows a highly successful period, including winning major titles at the 2024 Australian Open and 2024 US Open, as well as the 2024 ATP Finals.

Jannik Sinner has an impressive Grand Slam record, having won three major singles titles and reached at least the semifinals of every Grand Slam.

Australian Open: Sinner has a strong record at the Australian Open, winning the title twice. In 2024, he secured his first Grand Slam championship by defeating Daniil Medvedev in a five-set final, coming back from two sets down. He continued his success in 2025, winning the Australian Open for the second consecutive year by defeating Alexander Zverev in straight sets in the final.

French Open: Sinner has always performed well at Roland Garros. In 2025, he reached the final, where he faced Carlos Alcaraz in a highly anticipated match. This marked his best performance at the French Open to date. He also reached the semifinals in 2024 and the quarterfinals in 2020.

Wimbledon: Sinner has shown significant improvement on grass, reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2023. This was a notable achievement, showing his adaptability across different surfaces. In 2024, he reached the quarterfinals.

US Open: Sinner claimed his second Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2024. He defeated Taylor Fritz in straight sets in the final to secure the championship. Before this victory, he had reached the quarterfinals in 2022 and the fourth round in 2021 and 2023.

Jannik Sinner is from Italy and was born in Innichen San Candido, a town in the South Tyrol province of northern Italy, near the Austrian border. He grew up in Sexten, another town in the Dolomites.

Sinner began playing tennis at the age of seven, but he also had a talent for skiing and football. It wasn't until around age 13 that he committed to tennis, moving away from home to train at the Piatti Tennis Center in Bordighera, on the Italian Riviera. This move, supported by his parents, was a key step in his development to becoming a professional tennis player.

Jannik Sinner was born on August 16, 2001, making him 23 years old as of June 13, 2025. He stands at a height of 1.91 meters (6 feet 3 inches). His career has been marked by a notable list of achievements for someone so young. He became the first male player born in the 2000s to reach the top 10 and, in 2024, won his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open at just 22. 

By 23, he had secured two more Grand Slams (2024 US Open, 2025 Australian Open), won the ATP Finals, and climbed to the world No. 1 ranking, making him the first Italian to achieve this feat.

Jannik Sinner's estimated net worth is between $26-$27 million. His wealth primarily derives from a mixture of his significant tennis prize money and lucrative endorsement deals.

By June 9, 2025, his career prize money stood at over $41.5 million, placing him among the top-earning players in ATP history. In 2024 alone, he earned a record-breaking $19.74 million in prize money.

Additionally, he has substantial earnings from sponsorships with major brands like Nike, Gucci, Rolex, and Lavazza, which contribute an estimated $15 million annually to his income.

Jannik Sinner was involved in a doping controversy in 2024, which ended in early 2025, after twice testing positive for clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid.

The positive tests occurred in March 2024 during Indian Wells and an out-of-competition test. Sinner's defence centred on inadvertent contamination: his physiotherapist, who had a cut finger, used an over-the-counter clostebol-containing spray (Trofodermin) and then massaged Sinner without gloves, transferring the substance.

The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) initially cleared Sinner of “no fault or negligence.” However, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed, arguing strict liability and seeking a two-year ban. To avoid a lengthy legal battle, Sinner and WADA settled in February 2025.

Sinner accepted a three-month ban, retroactive from February 9 to May 4, 2025. This allowed him to play in the French Open, but he forfeited prize money and ranking points from Indian Wells.

BERLIN (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologize for the “unprofessional” comments she made following her loss to her American rival in the final of the French Open.

Speaking to Eurosport Germany, the top-ranked Sabalenka said her remarks after her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 loss to Gauff at Roland-Garros this month were a mistake. In her post-match press conference in Paris, Sabalenka had suggested that the result was more due to her own errors than to Gauff's performance.

“That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka said. “I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then. You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward — not immediately, but recently.”

Sabalenka hit 37 winners but finished the final with 70 unforced errors — compared to Gauff's 30.

She said she wrote to Gauff to apologize and “make sure she knew she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her.”

“I never intended to attack her,” Sabalanka added. “I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I'm not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realized a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?”

Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff in the 2023 U.S. Open final, where she also won the first set.

“I kept getting so emotional,” Sabalenka added. “So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn't be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.”

The measure of greatness in tennis is based around the number of Grand Slam titles a player has on their record, but Chris Evert believes that marker is not entirely accurate.

Novak Djokovic is widely hailed as the best male player of all-time after he secured more Grand Slam titles than his great rivals Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

Women's tennis great Margaret Court is currently tied with Djokovic with 24 Grand Slam titles and like Djokovic, a large percentage of her Grand Slam successes in singles at the Australian Open.

While the opening Grand Slam of the year in Melbourne is now a tournament that all the top players compete it, that was not the case in the 1970s, 1980s and even into the 1990s

Speaking exclusively to Tennis365, Evert has reflected on her own career and the number of times she didn't make the long trip to play at the Australian Open.

The absence of some of the biggest names in women's tennis opened the door for Court to build up her Grand Slam title haul, with Evert telling this website that the focus was on building the women's game rather than personal glory.

Driven by Evert's fellow tennis great Billie Jean King, the Women's Tennis Association was founded in 1973 and their drive to build a platform for the women's game centred around the promotion of their new Virginia Slims Tour.

So playing what was very much the fourth most important major in tennis was not a key part of the agenda for players of Evert's gravitas.

The great American won the Australian Open in 1982 and 1984 as she joined the ranks of players to win all four major titles, yet she told this website that the obsessive attention given to Grand Slam tournaments has shifted since her days at the top.

“Winning Grand Slams was not a priority for us at that time,” Evert told Tennis365 while she was working for TNT Sports at Roland Garros.

“We were trying to create a tour that could possibly allow 200-300 women to have a tour that would allow them to earn a living.

“I missed 12 Australian Opens and three French Opens because our priority was playing the Virginia Slims Tour and trying to build that into a platform that could sustain women's professional tennis. The men had people doing this for them, building their tour. We had to do that ourselves.

“It is to the credit of Billie Jean King and the women who led the way with her that they created a professional circuit that gave women a chance to earn a good living.

“There wasn't any other professional women's sports then, so what they did created a legacy that had an impact not just in tennis, but in so many sports to this day. Our sport paved the way, no doubt about that.

“In the early 1970s, when I was coming through in tennis, we got equal prize money with the men at the US Open for the first time. That was a big moment. Now we have it for all the Grand Slam tournaments and I don't hear too many people questioning it.

“Maybe you could ask whether the men should play best of three sets rather than five, but I'm not sure. Tennis has been there for a long time and you don't want to change too much.”

Evert was not alone in missing the Australian Open and that story continued into the 1990s, with Andre Agassi one of the big names who opted out of the January trip to Melbourne as he preferred to spend Christmas at home rather than play the opening major of the season.

“I didn't play the Australian Open because I wanted to do something normal and that's called Christmas and New Year's,” Agassi said on a recent edition of the Serve with Andy Roddick podcast.

They are comments that look out of place in a modern game, but it does put some perspective on the notion that tennis greatness can be measured by the number of Grand Slam titles on your record.

Wimbledon has been renowned for its class, history and prestige in tennis ever since it was established in 1877.

Traditions have been a mainstay at the All England Club in SW19, with strawberries and cream one of the delights amongst fans.

Pimm's is also a popular beverage for spectators, some of whom are famous faces that take their seats in the prestigious Royal Box.

But there's one piece of Wimbledon heritage that's strictly preserved by tournament officials - the official competitor dress code.

Whilst dark green and purple are the official championship colours, players have long been required to wear all-white outfits.

Regulations on attire were initially enforced in 1963 and called for all competitors in SW19 to dress 'predominantly in white'. 

This was changed 32 years later to 'almost entirely white', and covers both practice and official matches throughout the tournament.

Players must adhere to the rules and if they don't, they are likely to be asked to change into the accepted garments.

Anna Kournikova became familiar with this in 2002 when she fell foul of the Wimbledon regulations.

The former Russian player, who was once the world no.8, wore black shorts during a practice session.

Kournikova therefore needed to change but with no white shorts to hand, she had to resort to a different item of clothing.

In order to comply with the dress code, she borrowed a pair from her coach, the late and legendary Nick Bollettieri.

Kournikova wore an all-white outfit for her first round match against compatriot Tatiana Panova, who won 6-1 4-6 6-4.

But she's certainly not been the only player to have gone against the Wimbledon dress requirements.

Andre Agassi, who won the men's singles title in 1992, wrote about his dislike of the rules in his autobiography Open.

"I resent rules, but especially arbitrary rules. Why must I wear white? I don't want to wear white. 

"Why should it matter to these people what I wear? Above all, I took offence at being barred and blocked and made to feel unwanted."

Agassi even decided not to play at Wimbledon from 1988 until 1990 due to the tradition, although he did return the year before his win.

More recently, Ons Jabeur seemed to forget the rules in 2023 ahead of her women's singles final clash against Marketa Vondrousova.

Jabeur wore a black top during practice and was told to return to the changing rooms.

Once she had changed into the requested white, she made her way back onto the court and then fell to a 6-4 6-4 defeat.

Although colourless clothes are mandatory, Wimbledon introduced a key change two years ago for the female players.

They are now able to wear mid or dark-coloured undershorts as long as they are not longer than their skirts or shorts.

Coco Gauff was one player who welcomed the change as she spoke on how she played at Wimbledon on her period in 2022.

"I was on my period last year at Wimbledon and it was very stressful," she said to Sky News.

"You have period underwear to help you but it's still in the back of your mind. 

"Sometimes when you go to the bathroom, you're supposed to use the bathroom but sometimes I would go to check nothing was showing.

"I think it's going to relieve a lot of stress for me and other girls in the locker room, for sure."

*Exception provided for female players who are allowed to wear solid, mid/dark-coloured undershorts provided they are no longer than their shorts or skirt.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Netflix is looking to remake another classic TV series. The streamer has closed a deal with Legendary Television for Land of the Lost, a reboot of Sid and Marty Krofft's 1974 sci-fi adventure show, Deadline has learned.


	Sid and Marty Krofft as well as Marty's daughter Deanna Krofft Pope, who is VP Development and Production at their company, will produce the project, which is in very early stages, sources said. Search is underway for a writer. Reps for Netflix and Legendary TV declined comment. 


Land of the Lost centers on a father, Rick, and his two children who accidentally go through a portal and find themselves trapped in a world inhabited by dinosaurs, including a Tyrannosaurus rex they nickname Grumpy; primate-like people named Pakuni, one of whom, Cha-Ka, they befriend; and reptilian humanoids called Sleestak.

	











Land of the Lost originated as a children's series which aired on NBC Saturday mornings for three seasons from 1974 to 1976, with CBS giving it a summer run in 1985 and 1987. In it, Rick was played by Spencer Milligan, with Wesley Eure and Kathy Coleman as his kids, Will and Holly, respectively. Stop-motion animation was used for some of the creatures.

	Despite its relatively short run, Land of the Lost achieved cult status, keeping the title relevant. That led to a 1991 series remake, which aired for two seasons on ABC, and a 2009 feature film starring Will Ferrell. Sid and Marty Krofft produced both. 


	While it does not have the extensive library traditional TV studios do, Netflix has taken on a few classic series titles. The streamer is currently filming a new Little House On the Prairie and previously rebooted Lost In Space and One Day At a Time. 


	Legendary Television's current slate includes Dune: Prophecy at HBO, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters at Apple TV+ and the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft at Netflix as well as Tomb Raider and Pacific Rim live-action series and an adaptation of Girls and Their Horses with Nicole Kidman — all in development at Amazon.

	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Tuesday that Tom Cruise, Debbie Allen and longtime Spike Lee collaborator and production designer Wynn Thomas will receive honorary Oscars at the 2025 Governors Awards. In addition, Dolly Parton will receive the Academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.


	The Oscar statuettes will be presented in a ceremony for the 16th annual Governors Awards on November 16 at the Ray Dolby Ballroom at Ovation Hollywood.


	“This year's Governors Awards will celebrate four legendary individuals whose extraordinary careers and commitment to our filmmaking community continue to leave a lasting impact,” Academy president Janet Yang said in a release announcing the news. “The Academy's Board of Governors is honored to recognize these brilliant artists. Debbie Allen is a trailblazing choreographer and actor, whose work has captivated generations and crossed genres. Tom Cruise's incredible commitment to our filmmaking community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community has inspired us all. Beloved performer Dolly Parton exemplifies the spirit of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award through her unwavering dedication to charitable efforts. And production designer Wynn Thomas has brought some of the most enduring films to life through a visionary eye and mastery of his craft.”

	











	Cruise, who has been nominated for three acting Oscars — leading for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire and supporting for Magnolia — received his fourth nomination for producing 2023 Best Picture candidate Top Gun: Maverick. His credits in a long career also include Risky Business, A Few Good Men, Interview with the Vampire, Eyes Wide Shut, Vanilla Sky and the Mission: Impossible film series that is wrapping with this summer's The Final Reckoning.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Allen's work over almost five decades as a choreographer, actor and producer includes choreographing the Academy Awards seven times. The Fame and Jo Jo Dancer actress' producing credits include Amistad and A Star for Rose.


	Thomas' credits with Lee spans from 1986's She's Gotta Have It to Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X and 2020's Da 5 Bloods with many in between. He was also production designer on Oscar Best Picture A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man with Ron Howard, and on Hidden Figures among others.


	The Honorary Oscar is a statuette given “to honor extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement, exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences in any discipline, or for outstanding service to the Academy,” according to the Academy.


	Parton, the Steel Magnolias and Nine to Five star who has sold 100 million records, has two Oscar Original Song nominations (for “Nine to Five” and “Travelin' Thru”), is being recognized for her humanitarian work with the Hersholt honor. She has founded charitable and philanthropic organizations including the Dollywood Foundation and within that the literacy program Dolly Parton's Imagination Library.


	The Hersholt award, also an Oscar statuette, is given “to an individual in the motion picture arts and sciences whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry by promoting human welfare and contributing to rectifying inequities,” the Academy says.


	Last year, Governors Awards honors went to Quincy Jones and casting director Juliet Taylor, with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award given to British writer-director Richard Curtis and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to James Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. It marked only the second time in the history of the awards that no actor was chosen for the annual honors, a must-stop on the movie-awards circuit.


	The Hersholt and Thalberg awards are not always given out, and are dependent on the vote of AMPAS' Board of Governors.


	The Governors Awards are not televised, but winners are traditionally recognized during the Oscars ceremony. That would happen for this group at the 98th Oscars, set for March 16, 2026 at the Dolby Theater to be hosted again by Conan O'Brien.

	Among the weighty roles and responsibilities placed on the American president's shoulders, the least controversial is the practice of calling other politicians, in the face of personal or public tragedy, to make sure that they have everything they need. If a president wants to go above and beyond that lowest of bars, they offer condolences, and act like a human instead of a partisan hack. 


	This week, after a spree shooter killed former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, her husband, and severely injured state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, President Donald Trump hasn't bothered to pick up the phone to speak with Minnesota's head of state. 


	Shortly after 3 p.m. ET on Sunday, Rolling Stone asked Gov. Tim Walz's office if he had received a call from Trump yet. A spokesperson for the Democratic governor replied, “We haven't heard from him,” adding that former President Joe “Biden called yesterday midday shortly after all the news broke.”


	Asked if Trump had ever called Walz, who took office in 2019, in previous moments of crisis or emergency, to speak cordially or professionally, the governor's spokesperson said, flatly, “Yes.”

	











	On Monday, Walz told reporters that he had yet to hear from President Trump in the aftermath of Saturday's murders, which resulted in a state-wide, two day manhunt before the suspect — 56 year old Vance Boelter — was apprehended. 


	By Tuesday morning, it appeared the president was not just committed to giving Walz the silent treatment, but to openly spurning the governor, who ran against him and J.D. Vance as the vice presidential candidate on the 2024 Democratic ticketSpeaking to reporters Tuesday on Air Force One, Trump stated that he had no interest in calling the former vice presidential candidate. “I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I'm not calling,” Trump said. “The guy doesn't have a clue, he's a mess… so, you know, I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?”

	











	This wasn't a one-off moment of being loose-lipped with reporters. A source with direct knowledge of the matter says that Trump has been relentlessly trash-talking the Minnesota governor behind the scenes since the horrific news broke. “He's not letting up,” the source said.

	When Trump asserted to reporters on the presidential plane that he had no interest in speaking to Walz, he justified himself by claiming that the governor had “appointed this guy to a position,” seeming to suggest that Walz himself may bear some responsibility for the tragedy. Boelter — who allegedly had a hit list of over 45 local and state lawmakers, including Walz — previously served as a political appointee on the Minnesota governor's Workforce Development Board. The appointment did not originally take place under Walz, but under his predecessor — former Governor Mark Dayton, also a Democrat. Walz renewed Boelter's term in the low-profile political position in 2019. 


	The Trump administration has made a show of pursuing hardline policies against politically motivated violence. Attorney General Pam Bondi has charged individuals who vandalized Tesla cars and dealerships with terrorism, she is seeking the death penalty for alleged United Healthcare CEO assassin Luigi Mangione, and her department charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) with assaulting a federal agent after a chaotic incident at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center.But this public fixation on combating political violence has always been incredibly self-serving. Terrorism charges remain conspicuously absent from the federal indictment against Boelter, and Trump was not the only GOP lawmaker to downplay the assassination.

	Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) wrote on X that Boelter's actions are “what happens when Marxists don't get their way.” In another post, Lee joked that Bueter — who wore a halloween mask to commit the murders — was a “Nightmare on Waltz Street.” 


	Minnesota Senator Tina Smith, a Democrat, tracked down Lee in the U.S. Capitol and confronted him directly about the posts. “I wanted him to know how much pain that caused me and the other people in my state, and I think around the country, who think that this was a brutal attack,” Smith told reporters of their conversation. “I needed him to hear from me directly what impact I think his cruel statement had on me, his colleague.”

The superstar famously doesn't celebrate birthdays, only anniversaries.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Some people might be obsessed with time, but Mariah Carey thinks the concept is nothing more than a thing of fantasy.


	In a recent interview with Capital FM posted Monday (June 16), the superstar once again stated how she refuses to acknowledge the passage of time. Carey has long said she doesn't subscribe to the construct of days, weeks and years, and has also asserted that she doesn't have birthdays — only anniversaries. 


	“Is it true you don't acknowledge the passing of time?” one interviewer asked, to which Carey confirmed, “That is true.”


	“I just don't believe in it,” she continued. “No, no, just time. Let it go. I don't have a birthday, no. Anniversaries, yes.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Carey's belief system also means that coordinating a so-called “time” to meet up with someone is not a viable option for her.  “Yeah, I would have somebody call you and figure it out,” she calmly replied when asked how she goes about making appointments.


	Mimi's commitment to being free from the constraints of time dates back years. In an old interview reshared by the singer in 2023, a younger Carey explains, “I don't have birthdays … I decided to do that. And I've noticed that people who decide not to have birthdays, they just don't have them.”

	











	That said, the “anniversary” of Carey's ethereal existence is on March 27 each year. This year, she marked the occasion by sharing a photo of herself on a jet ski and writing on Instagram, “Thank you lambily for the anniversary wishes and for always making me so happy!!!”


	Carey's interview comes on the heels of her new single, “Type Dangerous,” which marks her first proper release since 2018. The track just debuted at No. 95 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated June 21, 2025 — not that she would recognize such a time stamp — becoming her 50th career entry on the chart.

	Amazon MGM Studios has confirmed what was reported last night: Twisters star Glen Powell is starring in a Ron Howard directed untitled firefighter film. 


	The pitch came from Christina Hodson. Imagine Entertainment and Powell's banner, Barnstorm, are producing. 


	Howard knows something about firefighter movies: He directed the classic Backdraft. Hodson's script follows disparate childhood friends, now elite firefighters, who must rekindle their fractured relationship when a series of deadly fires sweep across Texas.


	Producers are Imagine Entertainment's Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and Jeb Brody, and Barnstorm's Dan Cohen and Glen Powell. Christina Hodson will serve as EP.

	Powell received a Golden Globe nom in Best Actor Musical/Comedy for the Netflix comedy Hit Man. He will next star in the highly anticipated series Chad Powers, which he also co-created and co-wrote, and will soon star in Edgar Wright's The Running Man for Paramount Pictures, which is slated to be released on Nov. 7. The Top Gun: Maverick star also recently wrapped production on the revenge thriller Huntington, and is currently in production in JJ Abrams' upcoming film for Warner Bros.

	











	Hodson first transitioned from development executive to screenwriter in 2012. Since then, her produced credits include being the sole screenwriter of Bumblebee for Paramount (2018) and both Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey (2020) and The Flash (2023) for Warner Bros. and DC Comics. Among various projects for the studios, Hodson's recent work includes co-writing a screenplay for the 11th installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise with Oren Uziel. In addition to writing, Hodson served as a co-producer on Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey, and is producing through her company, Hodson Exports, which she runs with executive Morgan Howell.

Watching Elio, the title character of Pixar‘s latest film, it's difficult not to draw comparisons to another child hero underneath the Disney umbrella. Introduced as a shy child reeling from an unspecified accident that took his parents' life, the 11-year-old bursts out of his shell upon an encounter with an installation speculating of life beyond the stars and emerges as a hyperactive, alien-obsessed weirdo who runs around wearing a cape and metal colander helmet, speaks in a made-up language he calls “Elio-ese,” and drives his Air Force aunt Olga (Zoe Saldaña) crazy. 

 










From the tragic backstory to the misfit behavior to the tense relationship with his guardian, Elio might as well be the male version of Lilo from Disney's similarly sci-fi themed “Lilo & Stitch” — it doesn't help that plenty of people went to go see the remake just last month.

The crucial difference? In the original 2002 animated film that introduced her, Lilo won the hearts of viewers because she was such a specific, sharply written weirdo. She was rough around the edges, bratty and mean, and with eccentricities — a love of Elvis Presley, a belief that a fish on her nearby beach can control the weather — that were singular to her and her alone. Elio is a teddy bear in comparison: he's too instantly sympathetic to ever get properly annoyed at, and his obsession with aliens feels more banal and less personal, a way of acting out after the death of his parents rather than a real passion inside himself. He's easy to like, a sweet kid voiced winningly by spirited child actor Yonas Kibreab. But, like the movie that bears his name, he's a bit too forgettable to fall in love with. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Any Pixar film that's been released since roughly the mid-2010s invites a perhaps unfair game of comparison, measuring how it stacks up to the studio's golden period of the 2000s, when every other film they produced was an instant classic. “Elio” certainly is a fair sight better than much of the company's latest output, which has geared more toward regurgitating old ideas or sputtering around in shallow storylines. And yet watching it feels a slight bit depressing at the same time, a reminder that where Pixar's films once led the animation industry, taking out there concepts like rats that want to cook and robots that want to find love and bringing exquisite heart to them, they now feel imitative instead of innovative.

If there were ever a version of “Elio” that had the spark of an old Pixar classic, it got shuffled out of existence by a turbulent production process that saw original director Adrian Molina, who previously helmed the company's Oscar-winner “Coco,” replaced by the duo of Domee Shi — whose hilarious “Turning Red” remains the best Pixar film of the 2020s by a significant margin — and Madeline Sharafian, known for directing the short “Burrow.” Molina based the film's original story concept heavily on his own life, and the directorial transition occurred right around Pixar head Pete Docter admitting the studio would be pivoting away from “personal stories” driven by directors to films with universal mass appeal. Certain elements of the script directly based on Molina's life, such as Elio's mother working for the military, got rewritten entirely.

 










The directorial change-up feels readily apparent throughout “Elio's” 90-minute running time. That's not necessarily due to plot holes or pacing — the film clips along its standard beats at a steady pace, only lagging during one spaceship ride near the end that comes across as pure filler — but the overall feeling that it's only dipping its toes into the emotional and creative depths of this story.

Elio's desire to be abducted by aliens, a reaction to his miserable loneliness on Earth, leads him to send a message via a satellite at his aunt's base to the stars pleading for extraterrestrials to come abduct him. The message gets received not just by a spacecraft but by the Communiverse, a roaming planet-like spaceship holding an international committee of representatives from across several galaxies. Getting whisked away into this fantastically technicolor world is a dream come true for Elio, enough that he's willing to go along with it when the committee reveals their misread that he's the leader of Earth. To secure his place in their ranks, he bravely/insanely plunges himself into solving a diplomatic crisis between the alliance and Lord Grigon (a suitably hammy Brad Garrett), the “blood emperor” of a warlike race of alien worms from the planet Hylurg, who seeks revenge on the ambassadors for rejecting his bid to join them.

 










All of this looks fantastic — while on Earth, Elio suffers a bit from that squishy, rounded animation style that's recently become more or less Pixar's house look. In space, the movie experiments more, adding splashes of 2D graphic animation and gorgeous technicolor around the stately white spaces Elio inhabits. The alien designs are suitably weird and inspired, from the mind-reading floating manta ray Questa (Jameela Jamil) to the rock monster Tegmen (Matthias Schweighöfer). One can detect sci-fi inspirations from “E.T.” to “Star Wars” all over the film's DNA, and in its funniest and most memorable moments it takes cues from sci-fi horror of all things, including the introduction to Grigon's son Glordon (Remy Edgerly), which has a whiff of both H. R. Giger in the character design and Ridley Scott in the blocking.

But, as fun and creative as some of the individual parts of this spaceship are — from the chibi supercomputer sprite that gives Elio the ability to communicate with other aliens to the cloning goo he uses to explain away his absence on Earth — on a whole, the Communiverse is never as wondrous as you want it to be. None of the ambassadors get enough individuality for us to actually care about them, and their actual goals as an organization are too vague to grasp. Grigon is amusing as a warlord who, at heart, is really a beleaguered dad — he reminds one of Bowser in the Mario games more than any past Pixar character — but his softness is telegraphed a bit too early for him to ever be a convincing threat, even to children. This wondrous world up in the stars too frequently feels more like an amusement park for Elio to run and geek around in than a living, breathing universe.

 










The real problem, though, might be the material that's earth-bound. “Elio” draws clear parallels between Grigun's issues relating to Gideon and Elio's disconnect from his aunt Olga, and his desire for alien approval comes from a deeply wounded sense of pain that he no longer belongs on Earth after the passing of his parents. There's some great raw material here, and yet onscreen it never gets to compelling territory. Elio and Olga are simply too generic, stock types that can be found in plenty of modern animated films, for their friction to ever build into something as compelling as, say, Marlin and Nemo's strained father-son relationship. 

It doesn't help that Saldaña, whose character is meant to be the story's heart, sounds like she's phoning it in a bit in the voiceover booth. There's no specificity to Elio's circumstances on Earth — his trauma from his parents' deaths gets mostly brushed over, the isolation he feels from his peers is represented via a stock bully, even the town he lives in is a generic suburbia — which makes his yearning to escape to the stars ring hollow.

So, by the time Rob Simonsen's rather generic score begins to overdo the bombast and the film gears up for an emotional decision from Elio about where he belongs that it has to take more than a few logical leaps to arrive at, the pathos falls a tiny bit flat. It's difficult not to wonder what “Elio” could have been like, had the original concept from Molina made it onscreen, and whether or not the more “personal” version of this story had the sharp edges and specificity needed to elevate the film from a cute kids' film to something more meaningful. 

 










“Elio” isn't a bad time at the theaters — it's pretty to look at, charming enough, and frequently funny. But by shying away from investing in where its main character is coming from, the movie makes his galactic adventures feel a bit weightless.

Disney will release “Elio” in theaters on Friday, June 20.

Film Editor, Awards


F1: The Movie starts, ominously enough, with the black Warner Bros logo, which suggests it's going the be The Dark Knight Rises of sports movies. But although it never really relaxes into the fun, '60s-style Paul Newman picture it might have been, F1 never takes itself too seriously. You might go to it with solemn images in mind of the old-school maverick driver classics — Grand Prix (1966) and Le Mans (1971) — which is a vibe director Joseph Kosinski does prize highly and a role that fits Brad Pitt quite snugly. But there's an amiable surrogate-family movie just vrooming to get out, and the strange thing is that the recent release it more strongly resembles, down to its weird, squishy logo, is the last Mission: Impossible, since, although it's definitely about the American way of winning, the emphasis is as much on high-tech teamwork as it is on traditional star wattage.

	











	There's a significant overlap with Once Upon a Time's Cliff Booth in Sonny Hayes, the driver Pitt plays. Unlike the recent M:I movie, his age is mentioned — and mentioned a lot, never in an admiring way. In fact, we start the movie at the 24 Hours of Daytona race, an endurance event that he is clearly doing for the money. His backstory involves a terrible crash at the Spanish Grand Prix in his 30s that still gives him nightmares (and explains the film's cryptic opening, in which calming ocean waves are interpolated with gritty video images of a high-speed race). Sonny, we learn, is the couldabeen that never was, his rock 'n' roll bona fides confirmed when Kosinski drops Led Zeppelin's “Whole Lotta Love” onto the soundtrack, making great use of its atonal midsection.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Everything is laid out here, from Sonny's contempt for authority to his capacity for superstition. He gambles; before every race he pockets a playing card (sight unseen); and whenever he wins, he refuses to handle the cup (“It's bad luck,” he believes). But like the gangster who's out of the game, his past comes calling when a face from the past shows up while he's doing his laundry. Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem) is an old adversary who now runs APXGP and is $350 million in the hole. “I need a new driver,” he says, flashing an old magazine cover touting their young selves as The Rising Stars of F1. Sonny says no, but Cervantes won't hear it. “What would he want you to do?” asks Cervantes, pointing to Sonny's younger, blonder self. “Join a boy band?” he shrugs.


	Inevitably, Sonny does join the team, led by star driver Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), who greets Sonny with horror and prompts a lot of talk about whether an oldie has ever won an F1 race (that will be Luigi Fagioli, who was 53 when he won the 1951 Grand Prix in France). Their sparring goes exactly the way you think it might, and Pearce soon begins to see and appreciate the long-gestating method in Sonny's madness (there's a lot of talk about cold and hot tires, and the judicious timing of pit stops). But then, Sonny wins over the whole team too, from company board director Peter Banning (Tobias Menzies) to team manager Kaspar Molinski (the great Kim Bodnia) and, most crucially, APXGP's technical director Kate McKenna (Kerry Condon), a science genius nursing a broken heart.


	The plot, such as it is, involves Sonny's unorthodox attempts to get APXGP back on track, and although you know which way the wind will blow in the end, there's a lot of enjoyable, self-deprecating bathos that you would probably never get from a Tom Cruise movie. Unfortunately, Sonny's hijinks don't exactly chime with the way Formula One is heading (to borrow Donald Trump's famous phrase on encountering a Tesla for the first time, “Everything's computer!”). As a result, the film seems to toggle between a nostalgia for the traditional iconography of the lone man at the wheel (Sonny's mantra is “put your head down and drive”) and a respect for the technicians that, through aerodynamic design and such, snatch all-important fractions of sections when racing at over 200 mph.


	Inevitably, F1 does somewhat sidestep criticisms of the Formula One community, but it does land some punches when it can, in terms of the organization's vice-like grip and the absurd proliferation of branding (Kosinski's film has it both ways, with much placement for Expensify and Tommy Hilfiger). It probably also romanticizes the sport's largely male skew, leavening Condon's role as the sole female (apart from Pearce's overly protective mum), who also serves as the film's sort of age-appropriate love interest.


	Where it will place in the summer-movie stakes, however, is hard to predict, given the fate of recent race movies such as James Mangold's Ford v Ferrari (a hit) and Michael Mann's Ferrari (very much not a hit). Awards prognostication is similarly fuzzy too, although technical noms will be its strongest play. But whether or not it finds it audience (and there are probably a lot of Easter eggs for viewers who know a hell of a lot more about Formula One than I do), F1 is proof that brand Pitt is still a viable option and, like Tom Cruise, can still hold a movie the old-fashioned way, putting pedal to the metal.

	The average Formula One vehicle averages about 130 mph, though with the right person behind the wheel, you can push it up to 250 mph. (Don't try this at home, kids.) You also need a great piece of machinery, of course, and a professional crew making sure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. It takes a virtual village to dominate the circuit. But the difference between a competition-level team and a championship one often comes down to who is sitting in the cockpit. 


	“Do we have the car?” someone asks late in F1, the Formula One drama that hopes to both sell the motorsport to those who don't know a McClaren from a McRib and ride in the wake of this globally popular, billion-dollar phenomenon. “WE HAVE THE DRIVER!” intones Javier Bardem, with a solemnity that would make Moses put down the 10 commandments and break into a slow clap. We'll second the Oscar-winner's assertion. A tale of a veteran taking one last shot at the checkered flag, a hotheaded youngster in need of a mentor, and an underdog team gunning for glory via a sports-film narrative that couldn't be more formulaic — please tip your waiters! — this throwback to old-school blockbusters is indeed a well-oiled, finely tuned operation. Most importantly, however, is that it definitely has the driver. Never mind the horse power. The fuel running this sleek, aerodynamic speedster of a movie is 100-percent pure star power.

	











	They call him Mr. Pitt — and even before you officially meet the man-above-the-title's character Sonny Hayes, a.k.a. “the best that never was,” you can feel the movie setting him up as a misfit legend rebel genius. Serene images of nature are interspersed with en media race footage, cars whizzing and whooshing around a first-person POV. This is what plays in Hayes' head before he exits the sacred space that is the van he lives in, and starts his slow trek to the track for a race. In this case, the event happens to be the 24 Hours of Daytona, which officially kicks off the racing season. He gets into car, runs his section his way, and thanks to Hayes' lead, the team walks away with the trophy. (Our hero won't touch the cup, however — he claims it's bad luck.) The fact that he manages all this in the time it takes to play Led Zeppelin's “Whole Lotta Love” only makes it, y'know, a 100 times cooler. Then Sonny walks away, “one and done,” ready to head whichever way the wind will blow him next. The off-road Baja 500 is coming up. Maybe he can nab a spot there.

	But who should walk into the Orlando laundromat that Hayes is killing time in than his old friend, Ruben (Bardem). Once upon a time, these two were fellow up-and-coming drivers, each pole-positioned to become Formula One's Next Big Thing. Then Hayes was involved in an accident during a big race against Ayrton Senna, and proceeded to spend the next 30 years drifting into obscurity. Ruben, meanwhile, has become the owner of APXGP, an F1 team languishing comfortably in perpetual last place. He's now 350 million in the hole, and about to lose the team. Someone needs to help them turn things around. Why not Sonny? The answer is a solid no. Until it isn't, and Hayes shows up at the team's practice track, sauntering in like he's already won.


	Because he already has — when you're a hot shot played by Brad Pitt, strolling through a film that has beautifully set you up to be the human equivalent of a racecar running on all cylinders yet blissfully defiant of anything resembling “the rules,” it's all over but the checkered-flag waving, right? Well, not quite. Hayes still has to win over Joshua Pearce (Snowfall‘s Damson Idris, leveling up in a massive way), the rookie who's got the right stuff but has to learn the ropes, etc.; he's wary of this dinosaur coming in and potentially stealing his thunder. The same goes for Kasper (Kim Bodnia), the Danish group principal, and Kate (Kerry Condon), the Irish technical director, neither of whom trust this geriatric newbie to pull off a miracle. We should note that, starting with a press conference announcing Hayes as the newest addition to APXGP, everyone from journalists to Pearce's mom (Sarah Niles) and manager (Samson Kayo) begin making cracks about Sonny's age. Shortly thereafter, F1 has the star dipping himself shirtless into an ice bath, as if to say: Yeah, the dude's old, but he's like Hot Sixtysomething Brad Pitt old.

	Hayes has also got to learn that Formula One is a team sport, not an individual one, even if you take into account that whole thing we said above about the MVP driver being the only one that matters. He will need to balance humility with experience and talent; understand that even his undeniably brilliant, eccentric tactical actions have IRL consequences; and battle not just professional setbacks but those pesky personal demons. No matter how “meetings” involving downing shots and impromptu poker games between Sonny and Joshua are co-ordinated by their peacemaking technical director, the trust between these two aces must be earned one lap at a time. If you believe that the flirty, flinty banter between Sonny and Kate earmarks the latter as Sassy Irish Romantic Interest — thankfully, Condon is way too graceful and instinctual an actor to let her character devolve into a stereotype — then you should trust your gut. (She comes off much better than the female crew member who keeps conspicuously fucking things up early on, and seemingly exists just to highlight Hayes' emotional largesse when she eventually becomes invaluable.) If you think that Tobias Menzies' corporate gladhander immediately gives off Big Judas Energy, congratulations: You know how movies work. 

	











	Former engineer-turned-filmmaker Joseph Kosinski knows how to make all of this work — he was the director responsible for Top Gun: Maverick, another gigantic epic that revolved around a major star, a lot of spectacle, the star as a spectacle unto themselves, and a need for speed. And like that industry-saving hit, this is a project that pushes the idea of collective effort in the forefront, yet still gleefully sells the idea that only a single superior, protocol-ignoring human being can get the job done. They practically feel like companion pieces. Kosinski could have called this Form' One: Maverick and no one would have blinked. 


	And like that Tom Cruise sequel, F1 plays up the fact that authenticity, verisimilitude and a you-are-there-feeling can often make the difference between a fun afternoon at the moving pictures and an immersive adrenaline rush. The marketing has been playing up the fact that the production embedded itself within the actual Formula One circuit for a season, the Pitt crew intermingled with actual pit crews, the actors are actually driving in a number of scenes, and a gaggle of real-life Formula One personalities lend their presences in the name of making this feel realer than real. It helps to get Lewis Hamilton to play Lewis Hamilton — yes, the “Through goes Hamilton!” moment is recreated here, complete with hyperventilating commentary — especially when you've brought on Lewis Hamilton as a producer. Kosinski and Maverick cinematographer Claudio Miranda also pulls out the technical stops, utilizing bleeding-edge cameras and continually busting out a swerving pan that seamlessly swings from driver's viewpoint to side profile, which somehow manages to feel awe-inspiring after the 100th use. Most of us had never flown a Boeing Super Hornet, and most of will never take a customized F1 car for a spin in Abu Dhabi. The gamble is that such first-rate second-hand thrills will make up for a 250mph ride through extremely familiar terrain.

	It does, for the most part, and certainly helps distinguish F1 from becoming nothing but this generation's Days of Thunder. Both films are courtesy of super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer's ability to sell the public what they want, only louder, faster and soundtracked by NASCAR-dad–friendly jock jams. His touch is evident throughout, though that's not what makes this feel like such a giddy throwback. It's the way that what's clearly designed as a star vehicle knows that the emphasis is on “star.”

	











	A-listers are still being minted in the 21st century, but few can truly carry a picture of this scope and magnitude and not play second fiddle to the sound and fury. The way that Pitt injects his presence, his physicality, his charm, his well-honed screen persona, his particular mix of discipline and DGAF effortlessness, and his backhanded way of making outdated, Golden Age Hollywood roguishness feel completely somehow timeless is what makes this a winner. He even manages to upstage the cars. It's a turn that reminds you of Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster, William Holden, and, notably Steve McQueen, no stranger to movies about racing. (It can't be a coincidence that one of Hayes' Zen-like pastimes is throwing a ball against a wall like McQueen in The Great Escape.) F1 couldn't feel more contemporary in its focus over a sport that's the current obsession of millions, yet couldn't feel more like a flashback to a bygone age where a larger-than-life movie star was the only necessary I.P. This what blockbusters used to look like. Come for the most impressive, lustrous car that a gajillion-dollar budget can buy. The reason to stay, however, is the driver.

In a clever flex of corporate synergy, Apple promoted its first summer blockbuster with the release of a haptic trailer that imitates the purr of an F1 engine in the palms of your hands. The clip delivers such well-calibrated vibrations that watching it on an iPhone makes it seem like you're microdosing 4DX right on the subway, or the toilet, or wherever it is you choose to enjoy the film industry's latest breakthrough in vertical integration. 

But the real potency of this ad, and the real potential of the technology that it represents, can only be experienced by viewing the promo on mute — the haptic feedback is so nuanced and expressive that you can literally feel the basic plot and emotions of Joseph Kosinski's “F1” through your fingertips. It's the closest thing to “pure cinema” I've ever enjoyed on a device that I primarily use for playing Marvel Snap and Googling answers to my five-year-old son's trivia questions (yes, a rhino could outrun Usain Bolt).

How disappointing, then, that the film itself manages to offer so little of the same thrill, despite the benefit of booming Dolby speakers, the scale of an IMAX screen, and the sleekness of a director whose aesthetic naturally cleaves towards Apple commercials (see: “Oblivion”). That's certainly not for lack of trying. 

 










Determined to bring the same you are there verisimilitude to race cars that they did to fighter jets in “Top Gun: Maverick,” Kosinski, cinematographer Claudio Miranda, and superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer have gone to extraordinary lengths to capture the essence of F1 — lengths that include turning Brad Pitt and co-star Damson Idris into legit Grand Prix drivers, attaching hi-def micro-cameras to the frames of their vehicles as the actors whipped around the world's most famous tracks, and filming at the actual events that are depicted in the movie. 

Not only was the fictional APXGP team granted its own garage right between Scuderia Ferrari and Mercedes, but the pre-race party Idris' character attends before the tour's Las Vegas pitstop is even hosted by the real DJ Tiësto! “F1” is far too sincere in its crowd-pleasing ambitions to feel like a fully licensed piece of $200 million sponcon, but the movie's commitment to authenticity extends to every aspect of its titular sport, both on the track and off, as its mission to win over new converts is only outdone by its eagerness to satisfy diehard fans. 

Alas, Formula One has always been a testament to the difficulty of striking the right balance between power and precision, and “F1” embodies that aspect of the sport all too well. Always entertaining for how effectively it welds hyper-modern spectacle to the chassis of a classic underdog story (the latter part of that equation paving the way for Pitt's most Billy Bean-coded performance since “Moneyball”), Kosinski's film can be propulsive and exhilarating in spurts, but in working so hard to satisfy newbies and experts at the same time that it often struggles to seize on its simplest pleasures. Misfits becoming teammates. Losers finding redemption. Cars going really, really fast. 

 










All of these things are key parts of the mix, but for a movie so preoccupied with the difference between sound and noise (what's relevant to a racer at 200 M.P.H. vs. what they need to tune out), “F1” often fails to lock in on what really matters to its defining moments — a frustration that's reflected in everything from character arcs and backstories to shot selections and the incessant use of broadcast-like color commentaries. Your whole body will vibrate for the better part of this film's speedy 156-minute running time, and few other blockbusters this summer will be more fun to experience at a level of volume that you can't get at home, but loudness is a sad consolation prize for a movie whose own trailer didn't need any sound at all to better capture the flow state that its protagonist lives to chase.

Sonny Hayes (Pitt) hasn't enjoyed the most storied of professional racing careers, but you can tell from his name alone — a perfect movie name — that he was born to be in the driver's seat, and that he doesn't belong anywhere else. A future star of the F1 circuit until a devastating 1993 crash turned him from a “will be” to a “never was,” Sonny has spent the last 30 years as a wandering samurai who's taken any job that came attached to a pair of wheels, from a stock car racer to a New York City cab driver. 

 










Somewhere between a stoic Western archetype and a shit-eating myth, he lives in a van where he can suffer hotly in peace. The money never mattered to Sonny (he only needed enough to support his gambling addiction), and winning has always been little more than a means to an end — the shortest path to the self-actualization that he gets from being one with the road. Except, three decades of feeling like a loser seems to have taken its toll, and the first thing he tells his Daytona teammate in the film's opening scene is that he'll kill him if the guy blows their lead. 

This is as much insight as we'll ever get into the tao of Sonny, but it's enough to understand why he hesitates when his old racing buddy Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), now the desperate owner of the worst team on the F1 circuit, shows up with an unprecedented offer for a washed-up 60-year-old nobody: Become the not-so-new face of APXGP and save what's left of their season so that Ruben doesn't lose the company. It's a hail Mary, and Sonny isn't sure the risk of embarrassment is worth the paycheck that comes with it, but he can't turn down the chance at the glory that once got away from him and/or the chance to drive the world's fastest cars. 

And so, before we even get to the title card, Ehren Kruger's sleek and sturdy script has already put the story's foundation in place. All that's left is for Sonny to spar with APXGP's hotshot rookie driver (an instantly compelling Idris as cocky London native Joshua Pearce, all flash to Sonny's zen-like calm), make eyes at the sport's first female technical director (the ever-appealing Kerry Condon, squeezing worlds of personality out of a human plot device), and learn to get out of his own way as he comes to appreciate that F1 is a team sport. A few other bits take shape in the margins, including a garbled subplot involving Tobias Menzies as a techbro financier and some “Ted Lasso”-adjacent hijinks with APXGP's winsome pit crew (unrelated to “Lasso” alum Sarah Niles' performance as Joshua's mom), but “F1” is generally as straightforward and predictable as any of the nine different tracks that Sonny zooms around over the course of the film. 

 










In theory that should work to the benefit of this vintage Bruckheimer vehicle, and occasionally it does. The simplicity of the film's story makes it easier for Kosinski to accommodate the arcane nature of F1's rules, even if he never finds a satisfying way to incorporate them on the fly, and — similar to Kruger's script for “Maverick” — the lack of a clear villain for most of the movie allows the focus to remain squarely on the main characters, who are racing against each other and themselves to a much greater degree than they are any of the drivers from rival teams. 

But where “Maverick” was able to support that focus with decades of baked-in pathos, “F1” is forced to rely on the ample charms of its cast. While no one will ever get bored watching Pitt and Idris push each other's buttons, there isn't exactly a world of depth behind Sonny's leathered renegade schtick (it's a bit tiresome how many times he races outside the lines without alerting the rest of his team), just as the complexities of Joseph's arrogance are mostly hidden in the folds of Idris' performance. 

More frustrating is that the actual racing sequences are less expressive than the dialogue scenes. While the realism of the film's grand prix events is obviously second to none (silly as some of Sonny's rule-skirting gambits can be), and Kosinski has a proven track record of making speed look even cooler in the movies than it does in real life, “F1” makes the mistake of trying to reconcile the experience of driving Formula One with the experience of watching it on TV. 

 










The most obvious symptom of that is the aforementioned broadcast commentary, which narrates literally everything that happens during the races. In large part, that's a necessary evil of a film that has to explain how placing, safety cars, and tire grades work to an audience of neophytes in real-time. But in order to disguise the expository function of the commentary and affirm the authenticity of the average fan's F1 experience (which is to say: enjoying the races from their couch rather than the stands), the narration is also prone to saying things like “Sonny has fallen to last place! That's not going to make AXPGP happy.” On TV, that sort of color helps confer a narrative onto unconstructed reality. In the context of this movie, it crushes the reality out of a constructed narrative. 

The driver's seat of an F1 car is pretty small to begin with, and Kosinski's film — which constantly defaults to a “Star Wars”-like cockpit shot in order to show us Sonny's face while proving that Pitt is actually behind the wheel — leaves viewers precious little space to engage with the film's characters on their own terms. The emotional impact is so blunted that our only choice is to surrender to the booming spectacle of it all (Hans Zimmer, take the wheel), but even that proves difficult in a film that never quite solves how to handle the sameness of a 44-lap race. 

 










Kosinski is limited to 15 camera positions on each car, few of which capture anything more than wheel-to-wheel intensity, and he compensates for that lack of choice by restlessly cutting between them. It's as if the film is trying to reflect Sonny's agitated pursuit of clarity amid the chaos (a suspicion that's strengthened by subtle changes in the editing towards the end), and every merciful retreat to a top-down angle feels like a concession to the fact that Kosinski hasn't found a more satisfying way to shoot F1 than they do on TV. 

The action is hardly dull, but the sheer disconnect between the wowee zowee immediacy of the race footage and the mezzo mezzo excitement it inspires suggests that tuning out the noise isn't as easy as Sonny Hayes might seem to think. “Sometimes when you lose, you win,” Ruben tells his old friend. And sometimes when you win, this solid but underwhelming blockbuster contends, you still lose.  

Apple Original Films and Warner Bros. Studios will release “F1” in theaters on Friday, June 27.

Sarah Jessica Parker couldn't help but wonder why her iconic “Sex and the City” and “And Just Like That” character Carrie Bradshaw has been “condemned” by audiences. Well, that's just the gender bias for you. 

The actress told HuffPost UK that Carrie being deemed an unlikeable female lead has more to do with fan reactions rather than the character itself. “It's always interesting to me that [Carrie is] so condemned, but a male lead on a show can be a murderer, and people love him,” Bradshaw said. “If a woman has an affair, or behaves poorly, or spends money foolishly […] there's a kind of punitive response to it.”

The memes of Carrie eating Chinese takeout leftovers out of Natasha's (Bridget Moynahan) fridge after having an affair with her husband, Big (Chris Noth), is just one of the many cringe Carrie moments that have gone hate-viral. However, Parker does welcome the discord to some degree.

“I ultimately think that all those feelings are pretty fantastic,” Parker said of the controversy and knee jerk reactions to Carrie's choices throughout both series. “That kind of connection and those kinds of strong feelings, both positive and negative, are pretty wonderful. People are kind of captive in those moments to something, and I think that's perfectly fine.”

 










Parker added that Carrie is one of the “smart people [who] make bad decisions sometimes [and] are foolish in judgement,” especially since Carrie has “made mistakes” and “not been mature in love.”

“I think, fundamentally, Carrie is an extraordinarily decent and good person – an extremely devoted friend, she's generous of spirit and time, in all she has to offer,” Parker said. 

Parker's former co-star Kim Cattrall recently spoke out about the legacy of her own “Sex and the City” character, Samantha. Cattrall told The Times that she still disagrees with some audience reactions to the beloved role. “[Samantha] wasn't a nymphomaniac — well, some people might have thought she was — but she was just enjoying the main course,” Cattrall said. “Everyone else was nibbling on the appetizers when she was going for the steak. And it was always on her terms — that I always insisted on.”

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Justin Kroll 


	When it came to casting the lead in DC Studios' next big movie Clayface, the studio went with a fresh face, that being Welsh actor Tom Rhys Harries.


	The actor from the Uma Thurman-starring Apple TV series Suspicion and such movies as Uberto Pasolini's The Return (starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche), the Gerard Butler action title Kandahar and Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen, landed the role from a competitive list of British thespians that included 28 Years Later‘s Jack O'Connell, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes‘ Tom Blyth and 1917‘s George MacKay.


	The movie, from Speak No Evil director James Watkins, is the next big project for James Gunn and Peter Safran's DC Studios after next summer's Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, scheduled for release on September 11, 2026. Clayface will be shooting at Warner Bros Leavesden studio in the UK.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Clayface is shape-shifting villain in the Batman comics and got his introduction as part of Detective Comics #40 in June 1940. The original Clayface was a moderately successful actor who adopted the identity of a character he'd portrayed in a horror pic after turning to crime. Clayface has a body seemingly made out of clay and has appeared over the years in various films, series, animated works, video games and other forms of media.


	Rhys Harries, repped by UTA, Curtis Brown Group and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher, was born in Cardiff, Wales and attended the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama. In theatre, he made his West End stage debut in 2013 in Jez Butterworth's Mojo opposite Colin Morgan, Rupert Grint and Ben Whishaw. The actor also starred in Netflix's Álex Pina-created series White Lines.

	











	Producing Clayface are Gunn and Safran as well as The Batman filmmaker Matt Reeves and Lynn Harris. Chantal Nong is executive producer. The Life of Chuck filmmaker Mike Flanagan wrote the first draft of Clayface, with additional drafts by Oscar-nominated The Wings of a Dove and Drive scribe Hossein Amini.


	DC Studios is expected to make a big splash with Gunn's Season 2 of Peacemaker at San Diego Comic-Con. DC's Superman from Gunn is opening July 11. The movie is currently projected to open to $100M+ at the domestic box office.

Donald Trump said that he will probably extend the deadline again for China‘s ByteDance to divest TikTok. 


	Asked about an extension, Trump told reporters on Air Force One, “Probably, yeah. Probably have to get China approval but think we'll get it. I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.”


	Last year, Congress overwhelmingly approved legislation to require the divestiture, or TikTok would face a ban on U.S. app stores. The Supreme Court upheld the law.


	The law went into effect on January 19, leading to a short blackout. When he took office, Trump extended the deadline into April. But he extended the enforcement of the law again, this time until Thursday.

	When the deadline extension was meant to give U.S. investors a deal to purchase TikTok, relations with China have chilled as Trump imposed tariffs, reaching 145% at one point, in the first months of his term. Among the investors working on a deal is Frank McCourt Jr., the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

	In a recent interview with Entrepreneur, McCourt said that his plan does not require acuiring the TikTok algorithm. Rather, users and their data would be migrated to an open source platform, per the publication.


	“We're advocating for a new, better, advanced Internet where individuals own and control their identity and their data,” McCourt told the publication. “We're in charge, and our social information is ours to share with others as we see fit.”


	During his first term, Trump sought a divestiture of TikTok from its China owner. But Trump's actions via executive order got sidelined in the courts. This term, he has been praiseworthy of TikTok, crediting it for helping him win over young voters.

Jason Isaacs is speaking out about his former co-star Mel Gibson. The “White Lotus” actor starred alongside Gibson in 2000 film “The Patriot” and later, 2022's “Agent Game.” However, Isaacs isn't standing by Gibson's actions, especially his infamous antisemitic rant in 2006 when being arrested for a DUI. 

Isaacs told Vulture that he actually confronted Gibson at a party after the incident. “I went, and Mel was there, and he called ‘Jace' across the room, very friendly. I went, ‘Rabbi Gibson, how are we?' He came up and he said, ‘I was really drunk, man. I was trying to get him to hit me or shoot me or something. I'm having a terrible time.' And he proceeded to unload some very personal things,” Isaacs said.

Isaacs later explained that while he doesn't quite “forgive” Gibson for his actions, he is still open to speaking with him. “[Mel] was very charming personally, and he's intelligent and self-deprecating. He's said and done some things that are unconscionable and unforgivable,” Isaacs said, adding that Gibson “was there making himself vulnerable.”

“No, you can't forgive everything from everyone. I'm not saying I forgive Mel. I've seen him once a decade for five minutes,” he added. “But if he knocked on my door tonight and said, ‘Look, my hotel's canceled. Can I stay?' I'd say, ‘Yes,' probably.”

Yet Isaacs clarified that Gibson is “not my friend” even though they “text each other once in a blue moon.” 

Gibson issued an apology after the 2006 arrest, saying that there was “no excuse” for his remarks. The “Lethal Weapon” actor also specifically apologized to the “Jewish community for the vitriolic and harmful words.” A decade after the incident, Gibson later said in 2016 while promoting “Hacksaw Ridge” that it was “annoying” and “unfair” to still be marred by his past comments.

Gibson's “Hacksaw Ridge” co-star Andrew Garfield said in 2024 that Gibson is a “real empathetic guy” who “deserves” a “second chance” in Hollywood. Garfield, who is Jewish, says that he had “deep, important conversations” with Gibson while making “Hacksaw Ridge,” adding, “He's done a lot of beautiful healing with himself. And thank God, because he's an amazing filmmaker, and I think he deserves to make films. He deserves to tell stories, because he has a very, very big, compassionate heart.”

 










Gibson is next directing “The Resurrection of the Christ,” a sequel to 2004's “Passion of the Christ,” for Lionsgate.

Acclaimed actress Danielle Deadwyler (“Till,” “The Piano Lesson”) is back on the big screen this summer with the release of R.T. Thorne's “40 Acres.” The critically praised 2024 TIFF premiere — a survival action-thriller set after a plague has destroyed animal life on Earth — doesn't open nationally until July 2. But select audiences can see the movie for free on the upcoming Juneteenth holiday, June 19, courtesy of distributor Magnolia Pictures.

As IndieWire exclusively announces, Magnolia will partner with top radio stations, DJs, and affinity groups in select U.S. cities to bring the film directly to local communities in honor of the 160-year anniversary of the end of slavery in the United States. (Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021.)

Cities and partners include Atlanta, GA (Majic 107.5/97.5), Birmingham, AL (WBHK-FM 98.7 KISS), Chicago, IL (Creative Cypher + Xl Fest), Dallas, TX (Juilliard Black Alumni Association – JBAA), Houston, TX (Prairie View University Alumni), Los Angeles, CA (Radio Free 102.3 KJLH), Nashville, TN (Joe Major from 101.1 The Beat), New Orleans (BMIKE + Eternal Seeds), and New York, NY (DJ Sussone). Radio giveaways are underway in Atlanta, Birmingham, and Los Angeles, with other organizations offering outreach as well. Free screenings take place at select Regal, AMC, and Cinemark locations for respective cities, with Los Angeles' screening taking place at Cinemark. To get a free ticket, tune into those stations or follow other organizations' social and outreach platforms.

 










Led by executive producer Deadwyler, the film also stars Michael Greyeyes, Kataem O'Connor, Leenah Robinson, Jaeda LeBlanc, Haile Amare, Elizabeth Saunders, and Tyrone Benskin. Thorne (in his feature directing debut) wrote the film with Glenn Taylor.

Here's the synopsis of the film: “In ‘40 Acres,' after a plague eradicates all animal life, famine spreads across the globe, leaving society at war and in ruins, but the Freemans are surviving — even thriving — on their ancestral farm so long as they dispatch the occasional raiding party. But what good is surviving the end of the world if it means snuffing out your own humanity? Former soldier Hailey (Deadwyler) made that choice years ago, believing that isolation was the only way to protect her family. She and her partner, Galen (Michael Greyeyes), fled the collapse along with their children, fenced them off from the world and trained them to fight (and, yes, kill). But now, Hailey's eldest, Emanuel (Kataem O'Connor), is a young man, and when he meets a young woman (Milcania Diaz-Rojas) in the forest beyond the fence, his need for human contact could place the whole family in jeopardy.”

Other upcoming Magnolia Pictures releases include Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's hit Sundance doc “Folktales,” Amy Berg's music doc “It's Never Over: Jeff Buckley,” and Sundance-winning queer thriller “Plainclothes.” Back in 2023, Magnolia got the word out on its award-winning trans documentary “Kokomo City” by offering a pay-it-forward ticket model that allowed audiences to buy a ticket for someone else. The company saw breakout box-office success from Sundance last year with the release of June Squibb-starrer “Thelma.”

	In the driving wind off the Gulf of Mexico, under the looming 480-foot-tall steel launch towers called “Mechazilla,” a group of local kids take turns whacking an Elon Musk-shaped piñata. 


	A crowd laughs as the youngest, a girl who looks about four, slaps at Musk's papier-mâché head with a thin stick. An older boy turns his stick into a spear and plunges it into Musk's stomach, which splits open revealing a trove of fruit snacks. Someone yells “Eat the rich,” and the kids rush in to scoop up handfuls of the billionaire's guts.


	Moments before, the election results had been announced. Starbase, the Cameron County development two miles down the road that houses the test facility for SpaceX rockets and is home to some 500 people, officially voted to become Texas's newest city. The final tally was a lopsided 212 to six — not a surprise since the vast majority of voters were SpaceX employees, and their boss, who now rests on the beach as a battered piñata, had publicly pushed for incorporation. Protesters, mostly from the neighboring city of Brownsville, Texas, gathered on Boca Chica Beach to express frustration that they weren't allowed to vote in an election which will surely impact them. 

	











	Since 2014, the $350 billion space-tech company has dramatically transformed this region in the deep south of Texas, known broadly as the Rio Grande Valley. New housing developments with names like Lunar Estates and Starship Landing are cropping up along the highway between Brownsville and Starbase. Local businesses have taken on rocket-themed branding — you can grab hot dogs at Space Dog Station or seafood at SpaceFish Mariscos. Musk stans have erected maybe not entirely ironic shrines to their hero throughout the region — including a 10-foot-tall deformed, gold-spray-painted plaster statue that guards the highway to Boca Chica.

	Every couple of months, rocket launches shake houses within a 15-mile radius with the force of a moderately powerful earthquake, and some have burned acres of wilderness, blown out windows, and showered the region in a drizzle of melted cement. SpaceX dumps hundreds of thousands of gallons of water used in launches into the neighboring south bay, and has destroyed nests of vulnerable shorebirds. Boca Chica, a popular local spot known as the “poor people's beach,” can now only be accessed via a highway controlled by SpaceX, and has begun frequently closing to the public to accommodate SpaceX launches.

	These changes have angered locals from Brownsville and the beach towns of Port Isabel and South Padre Island across the bay from the launch site, and brought opposition like this protest today. “These guys want to go to Mars. Let them go to Mars,” Rene Medrano, who owns a ranch along the highway from Brownsville to Starbase, tells the crowd. “The people here want to enjoy the beach. Let us enjoy the beach. This should be open forever.” 


	But SpaceX has also brought jobs and investment to the area, among the poorest in the country. A Cameron County release claims that the site employs more than 3,400 full-time SpaceX workers — many employees live in neighboring towns, while a couple hundred live in Starbase itself — and that it has created 21,400 indirect jobs, while generating $3 billion of local infrastructure investment. With that, along with tactfully deployed campaign contributions, Musk has gained support of Cameron County politicians. 


	The rockets have polarized the region and forced Cameron County residents to pick sides. It's one of the economic development debates that occur in so many local governments, only this one has been turbocharged by literal rockets shot off by the world's richest man, who doesn't seem concerned about making mistakes or enemies.

	With the incorporation vote, Musk's power and influence over the region will grow even less restrained, as he will control what is essentially a modern-day company town. With it, comes a new mayor and board of commissioners, most of whom are at-will SpaceX employees. The new municipality will be able to levy taxes on its residents, oversee permitting and zoning, initiate eminent domain, apply for municipal bonds, and charter a police department.

	











	It's a new development in company towns, according to Harvard researcher Brian Highsmith, who studies the impact of corporate power on local governments. The company towns of the Gilded Age were generally not officially incorporated so as to avoid the democratic mechanisms that could impede corporate power. “In fact the absence of those processes was in many ways the whole reason for their operation as a company town,” Highsmith says. But in the Rio Grande Valley, instead of opting out of the government, Musk has simply opted to become the government.


	As he steps away from his political project at the federal level, his power and influence over this rocket-fueled fiefdom on the Gulf continues to grow stronger, whether the locals like it or not. 


	HOMER POMPA IS A 75-YEAR-OLD Vietnam Veteran, with a weathered face and wispy white goatee, who lives in an RV three miles from the SpaceX launch site with several rheumy-eyed dobermans and two wild goats. He's retired on VA benefits, and in his free time, he watches YouTube on his phone and sings raucous blues songs at local bars. He bought this land in the early aughts, back when there were only a few dozen residents, in hopes of finding isolation at what felt like the end of the world.


	But two decades later, a small city has formed around him. As of May 3, he is a resident of the City of Starbase, though he chose not to vote in the election. “You can't stop progress,” Pompa tells me as we chat in a plywood shack behind his RV, underneath three massive wooden crosses and a 20-foot-tall watchtower he's erected to view the launches. “He has the money — he can do what he damn well pleases. Why vote if you know who's going to win?”


	Not long after Pompa bought his land, Musk, then still a liberal darling who was getting glowing press for sharing his electric car patents, set his sights on the neighborhood as a test site for SpaceX rockets. While the company already had been launching rockets from government-owned facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida, this would be a test site entirely operated by SpaceX. The spot was chosen for its latitude and relative seclusion — Musk described it as “an empty sandbar” in a recent post on X —  though, as Pompa will point out, there were people living there.


	Importantly, state and local politicians were willing to play ball. As Musk mulled other potential testing sites, Cameron County courted him by offering the company a 10-year break on property taxes. The Texas State Legislature was even more obsequious, approving a $15 million incentive package in 2013. They also passed a law that exempted space-flight entities from liability for nuisance damages caused by launches, and granted the company an exception to a provision in the Texas constitution guaranteeing residents unrestricted beach access. The latter provision allowed SpaceX to coordinate with a Cameron County commission to shut down access to Boca Chica Beach during tests.

	











	With the goodies lined up, Musk announced that SpaceX had officially chosen Boca Chica as its launch site in August 2014, and Pompa watched as the neighborhood began to grow around him. He and his handful of neighbors began receiving offers on their property, which he declined, but some accepted.


	By 2019, SpaceX had launched its first rocket from Boca Chica, the Starhopper —  a silo-shaped behemoth that was able to successfully lift off and land. The first launch so enthralled Pompa that it inspired him to write and perform a psychedelic blues song called “Half Moon Jam.” But after a while, the rockets became routine. “It's like sex,” he says. “Once you've had it, you've had it.” 


	Later tests have been less successful, though perhaps more exciting. Most dramatic was an April 20, 2023, test of the SpaceX Starship, which melted the launchpad and showered the region as far as Port Isabel in a fine cement powder. Pompa remembers a chunk of cement crashing through a windshield on his street. The two most recent tests this year were also spectacular failures, with rockets exploding over the Caribbean, scattering debris, and forcing nearby aircraft to scramble. 


	Despite the setbacks, the area has continued to grow. Work moved at a breakneck pace — buildings sprung up and were abruptly demolished when no longer needed. It's become a passion project for Musk, who keeps a house nearby, and often posts glowingly about the new city. “Starbase is so cool,” he tweeted last August. New neighbors — mostly SpaceX employees or fans — kept moving in near Pompa's land, which grew into a small subdivision. He doesn't know many of them, and they mostly keep to themselves. Pompa has never met the billionaire either, but he's developed a pretty negative opinion of him. “I'm not a cultist,” he says. “I fought for America. I didn't fight for some South African guy to come over here and tell everyone what to do.” 


	Like the piñata protesters, he is concerned about completely losing access to Boca Chica Beach, where he's gone fishing since he was a kid. Even more troubling is the possibility that the new town could use the power of eminent domain to legally seize his land for a project deemed to be in the public interest. “They can file it, and I'll wait,” Pompa tells me, his eyes darkening. “I was good at ambushes.”

	











	THE VIBES ARE OFF IN BOCA CHICA VILLAGE, the small neighborhood right next to the SpaceX facility about a mile away from Pompa's RV. It's made up of several rows of ranch homes, remnants of pre-SpaceX neighbors who have mostly moved out, along with clusters of storage container apartments and airstream trailers arranged on turf lawns. There are a couple of small parks and a restaurant called the Astropub, all of which are SpaceX property closed to the general public. I'm visiting the day before the election, and it's pretty quiet, with only a few people out and about.  


	The neighborhood features the highest concentration of Cybertrucks I've encountered, though there are plenty of pickups that belong to local Brownsville day laborers, as well. Two-thirds of people living here are men, with an average age of about 27, according to a New York Times analysis. It's a place for transplants — most residents have no history of voting in Texas.


	When former SpaceX employee Joshuah Gardner applied for housing in Boca Chica Village in 2023, he noticed a strange stipulation on his lease agreement. If they were fired from SpaceX, he remembers the lease reading, the renter would be required to vacate their property in 10 days. These firings, he calls them “purges,” were very frequent while he was working there and felt arbitrary. He remembers Musk once visiting the town while he was living there temporarily in 2021, where he interviewed supervisors and inspected the row of airstream trailers. Later that day, he says, dozens of workers were laid off. While the threat of job loss is always stressful, there's an added layer of stress here because, at Boca Chica Village, a firing also means an eviction. 


	According to Gardner, nondisclosure agreements keep workers from discussing details of their jobs with non-SpaceX employees. “It's really hard to have a social life outside of SpaceX,” he says. “Because you can't talk to anybody about anything.” Still, before he was caught up in a 2023 purge, he loved the work. “That's something about it you can't buy,” he tells me. “Being a part of a mission like that.”


	Glassdoor reviews show a similar attitude toward the site among workers who describe fulfilling work in a pressure cooker. “You are constantly in fear of being fired, and if you have uprooted your family to come to Brownsville to take the job, you cannot afford to lose it because there is nowhere else for an engineer to work,” writes one reviewer who identifies himself as a senior mechanical engineer, in a post titled “Don't Be Fooled by YouTube.” 

	











	While there aren't many residents outside, several private-security vehicles conduct a patrol along Memes Street, near Musk's house. If there's a crime in the village, these patrols are generally the first call, Gardner says, rather than the county police. When I wander off the main road through a row of Airstream trailers, on what I think is a public sidewalk, I'm quickly stopped by a burly security guard dressed in a military-grade tactical vest. He informs me that I've entered private property, and escorts me to the road 10 feet away, where he watches me from his car as I walk down the street.  


	I greet one guy wearing a black polo and a SpaceX employee badge, who is friendly, but tells me he isn't allowed to talk to me. The whole setup reminds me of what I've heard about historical company towns throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, where the threat of firing and eviction from company-owned housing kept people from speaking out about their bosses or organizing for better conditions. These towns were places where “workplace democracy and speech was almost always sharply regulated by the employer,” according to researcher Highsmith, who recently published a paper that discusses Musk's efforts to establish modern company towns in Texas. He defines a company town as a place with “an absence of friction between government and industry,” a definition which he found Starbase to meet both before and after incorporation.


	Following the May 3 vote, Starbase has moved quickly. According to documents recently filed with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, SpaceX plans to develop a $22 million community center, a $20 million school, a medical clinic, and a multifamily housing complex.


	But their broader plans have remained opaque. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on this article. One former Boca Chica resident tells me she's resorted to tweeting at Musk to try to figure out what's going on. Starbase released a statement on X on May 3 reading vaguely, “Becoming a city will help us continue building the best community possible for the men and women building the future of humanity's place in space.” The new government did not elaborate on what exactly this would entail in the lead-up to the election. New Mayor Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice president of Test and Launch, commissioner Jenna Petrzelka, a former SpaceX engineering manager and the wife of a SpaceX vice president, and Jordan Buss, the senior director of Environmental Health and Safety for SpaceX, have not spoken publicly about their plans for the city, and did not respond to our requests for comment. Campaign platforms weren't particularly necessary, since all three ran unopposed. 

	











	ACROSS THE BAY IN THE TOWN OF PORT ISABEL, at a space-themed restaurant called the Hopper Haus, barflies discuss last night's rocket-engine test as if it had been a football game or a must-watch Sunday night TV show. This one hadn't been so loud — it was conducted at Massey's Point, a new test site closer to Brownsville, not the facility directly across the bay — but it seems that something went wrong, pushing back the next launch to later in the month. Since SpaceX moved in, the community has become dramatically polarized.


	Retired surgical assistant and jazz singer Kim Zimmerman takes me through her house in the Long Island Village neighborhood of Port Isabel, a middle-class gated community along a canal that leads to the bay. They're about five miles from the main launch site. She and her partner Jim moved here in 2018, and have since seen their home more than double in value, as the neighborhood has become a target for SpaceX employees avoiding the company town environment in Boca Chica. 


	She shows me the several cracks that recently appeared in her popcorn ceiling, which she believes are caused by the launches. Out here, they feel like an earthquake — “a 4.5 or more,” she says, which spooks her cats. “I'm all for space exploration,” she says. “I just think it was built too close to civilization. What's going to happen when the big one blows up on the launchpad and rains shrapnel all over our houses?” Another neighbor shows me how he has glued down vases and photos so they aren't shaken off the wall during launches. He's not upset about SpaceX, though, in part because they allow him to make some extra cash AirBnB'ing a room to rocket fans.


	While Zimmerman is troubled by the launches, Doug Kinne, who lives down the street, sees them as a pretty unambiguous good. The 72-year-old retired ski instructor and restaurant owner's house is full of SpaceX-themed collectibles — a shovel from the Starbase groundbreaking, a model Cybertruck, and pieces of rocket that washed up in the bay. His place is the closest in Port Isabel to the launch site, and he gets a great view from his balcony, where he hosts watch parties for neighbors and traveling space enthusiasts. “I mean, you're at the future,” he says. “It's an amazing thing.” His late wife, who passed away in 2022, was an even bigger rocket fan than him, and her ashes rest in a three-foot-tall rocket-shaped urn. Kinne has noticed cracks in his ceiling as well, but he doesn't believe they could have come as a result of the launches. Hurricanes, he thinks, are the more likely culprit. When I ask if the cracks in other peoples' houses might be the result of launches, he responds firmly. “They're not,” he says. “That's the thing.”

	











	There seems to be a correlation between how people feel about Musk's recent actions in the Trump administration and how they feel about the rocket launches. Before his abrupt fallout with the president, Musk pursued an aggressive cost-cutting regime as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, purging federal employees and terminating government contracts — while leaving his own contracts, including those funding much of the work at SpaceX, untouched. Some anti-SpaceX protesters on the beach cited examples of how they had been personally harmed by Elon's DOGE'ing, including one who had been put on leave from her job at a Palo Alto Battlefield National Park earlier this year. Others in Cameron County — which supported Trump in the 2024 election — like Kinne, or Keith Reynolds, who lives within the boundaries of the new city, are fans of Musk's work in the Trump administration. Reynolds hasn't met him personally, but he has a lot of faith in the billionaire. “Will the formation of Starbase be good for me? I don't know the answer to that yet,” Reynolds tells me. “But I'm going to support Elon.”


	LETTING SOMEONE LAUNCH A 150-TON ROCKET in your backyard takes a lot of faith, or a lot of money. As SpaceX's expansion into the region has brought jobs and investment for some locals, it has also brought economic benefits to the pocketbooks of local politicians. A 2024 Reuters investigation found that in 2014, as he was accumulating his incentive package, Musk had showered state and local politicians from both parties with $150,000. In the ensuing decade, businesses associated with SpaceX and company lobbyists contributed more than $500,000 to the campaigns of two dozen elected officials from the region. One local politician bought and sold land around Starbase for a profit.


	More recently, as the SpaceX venture has spurred several environmental and public access lawsuits, Musk has set his sights on the Texas courts. In October 2024, he made a $2 million donation to the Judicial Fairness PAC, which backs Republicans in state judicial races. Notably, the PAC backed campaigns of Republican judges in the 13th Circuit Appellate Court, which covers Cameron County, and which had ruled against SpaceX in a case about public access to the Boca Chica beach in early 2024. After the election this November, the court became entirely Republican, likely more amenable to SpaceX and Musk. 

	











	Musk made another $1 million donation last year to Texans for Lawsuit Reform PAC, which funds pro-business conservative candidates in legislative and judicial races. They were the top benefactors to the two new Republican justices in the Cameron County appellate court, granting each $7,500. Two of Texans for Lawsuit Reform PAC's largest beneficiaries at the legislature were Rep. Janie Lopez and Sen. Adam Hinojosa, who received $854,849 and $700,000 from the PAC, respectively. 


	The PAC was the single largest donor to both politicians, who were the driving forces behind a State Legislature measure this year that would benefit SpaceX. A bill introduced by Lopez in the House and by Hinojosa in the Senate would transfer the right to control highway closures on the road leading to Boca Chica Beach from an independent commission to the new municipality of Starbase, essentially removing any level of public oversight from these decisions. (Lopez and Hinojosa did not respond to requests for comment.)


	The latter bill was a step too far even for generally pro-SpaceX Judge Eddie Treviño Jr., Cameron County's top executive, who spoke out against the move this March. “We think that has potential to create conflict going forward that we don't think is absolutely needed or necessary,” Treviño told local news. But the pushback was too little too late. After briefly appearing dead amid public pressure, the beach-access measure was revived in an amendment to an unrelated bill, and was passed by the legislature on June 1. 


	ON MAY 27, THE ROADS TO BOCA CHICA BEACH CLOSED for a launch. Homer Pompa perched in his tower and waited. In Port Isabel, Doug Kinne gathered a group of rocket enthusiasts on his front porch, while others in the neighborhood braced for impact.


	As the sun set over Boca Chica Beach, the 400-foot-tall Starship, the largest rocket ever built, was loaded into the Mechazilla launch tower. The rocket test was supposed to redeem the two recent failures. This time, SpaceX hoped the Starship would reach space and release several Starlink satellites before reentering the atmosphere and conducting a controlled landing in the Indian Ocean.


	On the live feed, SpaceX engineers began a countdown from 40. White smoke billowing, the 33 powerful Raptor engines activated, and the launch pad was deluged with tens of thousands of gallons of cooling water. With a massive blast and shockwave that rattled Pompa's tower, the engines pushed the rocket skyward. It wobbled slightly, before it shot up and out of sight.

	











	Fans watched on a stream as the Starship soared through the stratosphere, further than the past few missions had managed. But, at the edge of space, things started to go wrong. The bay door, which was supposed to open to release the satellites, was jammed shut. Then the spacecraft sprung a propellant leak. The rocket spiraled wildly out of control, tumbling back toward Earth. As it reentered the atmosphere, the ship broke apart, careening into the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, the booster rocket dropped into the Gulf of Mexico, debris washing up along the beach in the neighboring town of Matamoros, Mexico. Musk had announced on X that he would give a speech explaining “the Mars game plan in Starbase” following the launch, but it was canceled after the rocket was lost. The setback triggered an Federal Aviation Administration mishap investigation, the third of the year against the company.


	The following week, Musk's cushy relationship with the Trump administration suffered a similar disintegration. Musk stepped down from his role at DOGE on May 28, and quickly began criticizing Trump's flagship “Big Beautiful Bill” in a series of tweets on X. The pair of billionaires exchanged barbs on social media, and Musk's rockets were an important leverage point in the feud, with Trump threatening to cancel the billions of dollars in SpaceX's contracts, and Musk threatening to decommission the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft which had recently been used to return NASA astronauts from the International Space Station.


	But the failed launch and the squabbles with the President didn't slow the forward momentum of Starbase. Launches will be happening much more frequently after the FAA granted approval to increase the number of annual launches from 5 to 25 annually. Two days after the launch, Starbase held its first public meeting, where the town swore in city leaders, appointed a new city administrator and declared May 29th “Starbase Day.” The following day, they approved a request for a $1.5 million loan from SpaceX.


	That day, neighbors in Boca Chica Village received notices describing plans for a new Starbase zoning regime, which would establish what land in specific areas of Starbase can be used for, and which included a troubling line:


	THE CITY OF STARBASE IS HOLDING A HEARING THAT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER YOU MAY LOSE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE USING YOUR PROPERTY FOR ITS CURRENT USE, PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY.

	A meeting to discuss is set for June 23, though residents are yet to see the final proposal, which would define exactly which properties would be affected by the zoning changes. If politicians were attempting the same maneuver down the road in Brownsville, one non-SpaceX landowner who received the notice points out, the process would likely play out differently. “In Brownsville, if they pass something people are against, they'll be voted out of office,” he says. “But these guys have nothing to fear.”

	











	He's concerned that SpaceX, now armed with the powers of a local government, might be able to bulldoze the interests of the few remaining non-SpaceX neighbors, and requested to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution. “These guys have deep pockets,” he says, “and can make your life pretty miserable.”

	Amid seemingly politically-motivated assassinations at home and a fast-spiraling war in the Middle East, there was at least one extremely funny — but also, in its way, extremely grim — display of government ridiculousness for late-night television to sink its teeth into: Donald Trump's goofy-as-hell military parade/birthday party.


	The astoundingly expensive endeavor (paid for by your tax dollars) was nominally meant to commemorate the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army, but just so happened to coincide with Trump's own birthday, June 14. It was the biggest military parade in the U.S. in decades and featured a procession of troops and high-grade military hardware — from squeaky tanks to robot dogs — and was exceptionally boring. 


	“It was a $50 million version of when a five-year-old shows you every car in his Hot Wheels collection,” Jimmy Kimmel cracked. “We paid for most of it, but [Trump] brought in some corporate sponsors, including the UFC, a crypto company, and ScottsMiracle-Gro, which is the product Trump uses on his head. There were flyovers, there were combovers, the whole thing! 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Over on The Daily Show, Jon Stewart joked that, before the real insanity of this past weekend unfolded, they were going to spend much of Monday's show talking about “little Kim Jong-Trump and his big military parade/quinceañera.” And how the planned spectacle wound up paling in comparison to the reality of a large tank squeakily plodding past largely empty grandstands.

	











	“Was that tank squeaking?” Stewart asked incredulously. “We have a trillion dollar budget for the military and nobody's got WD-40?! … This was less a show of overwhelming force, and more like a military museum getting in its steps.”


	Even Trump seemed bored by the whole thing, with Jimmy Fallon sharing a clip on The Tonight Show of the president vacantly staring at the proceedings and joking, “You know it's bad when the person who looks most happy to be there is Melania. Trump was dozing off at his parade. If it wasn't for the squeaky tank, he would've been in REM sleep.”

	Many of the hosts also pointed out the glaring differences between Trump's sparsely attended parade and the “No Kings” protests that took place across the country. During Late Night, Seth Meyers highlighted the giant “No King!” formation that protesters organized themselves into on a beach in San Francisco. 


	“That's why you don't piss off a city that's amazing at graphic design,” Meyers cracked. “I'm sorry, but human beings making words that tight is like 50 times more impressive to me than robot dogs. And, look, I know in the end robot dogs win. It might not be tonight, it might not be tomorrow, but at some point, I'm gonna go to the door to get my UberEats and it's going to be a robot dog. And he's going to say something like, ‘Take a closer look at deez nuts,' before it shoots a laser through my brain. But for today, shout out to human beings!”

	The last time Paul Simon played a full concert in New York it was July 22, 2018, and he was capping off his Homeward Bound Farewell Tour in front of roughly 30,000 fans at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens. On Monday evening, after seven extremely long and tumultuous years that saw Simon enter his eighth decade, lose nearly all hearing in his left ear, and record the sparse, meditative LP Seven Psalms, Simon returned to New York City for an intimate night of music, new and old, at the Beacon Theatre.


	Before playing a note, Simon told the crowd how the concert would unfold. “Tonight's show has two parts,” he said. “The first is Seven Psalms. It's a 33-minute piece. It's uninterrupted. There are no breaks between songs. The second half, we'll play a bunch of hits, some deep cuts songs that I've never played or seldom played. We hope you have a great time.”


	The news that a veteran artist is about to play their entire new album would typically elicit silent groans throughout a classic rock audience, or at least a stampede to the bathrooms or bar, but Seven Psalms is a remarkable achievement, and fans have had two years to process it. When he kicked into its opening segment, “The Lord,” the capacity crowd fell into a hushed, reverent silence.

	Simon's hearing issues initially made him think he could never play live again. And it's likely true that the loud, electric show he brought to arenas and festival grounds back in 2018 is not something he'll be able to repeat. But Seven Psalms is a soft, acoustic work, and he recreated the chill vibe onstage with an ace band that included guitarists Mark Stewart, Gyan Riley, and Biodun Kuti, bassist Bakithi Kumalo, flute player Nancy Stagnita, and cellist Eugene Friesen.

	











	This tour is officially called “A Quiet Celebration,” and the quiet of Seven Psalms was only punctured by the occasional ringing cellphone or laughter at some of the funnier lines, like “I heard two cows in a conversation/One called the other one a name/In my professional opinion/All cows in the country must bear the blame,” in “My Professional Opinion.”

	As Simon explained, the seven parts of the album flow directly into one another, and some of the melodies and refrains are repeated throughout multiple segments. To help the audience follow along, a screen displayed the name of each chapter right as it began. And to help Simon with the harmonies on “The Sacred Harp” and “Wait,” Edie Brickell walked out to a microphone on the side of the stage and locked voices with her husband. Their musical partnership has largely existed outside of the public eye over the past three decades, and it was wonderful to finally witness their chemistry in person.


	After a brief intermission, Simon came back for the hits/deep cuts portion of the night. This was rockier territory since the songs on Seven Psalms were constructed specifically to accommodate Simon's weathered voice, which lacks some of the range and force it had in the past, and now he was going to attempt songs at age 83 that, in some cases, date back to his early twenties.


	In a bold move, he opened with “Graceland,” and briefly seemed overwhelmed, unable to hit the difficult notes. But things quickly evened out with a gentle, re-worked “Slip Slidin' Away,” and he never seemed lost again. “Here's a song from the Simon and Garfunkel days,” he said after a stellar “Train in the Distance,” one of three Hearts and Bones songs he slipped into the set. “Some of the early songs I wrote for us, I used to put a guitar figure on top the song.” He then teased bits of “I Am a Rock” and “The Sound of Silence” before kicking into “Homeward Bound.”


	Unlike the rendition on the Saturday Night Live 50 special earlier this year, he didn't alter the lyrics to remove the word “cigarettes.” He also didn't bring out Sabrina Carpenter or his old buddy Artie, even though they finally reconciled after years of bitter estrangement. It was instead the solo version, similar to the one on his 1974 concert LP Live Rhymin'. And it was majestic.

	The first true deep cut of the night came when he broke out “The Late Great Johnny Ace,” which he hadn't performed in a quarter century prior to this tour. It was inspired by R&B singer Johnny Ace, who died in 1954 while playing with a handgun backstage at a concert. The lyrics touch on John F. Kennedy and John Lennon in addition to Ace himself, and images of all three Johns flashed on the screen at the end.

	











	The Hearts and Bone tribute continued with a beautiful “Rene and Georgette Magritte With Their Dog After the War,” one of the many hidden gems on the vastly under-appreciated 1983 LP. (The common narrative that Simon was in a creative slump prior to Graceland simply isn't true. He just hadn't had a radio hit in a while.)


	Brickell came back onstage for “Under African Skies,” which Simon dedicated to Kumalo, noting he was the last surviving member of the Graceland band. And after a quick flashback to The Rhythm of the Saints with “Spirit Voices” and “The Cool, Cool River,” Brickell returned again for some impressive whistling on set-closer “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard.” This one required a bit more vocal power than Simon can muster, but the audience gladly helped him out.


	The encore began with a joyous “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,” and a stunning take on “The Boxer” where every person in the Beacon sang along to the “la la lie” chorus. This is such a pivotal New York City song that Lorne Michaels asked Simon to sing it on the first SNL after 9/11. It's a tale of perseverance and resilience, and it felt like the fighter who “carries the remainders of every glove that laid him down” is now Simon himself.


	The band took a bow after the final “la la lie,” but Simon remained onstage, and held up a single finger to signal that one more song was coming. It could only have been “The Sound of Silence.” Simon wrote the song over 60 years ago in the bathroom of his childhood home in Queens, and it became Simon and Garfunkel's breakthrough hit at the height of the folk rock movement. Hearing it with fresh ears can be difficult after infinite replays on classic rock radio, movie soundtracks, and Time Life Music informercials.

	But when he stood alone on the Beacon stage and sang “hello darkness my old friend,” the past 60 years collapsed into one divine moment. The words and melody felt as alive and vibrant as they must have sounded when Simon and Garfunkel first tested the song out before a Greenwich Village coffee house audience when they were still billing themselves as Kane and Garr.


	As we've seen over and over again, farewell tours rarely stick. But Paul Simon's A Quiet Celebration tour is nothing like some artists squeezing their fans for more money after promising to go away forever. It's a victory lap for one of the greatest songwriters of the past century. And if it winds up being the last time, he's taking a page from the Leonard Cohen playbook and going out on top.

The April 8 incident at the Dominican Republic club resulted in 236 deaths and more than 180 injuries.

	The owner of the Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican Republic was arrested last week and charged with involuntary homicide over the tragic roof collapse on April 8 where 235 people died and nearly 200 more were injured. According to The New York Times, prosecutors arrested and charged club owner Antonio Espaillat on June 12 after a club employee provided authorities with evidence showing he'd warned the club's owners that they should cancel that night's show because of the poor condition of the club's roof.

	











	The deadly incident occurred during a show by merengue singer Rubby Pérez at the beloved music venue that was celebrating its 50th anniversary. The singer's manager said at the time that the roof collapsed about an hour after the show's midnight start time. In addition to killing many fans, the collapse also took the lives of Pérez's saxophone player, as well as former Major League Baseball players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera and Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northwestern province of Montecristi whose brother is seven-time MLB All-Star Nelson Cruz.


	The Times described Espaillat as a wealthy businessman whose family also owns a chain of radio stations; Espaillat's sister, who helped manage the club, was also charged with involuntary homicide. The attorney general's office said in a statement that the siblings “demonstrated immense irresponsibility and negligence by failing to do what was necessary to ensure that the Jet Set Club's roof was adequately and expertly repaired.” 

	











	In addition, the AG's office claimed the Espaillat's attempted to “manipulate or intimidate” employees who could be potential witnesses in the case, not offering any details on those alleged efforts. The club was owned by Espaillat and his mother and, the Times reported, its roof had undergone years of “repeated repairs.”


	In a local TV interview two weeks after the collapse, Espaillat said that the club's ceiling panels often got soaked from water leaks from the air conditioning units on the roof, with workers reportedly replacing ceiling panels on the day of the Pérez show. Though the owner said he wasn't aware the roof situation was so pressing, an employee shared information with investigators reportedly showing that Espaillat had been warned about the peril.


	The unnamed employee's lawyer said his client had turned their phone over to investigators, containing evidence of conversations in which “he gave an account of the situation at the nightclub in which he expressed his fears and apprehensions, and his suggestion that the event be suspended. And that was ignored.”


	The Times reported that a number of lawsuits have been filed over the incident and that an engineering report reviewing the collapse was completed last week, but that its contents have not yet been made public.

	The first episode of Smoke, a new Apple TV+ miniseries about an arson investigator (Taron Egerton) and a cop (Jurnee Smollett) teaming up to catch two unrelated serial arsonists, opens with the dictionary definition of “creativity.” This is the sort of device that suggests anything but creativity is to be found. And for a couple of episodes, the show feels only slightly less hacky than the novel that Egerton's character, Dave Gudsen, is writing, inspired by his own experiences. 


	“Of all the elements,” he jots down at one point, “only fire retains a sense of mystery.” This is actually one of the less cliche-ridden lines of Dave's book. There are some early contrivances as well, including Michelle having a traumatic past that makes her particularly eager to catch their two mysterious arsonists: “Milk Jug,” so nicknamed because he fills them with gasoline to set his fires; and “D&C,” short for divide and conquer, who sets time-delayed fires in one area so he'll go unmolested when going after his real targets. 

	











	But then the show's creator, Dennis Lehane — reuniting with Egerton (and supporting actor Greg Kinnear, who plays Dave's boss) from their Apple miniseries Black Bird — reveals what's really going on with these investigations. And suddenly, the series' more trite elements become a feature, not a (fire)bug. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Will viewers have the patience to make their way through two episodes that are hiding what Smoke is really about, just to get to the actual show? Two hours out of nine isn't quite a full Surf Dracula situation, where a series wastes its entire first season before introducing its real premise. But it's still asking a lot from viewers with busy lives and long to-watch lists. If I wasn't planning to review it — and, frankly, if I hadn't enjoyed so many of Lehane's novels (like Gone, Baby, Gone, Mystic River, and Shutter Island), as well as his TV work on The Wire — I might not have even made it to the big turn that the story takes.

	Perhaps Lehane was simply following the lead of Fire Bug, the true crime podcast that he's fictionalizing, which also kept the true nature of what was happening a secret for a while. I can't speak to how it worked in that version, but it's not a coincidence that Smoke becomes vastly more entertaining and complex the second that it turns all of its cards face-up. The cat-and-mouse game between the investigators and the arsonists becomes more fraught. Smollett and Egerton are excellent and magnetic as we plumb the depths of their characters' damaged psyches. The supporting actors (including Rafe Spall, Anna Chlumsky, and John Leguizamo) give rich — and, in the case of Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine as a chicken joint fry cook whose only pleasure seems to come from watching things burn, terrifying — performances, that are all substantially better for knowing what's really motivating everyone. 


	Even answering the relatively small question of whether Lehane and company intend for Dave's book to be good goes a long way towards making Smoke work. At first, it's unclear if he's meant to be a bad writer, or if this the Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip problem in literary form, where a work-within-the-work that other characters insist is brilliant actually seems awful. Fortunately, Lehane is a great enough crime author to be able to imitate a terrible one(*), and being more overt about that helps to better establish who Dave is. 


(*) That said, there are occasional exchanges of dialogue that feel like Dave could have written them, like one character calling another, “The biggest joke I ever heard,” followed by their target replying, “Then why aren't you laughing?”

	The story spirals a bit too far out of Lehane and company's control in the final chapters, particularly with some choices that Michelle makes. But even they have some thrilling moments, and some thoughtful things to say about the lies we tell the world — and ourselves — about who we are.

	When Dave's book gets critiqued by his wife Ashley (Hannah Emily Anderson) and others, the complaints tend to be about the stilted dialogue or the poorly-written female characters. No one encourages him to get to the big idea sooner. But it's advice the people writing about Dave and his colleagues could have used, especially given how much better Smoke gets once that happens. 


The first two episodes of Smoke begin streaming June 27 on Apple TV+, with additional episodes releasing weekly. I've seen all nine episodes.

The Beatles legend was apparently not pleased that the group sacked his son not once, but twice.

	Gil Kaufman



	Zak Starkey isn't the only one who has had enough of The Who. In a new Rolling Stone interview posted on Monday (June 16) the veteran session and touring drummer who was fired, rehired and then fired once more by The Who in a head-spinning span of several weeks earlier this year opened up about his current relationship with the band and how his dad feels about the tabloid tussle.

	











	Asked what his father, former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr, thought of the bizarre back-and-forth, Starkey said, “He [Ringo] said, ‘I've never liked the way that little man runs that band,'” in seeming reference to The Who singer Roger Daltrey.




			Trending on Billboard		







	After The Who “made a collective decision” to part ways with Starkey in April after his nearly 30 years behind the kit, guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend relented a few days later and rescinded the firing, saying Starkey was “not being asked” to step down from his position. Then, a month later, Townshend took it all back and said after many years working together “the time has come for a change.” A week later, Starkey claimed that he hadn't been “fired” from the band, but had “‘retired' to work [on] my own projects.”


	It has all been a bit hard to keep up with, even for Starkey, who revealed to RS that even after all the firings and re-hirings he still has no idea where he stands. “I spoke to Roger last week,” Starkey told the magazine. “He said, ‘Don't take your drums out of the warehouse, we might be calling you.' What the f–k? These guys are f–kin' insane! I've been fired more times than [late Who drummer] Keith Moon in ten days.”

	











	It's all a bit unclear at this point, especially since The Who recently announced that Scott Devours, a veteran of Daltrey's solo band, will join them on their upcoming farewell tour. In the interview, Starkey once again noted that he had to sit out Oasis‘ eagerly anticipated reunion shows this summer because of his gig in The Who.


	“I was in the Who. And last time they asked me, I was in the Who, and it got a bit weird,” he said of whether he'd hoped Oasis' Liam and Noel Gallagher would invite him back into the fold of the Britpop band he kept time for from 2004-2008. “But this time, I talked to them both. I did tell them both on text, ‘Why the f–k aren't I in your band, man, helping make it the greatest rock band in the world again?”


	Starkey said the Gallagher's again noted that he couldn't join their band because of his gig in The Who, plus singer Liam is “happy working with Joey [Waronker],” the session and live veteran drummer who will be behind the kit for the band's first tour in 16 years.


	Frankly, Starkey said being in the Who sometimes kept him off-kilter. As an example, he described the rehearsals for the Royal Albert Hall gigs in March at which Daltrey apparently took issue with his playing, reportedly complaining from the stage that Starkey's loud drumming was throwing his vocals off. 


	“There's nothing normal about them. These are the most crazy… you've got an abstract, conceptualist artist who thinks the band is an art installation. And then you've got another guy who is a street fighter. It's all very weird,” he said, respectively, of Townshend and Daltrey. “But if you look at the group ever since they started, it's the craziest group. And they've undertaken the crazy ideas, whether the rest of the guys understood it or not. Pete has taken so much on himself. He'll lock himself away for two years, come away with Quadrophenia, and go, ‘You guys can just play on top.' You're dealing with two very, very different people. And when me and Pete catch fire, probably anyone's going to get lost. And probably anyone will. But we won't. When we're onstage, it's like we're f–king. Offstage it can be a little awkward after those 15 minutes. But onstage, It's like, ‘Cigarette, darling?'”

	











	And, for the record, Starkey claimed that it was Daltrey who came in “four bars early” during the Royal Albert Hall shows, after which the drummer sent the singer an e-mail, writing, “I watched you on TV last night, you were off.” 


	“It's 30 years in the group. It's like a family. But he came in four bars early. And he just asked for the drums to be turned up, and he couldn't hear the piano,” Starkey said of Daltrey. “But I love Roger. He never misses a note. His voice is still so pure. It's like a laser beam. He always nails it. They've not changed one key since the start of conceptual art as rock & roll. But he just got lost. He blamed it on the drums being too loud, and then it got made into this huge social media thing. And it freaked him out and he's going around doing solo shows, and saying it's ‘fake news.' But it wasn't me. I was in the car and gone before they finished the last acoustic song. There was no argument in the dressing room.”


	Starkey said he was fired two weeks later for dropping “two beats,” though he noted, “I've watched that film three times. I'm looking on the floor, and I can't see it. If I drop two beats, where the f–k are they?” In the end, Starkey said he doesn't blame Daltrey, or anyone from The Who, for what happened. “I don't hold any grudges. It's the Who. Weirder s–t than this has gone down,” he said. “I've heard them say weirder s–t than this. It's the Who — the maddest band there's ever been.”


	But would he come back if they re-re-rehired him? 


	“Of course I would. I said to Pete, ‘Thirty years. In the 30 years, you put the bar so f–kin' high. What the f–k do I do now?,'” he said. “The Who, you just don't know what's going to happen. If you think something is going to happen, the opposite happens. If you second guess Pete, he will play the opposite. You have to go with whatever you're doing, and not think.”

	As it prepares to unleash Danny Boyle's 28 Years Later around the globe later this week, Sony showed off the first 28 minutes of the zombie thriller for exhibitors here at the CineEurope conference in Barcelona.


	Boyle introduced the footage via video message, saying this “new journey” is the “start of something big.” The first trailer dropped back in December and is the third most-watched horror trailer ever with 60.2 million views in its first 24 hours, while Deadline reported earlier this month that in the first 24 hours of ticket sales domestically, 28 Years Later became the best horror pre-seller of the year to date.

	The second film in the newly revamped trilogy — 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple — will hit North American theaters on January 16, 2026. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	At the start of Sony's presentation, Steven O'Dell, President of International Marketing and Distribution, said to the assembled exhibitors, “I hope everyone is sitting here with a lot more confidence about the present and the future vs. the angst we have felt over the last five years… This year is the moment to make our bets and we all have big bets to make. On the movie side, our job is to create compelling content and market the heck out of it, to get people excited to go to a movie. While on the cinema side, it is your challenge to invest in, and modernize, the cinema experience to get people thinking every week about going to the cinema.”


	He continued, “When we are both operating at the top of our game, we create a shared experience that is a bedrock of entertainment all around the world.”

	











	Other footage that screened during Sony's presentation included two scenes from Darren Aronofsky's Caught Stealing starring Austin Butler, and which releases domestically on August 29 this year. Aronofsky sent a video message from New York where he said he's in the final stages of editing, and explained he'd wanted to make “a romp, caper, adventure” set in the East Village during a time of “peak humanity,” before 9/11, when “Y2K was the biggest threat.” 


	Also sending a message was Sam Mendes who mused on his epic four-picture project about The Beatles which he called “in every sense an entirely unique event.” The quartet of movies is due in April 2028.


	And, Scarlett Johannson, fresh off the Cannes unveiling of her feature directing debut, Eleanor the Great, sent a video message about the “personal” film, saying “every frame is etched in my DNA.” Sony is releasing internationally and Sony Pictures Classics domestically with a date TBD.


	Among other trailers and footage were a sizzle reel for Paul Rudd/Jack Black Christmas release, Anaconda, and a scene and new trailer for I Know What You Did Last Summer which releases in July.


	There are three big anime movies up ahead which each got a mention, Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle releasing September 12 in North America, followed by Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc which begins rollout on September 24 internationally and goes domestic on October 29, as well as Scarlet, a world-creation story of a brave princess who transcends time and space (U.S. release December 12).


	On the local-language front, Sony pointed to upcoming pics such as France's Forced Vacation, the Sisu sequel from Finland which releases in the U.S. on November 21 and the continuation of Spanish franchise Padre No Hay Mas Que Uno with the 5th installment. Director and star of the latter, Santiago Segura, sent a cheeky message to CineEurope urging the Spanish exhibitors in the audience to applaud so the non-Spaniards would know he is “huge in Spain.”

The private equity firm is investing in Rae's management and production firm, which works with diverse creators.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	ColorCreative, the management and production co-founded by actress and writer Issa Rae, is planning to significantly expand its business, backed by the investment firm HarbourView Equity Partners.


	Rae is set to announce the strategic partnership at the Cannes Lions Festival Tuesday.




	Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the companies say that ColorCreative has global ambitions, and will use the investment to “expand its talent representation and production capabilities while also accelerating the creation and ownership of original content.” ColorCreative also says that it doubled its revenue from 2023 to 2024 despite the ongoing industry headwinds.

	“We built ColorCreative to be a home for visionary talent and distinct, multifaceted stories,” said Issa Rae. “Partnering with HarbourView allows us to dream even bigger, while staying true to our mission of helming and supporting the kinds of projects that made us fall in love with storytelling.”

	ColorCreative was founded in 2014 by Issa Rae, Deniese Davis and Talitha Watkins, and seeks to provide opportunities for underrepresented creators across TV, film, digital and content and branded content. The first projects under the new structure will go into production early next year.


	“ColorCreative has proven that bold, creatively-driven content — especially stories rooted in Black culture — has the power to captivate audiences worldwide,” said Sherrese Clarke Soares, founder and CEO of HarbourView. “Issa, Deniese and Talitha have created a blueprint for global storytelling success, and we're excited to partner with them as they scale their next chapter.”

	











	“This partnership marks a defining moment in ColorCreative's journey,” said Talitha Watkins, co-founder and president of ColorCreative. “We've always believed that culturally driven content can also be commercially powerful. With HarbourView's partnership, we believe we have the resources and reach to take our vision to the global stage — without compromising the creative integrity that defines us.”


	HarbourView was launched in 2021 to pursue investments and acquisitions in the entertainment, sports, and media. The company has been active in the music space, acquiring catalogs and other assets from the likes of T-Pain, Pat Benatar, Kane Brown, Luis Fonsi, James Fauntleroy, and Wiz Khalifa. Last month it inked a deal for royalty rights to Grammy-winning producer-songwriter Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins.

	The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday said that it would not hear a lawsuit filed against musician Ed Sheeran that alleged his hit single Thinking Out Loud copied Marvin Gaye's classic Let's Get It On.


	The Supreme Court justices declined to hear an appeal filed by Structured Asset Sales, a company owned by investment banker David Pullman, that owns a partial stake in Gaye's 1973 song. 


	Structured Asset Sales first sued Sheeran, his record label Warner Music, and music publisher Sony Music Publishing in 2023, seeking monetary damages over alleged similarities between the two songs. A U.S. District Judge sided with Sheeran in the original case, concluding that the song's melody, harmony, and rhythm were too common to require copyright protection. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision last year.

	In a separate 2023 copyright lawsuit over the same issue filed by the heirs of Ed Townsend, Gaye's co-writer on the Motown classic, a jury in Manhattan federal court ruled in favor of Sheeran. Speaking outside the court at the time, Sheeran said: “We spent the past eight years talking about two songs with dramatically different lyrics, melodies and four chords which are also different and used by songwriters every day all over the world.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	He added: “These chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before “Let's Get It On” was written and will be used to make music long after we are all gone.  They are in a songwriter's alphabet, our toolkit, and should be there for all of us to use. No one owns them or the way they are played, in the same way nobody owns the color blue.”

	











	The Let's Get It On case followed another high-profile lawsuit by Gaye's estate, in which Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay more than $5 million in 2018 after a court found that Thicke's global smash Blurred Lines copied Gaye's 1977 hit Got to Give It Up.

"Every time I sing it I feel so honored," Beyoncé wrote.

	Jessica Lynch



Beyoncé closed out the final night of her Cowboy Carter tour's six-show run at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Monday (June 16) with a heartfelt message to fans and a tribute to one of England's most iconic songwriters.

	“Thank you, Sir Paul McCartney, for writing one of the best songs ever made.  Every time I sing it, I feel so honored. And it is a full circle moment to wear your beautiful daughter's design,” Beyoncé wrote in an Instagram post, referencing her Cowboy Carter rendition of the Beatles' 1968 classic “Blackbird.”

	“Thank you, London, for creating unforgettable memories for me and my family,” she continued. “Holla at ‘ya when I come on tour again!”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Her version of the song, stylized as “Blackbiird,” reimagines the original with string flourishes and vocal contributions from four rising Black female country artists: Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Reyna Roberts and Tiera Kennedy. The cover is one of two reinterpretations featured on Cowboy Carter, alongside her take on Dolly Parton's “Jolene.”

	











	McCartney praised Beyoncé's version earlier this year, calling it a “magnificent” interpretation that reinforces the civil rights message that inspired him to write it. “I think Beyoncé has done a fab version and would urge anyone who has not heard it yet to check it out,” he wrote on Instagram. “You are going to love it.”


	The Beatles' “Blackbird” was originally written in response to the Little Rock Nine, a group of Black students who faced violent resistance while integrating an Arkansas high school in 1957. McCartney has said the song was written as a message of hope and encouragement to Black women facing injustice.


	McCartney, whose original master recording is used in Beyoncé's version, according to Variety, also revealed that he had the chance to speak with the pop icon about her take on “Blackbird.”


	“I spoke to her on FaceTime and she thanked me for writing it and letting her do it,” wrote McCartney, who attended Beyoncé's record-breaking Renaissance World Tour last year. “I told her the pleasure was all mine and I thought she had done a killer version of the song. When I saw the footage on the television in the early 60s of the black girls being turned away from school, I found it shocking and I can't believe that still in these days there are places where this kind of thing is happening right now. Anything my song and Beyoncé's fabulous version can do to ease racial tension would be a great thing and makes me very proud.”


	Released in March 2024, Cowboy Carter debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and made Beyoncé the first Black woman to top the Top Country Albums chart. The project also won her the Grammy for album of the year and best country album earlier this year.

The movie starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris hits theaters June 27.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Joseph Kosinski, who helmed F1: The Movie, is revealing why Simone Ashley‘s role was ultimately cut from the film.


	It was announced last year that the Bridgerton actress joined the Formula One racing drama, starring alongside Brad Pitt and Damson Idris. However, few details were released about her specific role at the time.




	“It happens on every film, where you have to shoot more than you can use,” Kosinski recently told People magazine about the decision to reduce Ashley's part in F1: The Movie. “There were two or three storylines that ultimately didn't make into the final cut.”

	The Top Gun: Maverick director added, “But Simone, she's an incredible talent, incredible actress, incredible singer, and I would love to work with her again.”


	Ashley reportedly appears briefly onscreen but has no lines of dialogue in the movie, which also stars Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem, Tobias Menzies and Kim Bodnia.


F1: The Movie follows Pitt's Sonny Hayes, a former F1 driver who comes out of retirement to mentor and team up with a younger driver, Idris' Joshua Pearce. Real-life F1 drivers also make cameos throughout the pic.


	While Ashley hasn't addressed her role being removed from the movie, she previously told Elle magazine earlier this month that making the film was a “crazy” experience, saying, “I have a very small part, but I'm grateful to be in that movie.”


	“I got to experience many Grands Prix,” she added. “I don't think I'll ever do anything like that again.”


F1: The Movie starts playing in theaters on June 27.

	The collective hopes of fans longing for a collaboration between Nick Cave and Morrissey have been dashed, with the former revealing he turned down the opportunity to do so last year.

	Cave's revelation arrived by way of his Red Hand Files website, where he responded to a fan asking if he had ever met the former vocalist of The Smiths.

	Labelling Morrissey a “complex and divisive figure, someone who takes more than a little pleasure in p–sing people off” and “probably the best lyricist of his generation,” Cave admitted that he had not had the chance to cross paths with the singer, adding that may be why he remains a fan.


	However, Cave also added that Morrissey had approached him via email in 2024 to perform on a new song that he had written. “I would have been happy to do so, however, while the song he sent was quite lovely, it began with a lengthy and entirely irrelevant Greek bouzouki intro,” Cave explained. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“It also seemed that he didn't want me to actually sing on the song, but deliver, over the top of the bouzouki, an unnecessarily provocative and slightly silly anti-woke screed he had written.”


	While Cave did not share any specific details in regard to the lyrical content of Morrissey's track, he explained that it was enough for him to “politely decline” the offer.

	











	“Although I suppose I agreed with the sentiment on some level, it just wasn't my thing,” Cave explained “I try to keep politics, cultural or otherwise, out of the music I am involved with. I find that it has a diminishing effect and is antithetical to whatever it is I am trying to achieve.”


	Morrissey's most recent solo album, I Am Not a Dog on a Chain, arrived back in 2020. In November, the singer claimed that his as-yet-unreleased album, Bonfire of Teenagers, has been shelved so far because of his various controversial statements. 


	“As you know, nobody will release my music anymore,” Morrissey told a crowd in New Jersey. “As you know because I'm a chief exponent of free speech. In England at least, it's now criminalized.”

Tamara Tunie, who plays Anita Dupree on “Beyond the Gates”, recently discussed her reaction to the dramatic reveal of her character's new storyline. 

The actress has been balancing intense material on the CBS soap in recent months. 

A post shared by Beyond the Gates (@beyondthegatescbs)

[Trigger warning: Mentions of suicide]

In a June 5 interview with TV Insider, Tunie revealed her reaction to Anita's secrets coming to light in the recent episodes of “Beyond The Gates”. “Oh, I was thrilled. I was excited. We've been talking about this from the beginning,” Tunie said.

On “Beyond The Gates”, viewers were shocked to discover that Anita's group, “The Articulettes”, once had another member: Barbara, who was also responsible for creating the group.

In the June 3 episode, Anita read a letter she had kept from Barbara detailing the former member's feelings of hurt and betrayal after their falling out. At the end of the letter, Barbara blames Anita for her subsequent suicide, writing:

“I trusted you and you betrayed me. And I can't take it no more. So, if you're reading this, sista, I've left this world for what I hope is a better place. And that… that is on you.”

Tunie described her emotional response to the big reveal to TV Insider. “That was really emotional,” she said, “When I read the script, I cried, and then I didn't look at it until the night before we were shooting it, so that any emotion that might bubble up would be saved for the filming.”

Fans were equally moved by the shocking revelation of Anita's past.

“Anita almost took me out. What a burden to carry?!” one X user wrote. 

“Poor Anita. Poor Barbara,” another commented. 

Tunie went on to explain that she now feels as though a weight has been lifted off her character.

While Tamara Tunie originated the character Anita Dupree, this is not her first time on a daytime drama. 

Tunie made her daytime debut as Jessica Griffin on “As the World Turns”, a role she played on and off for over 20 years. 

In addition to her work in soaps, the actress and director is known for her portrayal of Dr. Melinda Warner on “Law & Order: SVU” and “Law & Order: Organized Crime”. 

What did you think of Anita's shocking reveal? Do you support her reuniting with the rest of the Articulettes? How do you think the rest of the Duprees will respond when they find out?

HGTV‘s Christina Haack is “feeling extra grateful” these days — and with good reason. “The Flip Off” star shared just some of the reasons everything is going her way.

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

On June 14, Haack took to her Instagram Stories to share a short but sweet post that summed up all of the great things she's got going on.

“Woke up feeling extra grateful,” she began.

Haack continued with her list: “Happy kids, Loving partner, United co-parenting, Amazing friendships, Healthy, Strong, Content, Clear head, Joy in my heart, Love my home, Love my job, Peace, Gratitude.”

Her list ended with prayer hands and heart emojis.

On June 10, the HGTV star took to Instagram to celebrate her daughter Taylor's 8th grade graduation. She posed with Taylor, her ex-husband Tarek El Moussa and his wife Heather Rae.

“Taylor we are so proud of you and so excited for you to head into the next stage of your life. Our beautiful, smart, incredible, bright light we all love and adore you,” she wrote in the caption.

Haack added, “We hope all the mistakes you've watched us make throughout your life help to guide you to a brighter future … 😜🤣🤣 love you baby. High school here we come!!!”

Fans applauded Haack and the El Moussas for their healthy blended family and successful co-parenting.

One fan noted, “Blended families are not easy to manage. We can tell you all must have put in a lot of work to get to this happy place. Congratulations on the next chapter for your daughter!”

Haack also celebrated her “loving partner” Christopher Larocca in her list of things she's grateful for.

On April 8, the HGTV star shared how she is approaching her relationship in a different way.

“As someone who recently discovered I have anxious-attachment (not sure what took me so long 🤪) and for sure a history of co-dependency issues … things can be challenging and by ‘things' I mean ‘me,'” she wrote in the caption.

Haack continued,  “Meeting an unexpected good man who has his own amazing career, life & hobbies (who also happens to have zero jealousy) can at times feel strange for someone who has had the opposite.”

“The Flip Off” star shared that she is “finally learning about safe communication, independence during commitment and a relationship that is NOT 0-100.”

She explained, “I am for sure guilty of putting pressure on others. Facing my own insecurities has forced me into doing the shadow work I've been avoiding … it's time to break the cycle.”

Meghan Markle celebrated Father's Day with a rare glimpse into her private family life. On Sunday, June 15, the Duchess of Sussex shared a heartfelt Instagram video tribute to Prince Harry featuring never-before-seen footage of him with their two children, 6-year-old Prince Archie and 4-year-old Princess Lilibet.

A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan)

Set to Jason Mraz's song “Have It All,” the video captures moments of Harry laughing with his kids, following Archie on a bike ride, and holding both children during their younger years. The tribute marked one of Meghan's most personal posts since returning to social media earlier this year.

“The best,” she wrote in the caption. “Happy Father's Day to our favorite guy 💕.”

The post quickly drew attention, offering a rare look at the family's life in Montecito, California, where Harry and Meghan have lived since stepping back from their royal roles in 2020.

A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan)

Since their royal exit, Harry and Meghan have raised Archie and Lilibet away from the public eye. Both children share their father's red hair, which Harry has credited to his late mother's family.

“The Spencer gene is very, very strong,” Harry said during a 2023 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” He added, “I actually really, genuinely thought at the beginning of my relationship [with Meghan] that should this go the distance and we have kids, that there's no way the ginger gene will stand up to my wife's genes, but I was wrong! Go gingers.”

The Father's Day post also comes amid ongoing tension between Harry and his father, King Charles III. In a BBC interview on May 2, Harry said, “He won't speak to me because of this security stuff,” referring to his legal battle to reinstate U.K. protection for his family.

“I would love reconciliation with my family,” he continued. “There's no point in continuing to fight anymore. Life is precious. I don't know how much longer my father has.”

As reported by People, the palace has denied that King Charles has the power to restore the high-level security Harry is seeking. Since moving to the U.S., the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have returned to the U.K. only once with their children, for Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee in 2022.

As Meghan continues to use her Instagram handle @meghan to spotlight personal moments and professional projects, the Father's Day tribute stood out for its emotional tone and family-first focus.

Good Deed has acquired the family drama movie in which the father-son duo star alongside Walker Scobell and David Morse.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Michael Douglas and real-life son Cameron Douglas are set to reunite on the big screen.


	Good Deed Entertainment has acquired domestic rights to Looking Through Water — a family drama feature starring Michael Douglas — and is planning a late summer theatrical release, The Hollywood Reporter has learned exclusively. Roberto Sneider helmed the film that co-stars Cameron Douglas alongside Walker Scobell, David Morse, Michael Stahl-David, Ximena Romo and Tamara Tunie.




Looking Through Water centers on a father who attempts to bond with his estranged son by teaming up with him for a father-son fishing competition.

	Sneider (Tear This Heart Out) directed the movie from a script by Rowdy Herrington (director of the original Road House) and Zach Dean (Fast X). Hailing from Aeth Entertainment, the project is based on the novels Catching Big Fish and Looking Through Water from author Bob Rich, who executive produces.


	Producers include Robert Mitas, Stan Spry, Carla Woods and Eric Woods. Storyboard Media's Elisabeth Costa de Beauregard Segel executive produces and handles worldwide sales. Costa de Beauregard Segel and Carla Woods negotiated for the film that was previously known as Blood Knot.


	“With Good Deed and Storyboard Media on board, we're excited to bring Looking Through Water to audiences — it's a story of healing, forgiveness and second chances, while the American pastime of fishing connects generations through water,” says Aeth Entertainment CEO Eric Woods.

	











	“We are honored to be teaming up with Aeth Entertainment and Storyboard Media to bring Looking Through Water to audiences in the U.S. later this summer,” adds GDE head of acquisitions and distribution Erik Donley. 


	Michael and Cameron Douglas previously starred together in the 2003 feature It Runs in the Family, alongside Michael's late real-life parents Kirk Douglas and Diana Douglas. Michael was last seen on the big screen in 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. 


	Cameron Douglas' recent credits include the 2022 Bruce Willis-led action film Wire Room and the Apple TV+ series The Crowded Room. His book Long Way Home was published in 2019 and details his journey following his conviction on drug charges.

The filmmaker and co-head of DC Studios admitted that they "just killed a project" because "the screenplay's not good."

James Gunn has a “number-one reason” why he believes the “movie industry is dying.”


	The filmmaker and co-head of DC Studios recently told Rolling Stone that a lot of the bad movies being released are due to production dates being set before scripts are completely finished.




	“I do believe that the reason why the movie industry is dying is not because of people not wanting to see movies. It's not because of home screens getting so good,” Gunn said. “The number-one reason is because people are making movies without a finished screenplay.”

	When Gunn took over at the helm of DC Studios with Peter Safran, he emphasized that superhero films under his guidance would not go into production until scripts were finalized. He even admitted that they “just killed a project” due to that very reason.


	“Everybody wanted to make the movie. It was greenlit, ready to go,” the Superman director said. “The screenplay wasn't ready. And I couldn't do a movie where the screenplay's not good.”


	Gunn added, “And we've been really lucky so far, because Supergirl's script was so fucking good off the bat. And then Lanterns came in, and the script was so fucking good. Clayface, same thing. So fucking good. So we have these scripts that we've been really lucky with or wise in our choices or whatever the combination is.”


	Not having a mandate from Warner Bros. to deliver a certain number of DC projects has also helped Gunn, as the Guardians of the Galaxy director believes Disney's previous mandate to increase Marvel films and TV shows “killed them.” Disney CEO Bob Iger has since refocused Marvel on quality over quantity.

	











	“We have to treat every project as if we're lucky,” Gunn explained. “We don't have the mandate [at DC Studios] to have a certain amount of movies and TV shows every year. So we're going to put out everything that we think is of the highest quality. We're obviously going to do some good things and some not-so-good things, but hopefully on average everything will be as high-quality as possible. Nothing goes before there's a screenplay that I personally am happy with.”

Justin Bieber rang in his first Father's Day as a dad on Sunday, June 15, sharing glimpses of his celebration with wife Hailey and their 9-month-old son Jack Blues Bieber across social media. The 31-year-old singer documented the special day through Instagram posts that showcased everything from lavish presents to sweet family moments.

The “Baby” singer kicked off his Father's Day posts with his signature humor, sharing a selfie featuring a fake tiny hand giving the middle finger. “I'm a dad that's not to be [expletive] with,” Justin captioned the photo.

His celebration included an impressive haul of luxury gifts, including an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch valued at $38,000, two Prada backpacks, and a new Apple laptop. The singer playfully captioned his gift photo with “Happy daddy day to me u lil ho.”

Despite ongoing speculation about their relationship status, the Biebers spent the holiday together. Justin would document their romantic getaway on Instagram. “Made it home from a lil date night getaway 🛸,” he wrote alongside photos of Hailey walking into their home.

The couple's son, Jack Blues, joined the celebrations in an adorable way. Justin shared videos of the baby at the piano with his mom, Hailey. In one clip, the singer filmed from the ground as his wife and son enjoyed music time together. Little Jack even sported a gold bracelet featuring his initials “JBB,” adding a touch of baby bling to the festivities.

Some outlets claimed Hailey “snubbed” Justin by not posting on Instagram for Father's Day. However, the couple clearly celebrated together based on Justin's numerous posts showing their family time. Hailey's distinctive engagement ring was visible in the piano photos. She also shared one of the images on her own Instagram Story, further confirming their quality moments together.

The couple welcomed Jack Blues in August 2024 after announcing their pregnancy in May of that year. A source close to the family told People shortly after the birth that Justin was already “great” at being a dad. They noted, “They're both overjoyed. The baby is such a miracle. He's adorable and doing well. The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for.”

Justin has already expressed enthusiasm about sharing his passions with his son. During a February 2025 charity hockey game, he told reporters he wanted to get Jack on the ice “as soon as possible,” joking, “It's never too early.” 

For her part, Hailey recently described motherhood as the “wildest, coolest thing I've ever done” in an Instagram post marking International Women's Day. The couple, who married in September 2018, continue to navigate parenthood together while sharing selective glimpses of their growing family with fans.

The singer and music producer joins the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Miley Cyrus and Dua Lipa in being sued for including allegedly unlicensed paparazzi pictures in social media posts.

Robin Thicke is the latest music industry figure to face a copyright infringement lawsuit for supposedly posting paparazzi pictures of himself on Instagram without paying to license the images.


	Thicke is the target of a federal lawsuit filed on Monday (June 16) by celebrity photo agency BackGrid USA Inc., which claims to own the rights to two paparazzi shots that the singer and music producer posted to Instagram in 2022.


	One of the images in question shows Thicke riding shotgun in a convertible, and the other depicts him leaving the restaurant Catch Steak with his now-wife, April Love Geary. These photos are no longer available on Thicke's Instagram page, but the lawsuit attaches screenshots of these seemingly deleted social media posts.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Defendants violated federal law by willfully infringing BackGrid's copyrights to at least two photographs,” write BackGrid's lawyers. “By uploading the Thicke photographs to the Instagram account, defendants encourage their fans to ‘share' the photograph, thus causing others to also willfully infringe and multiplying the harm to BackGrid.”


	BackGrid claims Thicke should have known better than to post these photos without proper licenses, since he's a “sophisticated creator of copyrighted works” who himself owns more than 100 copyright registrations. The photo agency also points out that Thicke is no stranger to intellectual property law, having faced lengthy copyright litigation over his 2013 hit “Blurred Lines.”


	The new lawsuit seeks a court injunction blocking Thicke from infringing BackGrid's copyrights again, as well as monetary damages for the alleged wrongdoing. The agency notes that it “made exhaustive efforts to resolve this lawsuit with defendants prior to filing this action.”


	A rep for Thicke did not immediately return a request for comment on the claims.


	The lawsuit comes a month after BackGrid brought a similar case against Jennifer Lopez for allegedly posting two paparazzi pictures of herself outside a Golden Globes pre-party this past January without licenses.


	Lopez and Thicke are far from the first celebrities to encounter this type of legal action over pictures of themselves on their own social media accounts. Artists including Miley Cyrus, Dua Lipa and Justin Bieber have all faced similar lawsuits in the last few years.


	As Billboard wrote in 2022, U.S. copyright law is on the side of photographers and image licensers. Though it may seem odd, celebrities do not automatically co-own images of themselves and therefore don't have the right to repost them for free.

Alexis Bellino, known for her role on “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” is entering a new chapter both personally and financially. As she gears up to marry fiancé John Janssen, Bellino has listed her home in San Juan Capistrano for $2.95 million—about $1.65 million more than she originally paid for the property in 2018, per The Daily Dish.

According to Reality Blurb, the listing reflects Bellino's ongoing transition as she prepares to wed Janssen, whom she got engaged to in August 2024 after nine months of dating. The timing aligns with her recent public statements about “more changes” coming to her life.

According to the property listing, the four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom residence sits inside the exclusive Marbella Country Club, a guard-gated community known for its luxurious amenities. Spanning 3,952 square feet, the home boasts high-end features such as cathedral ceilings, a wine cellar, and a three-car garage. The in-law floor plan and open kitchen-living area add to the home's flexible layout.

Outside, the estate features a heated in-ground pool and spa, an outdoor bar with a built-in barbecue and refrigerator, and a cozy seating area with a fireplace.

Bellino, a mother of three, purchased the home during her divorce from ex-husband Jim Bellino. 

Although the Bravo star has not disclosed where she and Janssen plan to live after the sale, she previously hinted at their current arrangement in a 2024 interview with The Daily Dish. “I mean, we pretty much live together right now, anyway. We bounce back between both homes,” she said. “We decided we're going to keep both homes. I have twins (Mackenna Bellino and Miles Bellino) in high school still. We don't want to uproot anybody from their normal, so we're gonna keep both homes for a while.”

Bellino has also shared that she and Janssen plan to reassess their real estate situation once her twins graduate in 2026. “We'll decide then,” she added. “Of course, we're gonna buy a home together when we decide to not have both homes, but, until then, we're just back and forth.”

The upcoming wedding is expected to take place later this summer, and Bellino has revealed that it will be “very unconventional.” 

In an April interview with People, she teased ceremony and dress details, saying, “The gown is actually complementing exactly what we want the wedding to be. It is unconventional, head to toe.” She added, “I am this bride that did not want conventional and did not want an ordinary dress.”

   15:33 EDT 17 Jun 2025, updated  15:48 EDT 17 Jun 2025    By ALEXA CIMINO FOR DAILYMAIL.COM  

US military personnel captured an eerie flying saucer UFO in incredible new footage that has just been leaked to the public.

Investigative journalists Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp say the video was recorded by government personnel over the Afghan-Pakistan border in November 2020. They released it to the public on Tuesday.

It shows a massive disc weaving in and out of cloud cover.  The Department of Defense labeled the disc a UAP - unidentified aerial phenomena - and it looks markedly different to other 'tic-tac'-shaped UFOs seen in recent military footage.

The raw thermal imagery, along with two additional enhanced clips produced by the U.S. government, show the unidentified craft abruptly changing direction - all without any visible signs of propulsion.

'This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public,' Corbell exclusively told DailyMail.com. 'It has implications that are huge.'

The object was spotted during a reconnaissance mission by a high-altitude Air Force platform. 

According to internal government slides Corbell and Knapp have seen, the UAP was described as 'navigating through clouds' and characterized as a 'disc'. 

The military's own internal enhancements - now made public - further underline the object's unusual heat signature, or lack thereof.

'You do not see plumes of heat coming off this disc-shaped object,' Corbell explained. 

'This was captured on a thermal sensor - it should have detected heat if any traditional propulsion was present. But there's nothing. That's one of the wildest aspects.'

In simple terms, that means it is unclear exactly how the disc is being powered. Terrestrial aircraft tend to use jet or propeller engines which can leave obvious trails across the sky.  

The footage was extensively studied within intelligence community investigations for years, known to those with high-level access but never intended for public release. 

Corbell and Knapp said they spent over two years validating the authenticity of the clips with multiple sources, including individuals who actively work in official U.S. government UFO programs.

'The source is legit. We know it's real,' Knapp confirmed during the latest episode of their podcast Weaponized. 'It was not supposed to be made public. But it should've been.'

The object is estimated to be between 200 and 400 meters in diameter, though Corbell admits its exact size is still being debated, with further analysis required to offer more accurate perspective on its size. 

'There's depth of field. There's relative distance. The shape is undeniable,' Corbell said. 'And the movement? It's extraordinary. You're seeing it dip into clouds, then emerge and reverse direction. That's not an artifact. That's a real object in motion.'

The videos released include:

Online investigators have already begun poring over the footage, which includes geolocation data in the bottom-left corner of the screen. 

Those coordinates point to the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan, an active conflict zone with strategic surveillance interest.

'The public has a right and a need to know,' Corbell said. 'This capture is worthy of serious discourse - not just in the UFO community, but in international and scientific conversations. It challenges our understanding of what's flying through our skies.'

Corbell and Knapp have not disclosed how they obtained the footage, only stating that it was 'leaked' and that they took extreme precautions to protect sources.

'This is just the start,' Corbell teased.

Jeremy Corbell is an investigative filmmaker known for releasing some of the most compelling UAP footage ever made public, including the infamous 'Tic Tac' UFO videos and a series of military-captured encounters that have sparked global headlines. 

Corbell has also played a key role in amplifying whistleblower testimony - most notably from Matthew Brown, the former Pentagon insider who recently came forward with claims about secret UAP retrieval programs.

The actor used to point vaguely to the sky and suggest the government was watching when asked for a photo. Nowadays, that could lead to some very awkward conversations

Sarah Jessica Parker, the Sex and the City star and Booker prize judge, has a nifty trick for getting out of taking selfies with her fans. “I did this for a really, really long time and it worked for ever,” Parker said in an interview with Howard Stern. “I used to say, ‘I can't, because of the government,' and I'd do this,” Parker said, pointing up to the sky. “It really confused people. This was through different administrations, so it wasn't political.”

It is not entirely clear why Parker – who has said she refuses to take selfies and would rather “have a conversation” instead because “it's much more meaningful” – stopped using this brilliant excuse. But one does have to wonder whether it is because the US has become a nation of conspiracy theorists. Rather than backing away from the weird “the government is watching” woman, perhaps fans started to excitedly engage her with theories about how Bill Gates has implanted us all with mind-controlling microchips. Or maybe she just got tired of the joke. I don't know. But I'm sure someone out there (the government) does.

Conspiracy theories have become so mainstream that they are even prompting nonsensical legislation. Earlier this month, Louisiana lawmakers sent a bill to the state's governor seeking to ban “chemtrails” – which don't actually exist. They are a longstanding conspiracy which posits that the white lines sometimes left behind by aircraft aren't just due to condensed water vapour but are far more sinister. Some people believe that the government is spraying toxic metals to reduce populations; others believe they are evidence that dark forces are trying to control the weather or people's minds.

Lawmakers in at least 11 other states are trying to advance similar “chemtrail” bans. “Every bill like this is kind of symbolic, or is introduced to appease a very vocal group, but it can still cause real harm by signalling that these conspiracies deserve this level of legal attention,” a member of the National Association for Media Literacy Education told the Associated Press.

Also causing real harm in the US with his obsession with imaginary problems is health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. The vaccine sceptic recently fired every single member of a critical advisory committee on immunisation practices. He has replaced them with people who reportedly have very little vaccine expertise and are accused of spreading misinformation. The ousted members of the vaccine committee have said that the shake-up may “impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses.”

RFK Jr is also fixated on conspiracy theories about fluoride, which he calls “a dangerous neurotoxin”. There are, to be clear, valid concerns about ingesting too much fluoride, including its effects on IQ as well as potential tooth discoloration. But experts are pretty unanimous that fluoride in drinking water is a great public health achievement that has done wonders for preventing tooth decay. There are worries that RFK Jr's meddling will cause a significant increase in dental cavities, especially among children in lower-income groups.

Anyway, I've got a good idea for Parker. Since acting like a conspiracy theorist no longer seems to ward off unwanted attention, why not try engaging selfie-seeking fans with a rational fact-based discussion? Increasingly large numbers of Americans seem allergic to that; some fans will immediately run a mile. I have some other thoughts too but I'm afraid I can't elaborate any more on this issue for top secret reasons. But here's a hint: it's because of the government.

By the time Supernatural wrapped its 15-season run, The CW series had amassed an impressive lineup of guest stars, leading to pretty great moments both life-changing and storyline-changing. Guest-starring on SPN often means having a scene or two with stars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, which was definintely a boon for the mother of guest actor Aimee Garcia, who recalled her mom fliring with Ackles with a hilarious story.

Garcia is best known for her role on Lucifer and can currently be seen starring on Criminal Minds: Evolution (streaming with a Paramount+ subscription), but guest-starred on Supernatural back in 2008. She appeared as a secretary at a police station in Season 3 Episode 12, “Jus in Bello,” and despite it filming nearly 20 years ago, she still remembers it like it was yesterday. Speaking with TV Insider, the actress recalled her parents visiting the set and nd her mom shamelessly flirting with Ackles. (Not that I blame her). According to Garcia:

I had the best time with those guys. My parents came on set, and I do remember my mom flirting with Jensen shamelessly in front of my father, and she's like — She's Mexican, so English is her second language. She's like, ‘Oh, Jensen, you are chewing gum before they start the scene. And then they call action. And then where does the gum go? I [don't] see it while you shoot the scene.' I'm like, ‘Mom, you cannot flirt with Jensen!'

I don't know which is better: The fact that Garcia's mother flirted with Ackles in the first place, or that she did it in full view of her husband and daughter. Not even moms are able to resist the Ackles charm, and it is pretty funny to learn how this went down.

Luckily, the flirting didn't do any harm, and now Garcia has a funny story to tell for years to come. It just makes me wonder if Ackles remembers that, although there's a more-than-good chance that Garcia's mother was not the first or last parent to shamelessly flirt with him on set.

Meanwhile, even after all these years, Jensen Ackles is still keeping people on their toes. With his upcoming Prime Video series Countdown coming out later this month, fans have been thirsting quite a lot over his new role. The Supernatural family was bringing the heat with the comments about how good he looks, and even compared his new character to Dean Winchester. It's clear that no one can resist him.

Supernatural and Countdown are not the only places that fans are able to see Ackles. The actor will soon be appearing in the fifth and final season of The Boys, reprising his role as Soldier Boy. He will also be playing Soldier Boy in the new prequel series, Vought Rising. Ackles has been guest starring on Tracker as well, appearing as Russell Shaw, the brother of Justin Hartley's Colter. Since Season 3 of the CBS drama has been ordered, it's possible that Russell will return, assuming Ackles' busy schedule gives him time.

Even though fans won't see Aimee Garcia's mom shamelessly flirting with Ackles, they can always watch her episode and all 15 seasons of Supernatural with a Netflix subscription. It does make you look at the episode differently, knowing what was happening behind the scenes.

Good Job is Slate's advice column on work. Have a workplace problem big or small? Send it to Laura Helmuth and Doree Shafrir here. (It's anonymous!)

Dear Good Job, 

I work in an office cube farm. The job itself is good and I enjoy my work, but I need some help dealing with a situation involving my co-worker and his “interesting” beliefs.

“Carl” is a nice guy and a good colleague most of the time, but he has these very weird, honestly conspiracy-theory beliefs about soy products. He thinks they're some sort of subtle poison foisted on us by an international cabal whose members change daily. I've learned to redirect all conversations away from the stuff and never bring it up myself.

But the problem is a second co-worker, “Rick.” He seems to enjoy riling Carl up, and will very conspicuously do things to set him off. A few times a week, he'll come back from his break with a drink, stand right in front of Carl's workstation, and say it's a soy latte. And if they have breaks at the same time, Rick will go out of his way to ask Carl about soy. He even brought it up at a group chat once, and the boss had to mute Carl because he wouldn't stop ranting.

It upsets me. I'm pretty non-confrontational. And they're both guys (I'm a woman), so I feel a bit intimidated at trying to tell them to directly knock it off. But I don't think it's the sort of thing that HR or my boss would take seriously. What can I do here to keep my sanity?

—Dealing With Lunatics

Dear Dealing With Lunatics,

Carl and Rick both sound awful in their own ways. My advice is to keep your distance, ignore both of them to the extent that you can, and focus on you and your own work. If their interactions get to the point where you absolutely can't ignore them and they're interfering with your work, then I would ask your boss if they've noticed Rick and Carl's behavior, tell them that you're having a hard time ignoring it, and ask for their advice on how to deal with it. That way, you're not getting directly involved, but you're also letting your manager know that this behavior is bizarre and disruptive, and hopefully, they will be able to do something about it.

Lastly, I'm not a mental health professional, but Carl's behavior does strike me as so far out of the norm as to be somewhat worrisome. If you notice that the conspiracy theories and ranting are spilling over into other areas, I think it's worth raising with your boss as well. And for the record, I think soy milk tastes gross.

—Doree

I'm a single woman in my 30s. I met a guy a couple of months ago through an online dating website, and we hit it off and are spending a lot of time together. He is funny, smart, articulate, sensitive, talented, and seems to adore me. The catch is that he is missing several of his teeth. In the front.

A strange jellyfish-like phenomenon was spotted streaking across the California sky Monday night.

While the unusual 'UFO' sighting baffled many locals from the Mojave desert to Los Angeles's South Bay, scientists say there were no extraterrestrials involved in creating the jellyfish - it was an Elon Musk rocket.

SpaceX's latest Falcon 9 rocket mission lifted off at 11:36pm ET Monday night from Vandenberg Space Force Station in California.

A few minutes into the flight, the rocket's exhaust interacted with the atmosphere, creating a visible cloud of condensed water vapor.

Since the launch took place right after sunset, around 8:36pm PT, the sun illuminated the crystalized exhaust plume, resulting in a spectacular sight for millions on the ground.

Californians posted images of the rocket soaring over the state on X, even as far south as Riverside, over 200 miles southeast of the Vandenberg launch site.

SpaceX's lead avionics systems engineer, Cameron Gable, captured the jellyfish phenomenon as the rocket traveled past Los Angeles County's South Bay.

The mission, dubbed Starlink 15-9, saw SpaceX launch its latest batch of Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit. 

Scientists said that the mysterious jellyfish seen over California Monday night was the exhaust trail of a Falcon 9 rocket

The Falcon 9 rocket's exhaust interacted with Earth's atmosphere, creating a visible cloud of condensed water vapor that became easier to see right after sunset

SpaceX's lead avionics engineer posted on X, showing the jellyfish effect as it passed over Los Angeles's South Bay

The jellyfish phenomenon, also known as a 'vapor cone' or 'shock collar,' occurs when the localized air pressure around the rocket drops, causing the air temperature to decrease and water vapor to condense into visible clouds.

Monday's giant jellyfish display started just a few minutes into the flight and was visible to anyone in the Southern California area.

It's not the first time a SpaceX rocket has produced the jellyfish effect. In October 2022, sky watchers caught another Falcon 9 rocket creating the same vapor trail during a similar mission to deploy new satellites.

Monday's Falcon 9 launch was the latest mission in SpaceX's ongoing efforts to expand its Starlink 'constellation,' aiming to enhance global internet coverage.

SpaceX has already conducted 75 launches in 2025, mainly for Starlink missions.

The mission also used a reusable first-stage engine, a hallmark of SpaceX's design philosophy aimed at reducing the cost of spaceflights.

SpaceX captured the moment on their live broadcast when the reusable engine safely landed back on Earth to be used again in future missions.

Monday's mission was the 200th from the company's Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg.

The SpaceX launch was part of the company's ongoing Starlink mission, which is deploying a network of new satellites that will boost global internet coverage

The jellyfish effect is a common occurrence during space rocket launches and can normally be seen from states hundreds of miles from the actual launch site

The remote-controlled reusable rocket engine made a perfect touchdown on SpaceX's droneship in the Pacific Ocean about eight minutes after launch, making it the 463rd engine returned to Earth.

While the jellyfish effect may seem like a bizarre UFO to the untrained eye, it's common among spaceflights.

Social media users regularly capture rockets giving off the jellyfish trail from hundreds of miles away.

One X user in Phoenix, Arizona, was able to spot a similar jellyfish during a June 2024 launch. That mission also involved a Falcon 9 launching from Vandenberg, which was over 500 miles away.

When a rocket launches, it expels a large amount of exhaust gases at high speeds. These gases, primarily composed of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other rocket launch byproducts, expand rapidly as they exit the rocket's nozzle.

As the exhaust plume expands, it encounters cooler, denser air in Earth's upper atmosphere. This can cause the water vapor in the exhaust to condense into visible clouds, forming a balloon-like shape around the rocket.

The high speed of the rocket can also create shock waves, further shaping the exhaust into distinctive patterns, creating the jellyfish effect. 

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, with their frequent launch schedule and reusable first stages, often trigger this effect due to their design and the typical launch times chosen for optimal visibility.

However, any rocket launch around the world can potentially give off a jellyfish trail, especially when the conditions are right for the exhaust to give off a dramatic display in the atmosphere.

Deep in the heart of East Texas, the small town of Palestine hides a chilling secret, a jailhouse where the echoes of the past refuse to rest. Built in 1931, the Anderson County Jail is now one of the most infamous haunted locations in Texas, attracting ghost hunters and thrill-seekers alike.

The Anderson County Jail served as the county's primary detention center for decades, holding prisoners accused of everything from petty theft to violent crimes. Its imposing brick structure and iron-barred windows were designed to keep criminals locked away, but many believe that some never truly left.

Legends claim that inmates who met tragic ends, whether by execution, illness, or suicide—left behind restless spirits. Visitors and paranormal investigators often report strange occurrences, from unexplained footsteps and eerie whispers to doors slamming shut on their own.

In recent years, the old jailhouse has become a hotspot for ghost tours and overnight investigations. Brave participants have experienced chilling encounters, including shadowy figures moving through cells and sudden drops in temperature. Some have even captured mysterious voices on audio recordings, adding to the jail's haunted reputation.

Paranormal experts point to the building's layered history of violence and despair as the reason for its spectral activity. Whether skeptics or believers, most who enter the jailhouse leave with stories they can't quite explain.

Today, the haunted Texas jailhouse is a must-visit for ghost hunters and history buffs. The property hosts scheduled tours, giving guests a chance to explore the building's dark past while keeping an eye, and ear, out for ghostly activity.

Whether you're searching for spirits or just looking for a spine-tingling adventure, the haunted jailhouse in Palestine offers an unforgettable experience. Just be warned, some visitors say the spirits have a way of following you home.

Where is it? Mid-Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of West Africa

What's in the photo? A giant, comma-shaped cloud of Saharan dust being blown out to sea

Which satellite took the photo? GOES-19

When was it taken? May 28, 2025

Satellites recently snapped a giant cloud of "Saharan dust" blowing out to sea from the world's largest hot desert. The hazy mass later traveled more than 4,000 miles (6,500 kilometers) to North America, where it polluted the skies of Florida and other states.

In the early hours of May 28, 2025, a large cloud of dust and sand began to blow out from the Sahara and over the Atlantic Ocean, according to a statement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Around a week later, on June 4, the cloud made landfall in Florida, with the plume also reaching Louisiana, Texas and other parts of the Gulf Coast. En route, it also briefly filled the skies of several Caribbean nations, including Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.

A photo captured by the GOES-19 satellite, which is co-run by NASA and NOAA, revealed the cloud as it first began its transatlantic journey. At the time, it covered an area of roughly 240,000 square miles (620,000 square km) between Cabo Verde — an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the mid-Atlantic — and the coast of West Africa, including the shorelines of Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau.

The dust cloud was a "particularly robust, comma-shaped plume," representatives from the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University wrote on Bluesky. However, soon after the photo was taken, the cloud dispersed, making it "appear larger in size."

Astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS) also captured shots of the plume as it moved across the Atlantic, Live Science's sister site Space.com reported.

In Florida, the plume caused a brief reduction in air quality that may have impacted people with respiratory conditions. The state's skies remained hazy for around 48 hours before the majority of the dust settled — some of which was later visible on windows and cars.

A second, smaller plume reached the U.S. between June 13 and 15.

Saharan dust can have several other surprising effects. "When it reaches the U.S., it can cause hazy skies as well as vivid sunrises and sunsets as the sun's rays scatter the dust in the atmosphere," NOAA representatives wrote. "It can even suppress thunderstorm development over locations where the dust is especially thick."

Saharan dust gets whipped up by strong gusts of wind, which occur much more frequently in deserts than other environments, and can reach several miles above Earth's surface, according to the U.K. Met Office. This mainly happens between late spring and early fall.

Once the dust is airborne, it hovers above the desert in a region known as the "Saharan Air Layer" — a roughly 2.5-mile-wide (4 km) band of very dry air that forms around 1 mile (1.6 km) above the Sahara desert. Every three to five days, the accumulated dust gets blown out to sea, and if there is enough of it, the particulates form large plumes that can travel across entire oceans, according to NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, which helps monitor the Saharan Air Layer.

Saharan dust plumes of various sizes reach the U.S. every year, usually peaking in intensity between June and August.

One of the most famous examples in recent years was the "Godzilla" plume, which hit large parts of the southern U.S. in June 2020. During this two-week-long event, the amount of dust reached the highest levels since satellites began tracking plumes 18 years previously, according to a 2021 study.

Microsoft's Aurora AI beat existing systems in predicting weather conditions over a 14-day period in 91% of cases, including hurricanes, sandstorms and ocean swells.

A new artificial intelligence (AI) model can predict major weather events faster and more accurately than some of the world's most widely used forecasting systems.

The model, called Aurora, is trained on more than 1 million hours of global atmospheric data, including weather station readings, satellite images and radar measurements. Scientists at Microsoft say it's likely the largest dataset ever used to train a weather AI model.

Aurora correctly forecast that Typhoon Doksuri would strike the northern Philippines four days before the storm made landfall in July 2023. At the time, official forecasts placed the storm's landfall over Taiwan — several hundred miles away.

It also outperformed standard forecasting tools used by agencies, including the U.S. National Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. It delivered more accurate five-day storm tracks and produced high-resolution forecasts up to 5,000 times faster than conventional weather models powered by supercomputers.

More broadly, Aurora beat existing systems in predicting weather conditions over a 14-day period in 91% of cases, the scientists said. They published their findings May 21 in the journal Nature.

Researchers hope Aurora and models like it could support a new approach to predicting environmental conditions called Earth system forecasting, where a single AI model simulates weather, air quality and ocean conditions together. This could help produce faster and more consistent forecasts, especially in places that lack access to high-end computing or comprehensive monitoring infrastructure.

Aurora belongs to a class of large-scale AI systems known as foundation models — the same category of AI models that power tools like ChatGPT.

Foundation models can be adapted to different tasks because they're designed to learn general patterns and relationships from large volumes of training data, rather than being built for a single, fixed task. In Aurora's case, the model learns to generate forecasts in a matter of seconds by analyzing weather patterns from sources like satellites, radar and weather stations, as well as simulated forecasts, the researchers said.

The model can then be fine-tuned for a wide range of scenarios with relatively little extra data — unlike traditional forecasting models, which are typically built for narrow, task-specific purposes and often need retraining to adapt.

The diverse dataset Aurora is trained on not only results in greater accuracy in general versus conventional methods, but also means the model is better at forecasting extreme events, researchers said.

In one example, Aurora successfully predicted a major sandstorm in Iraq in 2022, despite having limited air quality data. It also outperformed wave simulation models at forecasting ocean swell height and direction in 86% of tests, showing it could extract useful patterns from complex data even when specific inputs were missing or incomplete.

"It's got the potential to have [a] huge impact because people can really fine tune it to whatever task is relevant to them … particularly in countries which are underserved by other weather forecasting capabilities," study co-author Megan Stanley, a senior researcher at Microsoft, said in a statement.

Microsoft has made Aurora's code and training data publicly available for research and experimentation. The model has been integrated into services like MSN Weather, which itself is integrated into tools like the Windows Weather app and Microsoft's Bing search results.

The Exynos 2500 is expected to be Samsung's next flagship processor, but so far, all the information available has come from rumors and leaks, except for the one time the company acknowledged its name. Surprisingly, a big feature of the next big Samsung chip has now been confirmed, not by Samsung but by a company called Skylo.

If the name sounds a bit familiar, that's because Skylo is the satellite connectivity provider for the Pixel 9 series and the Galaxy S25 series on Verizon.

“Today, we are excited to announce the certification of the Exynos 2500 mobile processor, offering better energy efficiency and higher performance,” Skylo noted in a press release, hinting at the chip's imminent launch and confirming its extraterrestrial capabilities.

The Exynos 2500 is expected to debut on the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Rumor has it that the chipset could power the new foldable in all markets, even the US. This is also the first time Samsung will introduce a flagship Exynos chip on a foldable phone instead of its latest Galaxy S series flagship.

“Samsung's partnership with Skylo is built upon 3GPP NTN standards to unlock connectivity everywhere,” Hui Won Je, VP of the Modem Development Team at Samsung Electronics, noted in Skylo's press release. “Through our collaboration on the Samsung Exynos Modem 5400 and the Exynos 2500 mobile processor, mainstream devices worldwide will now have the underlying technology to connect to satellites wherever cellular networks are unavailable, ushering in a new era of ubiquitous connectivity,” he added.

In addition to its collaboration with Samsung, Skylo also announced partnerships with OPPO and TECNO to bring NTN-compliant satellite connectivity to future devices from the respective brands.

Over fifteen seasons, Supernatural delved into urban legends, myths, and lore from all over the world. Sam and Dean Winchester hunted monsters across the country, saving people from things that go bump in the night. Armed with sawed-off shotguns, silver blades, and holy fire, Sam and Dean took on everything from angels and demons to faeries and dragons.

Five years after Supernatural ended, creator Eric Kripke talked about the story he never got to tell and the one he would never tell. Inspired by Roald Dahl's The Gremlins, Kripke wanted to do a story about mischievous creatures that messed with technology. But Kripke purposefully steered clear of one particular religious figure when writing Supernatural.

 Richard Speight Jr. asked Eric Kripke if there was any story he wanted to do but didn't get to. Kripke said, "The one story that I always really wanted to do under my watch that I never got a chance to do was Gremlins. ‘Cause Gremlins are a real mythology that long predated the movie." Gremlins are most famous from the 1984 film.

The furry creatures wreaked havoc on a small town, blowing up washing machines and movie theaters. While there are a few instances of gremlins affecting technology, those mischievous little creatures weren't based on the gremlins to which Kripke was referring. Gremlins are fictional creatures created to explain otherwise inexplicable malfunctions in aircrafts and other machinery. The idea of gremlins became popular among the Royal Air Force pilots and crew during World War II.

Both sides experienced unexplained accidents, so the gremlins were thought to be unbiased tricksters, causing mischief and mayhem wherever they liked. Posters warning of the invisible mischief-makers depicting gremlins greasing floors and throwing things in people's eyes were made during the war. Kripke's gremlins would be more machine-focused.

And so, the Impala is the bad guy of the episode.

When describing his idea for the episode, Kripke said, "And so my notion was, okay, turns out gremlins are so small, you can't see them. So I don't have to make, like, a bunch of puppets. But they get into the Impala. And so, the Impala is the bad guy of the episode... But like all the other cars and electronics, and whatever, the rule was going to be: the only way to stop them was to destroy them totally." With the love Dean has for Baby, that would definitely be a dilemma for the eldest Winchester.

The original premise of Supernatural lacked important elements, and the show wouldn't be the same if Kripke hadn't made some big changes.

"And so then, in the middle of the episode, it was going to infect the Impala," Kripke described. "And so now Dean's like, ‘I can't destroy it. I can't like—how do I get the gremlins out of this thing? And it's like mowing over people and coming after me. But I can't destroy it. I have to save her.'" How Dean saves Baby is still a mystery, but he discussed some of the visual gags he had in mind. "But like that was a story I—like I always loved, and it was totally doable. Like it wasn't like an impossible story to pull off ... It—you know, the only monsters you ever saw would have been like the blender that someone's hand was in or the car."

It's basically all car gags all day.

When thinking back to why Kripke never made an episode about gremlins, he couldn't quite pinpoint the reason, but he said, "You know, I don't know why we never ended up doing it. Maybe, like the—I think it was, like—because they ended up doing like that great episode, ‘Baby,' that was [the one] Robbie wrote that was all within it. But I think at the time, the feeling was like we don't have enough days in the schedule to do, like, a real Impala-centric episode … It's basically all car gags all day."

While Supernatural never had a gremlin episode, something similar did happen in "Mannequin 3: The Reckoning." While it wasn't about imperceptible creatures, Baby was possessed by a ghost, and the Winchesters had to fight their Impala. "Baby" is one of the series' highest-rated episodes, taking place entirely in the Impala. Kripke's gremlins episode would've probably fallen somewhere in between the two.

When on Supernatural Then and Now, Richard Speight Jr. asked Eric Kripke if he'd ever considered including Jesus in the Supernatural mythology. “I wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole, man,” Kripke responded. “Like I'm not getting, like, super specific about Jesus.” Kripke did mention that comic books like Preacher partly inspired Supernatural.

“You know, the, the comic book sources that a lot of that stuff came from, like Preacher, you know, and Garth Ennis. And they were all—I mean—yes, there is sort of like a whacked-out Jesus character in that. But to me, it was like the binary, like God versus Lucifer without getting, like, too specific. You know, so that there're a lot of religions it could play under rather than, you know, being with any one particular religion.”

I wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole, man.

As non-specific as he tried to keep the mythology of the arching plot line of Supernatural's early seasons, Kripke and the writers did eliminate several belief systems in the season five episode “Hammer of the Gods.” Sam and Dean roll up in their iconic Chevy Imapala to a five-star hotel in the middle of nowhere, called the Elysian Fields.

It turned out the hotel was magically renovated to welcome several gods and deities from other faiths. The gods met to discuss what, if anything, they were going to do about the impending apocalypse. It ended in a slaughter at the hands of Lucifer. There were figures from Greek, Norse, Chinese, and Egyptian mythology, and some Hinduism.

Supernatural's "Swan Song" is hailed as Eric Kripke's perfect finale to the series, but his ending is actually much darker and unsatisfying.

The episode was well-received, but inserting deities from belief systems currently being practiced by millions of people didn't go over well with some viewers—namely the representation of Ganesh and Kali. In addition to poorly portraying the gods and what they represent, they made them appear weak, like the pagan gods that are no longer worshiped—although there are over a billion practicing Hindus worldwide. The episode played very heavily into the idea of Christianity as the absolute religion, offending many fans of the series. 

We wanted to be provocative without being, you know, firebombed.

Kripke also joked about finding the line in their storytelling, saying, “And, you know, we wanted to be provocative without being, you know, firebombed, I think.” The decision not to portray the Christian messiah was probably a good call, as the mythology was already limited to Abrahamic religions. Considering how offended a portion of viewers felt by “Hammer of the Gods,” there's a decent chance they could've alienated even more of their audience.
