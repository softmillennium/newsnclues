                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bad news, folks: we all went to sleep, woke up, and the Trump phone is still here. For one, it means the T1 phone wasn't the result of a spicy, food-fueled fever dream or a bad batch of crazy-style mushrooms—it's a real phone that costs real money, made by a real president, who thinks “fox in the henhouse” is an allegory for how to win bigly in the U.S. government. It also means something else depressing, and it's got nothing to do with making America great and everything to do with undermining your privacy. There are a lot of bad things about the Trump phone. There's the gaudy, I-hate-poor-people gold aesthetic; the “long life camera” that I assume is supposed to mean “long-life battery” that is actually not long-life at all; and the fact that it's masquerading as an American-made device, though it clearly is not being made in America and likely never will be. My personal favorite is the fact that it's 5G enabled, which, as we all know, may not jibe well for a certain subsect of people whose conspiratorial cult (QAnon) thinks 5G caused COVID-19. But all of that could be trivial when you unpack how disastrous a Trump phone (at least in theory) could really be. As I mentioned yesterday, after the T1's announcement, phones aren't just any product; they're kind of conduits into your whole life. What's to prevent, say, I don't know, someone who works in government with direct access to that information from collecting and using that data for their own purpose? There's a reason why the government doesn't own the platforms we compute on, and it starts with “c” and ends in “onflict of interest.” Some actual specs for the upcoming Trump Phone:-5000mAh long life camera (? )-under "Processor & RAM" it reads "Storage 12GB RAM", so maybe the next phone will have a processor-two of the three rear cameras are 2MP pic.twitter.com/PzPQtHGZsk Sure, I know that our devices are already a privacy minefield to begin with, and doubly so are the platforms that we access through them, but something tells me that encoding politics directly into our devices isn't going to skew those privacy pitfalls in a positive direction. No technology is completely agnostic at the end of the day, but that doesn't mean we should just give up on making our hardware as safe and as neutral as possible. I don't want to be an alarmist here; Trump's phone likely won't end up being a threat to that already-tenuous digital privacy for several reasons. One is that this phone sucks, and I don't think many people will be tempted to buy it, let alone use it every day or throw their most personal information into it. Secondly, even if this thing did sell, only the most hardcore Trump supporters would be using it, so the privacy pitfalls would only affect Trump's voting base. Lastly, I have my doubts that this thing is even real. There's a high chance, if I were a betting man, that Trump's family never even gets their shit together enough to make this monstrosity a reality, especially if initial attempts to purchase it are any indication. Phones aren't shoes; they're not memeocins; they're not NFT Christmas ornaments or commemorative coins—they're people's lives, for better and often worse.

Yesterday, it emerged that Intel's next-generation Core Ultra 9 'Nova Lake-S' processors for desktops will feature as many as 52 cores, which makes them quite formidable contenders both for gaming and for performance-demanding applications. It turns out that the whole Nova Lake-S platform will be quite beastly too, as it will support DDR5-8000 memory and will feature as many as 32 PCIe 5.0 lanes, according to Jaykihn, a blogger with an excellent reputation when it comes to Intel's plans. Memory subsystem of the new CPU will feature two channels supporting up to one DDR5-8000 memory module per channel, though it is unclear whether Intel plans to support regular DDR5-8000 DIMMs, or DDR5-8000 CUDIMMs with a clock driver chip. There is a small catch, though, as each pair of Nova Lake's high-performance cores will feature a shared 2MB L2 cache, according to HXL. Using shared L2 cache will affect the performance of Coyote Cove cores, though this is a necessary tradeoff to pack up to 52 cores into next-generation Core Ultra 9 and up to 42 cores into next-generation Core Ultra 7 CPUs, as well as double the number of high-performance cores in high-end CPUs. Hopefully, support for high-speed DDR5 memory will offset the smaller L2 cache, and the performance of Coyote Cove will not be lower than the performance of Lion Cove cores. In addition, the chipset will support eight PCIe 5.0 lanes and 16 PCIe 4.0 lanes for peripherals, which could enable rather monstrous systems with loads of storage and plenty of add-in cards and accelerators.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. I had it unboxed and set up within a couple of hours, lights on and water pump running. Even though from setup to harvest the Gardyn required the use of about five brain cells, I was quite pleased with myself, despite having long ago given up gardening outdoors due to deer, rabbits, and my own incompetence with anything other than starts from the big-box store. What I failed to understand, but would come to grasp with subsequent systems, was that indoor hydroponic gardening is just as hard in some ways as outdoor gardening. I had no way of knowing this, however, because Gardyn's pricey add-on app and AI gardening assistant, “Kelby,” had been doing all the real work via a network of sensors and live-view cameras (two on the larger Home model, one on the smaller Studio). My new friend Kelby had been gathering data in order to set its own watering times, schedule its 60 LED lights, and send me the occasional customized task that never took longer than 10 minutes. And this customized maintenance isn't just helpful for convenience, as mold, bacteria, or roots clogging up the plumbing are extremely common in hydroponic gardening. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There's also remote monitoring, of course, and a vacation mode that keeps the plants in a sort of stasis. Most of the work on my end was simply me admiring my plants, and admire them I did. I want one!” announced nearly every person who shuffled by in their paper booties. Even in a $2 million spec house, the lit-up display of lush herbs, flowers, and vegetables was a showstopper. At this point, I had successfully grown sunflowers, lemon balm, and even an entire kohlrabi. Within five minutes of opening the other systems' boxes and finding pH test strips and vials, manual-dial timers, and multiple bags of supplements, however, I realized I did not have this. And, according to founder FX Rouxel (pronounced F-X, like the initials), that's Gardyn's entire raison d'être. Though he did once work for the French version of the Environmental Protection Agency, his most recent pre-Gardyn gig was at French IT company Capgemini, deploying cloud, automation, and AI technologies. Although he is also a parent, cook, and Ironman athlete, his passion lies in using technology to lower the entry barrier to growing your own food. Unlike our competitors, we have a big chunk of the company that is just engineers." They make sure the Gardyn app is constantly adjusting through data collected via the system's two cameras and sensors that track water usage, humidity, temperature, and plant growth. It didn't seem to affect any of my tasks or plant stats, but I found it irritating nonetheless. Though if I weren't using the Kelby feature, it wouldn't matter, as the cameras are essentially useless otherwise. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Another plus with the Gardyn is its shape. The footprint is significantly smaller than comparable systems—the 5-gallon recirculating water tank (it comes with a bottle of plant food designed to keep a balanced pH) takes up a rectangular 2 square feet for the Home, 1.4 for Studio. The PVC-like pipes (three on the Home, two on the Studio) have holes that are pointed at different angles, both to prevent crowding and to allow plants to grow tall, whereas on other systems, height is limited by overhead lights. Gardyn's lights instead run on rails in front of the plants. To take maximum advantage of the clearance, Gardyn also sells add-on trellises if you want to grow vining plants like cucumbers or miniature pumpkins. I also like that Gardyn's yCubes use rockwool as a growth medium. I didn't think much of this until I began testing other systems that use peat pellets and learned the hard way that peat has a tendency to attract fungus gnats. New GMO-free and heirloom varieties specially tested for the Gardyn are constantly being added to the lineup, Rouxel said. (Gardyn does have by far the most plant varieties among its competitors.) All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Gardyn Studio comes with a 16-cube starter set, and Gardyn Home comes with 30—buyers can select either salad greens, flowers, or “chef faves.” I chose the latter, which included a lot of brassicas along with bunching onions, lettuces, and some interesting greens like sorrel. If one of the cubes doesn't sprout, Gardyn will replace it for free. The membership also includes 10 credits per month with free shipping to “buy” yCubes (which range from about one to three credits, or around $5 each), more plant food, accessories, or spare parts. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. People do forgo the membership to jury-rig their own setups with their own seeds—Amazon sells 3D-printed knockoff yCubes for cheap—but judging from posts in the Gardyners Facebook group, problems abound with wilting, premature bolting, and pests. (If you do, the warranty is two years.) As for the cost, Rouxel said, Gardyn is actively trying to get it down, but in the meantime, the company is subsidizing a 0 percent APR on Affirm and Klarna: “We're actually paying the difference so everyone can get up to three years.” Veteran hydroponic gardening nerds will scoff so hard at the idiot-proof Gardyn they might hurt themselves (like the one Redditor who declared it a toy for “coastal elite fart sniffers”), but I think there is a place for making the act of growing your own food as accessible as possible for every level of gardener, whether they live in an apartment with no yard or in an area where they can't grow food year round. And, of course, if you're a parent or caregiver, there's endless value in showing kids where their food comes from. “I'm really amazed at the impact it has had on people's lives,” Rouxel said. What I want is for them to grow up as healthy adults with the right habits. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Godzilla's been having a comics cameo queen moment for a while now, and Marvel has been celebrating the Big G's 70th anniversary in style with a series of fun one-issue crossovers with a whole host of Marvel heroes, from the Fantastic Four to Spider-Man. But the fun's over now: Godzilla's here to stomp over the Marvel Universe for real, and as things get from bad to worse for heroes and villains alike, it's almost time for mutantkind to enter the fight to save Earth. Gerry Duggan and Javier Garron, and Paco Medina's Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe is set to kick off next month, and we've already had a few tempting teases of just how bad things are going to get as Godzilla reawakens in Marvel's Manhattan, forcing heroes and villains alike to unite in a desperate gambit to stop the King of All Monsters. Our first teases for August's second issue of the five-issue mini have already teases that Godzilla might become even more dangerous by bonding with the Venom symbiote, but io9 has your first exclusive look the solicit for issue 3 of the series–as the X-Men hope to survive the experience that is a battle with Godzilla himself! Check out the solicit for Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe #3 below, as well as your first look at all covers for the issue. Issue 3 will feature a main cover from Marvel stalwart Mark Brooks, depicting Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Storm, Gambit, and Rogue alongside Godzilla, as well as a series of variant covers, including an action-figure style cover by John Tyler Christopher (featuring classic Godzilla kaiju Hedorah the Smog Monster), a “Marvelized” Godzilla cover by Dave Wachter depicting an Iron Man/Mechagodzilla mashup, and a gorgeous variant from Jeremy Wilson showcasing Cyclops and Godzilla blasting it out. But perhaps our favourite is a bold cover by Jeehyung Lee that asks the ultimate question: who will win, one giant kaiju, or one very small, angry Canadian? Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe #3 is set to hit comic book stores September 24, 2025. Check out where you can find a store to add a copy to your pull list at Comic Shop Locator.

Whether you're going camping for a long weekend, spending all day at the beach, or you just want a backup in case something happens to the power grid, having one of these devices around can be a huge help. They're very expensive normally though, so you're nearly always best off waiting for a really good deal. Well, we just so happen to have found a really good deal today, and on a really good brand. The Anker Solix C1000 Portable Power Station is a mighty option, and while it'd normally set you back $799 on Amazon, it's currently a massive 44% off, making it just $449 right now. This is a limited-time deal though, so we're not expecting it to last long. This portable power station has a lot of stuff going for it. It's durable too, and can manage 3,000 battery cycles over a 10-year period, meaning it should be good for even the most hardcore outdoorsy types. If you do want to upgrade though, then getting some solar panels can allow it to passively charge throughout the day, and makes for a great way to stay powered-up even on longer trips. It's a small benefit that not everyone is going to use, but those who want to will adore being able to really take control of this device. That's an awful lot of good for just $449 (-44%), but just keep in mind that it's unlikely to stay at this price for very long because of how Amazon's limited-time deals work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Food distribution giant United Natural Foods (UNFI) said it is making “significant progress” in recovering from a cyberattack that occurred almost two weeks ago, as grocery stores across North America reliant on the distributor continue to report food shortages. UNFI said in an update on Sunday that it was restoring its electronic ordering systems, which its customers use to place orders for their grocery stores and supermarkets. One of the largest grocers affected is Whole Foods, which relies on UNFI as its “primary distributor.” Several Whole Foods stores, including one visited by TechCrunch last week and others in the New York area, are experiencing shelf shortages amid the UNFI outages. One employee at a Whole Foods in California told TechCrunch about the supply issues at their store, saying they had not seen some products for days. Whole Foods previously told TechCrunch that it was working to restore its shelves “as quickly as possible,” but did not say when shipments would return to normal. People working at local grocery stores and big-chain supermarkets alike have told TechCrunch that they continue to experience disruption of varying degrees. One employee at a grocery store run by the Defense Commissary Agency said they were seeing empty shelves and delayed shipments. “This incident has affected deliveries across multiple grocery chains, including 53 Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) stores,” said Robinson. “The DeCA supply chain team has worked closely with UNFI to implement manual workarounds that have effectively minimized in-store disruptions.” UNFI has not yet provided a timeline for recovery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that often causes sudden and intense shortness of breath. Researchers in the U.K. have found that women who work night shifts are more likely to have moderate or severe asthma than women who work during the day. The study, published Monday in the journal ERJ Open Research, does not reveal any such tendency in men working nightshifts, and could hold important implications for public health guidance. The team had previously shown that permanent night shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from moderate-severe asthma compared to day workers. “Since increasing numbers of females are becoming shift workers it is important to determine if shift work-associated asthma risk is higher in females,” the researchers wrote in the study. Shift work refers to scheduled working periods that fall outside of traditional daytime hours. “Our main aim was to investigate sex differences in the association between shift work and asthma.” The researchers did so by analyzing data belonging to over 274,541 working people from the U.K. Biobank, a biomedical database open to health researchers. The researchers found that female shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from asthma, and women who only work nightshifts have 50% higher likelihood of developing moderate or severe asthma than female daytime workers. Furthermore, the risk increases “with both number of monthly night shifts and longer lifetime duration of night shift work,” they explained. Interestingly, the data did not reveal any differences in the prevalence of asthma in men based on their work schedule. High testosterone has previously been shown to be protective against asthma, and so lower testosterone in women could play a role. Among women not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT, a treatment for menopausal symptoms), postmenopausal women working only night shifts were almost twice as likely to have moderate-severe asthma than female day workers. This suggests that HRT might protect nightshift workers from asthma, though the researchers admit that more studies are needed to confirm this. The majority of workers will not have an easy option of switching their shift pattern, so we need further research to verify and understand this link and find out what could be done to reduce the risk for women who work shifts,” explained Florence Schleich from the European Respiratory Society, who was not involved in the study. Moving forward, the researchers aim to investigate how sex hormones might influence asthma prevalence among shift workers. Perhaps this line of research will also shed light on what drives the respiratory disease, given that the exact cause remains a mystery.

The first reports about Intel's plans to cut workforce in its manufacturing division starting mid-July emerged last Friday. However, the report lacked specifics, which appear to be quite dramatic as the chipmaker reportedly plans to eliminate between 15% to 20% of its Intel Foundry personnel, which will affect over 8,170-10,890 people globally, reports OregonLive. He stated that reductions would be guided by business priorities, individual evaluations, and decisions around which projects to continue funding. Intel's Silicon Forest Oregon facilities were not spared from layoffs last year, cutting approximately 3,000 jobs while still retaining roughly 20,000 employees. Intel has 15 wafer fabs in production worldwide at 10 locations. Intel does not disclose exactly how many of its employees work in production and related services, though the company says that approximately half of its workforce handles production or production services. The remaining half is distributed across R&D, design, sales, administrative roles, client, data center, and other business units. Intel will not offer buyouts or voluntary departures this year, opting instead for selective terminations in an attempt to keep the best employees with the company, the report says. However, the new report indicates that affected roles may span a range of positions, from technicians working directly on factory floors or under them to tool operators and support personnel. However, Intel may trim positions made redundant by automation or organizational efficiency. While reducing non-essential roles helps cut costs while maintaining critical expertise in the company, it may also reduce operational agility, slow responses to equipment problems, and increase pressure on remaining employees, which lowers morale and could result in costly downtime.

Separately, Oregon pledged $115 million in public funds, but those are conditional on meeting future hiring and tax revenue targets. If hiring or revenue projections are missed, state funding could be withdrawn. Anton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom's Hardware.

For those on the lookout for an alternative game upscaling solution, the new LSFG 3.1 update comes with image quality and performance gains, potentially delivering “up to 2x GPU load reduction,” according to the developer. The headlining 2x GPU load reduction comes courtesy of this tool's new Performance Mode. According to the release notes, the new mode delivers this boost, depending on hardware config and settings, “with a slight reduction in image quality.” So, as is often the case with these kinds of tools, there can be a trade-off. In some cases, it is noted that the new Performance Mode can, conversely, “improve image quality by allowing the game to achieve a higher base frame rate.” So, this is yet another graphical tweak that gamers will need to explore on a per-hardware-config, per-game, and per-preference basis. Developed by a one-man band, the Lossless Scaling utility is a GPU-agnostic tool that provides an alternative graphics upscaling technology at the one-off bargain price of $6.99. If your GPU doesn't support technologies like DLSS, FSR, or XeSS, you may be attracted to Lossless Scaling to fill the gap with admirable performance and configurability. The tool has found a lot of fans within the PC gaming community, especially among those who sometimes find the best GPU they have at hand is an older discrete card or integrated graphics. As well as offering up its own built-in upscaling options (like LS1, Nearest Neighbor, xBR, Bicubic CAS, and Anime 4K), Lossless Scaling can work its magic via AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution or Nvidia Image Scaling. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Like other upscalers, Lossless Scaling isn't without its issues, particularly apparent when pixel peeping, or in games where frame gen latency is a no-no. Though flagged as a “major update” and containing “significant architectural improvements” the Lossless Scaling tool version is only incremented by 0.1, to 3.1. But for all we know, there may be even more significant updates and feature introductions in line to push the version up a whole number. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>About a week later an email arrived that crushed her: DHL was demanding a $142 fee for US tariffs before it would deliver the well-worn medallion tote to Smith-Darley's Atlanta doorstep. Tariffs imposed this year by President Donald Trump have triggered higher prices and decreased selection, and some shoppers have been surprised to learn that the taxes apply to used goods. Several online marketplaces, including eBay and Vestiaire Collective, have been urging lawmakers and officials in Washington, DC, to exempt used items from import duties, including those recently imposed by President Trump, according to industry executives. “We're still a maturing industry, but we are the future,” says Rachel Kibbe, CEO of American Circular Textiles, an advocacy group that represents about 30 organizations, including Vestiaire Collective, that make, fix, rent, sell, recycle, or resell clothes. “We would just like preferential trade treatment for secondhand imports.” An exemption would likely lead importers to try to pass off new items as used, creating an additional enforcement burden for a government that's already stretched thin by Trump's “government efficiency” efforts. They note that the concept of duties on pre-owned wares dates back to at least medieval-era trade. It's far more challenging to envision a payoff from applying those same tariffs to used goods that are destined for new homes instead of landfills. Cohen says a reasonable approach would be to maintain tariffs on used items but at lower rates that would be commensurate with the risk posed to domestic manufacturing. Looking overseas may also be unavoidable for niche items, like trading cards and used handbags. Circular economy advocates contend that reuse, even when it involves an item crossing national borders, still may produce some environmental benefit by cutting waste. “There should be policies that encourage people to choose used items first,” says Liisa Jokinen, founder of the vintage clothing app Gem. As consumers seek out products that are more sustainable for the environment and their wallets, a new supply chain has emerged. Earlier this year, eBay's Japanese unit disclosed surging demand for secondhand cameras as people panic-shopped before Trump's tariffs took effect. Worldwide, about 40 percent of eBay's gross sales come from what it calls “pre-loved and refurbished items.” Previously, imports under $800, whether used or new, were not subject to tariffs. People accustomed to buying goods such as pre-owned, luxury accessories that are above the de minimis threshold weren't as surprised by the higher fees. Trump, though, has added an additional minimum tariff of 10 percent globally. Isaac Panzarella, who co-owns the Brooklyn, New York, shop Raleigh Vintage with his wife, says increased shipping costs and greater pressure to source the right items have led the couple to visit Europe more frequently, personally selecting merchandise to stock their racks. He believes there should be an exemption for items older than say, 20 years, making them free from tariffs. “At that point, it's not really displacing production or jobs in the US,” he says. Having tariffs on used items has arguably benefitted the US economy during certain periods. But this week, Smith-Darley says she learned that DHL had failed to hold her package while she was out of town and that it will be sent back to Japan. DHL didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In a way, the tariffs may be working as intended. Vestiaire Collective is nudging US shoppers to select used options from domestic sellers, and customers are buying them up, says US CEO Samina Virk. Smith-Darley, for her part, isn't slowing down her hunt for vintage goods—she's just making sure the ones she buys are sourced from the US. “I just walked in there like an idiot before,” she says.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. On Reddit, a very spicy thread calls into question the necessity for recommended hardware such as an octa-core CPU, and at least an RTX 3080 / RX 6800 XT, to enjoy Borderlands 4. We also note that 32GB of RAM is recommended, and this game will eat up to 100GB of SSD storage at launch. However, small print under the recommended specs listing asserts that “12GB+” is required. We wonder if VRAM might become an issue with GPUs like the new RTX 5070. From its origins, Borderlands set itself apart in visual style using a ‘cel-shading' graphical style, using thick outlines and stylized textures throughout. While this simpler-than-nature representation of characters and 3D worlds should have made the game less demanding in the 3D stakes, layering on all sorts of enhancing graphical enhancements and particle effects worked against this. Actually, the initial trio of Borderlands games made use of Nvidia PhysX to render its best dynamic cloth, explosive debris, and particle effects. Borderlands 3 moved away from dedicated GPU PhysX, handling the same style of visual effects in a more GPU-agnostic manner. And now we have Borderlands 4 set to arrive in a few months, packing the latest Unreal Engine 5 – a notoriously demanding foundation for PC games. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. PC gaming stalwarts may also not be surprised to see that Borderlands 4 is also going to feature potentially performance-impacting DRM. The product page says it will arrive laced with Denuvo and Symbiote. That price is in line with the BL3 launch. The Deluxe adds “4 unique areas, missions, & bosses,” as well as some new gear and weapons, and four new vehicles. Moving up to the Super Deluxe edition, gamers are most upset by there being “2 new playable Vault Hunters” exclusively included at this price. Hopefully, Gearbox, the dev team behind the franchise, can do some optimization between now and September 12 to ensure Borderlands 4 can run more smoothly and slickly on lesser hardware. For those who care very deeply about price, patience will usually be rewarded. Switch 2 gamers will have to wait a little longer. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Customs and Border Protection experienced a sharp rise in reports about potential tariff evasion after President Donald Trump abruptly imposed new duties on over 100 countries earlier this year, according to data the agency shared with WIRED. But the new data suggests that Trump's policies may have pushed more firms to adopt these kinds of legally risky tactics. Submissions can be made anonymously, and trade experts say they often come from a company's former employees or competitors. Trade attorney Jennifer Diaz says her law firm files “tons of e-Allegations” on behalf of clients, and she has found that CBP often does take them seriously. When CBP catches wrongdoing, it can “help level the playing field,” says Diaz, including by wiping out artificially low prices from a market. Congress has yet to finalize legislation known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would increase border staffing and resources for countering smuggling. Last year, a US Department of Treasury inspector general audit report concluded that CBP had not adequately tracked the outcomes of e-Allegations tips and called for new training and oversight measures to be put in place. From October 2018 through September 2020, CBP confirmed 68 out of over 900 duty evasion tips it received, the report found. But out of an estimated $65 million in unpaid duties, CBP did not know how much it ended up collecting. Data on tips and penalties are important because, unless Trump's tariffs are sufficiently enforced, they may fall short of the president's stated goals of increasing revenue and US manufacturing. Some companies also could grow frustrated with his administration if illegal conduct by their competitors goes unpunished. CBP spokesperson Trish Driscoll declined to comment on the number of duty evasion investigations happening at US ports and whether they have increased, citing law enforcement sensitivities. In general, she says that the agency uses a combination of “advanced data analytics, risk-based targeting, inspections, audits, investigations, and coordination with government agencies to identify patterns of evasion.” Since Trump began announcing sweeping new tariffs in February, importers have been filling online forums with questions and advice about tactics that could help them reduce their tariff burdens. Consultants who help importers previously told WIRED that clients have received unsolicited offers from foreign business partners to skirt tariffs using dodgy tactics. Companies can legally obtain lower tariff rates by shifting their manufacturing operations to other jurisdictions or changing the components, materials, and features of their products. More quick and affordable options, though, may violate the law. Another common tactic is to misrepresent the type of item being imported on customs declarations, since tariffs can vary by product. Whistleblowers can earn a reward of up to $250,000 through the e-Allegations program. They can receive higher sums by filing what's known as a qui tam lawsuit under the False Claims Act, though that process includes jumping through extra legal hoops. The lawsuits are initially filed under seal, so it may not be evident for years whether there has been an increase recently, says Gregg Shapiro, an attorney who specializes in the False Claims Act. Even given the recent increase in tips, many tariff violations may be going unreported, according to trade experts. About $14 billion in assessed tariffs stemmed from Trump's new policies, but the total lost to evasion will likely never be known. We talked to a fired DOGE staffer about who was really in charge</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The man who allegedly assassinated a Democratic Minnesota state representative, murdered her husband, and shot a state senator and his wife at their homes in a violent spree early Saturday morning may have gotten their addresses or other personal details from online data broker services, according to court documents. According to an FBI affidavit, police searched the SUV believed to be the suspect's and found notebooks that included handwritten lists of “more than 45 Minnesota state and federal public officials, including Representative Hortman's, whose home address was written next to her name.” According to the same affidavit, one notebook also listed 11 mainstream search platforms for finding people's home addresses and other personal information, like phone numbers and relatives. The addresses for both lawmakers targeted on Saturday were readily available. Representative Hortman's campaign website listed her home address, while Senator Hoffman's appeared on his legislative webpage, The New York Times reports. “Boelter stalked his victims like prey,” acting US attorney Joseph Thompson alleged at a press conference on Monday. Privacy and public safety advocates have long argued that the US should regulate data brokers to guarantee that people have better control over the sensitive information available about them. “The accused Minneapolis assassin allegedly used data brokers as a key part of his plot to track down and murder Democratic lawmakers,” Ron Wyden, the US senator from Oregon, tells WIRED. “Congress doesn't need any more proof that people are being killed based on data for sale to anyone with a credit card. Every single American's safety is at risk until Congress cracks down on this sleazy industry.” In many cases, basic information like home addresses can be found through public records, including voter registration data (which is public in some states) and political donations data, says Gary Warner, a longtime digital scams researcher and director of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm DarkTower. “Finding a home address, especially if someone has lived in the same place for many years is trivial,” Warner says. For many in the general public as well as in politics, Saturday's violent crime spree brings new urgency to the long-standing question of how to protect sensitive personal data online. “Lawmakers need to act before they have more blood on their hands.” There's a very simple pattern to Elon Musk's broken promises Big Story: The epic rise and fall of a dark-web psychedelics kingpin WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.
