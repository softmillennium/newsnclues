                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The authors have published a comprehensive review that explores how particles containing heavy quarks (known as charm and bottom hadrons) interact in a hot, dense environment called hadronic matter. This environment is created in the last phase of high-energy collisions of atomic nuclei, such as those taking place at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The new study highlights the importance of including hadronic interactions in simulations to accurately interpret data from experiments at these large scientific infrastructures. When two atomic nuclei collide at near-light speeds, they generate temperatures more than a 1,000 times higher than those at the centre of the Sun. The study focuses on what happens to heavy-flavour hadrons (particles containing charmed or background quarks, such as D and B mesons) during this transition and the hadronic phase expansion that follows it. Being so massive, they are produced just after the initial nuclear collision and move more slowly, thus interacting differently with the surrounding matter. Knowing how they scatter and spread is key to learning about the properties of the medium through which they travel. Researchers have reviewed a wide range of theoretical models and experimental data to understand how heavy hadrons, such as D and B mesons, interact with light particles in the hadronic phase. They have also examined how these interactions affect observable quantities such as particle flux and momentum loss. "To really understand what we see in the experiments, it is crucial to observe how the heavy particles move and interact also during the later stages of these nuclear collisions," says Juan M. Torres-Rincón, member of the Department of Quantum Physics and Astrophysics and ICCUB. "This phase, when the system has already cooled down, still plays an important role in how the particles lose energy and flow together. A simple analogy can be used to better understand these results: when we drop a heavy ball into a crowded pool, even after the biggest waves have dissipated, the ball continues to move and collide with people. Similarly, heavy particles created in nuclear collisions continue to interact with other particles around them, even after the hottest and most chaotic phase. Ignoring this phase would therefore mean missing an important part of the story. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On October 14, 2024, NASA's Europa Clipper launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for Jupiter's fourth largest moon. Its mission is to assess the moon's potential to host life in the vast ocean beneath its icy crust. While the Europa Clipper is a milestone in humanity's ability to study the oceans of other worlds, Earth's oceans still hold many mysteries yet unsolved by science. Without leaving Earth, scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) and the Universidad de Concepción in Chile have discovered new life themselves—a previously unknown, active predator in one of the deepest trenches in the world. Although its white carapace gives it a ghostly, almost Facehugger-from-Alien feel, the name is fitting if you consider that this predator lives out its life 7,000 meters below the aphotic zone, where absolute darkness reigns. Because of its deep ocean environment, this mighty crustacean, which is only roughly four centimeters in length, can also withstand pressures up to 800 times stronger than pressures found on land. “This finding underlines the importance of continued deep-ocean exploration, particularly in Chile's front yard,” IMO's Carolina González, co-lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “More discoveries are expected as we continue to study the Atacama Trench.” If something so small can persevere in conditions as adverse as those in the Hadal zone, maybe Europa Clipper has a non-zero shot at finding conditions that could support life in the vast, salty ocean of a whole different world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What Greenland's Ancient Past Reveals about Its Fragile Future Is that ice more vulnerable than we know? Expedition members Caleb Walcott-George and Arnar Pall Gíslason use a hand drill to pull rock cores out of an outcropping, called a nunatak on the Greenland ice sheet in May 2024. The samples they extract could help solve a much larger climate puzzle: When was the last time that Greenland was green? This story was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center.

Upended and laid atop the contiguous U.S., it would look like a flowing mountain range more than a mile and half tall at its highest point and 20 to 30 miles across, extending from Boston to Washington, D.C. If the entire Greenland ice sheet melted, global sea levels would rise by about 24 feet. The sheet won't melt all at once, of course, but scientists are increasingly concerned by signs of accelerating ice-sheet retreat. A recent report showed that it has been losing mass every year for the past 27 years. Another study found that nearly every Greenlandic glacier has thinned or retreated in the past few decades. Team members Tanner Kuhl, Forest Harmon and Elliot Moravec (left to right) operate the Winkie Drill at the GreenDrill field camp. The drill is designed to cut through both ice and rock. It seemed like something was about to go right, finally—in an expedition where almost nothing had before the team made it to the ice. So much in the weeks leading up to this moment had been uncertain. There were logistical delays and failed landings by military cargo planes. A more ambitious plan, which included a much larger drill and two different sample sites, had been scrapped. But at this moment, with just two weeks remaining in the expedition, their bit sat at the edge of discovery. The zone below was thought to hold within it a revelation: frozen in stone was a picture of this place but ice-free. Knowing the last time this area was actually green would help scientists answer a question of enormous consequence: Is the Greenland ice sheet even more fragile than we know? Since President Donald Trump announced his administration's desire to “get” the world's largest island, Greenland has been the subject of sudden global attention. Climate change is exposing land formerly covered by ice, heightening political tensions on the island nation—and in the waters surrounding it as sea ice also disappears. But although the administration's plan to extract Greenland's natural resources is new, the American desire to occupy it, and pull value from underneath its frozen heart, is not. In 1956 and 1957 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment, or SIPRE, recovered the first long ice cores from Greenland. Europeans and Americans alike had been trying to cross and dig into the ice sheet for decades before then. The “father of continental drift” himself, Alfred Wegener, is still entombed there. Wegener made four expeditions to study Greenland's ice in his lifetime. During his final expedition, in 1930, he died out on the ice. Just before he became a part of the ice record, he wrote: “We are approaching a new era of polar exploration characterized by the successful utilization of new technologies in a rational manner. Everything that we want to and can measure must be measured on the ground.” In 1956 American scientists were doing exactly that, but the reason they were there at all had as much to do with the cold war as it did with the cold ice. The government's real mission was to build Arctic capabilities so it could both operate and listen from somewhere much closer to the Soviet Union. The location where SIPRE pulled those first deep ice cores from was called Site 2, and despite its public science mission, it was also a top-secret radar installation watching 24-7 for Soviet threats. But the tense geopolitics allowed a scientific discovery that, until then, had seemed impossible: the recovery of deep ice cores that kicked off an international race to recover and interrogate deeper and deeper ice. Those ice cores, and all that would be collected after them, became a kind of high-resolution climatological bedrock on which much of our understanding of rapid climate change rests. Researchers have dated them, measured the pressure of their enclosed air bubbles, characterized the structure of their snow, detected ancient volcanic cataclysms in their particulate content, and more. The results have given us an indirect way to track the timing of large and abrupt shifts in climate as far back as 123,000 years ago in the case of Greenland and 1.2 million years ago for ice extracted from Antarctica. “They are basically a backbone of climate science in terms of giving us these continuous, high-resolution climate records,” says Joerg Schaefer, GreenDrill's co-principal investigator. I have a personal 25-year history with one of these backbones. Ice cores' bands come from seasonal variations in snowfall; in this marine mud, the winter sediment from above showed up one color, the summer sediment another. I used a measurement technique that allowed me to pull a climate signal out of the alternating light and dark bands. But to confirm that those climate wiggles were real, I had to try to match what I saw with other records that climatologists were really sure showed a strong connection to the hot and cold climate swings of the past; enter Greenland's ice cores. In 1999, when I was doing my research, the gold standards for such climate-record wiggle matching were ice cores from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) or from the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP). These two projects were a kind of friendly arms race between two different teams—one led by scientists in the U.S. (GISP2), the other by researchers in Europe (GRIP)—but without all the cold war skulduggery. When the U.S. group finished a year later, not only did its core reach deeper than 10,000 feet, but the scientists were also able to collect a five-foot-long core of some of the rarest rock in the world—rock from under an ice sheet. A drone's-eye view of the windswept GreenDrill camp. My mud record stretched from the present back to about 52,000 years ago. I could take that record of wiggles from dark (cold world above) to light (warmer world above) and see whether the same temperature-related wiggles pulled from the ice core matched up. Many other climate researchers saw the same thing. But in all the years researchers spent hunting for ice and finding out all they could about its nature, they mostly neglected to interrogate the stuff the ice is sitting on. “These are moon rocks for us—the most rare and the most hard-to-drill surface rocks anywhere on Earth—and we have practically no direct observations.” Schaefer and Briner have spent more than a decade fixated on this deep gap in climate science. “I have, for the first time ever in my career, datasets that take my sleep away at night,” Schaefer says. Jen Christiansen; Source: Jason Briner/University at Buffalo (scientist reviewer) The ice core went off to be immortalized in thousands of research papers as a centerpiece of climate science. There it sat for almost two decades. In 2016 Schaefer, Briner and their collaborators exhumed the rock core and read it like a buried history book. They published a research paper in Nature entitled “Greenland Was Nearly Ice-Free for Extended Periods during the Pleistocene.” The Pleistocene, a period that includes the last ice age, stretched from around 2.6 million to 11,000 years ago, when woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats and the first modern humans roamed over earth and ice. “You do one data point, bedrock underneath the thickest part of the Greenland ice sheet, so you basically have to melt the entire ice sheet to make that spot ice-free,” Schaefer says. “Even there the bedrock was telling us, ‘Hell, yes, I was ice-free a lot over the last geological period. “It started what some people like to call the fragile Greenland hypothesis,” says Paul Bierman, an author and geoscientist at the University of Vermont. Bierman and others have found additional evidence to support the worrying idea. In 2023 he and his colleagues published a study that showed “multiple lines of evidence” indicating much of northwestern Greenland was ice-free around 400,000 years ago. The GreenDrill team is preparing to publish new findings that are even more unnerving for humanity. At a recent academic conference, he presented solid evidence that an area in northwestern Greenland three times the size of New York City and currently covered by ice a third of a mile thick was either completely or nearly completely ice-free as recently as about 7,000 years ago. That corresponds with a time called the Holocene Thermal Maximum, when temperatures were just a few degrees warmer on average than they are now. Walcott-George says that's within the range of warming we might experience by 2100. Polar survival specialist and guide Gíslason uses a Shaw portable drill to bore through solid rock on a nunatak on the Greenland ice sheet. Walcott-George and Allie Balter-Kennedy of Tufts University stood shoulder to shoulder in a small, blacked-out tent originally designed for spearfishing pike over a frozen lake. The only light was a dim tangerine glow coming from a single LED strip taped to the ceiling. This rock could tell them when it last saw the light of day. But that memory was delicate, and even a flash of sunlight could throw it off. Certain minerals in the rock act like batteries by “charging” when they are buried. “We can determine essentially the charge rate, and by doing this we can figure out how long these quartz and feldspar grains have been buried,” Walcott-George says. But even seconds of sunshine can reset this signal, so every time a piece of rock is unearthed from below the ice sheet, they return to the blacked-out tent. There is another source of stored memory in a subglacial stone, and it originates inside the hearts of dying stars. Those rays blast their way to Earth, creating a cascade of elementary particles that buffet the planet's surface. “When they interact with rocks, they create these nuclear reactions that create isotopes or nuclides that we don't otherwise find on Earth,” Balter-Kennedy explains. “We know the rate at which those nuclides are produced. If we can measure them, we can figure out how long that rock has been exposed to these cosmic rays—or, in our field, how long that rock has been ice-free.” It's called surface exposure dating, and it works by revealing the total amount of rare isotopes in the rock sample. Over time, periods of sun exposure and burial create on/off spikes in the total amount of nuclides in the rock, with exposed being “on” and covered being “off.” Allie Balter-Kennedy, now at Tufts University, and Walcott-George, soon to be at the University of Kentucky, measure and package a core sample in a blacked-out fishing tent. If researchers take two of these nuclides—say, beryllium-10 and aluminum-26—and measure their relative levels along many feet of a rock core, they get what's called the decay clock. This clock runs down as each isotope decays at a different, predictable rate. And how many times have you been ice-free in the recent geological past?” Schaefer says. The core they had pulled up wasn't quite right. “Where's that smooth bed?” Walcott-George asked, referring to the solid bedrock pay dirt they were looking for. “I feel like it's gravelly ice, and then ...” Balter-Kennedy trailed off. “Dirty ice,” Walcott-George said, completing the thought. Sequentially dumped into Olympic-size natatoriums, it would provide a personal 660,000-gallon lap pool for every person living in Africa and Europe—all 2.2 billion of them. But how, exactly, future melt will bring more green to Greenland is one of the biggest questions that science has yet to answer. “We don't know what the mechanisms are and how long it takes for the ice sheet to get to its teeny-tiny state.” But the fate of Greenland is believed to be tied to that of its ice streams, which are more like small tongues that ring the island and are confined by deeply carved fjords. Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, a Danish ice-core climatologist, first came to the Greenland ice sheet in 1981. Back then, “no one was talking about global warming,” she says. In her four decades of working on this ice sheet, Dahl-Jensen has seen changes happen in real time. One day in 2012 she was on the ice—and it rained. “I saw it as a very pure sign of global warming that we actually got rain on the center of the Greenland ice sheet,” she says. More recently Dahl-Jensen led research for the East Greenland Ice-Core Project, which in 2023 managed to pull a 1.5-mile-long ice core (and some subglacial mud and stone) from close to where the NEGIS begins. Dahl-Jensen knows that ice streams are a big factor in sea-level rise, but she's also aware that we don't yet know how they behave. “We are not capable of modeling them properly into our ice-sheet models,” she explains. Measurements from each of these projects will feed into the mathematical models, which attempt to simulate how the real world works. “We have so many gaps in our physical understanding of how an ice sheet actually responds,” Schaefer says, noting that current models have big error margins. Ice-sheet models work much like the climate models we use all the time—the ones that predict tomorrow's weather. They use mathematics to simulate the interactions among real atmospheric phenomena: wind, pressure, moisture, thermodynamics, and lots more. They are reasonably trustworthy over hours to days because they are loaded with real data: historical data; measurements from weather satellites and balloons; and observations from land, sea and commercial aircraft. The models need data-based gut checks to make sure their predictions are informed and constrained by as much reality as we can feed into them. Schaefer believes reducing the error will make ice-sheet models better tools for adapting to climate change. “If you are a politician and you want to make New York City—or any city that is close to the ocean—sea-level safe, you need precise predictions of what is going to happen,” he says. And those predictions will become increasingly vital as the world moves deeper and deeper into its climate-warmed future—a future that those who study Greenland fear will be societally altering. “Think about the mass migration that will happen if we melt all of the Greenland ice sheet,” Bierman says. “That's not tomorrow—that's centuries from now and even millennia from now—but when that happens, that will be the biggest movement of humans ever because they'll lose their farms, they'll lose their cities, they'll lose their homes,” he says. A blizzard blew through camp hours later, shutting down drilling for the next two days. With good-enough weather, the twin-engine ski plane would be landing at the site, and it wasn't going to wait for anything. Barbara Olg Hild, the polar bear guard, stands in the GreenDrill camp during a blizzard that lasted for two straight days. During the team's weeks in the field, two such storms would stop work for two to three days in a row. Over the next two days they made good progress. Rather than setting up the drill tent all over again, they decided to chance a mostly unprotected drill hole. There Walcott-George, Balter-Kennedy and Arnar Pall Gíslason, the team's survival guide, used backpack-size rock drills to take a core from the surface of a nunatak. Just as it started to look like they might have this victory-lap sampling in the bag, a second blizzard blasted through the site. He emerged from the drill tent into a whiteout. It was time for the team to grope its way back to camp with only a line of red flags to guide it through the nearly zero-visibility conditions. As one drill spun into high gear through smoke and sputter, he looked like an ice-field Dr. Frankenstein, gleefully and maniacally gazing on his reincarnation. Balter-Kennedy breaks a bedrock core into pieces for packaging and shipment. This latitude sees no darkness in May and June, but without a break in the gale-force winds, the conditions outside are both bright and blinding. Wind-sculpted snowdrifts grow through the field camp like giant, icy fingers. They block the doors of sleeping tents and make walking treacherous; you either trip on a three-foot-tall snow wall that wasn't there hours before or fall off one into three feet of powder. There was a cruel monotony to the continuous winds. Walcott-George sat in the mess tent brewing carafe after carafe of strong coffee and engaging in Arctic self-care, using superglue to seal his dry, cracked fingers against drilling fluid. Moravec and Harmon played cribbage for hours. Everyone skulked outside into the whiteout on rotation to fill an orange five-gallon cooler with snow to be melted on a camp stove for water (it is ironic how much effort it takes to make drinkable water when we are surrounded by ice). “We live in our camp and do our research, and the time where you can only focus on one thing is really wonderful,” she said. That feeling—of slowing down, of concentration—is something many on the team told me they miss when they're off the ice. “I always dread the end of a field season,” Balter-Kennedy said. The first core took a week to get, and that was without any weather delays. The drill had burned through almost 70 feet of ice. “You were a good hole,” Harmon said as Moravec poured booze down to the bedrock. Walcott-George hoisted the final rock core like a prize striped bass. Jeffrey DelViscio is currently chief multimedia editor/executive producer at Scientific American.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We might miss our shot at observing the first stars to ever exist. Mega-constellations of satellites are connecting more and more of the world to the internet, beaming it down to Earth on an unprecedented scale. Unfortunately, in that process, they seem to be putting other scientific efforts at risk. SpaceX has managed to prevent some interference by switching off beams that transmit internet when their satellites pass over telescopes, but that hasn't cancelled out the entire problem. Astronomer Steven Tingay of Curtin University's International Center for Radio Astronomy Research in Australia is concerned. He and colleagues Dylan Grigg and Marcin Sokolowski investigated the types of emissions that were leaking from Starlink satellites, how much of these emissions were being released, and in what ways the mega-constellation could have a negative impact on Earth-based radio observations. He previously used the SKA-Low prototype station to analyze satellite constellation impacts on radio astronomy. “Although these protections exist, a succession of research has shown that an increasing number of satellites are being detected transmitting unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR) outside their designated downlink frequencies, and sometimes at these protected frequencies.” Some of SKA-Low's bandwidth—3.7 percent, to be exact—is protected by the International Telecommunications Union's Radiocommunication. Starlink launches were already problematic when Tingay and his team conducted the study, with 477 satellites being sent to space during the four months they were collecting data. Tingay's team conducted the largest survey of Starlink satellites at SKA-Low frequencies. This was when most of the electrically neutral hydrogen in the universe was charged by rising levels of radiation from the most ancient massive stars, known as Population III or Pop III stars (no Pop III stars have been detected yet). If left unchecked, radio emissions from Starlink satellites could get in the way of monumental discoveries. “SpaceX has made significant progress liaising with astronomers in the optical domain, and we hope to keep this dialogue open in the radio domain.” Her work has appeared in Popular Mechanics, Ars Technica, SYFY WIRE, Space.com, Live Science, Den of Geek, Forbidden Futures and Collective Tales.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI is shedding new light on the 12,000-year conversation between cats and their humans, suggesting that house cats wield a far richer vocabulary than once thought Anyone living with a cat knows their sounds: broken chirrups like greetings, low growls that warn, purrs stitched into sleepy conversation. The house cat's verbal repertoire is far greater than that of its largely silent wild cousins. Felis catus is a chatty species that, over thousands of years of domestication, has pivoted its voice toward the peculiar primate that opens the fridge. Now imagine pointing your phone at that predawn howl and reading: “Refill bowl, please.” Last December Baidu—a Chinese multinational company that specializes in Internet services and artificial intelligence—filed a patent application for what it describes as a method for transforming animal vocalizations into human language. (A Baidu spokesperson told Reuters last month that the system is “still in the research phase.”) The proposed system would gather animal signals and process them: it would store kitten or puppy talk for “I'm hungry” as code, then pair it not only with motion-sensing data such as tail swishes but also with vital signs such as heart rate and core temperature. All of these data would get whisked through an AI system and blended before emerging as plain-language phrases in English, Mandarin or any other tongue. The dream of decoding cat speech is much older than deep learning. By the early 20th century meows had been recorded on wax cylinders, and in the 1970s John Bradshaw, a British anthrozoologist, began more than four decades of mapping how domestic cats tell us—and each other—what they mean. By the 1990s he and his then doctoral student Charlotte Cameron-Beaumont had established that the distinct domestic “meow,” largely absent between adults in feral colonies, is a bespoke tool for managing humans. Yet for all that anecdotal richness, the formal literature remained thin: there were hundreds of papers on bird song and dozens on dolphin whistles but only a scattering on feline phonology until machine learning revived the field in the past decade.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. One of the first hints that computers might crack the cat code came in 2018, when AI scientist Yagya Raj Pandeya and his colleagues released CatSound, a library of roughly 3,000 clips covering 10 types of cat calls labeled by the scientists—from hiss and growl to purr and mother call. Each clip went through software trained on musical recordings to describe a sound's “shape”—how its pitch rose or fell and how long it lasted—and a second program cataloged them accordingly. The study showed that the 10 vocal signals had acoustic fingerprints a machine can spot—giving researchers a proof of concept for automated cat-sound classification and eventual translation. In 2019 researchers at the University of Milan in Italy published a study focused on the one sound aimed squarely at Homo sapiens. After they trained a computer program to spot those shapes, the researchers tested the system much as Pandeya and colleagues had tested theirs: it was presented with meows not seen during training—all hand labeled based on circumstances such as hunger or isolation. The research was then scaled to smartphones, turning kitchen-table curiosity into consumer AI. Developers at software engineering company Akvelon, including a former Alexa engineer, teamed up with one of the study's researchers to create the MeowTalk app, which they claim can translate meows in real time. But the app also logs incorrect translation taps from skeptical owners, which serves as a reminder that the cat might be calling for something entirely different in reality. Probability scores can simply reflect pattern similarity—not necessarily the animal's exact intent. Under the hood, these machine-learning systems treat cat audio tracks like photographs. Just as AI systems can pick out a cat's whiskers in a photograph, they can classify sound images that subtly distinguish specific kinds of meows. Last year researchers at Duzce University in Türkiye upgraded the camera: they fed spectrograms into a vision transformer, a model that chops them into tiles and assigns weights to each one to show which parts of the sound give the meow its meaning. And in May 2025 entrepreneur Vlad Reznikov uploaded a preprint to the social network ResearchGate on what he calls Feline Glossary Classification 2.3, a system that explodes cat vocabulary categorizations to 40 distinct call types across five behavioral groups. He used one machine-learning system to find the shapes inside each sound and another to study how those shapes change over the length of a single vocalization. Howls stretch, purrs pulse and many other distinct vocalizations link together in varying ways. According to Reznikov's preprint, the model had a greater than 95 percent accuracy in real-time recognition of cat sounds. Whether combining these data will make the animal's message clearer or add confusion remains to be seen. Machine learning is increasingly being used to understand other aspects of animal behavior as well. “Generally speaking, machine learning helps expedite the research process, making it very efficient and accurate, provided the models are properly guided,” she says. She believes the emergence of apps for pet owners shows how much people are thinking about innovative ways to better care for their pets. “It's positive to see both the research community and everyday pet owners embracing this technology,” she says. “Mice courtship is really interesting,” Coffey says—particularly “the full songs that they sing that humans can't hear but that are really complex songs.” Mice and rats normally communicate in an ultrasonic range, and machine learning decodes these inaudible chirps and whistles and links them to circumstances in which they occur in the lab. Coffey points out, however, that “the animal communication space is defined by the concepts that are important to [the animals]—the things that matter in their lives.... A rat or a mouse or cat is mostly interested in communicating that they want social interaction or play or food or sex, that they're scared or hurt.” For this reason, he's skeptical of grandiose claims made by AI companies “that we can overlap the conceptual semantic space of the animal languages and then directly translate—which is, I think, kind of total nonsense. But the idea that you can record and categorize animal vocalizations, relate them to behavior, and learn more about their lives and how complex they are—that's absolutely happening.” And though he thinks an app could realistically help people recognize when their cat is hungry or wants to be petted, he doubts it's necessary. Pet owners already communicate with their animal at that level.” A 2020 study found that dogs and horses playing together rapidly mimicked each other's relaxed open-mouth facial expressions and self-handicapped, putting themselves into disadvantageous or vulnerable situations to maintain well-balanced play. Florkiewicz believes this might be partly a result of domestication: humans selected which animals to raise based on communicative characteristics that facilitated shared lives. The mutual story of humans and cats is thought to have begun 12,000 years ago—when wildcats hunted rodents in the first grain stores of Neolithic farming villages in the Fertile Crescent—so there has been time for us to adapt to each other. Later the Egyptians revered them; traders, sailors and eventually Vikings carried them around the world on ships; and now scientists have adapted humans' most sophisticated technology to try to comprehend their inner lives. But perhaps cats have been coaching us all along, and maybe they'll judge our software with the same cool indifference they reserve for new toys.

Communications Earth & Environment volume 6, Article number: 453 (2025) Cite this article Metrics details Over recent decades the Amazon region has been exposed to large-scale land-use changes and global warming. How these changes affect Amazonia's hydrological cycle remains unclear as meteorological data are scarce. We use tree ring oxygen isotope records to confirm that the Amazon hydrological cycle has intensified since 1980. Diverging isotopic trends from terra firme and floodplain trees from distinct sites (approximately 1000 km apart) in Western Amazon indicate rainfall amounts increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season at large-scale. Using the Rayleigh distillation model, we estimate that wet season rainfall increased by 15–22%, and dry season rainfall decreased by 8–13%. These diverging trends provide evidence, independent from existing climate records, that the seasonality of the hydrological cycle in the Amazon is increasing. Continuation of the observed trends will have a pervasive impact on Amazon forests and floodplain ecosystems, and strongly affect the livelihoods of the regional riverine communities. There is growing concern about the future of the Amazon forests with several recent reports1,2 suggesting the system could be close to a ‘critical transition', interpreted as irreversible large-scale forest loss due to the interactive impacts of deforestation, heat and drought on local climate. Given Amazonia's importance for global biodiversity3, terrestrial carbon stocks4 and livelihoods5 it is important to evaluate these concerns. Large-scale deforestation could cause reductions in precipitation6 and land surface temperature increases7 which are further affected by fossil fuel burning induced climate change8 and by reductions in precipitation recycling due to vegetation responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations9,10. Early estimates by General Circulation Models (GCMs) studying the combined effects of deforestation and climate indicated a severe drying of the Amazon, resulting in widespread dieback of the Amazon forests11. While more recent modelling predictions suggest such an extreme scenario may be unlikely, there is still considerable variation in rainfall projections for the Amazon varying from drying to wetting, and critical transitions could result12. Rainfall changes are thought to be a central component for potentially causing an irreversible transition of Amazonia's forests2,6,11. Obtaining more reliable data on changes in rainfall over recent time is thus a pre-requisite to understand in what direction the system is heading, and to determine which global climate model predictions are consistent with observations and thus more likely to be realistic. Observational evidence indicates that the hydrological cycle of the Amazon has been changing in the past few decades with trends varying between regions and seasons. Some studies suggest that the south of the Amazon is getting dryer13,14,15,16, while others show wetting in large parts of the basin15,17,18, with increased frequency of severe droughts and floods19,20. A reliable quantification of these changes is needed to understand contributions of anthropogenic drivers (i.e. deforestation and climate change) versus natural climate variability and to assess risks for the future21. However, these efforts are hampered by a lack of meteorological data. Rain gauge stations are sparsely distributed across the basin (only one station per 150,000 km2), their operation is often discontinuous, and methodologies are changing over time22,23. Remote sensing and data assimilation are becoming increasingly more accurate and reliable, but time series are relatively short and there is still disagreement between these products18,23,24. River level data may offer a more reliable, long-term record, but the varying seasonality of river levels of the many tributaries of the Amazon River may mask the timing and strength of the changes, especially for the dry season25. Thus, more information to evaluate the response of the Amazon basin to climate change is needed. New information to aid our understanding of past variability of the hydrological cycle can be obtained from natural climate proxies. Different archives can be used for this purpose including ice cores26, lake sediments27, speleothems28, and tree rings29. In forested regions, tree rings can provide climate proxies with annual resolution, but finding suitable tropical species that form reliable annual rings can be difficult. In addition, growth of tropical trees in moist and warm climates is generally not very sensitive to inter-annual climate variation29. An approach that partly overcomes these challenges is the analysis of stable oxygen isotopes in the cellulose of tree rings. This approach results in excellent signal strength, thus allowing more reliable reconstructions with fewer samples compared to standard ring-width chronologies30,31. Oxygen isotopes in tree rings (δ18OTR) to a large degree reflect the δ18O of source water (mostly rainfall)32,33, which for the Amazon basin is controlled by the depletion of heavier isotopes in water vapor due to rainout of heavier water molecules (H218O) during moisture transport over land (i.e. Rayleigh distillation of water in the atmosphere)34,35,36. Due to this mechanism, δ18OTR from western locations in the Amazon have been found to closely reflect the amount of rainfall over large regions of the Amazon basin and provide data representative of climate variability at large scale30,31,37,38. Annual ring formation in tropical trees is generally triggered by the annual cessation of cambial growth during a distinct dry season, restricting growth to the wet season39. An exception to this is trees from Amazon floodplains, where annually recurring multi-month floods create anoxic soil conditions, that impede cambial activity and restrict the growth of floodplain trees to the terrestrial (i.e. non-flooded) phase40. For many regions in the Amazon, the terrestrial phase of floodplain forests coincides with the local and Amazon-wide dry season (Supplementary Fig. As a result, growth of floodplain and terra firme trees (i.e. non-flooded) are out of sync, occurring during the dry and wet seasons respectively (Fig. These differences should allow for a seasonal reconstruction of the regional hydrological cycle at large-scale. Here, we pioneer this approach to reconstruct changes in rainfall seasonality from 1980 to 2010 by comparing tree ring oxygen isotope series (δ18OTR) from a floodplain species (Macrolobium acaciifolium) and terra firme species (Cedrela odorata) from the western and south-western Amazon, with a climatic footprint that largely coincides with the Amazon-wide region and climate (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. a Map of the Amazon basin97,101,102 showing the location of the floodplain site (red) and the terra firme site (blue). Black area corresponds to (seasonal) wetlands, rivers and seasonal floodplains. Color shading indicate the upwind regions of moisture transport from each site, derived from the HYSPLIT back trajectories (see Supplementary Fig 3 and Methods section). b Schematic diagram showing the seasonal phenological differences between terra firme and floodplain environments. c Seasonal variation of the local river level at the floodplain site, rainfall for the Amazon Basin, and local rainfall at the terra firme site. d Images of the annual growth rings of Macrolobium acaciifolium and Cedrela odorata tree species used in this study, with red arrows indicating ring boundaries. In (c), Arrows indicate the growing seasons of the trees, and vertical lines indicate the seasonal boundaries defined by rainfall and river levels. Vertical dotted lines extends the boundaries of the Amazon-wide seasons (bottom panel) for a visual comparison of how they overlap with the local growing seasons at each of the sites. Note that for calculations using rainfall data, we disregarded the shoulder months of those seasons, i.e. the months immediately next to the black vertical lines (details in Methods). The interannual variation of δ18OTR of both species is negatively related to the interannual variation in Amazon-wide precipitation during their respective growing seasons (Fig. Peak rainfall correlations for the floodplain δ18OTR chronology occurred from August to November, within the growing season for M. acaciifolium which extends from July to November (Fig. 2a-c), while the terra firme δ18OTR chronology correlations peak from January to May, almost entirely within the growth season for C. odorata which extends from November to April (Fig. Correlations that extend outside the trees'growing seasons are generally weaker, which could be due to interannual variation in the growing season length of the trees. a-d Correlations with the δ18OTR records of the floodplain trees. e-h Correlations with the δ18OTR records of the terra firme trees. Bars indicate the Pearson's r between δ18OTR and 3-monthly means of rainfall or river levels. Filled bars indicate significant correlations with 95% confidence interval. Shaded areas show seasonal variation in precipitation in the Amazon region (a,b,c,e,f,g) or Amazon river levels at Obidos (d,h). Dotted lines and arrows indicate the growing season of the floodplain and terra firme trees. The x-axis spans the full hydrological year, and therefore extends across two calendar years. Months January to May in the three-month periods on the right-hand side of the x-axis correspond to the year after the onset of the ring formation. Climate correlations for the record of M. acaciifolium are for a shorter seasonal window. This could reflect the short, non-flooded period during which this species mainly grows40, or be due to differences in methodology as we only used the middle portion of the rings for this species to avoid interference of river water δ18O and capture climate signals of the peak growing season41. Correlations for the C. odorata record cover a longer period coinciding with the longer growing season of this species30. The correlations for this record lag the onset of the species' growing season by one month probably due to a lag between leaf flush, the start of cambial activity and xylogenesis42. The two δ18OTR records also show close correlations with Amazon River level records measured at Obidos (Fig. The periods of significant correlations correspond very well with the months of low river levels for M. acaciifolium, and with the months of high river levels for C. odorata. Because of lag times between Amazon precipitation and river level43, these correlations are ca. 3-5 months later than the rainfall-δ18OTR correlations. All correlations with climate were very similar when we averaged rainfall over the Amazon region or over the estimated regions of moisture transport (Supplementary Figs. This large scale climatic footprint of the δ18OTR records is further evidenced by spatial correlation analyses of δ18OTR with gridded precipitation datasets (Supplementary Fig. The two δ18OTR chronologies show diverging long-term patterns, with a positive trend (p < 0.05) in the M. acaciifolium record and a negative trend (p < 0.1) in the C. odorata since the mid 1970s. The divergence between the two records since mid 1970s is greater than at any other time in the period covered (Supplementary Fig. The trend in the M. acaciifolium record starts a few years earlier than the trend in the C. odorata record. To estimate the magnitude of changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, or moisture influx required to explain the trends in the δ18OTR records, we used a Rayleigh distillation model (Eq. 3, see Methods for details). For these estimates we calculate changes for the period of 1980-2010, when there was an increase of 1.14‰ in the dry season record for M. acaciifolium and a decrease of 0.90‰ in the wet season record of C. odorata (Fig. a Diagram of the isotopic distillation of inland transport of atmospheric moisture over South America103,104. b Graphic representation of the changes in the δ18O of atmospheric moisture based on a Rayleigh distillation model (shown on top of the graph, rearranged from Eq. [1]), with green and blue lines indicating the expected effects of increasing evapotranspiration (E) and precipitation (P), respectively. c δ18OTR chronologies, with blue lines showing the wet season record obtained from C. odorata trees from terra firme forests, and red line showing the dry season record obtained from M. acaciifolium trees from floodplain forests. Straight lines indicate significant trends at 90% confidence interval. d, e Inferred changes in rainfall since 1980, calculated from a Rayleigh distillation framework based on the Δδ18OTR trends (see methods). Lighter vertical stippled lines indicate an evapotranspiration change scenario corresponding to 0% and ±5% over the entire analysed period, and shading indicates possible variations arising from uncertainties in estimates of evapotranspiration, moisture flux and vapor δ18O (see also Table 1). Note that in (c), the δ18O axis is inverted. In the simplest version of this model, we assumed that there were no changes in moisture influx into the basin, or evapotranspiration along air parcel paths, and thus attributed all observed changes in δ18OTR to changes in precipitation along the water vapour path. This results in an estimated increase in wet season precipitation of 5% per decade (i.e. ΔP/ΔPi, 15.5% since 1980 C.E.) 3e, Supplementary Fig 8b, Table 1) and an estimated decrease in dry season precipitation of 4.4% per decade (−13.5% from 1980–2010 C.E.) 3d and Supplementary Fig 8a, Table 1). These estimates however are sensitive to various assumptions. Firstly, this model version assumes no trend in the coastal (i.e., initial) air column water vapour content (Ni). However, observed sea surface temperatures have increased by approximately 0.5oC since 1980 C.E. over the tropical North Atlantic, which would result in an 4% increase in air water holding capacity according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for saturated vapour pressure (i.e., 7% for each oC44). Assuming the change in mass of water in atmospheric inflow is linearly proportional to the ratio of saturated vapor pressures in 2010 and in 1980, accounting for this increase in water vapour in the Rayleigh model (i.e., changing Nf - Ni, or ΔN, see Eqs. 2, 3) results in larger estimates for increases in wet season precipitation (i.e. 5.9% instead of 5% per decade) and weaker drying trends for the dry season (i.e., −3.6% instead of −4.4% per decade, Case 1 in Table 1). Independent records from ERA5 indicate that wet season (Nov-March) water vapour inflow increased by 8%, but show no support for dry season changes in vapour inflow (Supplementary Fig. Using the changes from ERA5 would result in a larger difference between wet and dry season trends. We further assumed there are no changes in the total evapotranspiration of the forest. In our estimates, we considered that evapotranspiration recycles 40% of total dry season rainfall and 32.5% of total wet season rainfall45. Deforestation or CO2-induced stomatal closure may result in decreases in evapotranspiration6,46, while warming induced vapour pressure deficit may increase evaporative demand47. These opposing effects may offset each other48, which could explain why no changes in evapotranspiration are evident within a variety of dataset types and sources for the Amazon49. While the extent of shifts in evapotranspiration at large-scale in the Amazon remains uncertain47, recent evidence suggests that Amazon evapotranspiration may have decreased by approximately 6% in the past 30 years50. The contribution of total evapotranspiration to rainfall can influence the degree of Rayleigh distillation effect during moisture transport (Fig. 3b) and thereby add uncertainty to our estimates (Eqs. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess variations in our estimates under different scenarios of changes in evapotranspiration during the analysed period. This sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates of precipitation changes are not very sensitive to the effects of changes in evapotranspiration on the Rayleigh distillation: the Rayleigh model shows that a 1-1.5% change in evapotranspiration per decade has only a minor (±0.5 to 0.8% per decade) effect on our estimates of precipitation changes for the two seasons (Fig. 3, Table 1, case 5). Our analysis further shows that these estimates are insensitive to assumed condensation temperature of water vapour in the clouds (Table 1, case 6). Additional smaller uncertainties in our estimates arise from possible changes in the contribution of leaf water enrichment to δ18OTR, evaporative enrichment of soil water, in the isotopic composition of water vapor entering the basin, in rainfall type or intensity, and from uncertainties related to the magnitude of the continental difference of δ18Ocoast to δ18Osite, and the assumed recycling ratio of evapotranspiration over precipitation, \({r}_{E:P}\). See Table 1 for all quantified uncertainties arising from these factors, and supplementary materials for a full discussion of how these factors may affect our estimates. Our results show that floodplain and terra firme trees record the climate for different seasons at large-scale (Fig. When analysed together these records provide more detailed, seasonally resolved climate reconstructions for the Amazon compared to using one single species. To the degree that δ18OTR accurately reflects rainfall δ18O, these trends are due to long-term changes in the rainout of heavy water (H218O) along the air parcel trajectory from the tropical north Atlantic to the site of precipitation34,35. Previous analysis for C. odorata from the terra firme site has shown that the total cumulated precipitation over the air parcel path over land is a very strong predictor of inter-annual variation in δ18OTR31 giving confidence that the signal is governed by Rayleigh distillation during moisture transport over land. Analysis of atmospheric back trajectories of moisture transport for the two study sites show that they have similar paths that cover a large portion (60-70%) of the Amazon basin, with a climatic footprint that is highly representative of Amazon-wide rainfall (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. This large-scale spatial footprint is further confirmed by spatial correlation analyses of these records with gridded precipitation datasets (Supplementary Fig. The diverging long-term trends in δ18OTR are therefore interpreted to reflect diverging seasonal trends in precipitation for the same central region of the Amazon basin. Taking identified uncertainties into account (see Table 1, Fig. 3, Supplementary Discussion), we estimate wet season rainfall to have increased by between 5 to 7.1% per decade (15.5-22% since 1980) and dry season rainfall to have decreased by 1.9 to 4.4% per decade (5.8-13.5% since 1980, Fig. This provides evidence for increases in precipitation seasonality using a record that is independent from current climate records, and that integrates variability in rainfall over a large area within the Amazon basin. Our analysis is based on a mechanistic understanding of the association between climate and δ18OTR and overcomes some of the limitations of spatial and temporal scarcity of meteorological data in the Amazon22. To what degree are tree ring estimates of Amazon precipitation changes consistent with observations? To evaluate this question, we compared our δ18OTR to rainfall and river stage records for the two seasons (Fig. Interannual variation and long-term trends in δ18OTR are well correlated with variation in precipitation and with river level (see Fig. 4, please note the inverted scale for oxygen isotopes). Our estimates from tree ring oxygen isotopes suggest rainfall reductions in the dry season (−1.9 to −4.4% per decade) are largely within the range of those derived from the different gridded precipitation datasets used here (CRU: −0.3%, CHIRPS: −6.3%, MSWEP: −1.6% per decade), but imply stronger rainfall increases during the wet season ( + 5 to +7.1% per decade) than estimated from all three datasets (CRU: +1.6%, CHIRPS: +1.6% and MSWEP: +0.3%, per decade). This discrepancy in the estimates of rainfall changes may possibly be caused by differences between the footprint of the tree ring isotope series (i.e. the region of moisture transport from coast to sampling sites, Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) and the spatial distribution of the stations that these climate records relied on. The difference in the estimates from different gridded datasets also highlight the uncertainties arising from their use to assess long-term climate trends in the Amazon region. Despite this difference, our estimates of rainfall changes largely agree with the few published estimates of precipitation changes in Amazonia, which consider different datasets. Few studies report similar magnitudes to what we found here, with a reduction of up to 4.4% per decade in the dry season and an increase of up to 10% per decade in the wet season depending on region17,19,51, and one recent study (based on observations and reanalyses) reports an increase of 6% per decade in rainfall seasonality, given by the difference between maximum and minimum rainfall amounts per year, since 197952. Diverging seasonal trends have also been detected regionally, with up to ~5% (per decade) dry season drying in the south and similar wet season wetting in the north portion of the basin53,54. Interestingly, these results seem to go in the same direction of ours, even though the spatial footprint of our records does not capture all of the southern Amazon during the dry season. Here we cannot make any inference regarding spatial heterogeneity of the trends, but it is possible that to some extent our integrated measure of the regional hydrological cycle reflects spatially heterogeneous climate changes in the region.

The significance of trends was tested by means of linear regression, with p values shown at each graph. The Pearson's correlation coefficient of the hydrological variable with oxygen isotopes from tree rings is also shown on (d, e, rδ18O). Note that in (c), the δ18O axis is inverted. In all, our tree ring trends provide strong support for a substantial increase in the seasonality of Amazon rainfall, with the wet season becoming wetter and the dry season drier. We find no support for previous GCM predictions for a general drying of the Amazon basin11,55,56,57, or for a general wetting58. Instead, our results point to an increased seasonal cycle, as observed before in both precipitation and river level records13,17,19,52,53,59. These latter authors have analysed possible drivers for these trends, and find changes are related to differences between the tropical north Atlantic and Pacific SST anomalies, in part associated with natural variability, but a more rapid warming in the Atlantic is likely to continue due to anthropogenic forcing59. These large-scale changes have led to an increase in the upwelling of the Walker cell branch over Amazonia59,60. Existing tree ring records from the Amazon provide some support for the increase in wet season precipitation suggested by our records. An extended δ18OTR record (1980 to 2020) from Cedrela odorata located in the nearby Brazilian southwest Amazon61 shows a similar upward trend in precipitation up to 2020, despite the strong 2015 El Niño (i.e. dry anomaly). Tree ring-widths from south-west Amazon-Andes also capture this wetting trend locally62, and one study from eastern Amazon points out that climate signals in the tree rings became weaker after 1990's63, which can be an indication that growth limitation by rainfall is decreasing, even in the absence of trends. Other ring-width studies from different parts of the Amazon don't seem to capture this change64,65,66,67. The reasons why tree ring-width do not capture these changes may vary. Firstly, trees growing in humid conditions during the wet season may not be limited by the precipitation ammounts, and thus don't benefit from the increase in rainfall. Secondly, tree ring studies often focus on the high-frequency variability, and may not reproduce multidecadal trends. In addition, detecting trends in ring-width series requires consideration of several ontogeny and other biases due to demography or field sampling strategies, which are often not considered39,68,69. In comparison to tree ring widths, δ18OTR records are superior proxies for hydroclimate as the signal in these two sites arises predominantly from variation in precipitation δ18O and is thus relatively independent of plant physiological effects30,41 and do not require detrending to correct for ontogenetic effects. Though the climate changes inferred from the δ18OTR chronologies may seem large, the severity of recent climate extremes is consistent with expected consequences of climate change21, and trends have persisted over time. Our records only extended to 2010 and 2014, but extreme floods of the Amazon River have continued to happen with high frequency. The four highest flood-season river levels (2021, 2012, 2009 and 2022) and three lowest dry-season river levels (2024, 2023, 2010) all occurred during the last 15 years70. Of those, the most extreme levels for the entire 122-year record at the port of Manaus were recorded in the past 3 years, indicating that the intensification of the hydrological cycle is persistent, with increased rainfall seasonality leading to more frequent droughts and floods19,20. As a result, the maximum flood area of the Amazon River has extended by 26% since 198071, while intensified dry seasons have facilitated the spread of wildfires72,73. These changes cause extensive social, economic and health impacts74, including damages to agriculture5, hydropower generation75, and respiratory health76. For the forests, floods, droughts and fires may lead to widespread tree mortality, both in floodplains and non-flooded areas77,78, and impact on forest biodiversity79, structure80, and resilience1. Our support for the existence of diverging long-term changes in rainfall amounts during the wet and dry seasons has important implications for proxy-based studies in this region. Commonly used proxy records such as ice-cores rarely contain seasonal climate information26, while cave speleothems28 usually integrate signals over periods of three or more years. Such records will conceal diverging seasonal patterns as detected here, and thus fail to provide an accurate picture of the full climate response. Tree rings do provide information about seasonal climate variability, but in the tropics such information is often restricted to the wet season39. The approach we used here overcomes such limitations, and exploits differences in growing seasons between species to permit seasonally explicit climate reconstructions. This approach is limited only by the maximum age of tropical trees, which may reach up to few hundred years in these ecosystems81. To conclude, we find diverging time trends in these two δ18OTR records since ca. 1980, with increasing δ18OTR in the species growing during the dry season and decreasing δ18OTR for the species growing during the wet season. These diverging trends are indicative of approximately 5 to 7.1% per decade (15.5–22% since 1980) increase in wet season rainfall and by 1.9 to 4.4% per decade (6–13.5% since 1980) decrease in dry season rainfall at large-scale in the Amazon. Our analysis highlights that traditional climate proxies may hide seasonally diverging trends as observed here. We find no support for a general drying or general wetting of the Amazon basin and instead find an increase in the seasonal cycle. Our conclusions are largely independent from any climate data, relying only on the well-known relationship between rainfall and the δ18O signals in rainfall as recorded by tree rings. The results provide a benchmark for testing the realism of climate predictions for this region and confirm a trend in seasonality that is larger than assumed so far. These changes have severe and widespread implications for human livelihoods and ecosystems in the Amazon. To reconstruct seasonally resolved δ18O from the Amazon basin, we used tree ring records from Cedrela odorata from terra firme forests in the Southwestern Amazon31,82 (10°5′S, 66°18′W), and from Macrolobium acaciifolium from floodplain forests in the Western Amazon37 (74°05′ W, 4°29′ S, Fig. C. odorata grows during the local wet season, defined as the period of the year with rainfall exceeding 100 mm month-1 (which is October to April at this site)31, and the δ18OTR chronology (i.e. the average of δ18O records obtained from trees belonging to the same local population of trees) of this species thus reflects past variability of wet season rainfall in the Amazon. The inter-annual and decadal scale variation is in close agreement with similar chronologies obtained from trees of the same species growing at other locations in the western Amazon basin82. Macrolobium acaciifolium is a typical floodplain species, that grows only during the non-flooded (terrestrial) period40, which is between July and November for this site. As this period coincides with the Amazon-wide dry season, the chronology reflects rainfall variability for the dry season. Though the two sites are distant from each other, the large-scale atmospheric processes associated with Rayleigh distillation during moisture transport result in wide spatial coherence of tree ring δ18O even at distant locations38. This can be illustrated by the large overlap of the regions of moisture transport to each of our sampling sites (Supplementary Figs. Both chronologies consist of oxygen isotope ratios in the cellulose extracted chemically from the tree rings using the procedure described in ref. For C. odorata, 890 rings from 9 trees were separated prior to cellulose extraction, while for the M. acaciifolium trees we first extracted cellulose from cross-section laths and then separated 384 rings from 6 trees84. As these species grow in tropical warm climates which favour rapid drying of the soils and constant recharging with new rainfall85,86, long soil water residence times are generally not expected87,88, and we consider that trees use mostly recent rainfall as their main source water. Still, for M. acaciifolium trees only the middle section (of three segments) for each ring was used to avoid using wood produced at the start and end of the growing season, when river water (which has longer residence times) are close to trees' rooting zones. After extraction, tree ring cellulose samples were homogenized, freeze dried, packed into silver capsules and pyrolyzed with an Element Analyzer coupled to a Sercon 20/20 IRMS for analysis of their stable oxygen isotope ratios, with a precision of 0.2‰. All isotope ratios are expressed relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), in permille (‰) units. The mean δ18OTR chronologies for each species were produced by taking the mean δ18OTR of all trees for each calendar year. The average of Pearson's correlation coefficients of all pairwise combinations of trees in each chronology was 0.58 for M. acaciifolium and 0.63 for C. odorata. We use the following Rayleigh distillation model89 to relate changes in the oxygen isotope values to changes in precipitation, moisture content in air entering the basin and evapotranspiration in Amazonia. Here, \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}\) and \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) (‰) are relative deviations of isotope ratios from a standard ratio at the site and coast respectively, P and E (dimensions of mass per area) are the cumulated rainfall and evapotranspiration along an air parcel trajectory from the coast to the site, respectively, N (mass per area) is the total amount of water of the air column when air enters the basin, and Nsite is the water mass left in the air column at the end of the trajectory, α = 1.010744 the water-vapor equilibrium fractionation factor for a condensation temperature of 10 °C90 corresponding approximately to 700hPa altitude91, and f is the fraction of water vapour in the air column at the site relative to water vapor in air entering the basin, or ‘remaining fraction'. Our Rayleigh model assumes that (a) there have been no changes in the type of precipitation (i.e. convective vs stratiform) and intensity of precipitation, and (b) that temperature does not affect δ18O strongly at these locations, and (c) that the isotopic ratio of vapor entering the basin does not change over time. 1, the long-term change over time in δ18O as a result of long-term changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration and changes in water content of air entering the basin is then given by Here the subscript ‘i' stands for initial and the subscript ‘f' for final in time (in our case 1980 and 2010). Equation 2 can be rewritten as a function of relative changes \(\Delta P\equiv \frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}-{P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{{P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}\), \(\Delta E\equiv \frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}-{E}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{{E}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}},\,\Delta N\equiv \frac{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}-{N}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}\) using the identities \({P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}=\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{\left(1+\Delta P/{P}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}\right)}\) for P and similar for E and N to obtain Equation 3 permits, in principle, to determine which combinations of relative changes in precipitation and evaporation are compatible with the observed difference of the heavy isotope ratio in precipitation between 2010 and 1980 inferred from our tree ring records. Nonetheless, to use Eq. 3 for this purpose we need (i) an estimate of present \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) and (ii) estimates of the ratios \(\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}},\,\frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}\) and their uncertainties. We estimate the former using the observations at Belém from Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), for which rainfall δ18O data is available for the years of 2014 and 2015. From these years, we used the months from August to October for the peak dry season and from November to March for the peak wet season. These periods disregard the shoulder months from the growing season of the trees, to avoid an effect of year-to-year variability in the growing season length on our results. To estimate the latter we express them as functions of remaining water vapor fraction, f, in an air parcel arriving at the site at the end of the period considered (here 2010) and a recycling ratio \({r}_{E:P}\equiv \frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}\), the ratio of cumulated evaporation to cumulated precipitation along the air parcel path from the coast to the site. The ratios \(\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}},\,\frac{{E}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}\) expressed as functions of f and \({r}_{E:P}\) are \(\frac{{P}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}{{N}_{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}=\frac{1-f}{1-{r}_{E:P}},\,\frac{{E}_{f}}{{N}_{f}}=\frac{f-1}{1-\frac{1}{{r}_{E:P}}}\). f we estimate from observed \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}-{\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) at the end of the period considered, inverting Eq. For our best estimate we used \({r}_{E:P}=0.325\) for the wet season and \({r}_{E:P}=0.4\) for the dry season45. To estimate \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}-{\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) we used measurements made at the GNIP stations Iquitos (Peru) for \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}\) and Belém (Brazil) for \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\), and data for Riberalta (Bolivia), from a monitoring led by the authors of this study (Brienen and Gloor). For details see Supplementary Table 1 in supplemental information. In order to obtain plausible ranges of relative changes of Pf and Ef we vary estimates of using two different estimates of \({\delta }_{{{{\rm{site}}}}}-{\delta }_{{{{\rm{coast}}}}}\) (one based on observations from GNIP, and one based on a isotope enabled version of the Hadley Climate model HadAM392, and by varying α over a plausible condensation temperature range. Separately we also vary \({r}_{E:{P}}\) by ±10%. As we know that tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature increased by 0.5 °C (80−15 W, 8−22 N, HadSST data from ref. 93) we also examined the sensitivity of our best estimate of the attribution of the observed isotopic time trends to these changes. We did this by varying the water vapor content and the isotopic ratio of incoming air (see Supplementary Discussion for details). We related the δ18OTR chronologies to large-scale precipitation obtained from three different gridded datasets, Climate Research Unit (CRU TS 4.07)94, from CHIRPS95 and from MSWEP96. We used CRU as it is based on station data. CHIRPS and MSWEP are more recent products that combine both station and satellite data and might provide better spatial representation. Large-scale rainfall was obtained by averaging rainfall over the Amazon Basin region during the trees' respective growing seasons (Fig. To assess the regions of influence of trends in both chronologies, we calculated for both sites the daily air mass trajectories using HYSPLIT98,99 (Supplementary Fig. 3ab) and then calculated the latitudinal range covered by >95% of all trajectories for every 0.25 degrees longitude, using a smoothing spline to remove noise. This provided the northern and southern limits of the regions of moisture transport to each sampling site (Fig. We then averaged rainfall within this region (upwind region rainfall). The rainfall series obtained by doing so is highly correlated with the rainfall time series obtained for the Amazon Basin region (Supplementary Fig 2). We also correlated the δ18OTR with Amazon River level recorded at Obidos, approximately 600 km from the Amazon delta. River levels at this location corresponds to nearly 80% of the water drained within the Basin100, thus providing a second measure of large-scale hydrology within the Basin. The presence of trends in the δ18O chronologies and climate data over the past 30 years was assessed using linear regression analyses and t-tests.

But certain cells in older people appear to do the exact opposite — they consume more energy than when they were young. These potential energy hogs are senescent cells, older cells that have stopped dividing and no longer perform the essential functions that they used to. Because they seem idle, biologists had assumed that zombie-like senescent cells use less energy than their younger, actively replicating counterparts, says Martin Picard, a psychobiologist at Columbia University in New York City. How to kill the ‘zombie' cells that make you age How to kill the ‘zombie' cells that make you age But in 2022, Gabriel Sturm, a former graduate student of Picard's, painstakingly observed the life course of human skin cells cultured in a dish1 and, in findings that have not yet been published in full, found that cells that had stopped dividing had a metabolic rate about double that of younger cells. For Picard and his colleagues, the energetic mismatch wasn't a paradox at all: ageing cells accumulate energetically costly forms of damage, such as alterations in DNA, and they initiate pro-inflammatory signalling. How that corresponds with the relatively low energy expenditure for ageing organisms is still unclear, but the researchers hypothesize that this tension might be an important driver of many of the negative effects of growing old, and that the brain might be playing a key part as mediator2. As some cells get older and require more energy, the brain reacts by stripping resources from other biological processes, which ultimately results in outward signs of ageing, such as greying hair or a reduction in muscle mass (see ‘Energy management and ageing'). Picard and his colleagues call this concept the ‘brain–body energy-conservation model'. This work, some researchers say, is also beginning to illuminate how psychological stress can accelerate ageing at a molecular level. Although once at the fringes of ageing research, this idea is now becoming mainstream, says Alessandro Bartolomucci, a biologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. In the early 2000s, Elissa Epel, who was then a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), set out with her colleagues to examine whether chronic stress could leave behind a cellular signature. At the time, there was already a “very impressive literature” linking long-term stress to poor health, says Epel, who is now a health psychologist at UCSF. “But we didn't know as much about what was happening at the cellular level.” So, the researchers decided to look at telomere length. Telomeres progressively shorten over the lifespan of an organism, and this process has been linked to senescence and other forms of age-related changes in cells. What molecular ‘clocks' can tell you about your health What molecular ‘clocks' can tell you about your health Epel's team found that the women with a chronically ill child had shorter telomeres than those who did not — and that telomere length correlated with the number of years spent as a carer. These findings suggested that exposure to chronic stress can introduce molecular changes that are important for ageing, says biologist Noah Synder-Mackler at Arizona State University in Tempe. Since then, teams have also found evidence of telomere shortening in people exposed to other stressors, such as adverse experiences in childhood and work-related exhaustion4. Although some of the results have been mixed when it comes to telomere length, researchers have also amassed evidence linking stress to other molecular markers of ageing. These changes might be mediated by stress hormones such as cortisol. Zannas's team found that, in women, higher levels of cortisol were linked to lower levels of DNA methylation, as well as an increase in the expression of the gene coding for tumour necrosis factor (TNF), a signalling molecule associated with inflammation5. Others have been studying these processes in animals. Although animal models of stress have their limitations — for one, humans stressors are much more complex and can include a variety of social, psychological and biological factors — this work has provided mechanistic insights that are difficult to obtain in human studies. Bartolomucci and his team have discovered that chronic social stress in rodents, such as being subjected to aggressive behaviour from a dominant animal, can damage heart health and lead to a shorter lifespan6. They've also found that exposure to this type of adversity is linked to an increase in age-related molecular changes, such as a build-up of signals associated with senescence. These changes occurred only in response to social stress: animals exposed to stress in the form of physical restraint, which involved placing them in small tubes for three hours per day for a month, did not experience a build-up of p16. Hacking the immune system could slow ageing — here's how Hacking the immune system could slow ageing — here's how Synder-Mackler's team have been conducting similar studies in rhesus macaques. So, by sequentially introducing animals into groups, the researchers were able to examine the effects of social status on health. They found that social stress affects the immune system in multiple ways. In the immune cells of monkeys with lower social status, it led to an increase in the expression of inflammation-associated genes8. These effects were at least partially reversible: when the animals' social rankings were rearranged, the gene expression patterns in their immune cells also changed to match their standings. The team has yet to look at how these alterations affect lifespan — macaques can live for around 30 years, which makes it difficult to address this issue, Synder-Mackler says.

(2025)Cite this article Geometry and topology endow mechanical frames with unusual properties from shape morphing to phonon wave manipulation, enabling emerging technologies. Despite important advances in macroscopic frames, the realization and phonon imaging of nanoscale mechanical metamaterials has remained challenging. Here we extend the principle of topologically engineered mechanical frames to self-assembled nanoparticle lattices, resolving phonon dynamics using liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. The vibrations of nanoparticles in Maxwell lattices are used to measure properties that have been difficult to obtain, such as phonon band structures, nanoscale spring constants and nonlinear lattice deformation paths. Studies of five different lattices reveal that these properties are modulated by nanoscale colloidal interactions. Our discrete mechanical model and simulations capture these interactions and the critical role of effects beyond nearest neighbours, bridging mechanical metamaterials with nanoparticle self-assembly. Our study provides opportunities for understanding and manufacturing self-assembled nanostructures for phonon manipulation, offering solution processability, transformability and emergent functions at underexplored scales of length, frequency and energy density.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have developed a low-cost, durable, highly-sensitive robotic 'skin' that can be added to robotic hands like a glove, enabling robots to detect information about their surroundings in a way that's similar to humans. The researchers, from the University of Cambridge and University College London (UCL), developed the flexible, conductive skin, which is easy to fabricate and can be melted down and formed into a wide range of complex shapes. The technology senses and processes a range of physical inputs, allowing robots to interact with the physical world in a more meaningful way. Unlike other solutions for robotic touch, which typically work via sensors embedded in small areas and require different sensors to detect different types of touch, the entirety of the electronic skin developed by the Cambridge and UCL researchers is a sensor, bringing it closer to our own sensor system: our skin. Although the robotic skin is not as sensitive as human skin, it can detect signals from over 860,000 tiny pathways in the material, enabling it to recognise different types of touch and pressure - like the tap of a finger, a hot or cold surface, damage caused by cutting or stabbing, or multiple points being touched at once - in a single material. In addition to potential future applications for humanoid robots or human prosthetics where a sense of touch is vital, the researchers say the robotic skin could be useful in industries as varied as the automotive sector or disaster relief. In most cases, different types of sensors are needed for different types of touch - one type of sensor to detect pressure, another for temperature, and so on - which are then embedded into soft, flexible materials. "Having different sensors for different types of touch leads to materials that are complex to make," said lead author Dr David Hardman from Cambridge's Department of Engineering. "At the same time, we need something that's cheap and durable, so that it's suitable for widespread use," said co-author Dr Thomas George Thuruthel from UCL. The researchers melted down a soft, stretchy and electrically conductive gelatine-based hydrogel, and cast it into the shape of a human hand. They tested a range of different electrode configurations to determine which gave them the most useful information about different types of touch. "We're able to squeeze a lot of information from these materials - they can take thousands of measurements very quickly," said Hardman, who is a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of co-author Professor Fumiya Iida. "They're measuring lots of different things at once, over a large surface area." "Our method is flexible and easier to build than traditional sensors, and we're able to calibrate it using human touch for a range of tasks." Fumiya Iida is a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Note: Content may be edited for style and length. Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"They're some of the most amazing extraterrestrial samples we have," said Ryan Ogliore, an associate professor of physics in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, home to a large repository of lunar samples that were returned to Earth. Using a variety of microscopic analysis techniques not available when the Apollo astronauts first returned samples from the moon, Ogliore and a team of researchers have been able to take a close look at the microscopic mineral deposits on the outside of lunar beads. The investigation was led by Thomas Williams, Stephen Parman and Alberto Saal from Brown University. The study relied, in part, on the NanoSIMS 50, an instrument at WashU that uses a high-energy ion beam to break apart small samples of material for analysis. WashU researchers have used the device for decades to study interplanetary dust particles, presolar grains in meteorites, and other small bits of debris from our solar system. The study combined a variety of techniques -- atom probe tomography, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy -- at other institutions to get a closer look at the surface of the beads. "Many of these instruments would have been unimaginable when the beads were first collected." As Ogliore explained, each glass bead tells its own story of the moon's past. Because of their origins, the beads have a color, shape and chemical composition unlike anything found on Earth. To avoid this possibility, the researchers extracted beads from deep within samples and kept them protected from air exposure through every step of the analysis. "Even with the advanced techniques we used, these were very difficult measurements to make," Ogliore said. "It's like reading the journal of an ancient lunar volcanologist," Ogliore said.
