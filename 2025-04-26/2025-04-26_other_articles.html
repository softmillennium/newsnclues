                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Look, I don't believe the NFL is blackballing Shedeur Sanders. But it would take a damn fool to dismiss the possibility that something is in play either with the teams or the player that extends beyond sheer athletic talent and is causing a problem. Up until the start of the third round on Friday, I was fully on board with the idea that Shedeur Sanders hadn't been selected in either the first or second round because the league's personnel people simply didn't think he was good enough. I based it on all those sacks Sanders took the last two years, and those pro day hiccups, and his good-not-great arm. I was fully invested in the idea that the evaluation process was simply doing its thing. I didn't blink when Cam Ward went first overall to the Titans because he's the real deal. I agreed with the Giants picking Jaxson Dart because his ceiling is much higher than Sanders'. Look, I even understood the Tyler Shough selection by the New Orleans Saints because you put his athletic abilities and arm and speed and size next to Sanders, it's clear the Saints picked the more gifted prospect. BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA - NOVEMBER 09: Jalen Milroe #4 of the Alabama Crimson Tide celebrates the win after a game against the LSU Tigers at Tiger Stadium on November 09, 2024 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. But then the third round came and all sorts of weird started happening. And this is where I stipulate that Milroe ran a 4.37 at his pro day and Sanders didn't run at his because it would have been somewhere in the 4.8 range. But Milroe is less accurate and slower at reading defenses than Sanders. And Milroe, the latest Alabama quarterback surrounded by a depth chart full of future NFL players, did less with more talent at Alabama than Sanders did at Colorado and Jackson State. The Cleveland Browns, at one point connected to Sanders with their No. 2 overall pick, selected for the fifth time in this draft. Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel throws out a pass during the Oregon football's Pro Day Tuesday, March 18, 2025, at the Moshofsky Center in Eugene, Ore. And after not taking Sanders in the first round, and not taking him with either of their picks in the second round, and not selecting him with their initial pick of the third round, they turned in the card for Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel with the No. Gabriel is not a better prospect than Sanders. He doesn't have an appreciably stronger arm. An ESPN draft analyst selected a comparable player in his profile of Gabriel before this draft. But is he a better quarterback prospect than Sanders because he processes quicker and reads defenses better and can throw from different arm angles? DENVER, COLORADO - JANUARY 05: Head coach Sean Payton of the Denver Broncos celebrates after beating the Kansas City Chiefs 38-0 at Empower Field At Mile High on January 05, 2025 in Denver, Colorado. "This thing is surprising," Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton said Friday night. "… I think we all are surprised … The talent, holy cow." And furthermore, Payton is certain when Sanders does play, he's going to make some NFL people look bad. "Like, there'll be this chip on his shoulder," Payton said. I think it's hard for any of us to explain what other people are looking for. Cleveland Browns general manager Andrew Berry responds to questions during Watson's introductory press conference at the Cleveland Browns Training Facility on March 25, 2022. So let's ask one of the people who was looking at quarterbacks and picked Dillon Gabriel, why every NFL team seems to be running away from Sanders. "You know what, I think it's unfair for me to comment, I guess, maybe on behalf of the industry," Browns general manager Andrew Berry said. "All I can say is this: You know, the time that we spent with Shedeur, and what he's done throughout his college career is impressive. "Sometimes, fit comes into play, and I'd also say this, there are four more rounds of the draft. That's really the most important thing. "Getting to know him over the course of the spring, he has a ton of resolve and I think he's going to find himself in a really good spot." That doesn't answer the question. It merely suggests the Browns think Sanders will be productive, but are comfortable with that production happening elsewhere. Former Colorado Buffaloes QB Shedeur Sanders was expected to be the first or second quarterback taken in the 2025 NFL Draft. So there has to be something about Sanders that so far is putting NFL people off. There's something beyond quarterback play because, again, Gabriel and Milroe are not necessarily better players. So, is it the whole entitlement thing that some anonymous scouts have mentioned? We have to consider that because Sanders can come off as kind of arrogant. Sanders told reporters at the scouting combine. Without people hating, it's not normal for us. We like everything that comes with the name. But others could see him as lacking introspection or the willingness to self-examine. Perhaps that, more than physical traits and the tape, is why teams are so far not picking Sanders. He has covered the NFL since 1990 and is a selector for the Pro Football Hall of Fame and a voter for the Associated Press All-Pro Team and Awards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Panic and fear have gripped residents of Musukwani area in Jakara, Kano Municipal Local Government Area, following the mysterious disappearance of two young boys believed to have gone missing inside a large, deep ditch in the neighborhood. Eyewitnesses say the latest case happened on Monday, April 21, 2025, when one of the boys reportedly removed his clothes and wallet — which contained money — and handed them over to some people nearby before entering the ditch. “We were sitting here when the boy came, took off his clothes, including his wallet with money, and asked us to keep them for him. Even after nightfall, we closed our shops and went home. The next morning, there was still no sign of him. His belongings are still with us,” Abdul Basit Yusha'u Safiyanu told DAILY POST. Just a few days earlier, another boy named Dan Sani also entered the same ditch with a friend and was never seen again. Musa Hamza, a community leader and maternal uncle of (Dan Sani) one of the missing boys, expressed deep concern and frustration. “In response to a call from one Hamisu Wakili, our team rushed to the site in Jakara, but unfortunately, we could not find the missing individuals, and had to call off the operation,” he confirmed in a phone interview with DAILY POST. Some, like Sadam Saraki, linked the area to paranormal activity, claiming it has long been known as a hub for spiritual and mysterious happenings. Now, the people of Jakara are calling on the Kano State Government and emergency agencies to urgently investigate and take action before more lives are lost. We can't sleep with both eyes closed anymore,” one resident said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every new character needed to be introduced, and a number of them were more memorable than others. While Sam and Dean Winchester have pretty awesome first introductions in the pilot episode, plenty of other characters create lasting impressions with notable debuts. In season seven's "The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons Tattoo," Sam and Dean get an alert from Frank—an eccentric, paranoid hunter, who was looking into Dick Roman. The message warned them that someone was hacking into his files. Audiences first meet Felicia Day's Charlie as she rides up on her yellow scooter, puts her headphones on, and goes to work. She cheerfully swipes her badge and steps onto the elevator. Realizing she is alone, Charlie dances like no one's watching. Then she shows pictures of her latest hookup to her co-worker, saying, "If you can't score at a reproductive rights function, then you simply cannot score." Bobby sends another hunter named Garth to help Dean with his investigation. Dean sits down and asks Garth if Bobby filled him in on the case. Garth, being a straight shooter, says, "He told me two things. One, he's tangling with a major-league nest up in Oregon territory. Numero dos, he said you'd be all, uh, surly and premenstrual working with me. When Dean shows Garth the newspaper article about their case, Garth immediately flips to the funny pages, laughing and saying, "Oh, Marmaduke, you crazy." In "Jus In Bello," Sam, Dean, and a few others fight off a horde of demons working for Lilith. They manage to exercise them, but one gets away and reports what happened. In its 15-season run, Supernatural introduced some very bizarre concepts and storylines some of which didn't work for the fans. After Sam and Dean leave, a young girl enters the police station. The secretary, Nancy, asks for her name, to which she responds, "Lilith." Before anyone can react, her eyes turn gray, she holds up her hand, and a bright light fills the room, killing everyone inside. Using a child as her "meat suit" was a hint at her twisted brand of cruelty that audiences would see later in "No Rest for the Wicked." Arthur Ketch was an enforcer and torturer for the British Men of Letters. When they let the psychic girl go, he kills her casually and without hesitation. When Sam and Dean get stopped by the Secret Service, who are working for Lucifer, a black sedan casually pulls up to the scene, and out steps Ketch with a grenade launcher in hand. After a couple of quips, he introduces himself with a wry smile, demonstrating his callous, playful attitude towards extreme violence. Everyone's favorite crossroads demon first appears in season five. After Lucifer has risen, Sam and Dean seek out Samuel Colt's gun in hopes it can kill the devil. Before the heist, viewers see Castiel spying on Crowley as he wraps up a crossroads deal. The banker was put off by the idea of kissing a man, and Crowley had no patience for it, saying, "You can cling to six decades of deep-seated homophobia, or give it up and get a complete bailout for your bank's ridiculous incompetence." The scene shows off Crowley's charisma, intelligence, and love of making people feel uncomfortable in less than ninety seconds. Dean and Crowley seek him out when searching for the First Blade, the only weapon that could kill Abaddon. From the moment Crowley spots Cain tending to his bees, he is on edge. Crowley's fear and discomfort tell Dean just how dangerous Cain is. When demons show up, audiences get to see Cain's power. After transferring the mark to Dean, Cain sends them off to safety and single-handedly takes out the entire army of demons. A drop of blood falls on her arm, and the camera pans up to reveal two men, dead, pinned to the ceiling. Four episodes later, audiences meet the incredibly powerful witch when she kills a demon by tossing him a hex bag. Dean Winchester is one of Supernatural's most beloved characters, and there are more than a few reasons that prove why. Rowena adopts the two women she saved and tells them about magic, revealing that she's a new kind of witch. She doesn't serve demons like other viewers have seen on Supernatural. Rowena possessed latent, natural magical power that she'd cultivated over hundreds of years. Inside the darkness, Dean sees a woman, her head slowly turning to face him. Throughout the episode, viewers catch glimpses of her until the end when she tells Dean they're connected and will always help each other. Jensen Ackles and Emily Swallow bring the intensity of emotion. Its importance is felt in every second and movement, making for an unforgettable first impression, which is fitting for the introduction of God's sister and the primordial Darkness. When Dean is mysteriously pulled out of Hell, he is determined to find who or what brought him back. Throughout the episode, the truth about Castiel is gradually revealed, from causing Dean's ears to bleed to burning out Pamela's eyes. There are some other great fantasy shows, old and new, that fans can watch to scratch the Supernatural itch. Castiel tells Dean he is an Angel of the Lord. When Dean doesn't believe him, Castiel summons lightning, revealing his wings as large shadows that stretch out from his back. Death becomes an even more intriguing character when he meets with Dean. Dean finds Death enjoying some deep-dish pizza in Chicago. He invites the hunter to join him and reveals that he's bound by Lucifer to do the devil's bidding, and Death's not happy about it. Dean's fear and reverence for the unstoppable force help create an unsettling first impression of Death. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. There are many characters in Supernatural who have done amazing things, but Jack Kline is the only one with a title that fans don't even know. ABC has always been a mainstay in television with great shows that once changed everything, with three amazing shows in particular. CBS is moving over an actor from its sitcom Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage to its Fire Country spinoff to play Morena Baccarin's ex-husband. The underrated fantasy series is perfect for Harry Potter, Twilight, and Outlander fans. After last week's stunning ending, The Last of Us is set to return next week for season 2, episode 2, and it will be a devastating follow-up. Dexter is TV's favorite killer and despite a flawed series, there are some episodes that remain flawless from start to finish.</p>
