This March saw the highest monthly civilian casualty count in Yemen in nearly two years, with 162 dead.

This March saw the highest monthly civilian casualty count in Yemen in nearly two years, with 162 dead.

A trio of Democratic senators on Thursday demanded answers from embattled Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth regarding U.S. airstrikes in Yemen, which have reportedly killed scores of civilians including numerous women and children since last month.

“We write to you concerning reports that U.S. strikes against the Houthis at the Ras Isa fuel terminal in Yemen last week killed dozens of civilians, potentially more than 70,” Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) wrote in a letter to Hegseth.

The lawmakers noted that “the United Nations Protection Cluster's Civilian Impact Monitoring Project has… assessed that March 2025 marked the highest monthly casualty count in Yemen in almost two years, tripling the previous month, with a total of 162 civilian casualties.”

“If these reports of civilian casualties are accurate, they should come as no surprise,” the senators said. “Using explosive weapons in populated areas—as these intense strikes appear to do—always carries a high risk of civilian harm.”

Getting rid of safeguards designed to limit civilian harm from U.S. military operations & ensure compliance with international humanitarian law undermines our credibility,  jeopardizes our missions & raises the risk of natl security threats. https://t.co/vd9WpjVCnn

“Further, reports suggest that the Trump administration plans to dismantle civilian harm mitigation policies and procedures at the Pentagon designed to reduce civilian casualties in U.S. operations,” the letter notes. “And the Trump administration has already dismissed senior, nonpartisan judge advocates, or JAG officers, who provide critical legal counsel to U.S. warfighters, especially when it comes to the laws of war and adherence to U.S. civilian harm mitigation policies.”

“The Defense Department also recently loosened the rules of engagement to allow [U.S. Central Command] and other combatant commands to conduct strikes without requiring White House sign-off, removing necessary checks and balances on crucial life-and-death decisions,” the senators added. “Taken altogether, these moves suggest that the Trump administration is abandoning the measures necessary to meet its obligations to reducing civilian harm.”

"So far the Trump administration appears to be 'choosing targets [in Yemen] that pose a more direct risk to civilians and may indicate a higher tolerance to the risk of civilian harm,' Airwars said."https://t.co/7hbHd1Mqjq pic.twitter.com/gM4wuKCA9R

The senators asked Hegseth to answer the following questions:

Last month, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon's Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Office and Civilian Protection Center of Excellence, which was established during the Biden administration, would be closed. Hegseth — who has supported pardons for convicted U.S. war criminals — lamented during his Senate confirmation hearing that “restrictive rules of engagement” have “made it more difficult to defeat our enemies,” who “should get bullets, not attorneys,” according to his 2024 book The War on Warriors.

Asked during his confirmation hearing whether troops under his leadership would adhere to the Geneva Conventions, Hegseth replied, “What we are not going to do is put international conventions above Americans.”

During his first administration, President Donald Trump relaxed rules of military engagement meant to protect civilians as he followed through on his campaign pledge to “bomb the shit” out of Islamic State militants and “take out their families.” Thousands of civilians were killed during the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria as then-Defense Secretary James “Mad Dog” Mattis announced a shift from a policy of attrition to one of “annihilation.”

Meanwhile, noncombatant casualties soared by over 300% in Afghanistan between the final year of the Obama administration and 2019.

Overall, upward of 400,000 civilians in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen have died as a direct result of the U.S.-led War on Terror, according to the Costs of War Project at Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs.

In Yemen, the U.K.-based monitor Airwars says U.S. forces have killed hundreds of civilians in 181 declared actions since 2002. Overall, hundreds of thousands of Yemenis have died during the civil war that began in 2014, with international experts attributing more than 150,000 Yemeni deaths to U.S.-backed, Saudi-led bombing and blockade.

The U.S. bombing of Yemen has not received nearly as much coverage in the corporate media as the scandal involving Hegseth's use of Signal chats to share plans for attacking the Middle Eastern country with colleagues, a journalist, and relatives. However, critics say the mounting backlash over the high civilian casualties there is belying Trump's claim of an anti-war presidency.

“President Trump has called himself a ‘peacemaker,' but that claim rings hollow when U.S. military operations kill scores of civilians,” the senators stressed in their letter. “The reported high civilian casualty numbers from U.S. strikes in Yemen demonstrate a serious disregard for civilian life, and call into question this administration's ability to conduct military operations in accordance with U.S. best practices for civilian harm mitigation and international law.”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Donald Trump departed Rome shortly after the Pope's funeral to treat the first lady Melania to a romantic dinner on Air Force One for her 55th birthday.

The US president said he had been too busy to buy his wife a present and would instead treat her to a meal onboard the presidential plane when they return from Rome on Saturday.

The two were pictured together in St Peter's Square attending the funeral with world leaders. Mr Trump was wearing a blue suit and his wife all black with a lace veil.

Mr Trump left his wife as he attended to high-stakes Ukraine diplomacy, meeting with European allies and Volodymyr Zelensky in an extraordinary day of peace talks.

He was seen boarding his plane one hour after the Pope was buried. European leaders, meanwhile, were engaged in further peace talks in Rome.

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Mr Trump admitted that a trip to Rome for a major funeral may not be everyone's idea of the perfect way to celebrate a birthday.

“She's got a working birthday,” he told the press on the presidential jet as the couple headed off for the first foreign trip since his return to power.

The president added that as he prepares to mark the 100th day of a frenetic opening to his second term, seeking deals on tariffs, Ukraine, Iran and Gaza, there hadn't been time to shop for his wife.

“I haven't had time to buy presents, it's been pretty busy,” he said.

When asked if he would be taking Melania to dinner to mark her birthday, he replied: “I'm taking her for dinner on the Boeing; I'm taking her for dinner on Air Force One.”

Mr Trump then joked that he would send his wife back into the “lions' den” to talk to reporters herself.

The Trumps have led largely separate lives since he took office, with Melania spending most of her time in New York, where their son Barron, 19, is attending university.

But they have made a few joint appearances, including on Monday when they hosted the traditional Easter Egg Roll at the White House.

Last year the couple spent her birthday apart, with Melania in Florida while Mr Trump was in New York for a trial over payments of hush money to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.

Mr Trump said at the time: “It'd be nice to be with her, but I'm at a courthouse for a rigged trial.”

The right-wing movement wants the Supreme Court's help to alienate students from LGBTQ-inclusive books.

The right-wing movement wants the Supreme Court's help to alienate students from LGBTQ-inclusive books.

A prince vanquishes a dragon and falls in love. A young girl named Violet works up the courage to give her classmate crush a valentine. Another girl fears she won't get to see her Uncle Bobby as much after he gets married, but after spending a day with him and his fiancé, she realizes she's just gaining a new member of her family.

All of these stories are found in children's picture books, and none are particularly unusual. They touch on universal topics like bravery, friendship and family. But since the books feature LGBTQ protagonists — the prince falls in love with his knight, Violet's classmate is a girl, Uncle Bobby is gay — they're now at the center of Mahmoud v. Taylor, a Supreme Court case brought by parents who say that the books' inclusion in public schools violates their parental rights and religious freedom. If, as seems likely, the Court's conservative supermajority rules in favor of the parents, the case would notch a major win for the so-called “parental rights” movement — a pernicious right-wing crusade to undermine public education, church-state separation and children's autonomy under the guise of fighting for individual civil liberties.

Though accounts differ on its exact origins, the parental rights movement can be traced back at least to 1925, when a biology teacher came under fire for teaching evolution in violation of Tennessee law. Other experts point to when parents used their own rights as a pretext to fight against the prohibition of child labor in the 1920s. (This same argument is cropping up again in 2025 as Florida Republicans push to weaken child labor laws.) And as the Red Scare swept the U.S. and public schools began racial integration in the 1950s, the parental rights argument flared again, with conservative parents monitoring schools for “communist infiltration” or pulling their children out of the desegregated public system.

What you will notice is that none of these instances has to do with actual civil rights — they're all about enacting a particular right-wing vision for the country. The present-day parental rights movement builds upon this legacy. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced learning online in 2020, a new wave of parents began rallying under the banner of parental rights, fighting against school closures and vaccine mandates. Moms for Liberty, formed in 2021, is one of the leading instigators, muscling its far right members onto school boards and ballots.

While these groups decry government intervention on the level of public health, they simultaneously advocate for increased state control over education — banning books, cracking down on inclusive teachers and lesson plans, and pushing to undo diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Because, of course, Moms for Liberty and its allies are not fighting for the rights of parents who wish to support their children's access to gender-affirming care. Nor are they supporting parents who help their children obtain abortions. And the parental rights movement makes no mention of the rights of parents whose children are forcibly taken away from them by the state, in a family policing system that disproportionately targets low-income families and Black mothers.

Instead, the parental rights movement is focused on expanding conservative parents' control in the public sphere and suppressing the representation of any ideologies or identities with which they personally disagree. A prime example of the movement's impact is Florida's 2022 “Don't Say Gay” law, which was officially titled the Parental Rights in Education Act. The law restricted teachers from referencing sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools, but its parameters were so sweeping and vague they were partially rolled back through a 2024 settlement.

As a Vox headline noted last week, Mahmoud v. Taylor now “threatens to bring ‘Don't Say Gay' to every classroom in America.” The case stems from a lawsuit filed in 2023 against the Montgomery County Public Schools district in Maryland. The Board of Education made LGBTQ books available in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms in 2022, citing the diversity of the county's student body and the goal of promoting “equity, respect, and civility.”

Whether teachers actually incorporated the books in their lessons was left up to them; in fact, the district said in a court brief that the books were not used to teach about gender or sexuality. Rather, the texts were made available for students' own reading, classroom read-alouds and other educational activities. While Montgomery County initially offered an opt-out option for parents who wanted to exempt their children from exposure to LGBTQ books, the district removed the policy in March 2023, citing “high student absenteeism, the infeasibility of administering opt-outs across classrooms and schools, and the risk of exposing students who believe the storybooks represent them and their families to social stigma and isolation.” A group of six Christian and Muslim parents then sued to block the rule before it took effect.

The Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision by early July, but the conservative justices appeared sympathetic to the plaintiffs during oral arguments on Tuesday. Montgomery County is the most religiously diverse county in the U.S., and the parents behind the lawsuit come from several different faith backgrounds. Why, conservative justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh asked, could the school district not just reinstate its opt-out policy?

But that framing downplays what's actually at stake in Mahmoud v. Taylor. While the right may choose to amplify the issue as one of religious diversity, the allegations of indoctrination simply don't hold water. As Nelson Tebbe, a law professor at Cornell Law School, told TIME, “The long standing settlement is that religious parents don't have a right to opt out of elements of the public school curriculum that they disagree with.” If that were the case, parents could opt their children out of learning about evolution, which courts typically haven't supported. The books at issue aren't even being used to teach specific lessons; they're just representing the fact that LGBTQ students exist in the school district — which they do. “Mere exposure to ideas is not itself considered a burden on religion under these precedents,” said Tebbe. As such, sex education is currently the only area of instruction that students can be entirely exempted from in Montgomery schools.

Of course, if parents do not want their children exposed to scientific facts and fundamental realities, they do have another option: private school. There is no shortage of religious institutions to choose from. But imposing the will of a few parents on the education of thousands of schoolchildren is antithetical to the goal of public education, which, by definition, exists to serve the public — not cater to the demands of a select few.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

            Five people have been killed and more than 700 injured in a huge explosion at the port of Bandar Abbas in southwestern Iran, according to official Iranian media.
    


            The explosion sent a huge plume of thick, gray smoke from the Shahid Rajaee part of the port complex, according to videos geolocated by CNN, with the government saying the blast was likely linked to chemicals being stored.
    


            The head of the Iranian emergency services said four people had died in the blast. A spokesperson for the emergency services earlier said 516 had been injured.
    


            A video distributed by the Mehr news agency showed surveillance footage of the moment of the explosion, which appears to have occurred in a warehouse at the port. Other footage showed helicopters dropping water at the site of the fire ignited by the explosion.
    


            Debris was spread over a wide area and many buildings at the port complex were badly damaged, according to state media. Windows within a radius of several kilometers were shattered, they said.
    


            Some reports said people were trapped in the wreckage of a building that was reduced to rubble.
    


            The region's governor, Mohammad Ashouri Taziani, said injured people were being transferred to Bandar Abbas medical centers and the fire had been contained. The port has been closed and maritime operations suspended, according to state media.
    


            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered an investigation into the causes of the incident. He wrote on X that the interior minister had been sent to the region to “examine the dimensions of the accident.”
    


            State broadcaster IRIB said the explosion took place in the chemical and sulfur area of the port.
    


            A government spokeswoman, Fatemeh Mohajerani, said it would take some time to establish the cause of the explosion – “but so far what has been determined is that containers were stored in a corner of the port that likely contained chemicals which exploded. But until the fire is extinguished, it's hard to ascertain the cause.”
    


            Shahid Rajaee is a large facility for container shipments, covering 2,400 hectares (around 5,900 acres). It handles 70 million tons of cargo annually, including oil and general shipping. It has nearly 500,000 square meters (5.4 million square feet) of warehouses and 35 shipping berths.

Russian forces have fully recaptured the territory of Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region partially held by Ukraine since last August, the Kremlin claimed on April 26 in a statement later disputed by Kyiv.

"Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov reported to Supreme Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Putin on the completion of the operation to liberate Kursk Oblast," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency.

Ukraine has denied the claim, saying that Russia's statements "do not correspond to reality."

"Ukrainian defensive operations in certain areas of Kursk Oblast continue," Ukraine's General Staff said, adding that Kyiv's forces repelled five Russian ground assaults in the area on April 26, with another clash currently ongoing.

"The situation is difficult, but our units continue to hold certain positions and carry out tasks as assigned," the statement read, noting that there is no threat of encirclement. A military source also told the Kyiv Independent that Kyiv continues to hold territories in Kursk Oblast.

For the first time, Gerasimov also acknowledged the participation of North Korean troops in the campaign, praising their "fortitude and heroism." Kyiv and Seoul have previously said that North Korea has dispatched around 11,000 troops to Kursk Oblast, though Moscow has not openly confirmed this until now.

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. The operation aimed to disrupt a planned Russian offensive on the neighboring Sumy Oblast and draw Russian forces away from the embattled Donbas region.

Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha.

As of April 25, Ukrainian battlefield monitoring service DeepState showed Ukrainian forces holding onto limited positions in Kursk Oblast near the border, namely the villages of Oleshnya and Gomal.

Buffalo hotel workers are facing off with a Trump-aligned developer in their battle to unionize.

“They just look at you like you're nothing,” said a housekeeper from the Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Buffalo, New York.

Sitting with me for a conversation in her East Side apartment, the housekeeper, who requested not to be named due to fear of retaliation, spoke of slashed hours and stagnant pay, arduous and unfair workloads, and racist treatment and verbal abuse from managers so severe that it has sent her running to the bathroom in tears.

But when she spoke about the belittling gaze of her employers — the feeling that immigrant workers like herself are seen as “nothing” by the hotel's management – her words seemed to capture the deep nature of her grievances.

“They're mistreating the workers, especially the immigrants,” she told me. “They should respect the workers that are making the hotel look clean.”

These sentiments also explain why she and other Hyatt workers are taking great risk by supporting a union drive at their hotel.

“All that I'm looking for is for the union to support us,” she said, “so us working at the hotel will be respected, and they can look at us like humans.”

Over the past several months, a battle has been unfolding at the Hyatt Regency in Buffalo that pits two sides of the city against each other: its love affair with developers, who city leaders have turned to as post-industrial saviors, and its identity as a union town, filling up with non-union jobs in low-wage sectors like leisure and hospitality.

On one side of this battle is Douglas Jemal, a real estate mogul who swooped into Buffalo from Washington, D.C. a decade ago to gobble up dozens of storied commercial and residential properties across the city, including Buffalo's only skyscraper. A darling of local media and civic elites, and a big donor to city and state officials, Jemal has been awarded millions in public subsidies. He is a close friend of the Kushners, and he had a wire fraud felony conviction pardoned by Donald Trump in 2021. Jemal's imprint across Buffalo is inescapable.

On the other side are the workers at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Buffalo, a full-service convention hotel surrounded by sports stadiums and trendy restaurants. Jemal acquired the Hyatt in 2021. Last August, these workers announced a union drive to improve their working conditions and win more voice and dignity on the job, but they say they were met with a ferocious union-busting campaign that included numerous firings of pro-union workers.

Behind its “revival” narrative, Buffalo remains one of the nation's poorest cities. It's a labor stronghold, but its hotels are almost entirely non-union, even as their workers help undergird the city's so-called revitalization. While developers like Jemal enjoy big subsidies and tax payment schemes that benefit their own properties, Buffalo's city budget faces a massive $60 million deficit.

In many ways, the battle at the Hyatt is a proxy over whose interests will prevail in the new Buffalo: wealthy developers who receive lush subsidies, or workers fighting for good union jobs in industries like leisure and hospitality that prop up the city's purported renaissance.

Rumblings of a union stirred among some Hyatt workers in 2023, but the idea gained momentum during the busy summer of 2024, especially among a core of front desk workers. One of them was Luke Sills, who has worked at the hotel for nearly two years. In 2023, the Hyatt Regency Buffalo named Sills its “Employee of the Year.”

Sills is one of the rank-and-file leaders of the union drive at the Hyatt. “Every worker in the building knows how we should be doing things differently,” he told Truthout. “Having a voice to make this hotel a place that we can be proud of was a big motivator for us deciding to unionize.”

Truthout spoke with current and former Hyatt workers — front desk agents, restaurant servers, housekeepers, baristas — who described a range of grievances and a workplace marked by dysfunction and disrespect toward employees.

Workers expressed concerns around wages, understaffing, inconsistent scheduling and reduced hours. But their issues went much further.

They spoke of a rundown hotel that is not adequately maintained, leaving guests to lash out at employees. Broken ovens and espresso machines go unfixed. The carpets are old and grimy, they say. The heating and air conditioning systems run poorly.

“The rooms are just falling apart,” said Sills. “These problems with the hotel ruin the guest experience.”

Workers say the hotel is chaotic and mismanaged. Employees do work beyond their job descriptions for no extra pay to compensate for inept managers. Understaffing leaves hotel departments scrambling to get through the day.

Tiba Salvatore told Truthout that for weeks after she started working at the front desk last July, she didn't even have a manager. “Right away, I noticed the dysfunction at the Hyatt,” she said.

For many, the worst part is the disrespect and humiliation workers face, with some recounting racist slurs by managers and verbal abuse toward immigrant housekeepers who make up the hotel's largest department.

The housekeeper I spoke with in her East Side apartment described heavier workloads for non-English speakers and reductions in her hours without explanation. She says she has not seen a wage increase in years.

She also said she's often ordered to do tasks beyond her role at the Hyatt, and described one incident where she was yelled at by her supervisor after she refused.

“He was loud and aggressive toward me in front of people,” she said. “The managers are racist, and I don't have any right to express myself. All this happens to us because we're immigrants and our English is not enough.”

Left in tears after the incident, she says she can't leave the job. Like other housekeepers, she depends on the income.

“That's why, after all the humiliation, I still go.”

Multiple workers told Truthout that this kind of treatment was a key motivation for unionizing.

“There's this culture of disrespect and abuse where management treats immigrants like they're stupid,” said Sills. “I became friends with some of these people and realized how cruel it is.”

Sills was among the half-dozen workers who formed a union organizing committee affiliated with Workers United, the same union that organized the ground-breaking Starbucks union drive that originated in Buffalo.

On July 31, 2024, the organizing committee announced the union in a letter to Jemal; the hotel's general manager, Steve Jarmuz; and Craig Smith, the CEO of Aimbridge Hospitality, who operates the hotel. The letter asked Jemal and the Hyatt management to agree to Fair Election Principles safeguarding workers' rights to unionize without company interference.

“I was hoping they might listen to me as someone who clearly cares about the hotel, but who wants to have a voice to make this place better and believes that workers need to be respected,” said Sills.

The workers never received a response.

The union drive kicked into high gear. Organizing committee members knocked on doors and spoke with coworkers. Workers started wearing union buttons on the job. Signed union cards began to pile up. The union quickly gained strongholds at the front desk and lobby area and in the restaurants and the hotel's Starbucks.

Edgar O'Connell, a restaurant server, was one worker who joined up. He was upset with things like understaffing and disrespectful treatment from management. He told Truthout he hoped the union “could make a difference in the way that the hotel was run” and wanted “respect for us workers as the people who are making the hotel run.”

The union estimates they had around 70 percent support among customer-facing “front of house” workers across the hotel when they filed for a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election in early September 2024. They hoped that winning a union for “front of house” workers would provide the foundation for organizing the hotel wall-to-wall, especially the several dozen housekeepers.

However, right after workers announced the union, they say, the union busting began.

Multiple workers say the Hyatt management launched a multi-pronged offensive to smash the union drive, firing pro-union workers and creating a climate of fear around the union.

Two days after the organizing committee sent its letter, Sills was pulled into a meeting with the hotel's top management and grilled with questions about the union.

“They were trying to talk me out of it,” said Sills. “The tone was very much intimidation and veiled threats.”

Other workers told Truthout of similar meetings. They say out-of-state consultants held captive audience meetings with workers where they stoked fear and misinformation about the union. Workers say management was monitoring them with security cameras and scouring their social media accounts.

Pro-union workers started getting fired or pushed out. The hotel's Starbucks, one of the strongest pro-union departments, was a main target.

Garion Lopez, a barista who was part of the organizing committee, told Truthout that Starbucks workers were interrogated and accused of theft. The common practice of occasionally giving friends free drinks was suddenly being treated as a fireable offense. Several baristas were suspended and fired, while others left under the pressure.

“It felt like a witch hunt,” said Lopez.

Sills said that “every single person they fired had signed a union card.”

One Hyatt worker shared a company flyer with Truthout that was posted in the breakroom implying that the union was a threat to workers' legal rights and privacy.

According to labor expert John Logan, this is “a really standard anti-union flyer” whose variations have been used in anti-union campaigns for decades.

“The intention is to give the impression that unions are invading the privacy of workers, even though the reason that unions conduct home visits is that employers deny them access to the workplace and make it as difficult as possible for them to communicate with workers,” Logan told Truthout.

“Generally speaking,” Logan added, “employers are the ones who bombard workers with anti-union texts and emails with messages like this one and force them to attend anti-union meetings.”

Workers say the most chilling effect of the Hyatt's anti-union campaign was on housekeepers. Many are immigrants who face language barriers and whose families depend on their jobs at the Hyatt. They cannot easily find new work.

“They were telling them the union would cut wages” and that it's “there because it wants your money,” said one housekeeper. “They traumatized us.”

Housekeepers saw pro-union workers being fired and pushed out. “All those people were very scared to lose their jobs,” said Salvatore.

On October 9, the union held a press conference in front of the Hyatt where Sills referred to management's anti-union offensive as a “terror campaign.”

“It's been really shocking and a bit horrifying to see the ways that they responded to our campaign so far,” he told reporters.

The Hyatt's anti-union blitz took a heavy toll on the union drive. Workers estimate that, after several weeks, front-of-house support for the union fell from 70 percent to around 50 percent.

Sills says the hotel's brazen firings “showed everybody that they were willing to break the law to bust the union.” Under these circumstances, Workers United made the tough call to temporarily pull the NLRB election in early November.

Meanwhile, the union filed nearly three dozen Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges with the NLRB during October alleging a slew of illegal acts of intimidation and retaliation against workers. These charges range from “unlawfully interrogating an employee by asking them if they signed a union authorization card” to “telling employees that their pay and benefits were ‘frozen' because of the union campaign.”

One ULP charge stated that the employer engaged in “threatening employees that the hotel may have to close if the employees unionize,” an allegation that multiple workers mentioned to Truthout.

Truthout reached out to Jemal to ask about this allegation around closing the hotel but received no response. Truthout also reached out to Jemal, Hyatt Regency Buffalo General Manager Steve Jarmuz, and Aimbridge Hospitality for comment on worker grievances and anti-union allegations discussed in this article, but received no responses.

The union also requested a remedial bargaining order that would compel the Hyatt to recognize and bargain with the union, alleging that a fair and free election is no longer possible because of the company's anti-union behavior.

Not the industrial powerhouse it once was, Buffalo remains a labor stronghold. Union halls dot the city landscape. Any local political candidate covets the labor vote. Nearly a quarter of workers in the area have union jobs.

But not Buffalo's hotel workers.

“Buffalo is a union town, except for hotels,” Gary Bonadonna Jr., the regional head of Workers United, told Truthout.

At workplaces like the Hyatt, Buffalo's identity as a union town is clashing head-on with its commitment to developers like Douglas Jemal, who receives millions in public subsidies while, workers say, his managers at the hotel feverishly fight a union drive.

Bonadonna Jr. sent a letter to Jemal, shared with Truthout, demanding a fair union election at the Hyatt and the reinstatement of fired workers. He never received a response.

“We support developers who take an interest in Buffalo and want to invest in the city,” said Bonadonna Jr. “But it can't be at the expense of the workers.”

The union is hoping that pressure from the labor movement and the wider Buffalo community will convince the Hyatt, which hosts many large gatherings, to respect their workers' right to unionize.

Recently, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which has held events at the hotel, sent the Buffalo Hyatt a letter, viewed by Truthout, supporting the workers' right to unionize. Ed Braukus, international representative for IBEW 3rd District, told Truthout that the Hyatt is “pretty much off the list” for future IBEW meetings in Buffalo right now. “We're not going to patronize a place that's actively violating workers' rights to organize,” he said.

“We're not calling for a boycott now,” Bonadonna Jr. told Truthout, “but I think eventually customers can decide to support this business or not after learning what happened to the workers who tried to organize.”

Jemal and Douglas Development are not done with hotels in Buffalo. He was recently awarded $12.5 million in state subsidies to redevelop the historic downtown Statler building, which will include 200 hotel rooms.

Jemal has also negotiated a scheme that directs his tax payments toward his own properties rather than the city's general fund. All this comes as Buffalo faces a huge $60 million budget deficit.

“Jemal is using the developer toolkit of making agreements that keep his money out of the general fund and focus his tax contributions around his own developments,” Andrea Ó Súilleabháin, executive director of the Partnership for the Public Good, a community-based think tank in the Buffalo-Niagara region, told Truthout.

“That's problematic in a city like Buffalo, where we have a revenue crisis, which means many of our neighborhoods get neglected,” she added.

Ó Súilleabháin wants to see stronger criteria around union rights from state and county agencies that issue subsidies to developers. “If you're taking public money, you have to be recognizing unions across all of your projects,” she said.

She adds that tackling Buffalo's chronic poverty depends on creating good union jobs at workplaces like hotels. “The only way to counter Buffalo's long-term high poverty rate is to improve jobs in sectors like leisure and hospitality and drive their wages and benefits up,” she said.

“And of course,” she adds, “the right to unionize is central to that.”

Truthout reached out to local elected officials for comment about the allegations surrounding the Hyatt and asking if they felt subsidies to Jemal should be contingent on workers' rights to organize being respected across his properties.

None of Buffalo's Common Council members responded, nor did Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz. Over the past several years, Buffalo's city government and the Erie County Industrial Development Agency — where the Mayor of Buffalo, President of the Buffalo Common Council and Erie County Executive all have seats on the board of directors — have supported PILOT deals and subsidies for Jemal.

According to campaign finance records, Poloncarz has reported receiving $28,000 from Jemal since 2019, while Common Council Majority Leader Leah Halton-Pope received $2,500 in 2023 and Council Member Joel Feroleto received $1,000 since 2022.

Truthout additionally reached out to Buffalo Mayor Christopher Scanlon for comment but received no response. Scanlon is also a candidate in Buffalo's mayoral Democratic primary race this year, and Truthout reached out to three other candidates, State Senator Sean Ryan, Common Council member Rasheed Wyatt and former Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield, for comment.

Only Ryan responded, calling the allegations against the Hyatt “serious and concerning,” and said he's “long supported attaching basic labor standards as a condition of receiving public subsidies, a commonsense safeguard against anti-union tactics like those being alleged.” 

“The ability to organize is a fundamental right and taxpayer dollars should not be used to support anyone attempting to deprive their workers of that right,” Ryan added.

Jemal, a big donor to former Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, has not contributed to mayoral candidates so far this election, according to the most recent campaign disclosures. Other major Buffalo developers have donated heavily to Scanlon, who also held a December 2024 fundraiser at Jemal's Seneca One building. In May 2023, Ryan's State Senate campaign reported a $950 in-kind contribution from Jemal's Richardson, a rental fee waiver for a fundraiser.

A Buffalo with a unionized hotel sector would be no outlier among pro-labor Democratic cities. According to government statistics, the median full-time pay of hospitality workers who are union members is nearly 27 percent higher than non-union workers.

“Buffalo should be a place where there are many unionized hotel workers,” Bonadonna Jr. says.

Meanwhile, Hyatt workers are keeping the fight going. The union is planning actions in Buffalo for the spring, and it has been meeting with community and political leaders. They're asking the community to not give money to corporations and developers who retaliate against their workers for organizing.

The union is also waiting on the NLRB decisions around the ULPs and remedial bargaining order, though expectations are hedged given Trump's anti-union changes to the NLRB.

“We're hoping for a good outcome, but we can't place too much faith in the NLRB this day and age,” said Richard Bensinger, the former organizing director of the AFL-CIO who is helping with the Hyatt campaign. “Labor law under Biden was weak at best, but certainly under Trump we can't treat NLRB decisions as the yardstick by which to measure antiunion behavior.”

Sills is grateful that the Hyatt named him employee of the year. But he'd be even happier, he says, if the hotel respected his and his fellow workers' right to unionize.

“Having a voice sounds like this really abstract thing,” he says. “But workers have so many good ideas about how to make things better. If we just had a chance to sit across the table from Jemal and put these ideas into a contract, it would make the hotel a better place for everyone.”

The housekeeper Truthout spoke with in her East Side apartment says, more than anything, she wants workers to have more respect at work.

“A person should recognize that you're human,” she said. “He shouldn't look at you like you're disposable, like you're an animal because you're an immigrant.”

She says other housekeepers who were scared to support the union, but who continue to feel mistreated, are now asking about it.

“They're starting to see the importance of the union,” she said.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a brief one-on-one discussion inside St. Peter's Basilica on April 26 before convening with other leaders to attend Pope Francis's funeral.

The conversation took place before the funeral Mass began, at a point in the morning when the Vatican's vast basilica was shut to allow world leaders and diplomats to visit the pontiff's closed coffin and pay their respects.

Pictures showing Trump and Zelenskyy seated in a corner as if they just pulled up a couple of chairs, hunched over deep in discussion, were shared across social media.

This was the first face-to-face encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy since their heated meeting in the Oval Office in February that ended with Zelenskyy being asked to leave.

Many of those who shared it commented on the significance of their meeting place, including Trump's National Security Advisor, Michael Waltz, who said, “Nothing like some tough diplomacy in one of the most beautiful places in the world.”

The White House later confirmed that the sitdown took place.

“President Trump and President Zelenskyy met privately today and had a very productive discussion,” Steven Cheung, White House communications director, told reporters. “More details about the meeting will follow.”

No further discussion was had after the funeral. Trump and first lady Melania Trump quickly returned to Air Force One afterward to fly back to the United States.

Zelenskyy thanked Trump and said it was a good meeting.

This meeting came less than 24 hours after Trump announced he had “a good day in talks and meetings” with Ukraine and Russia.

“They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off.' Most of the major points are agreed to,” the president wrote on Truth Social. ”Stop the bloodshed, now. We will be wherever is necessary to help facilitate the end to this cruel and senseless war!”

In a follow-up post to his social media platform, Trump reiterated his stance that President Barack Obama was responsible for allowing Crimea to fall into Russian hands, and that the ongoing conflict belongs to President Joe Biden.

However, he expressed doubt that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not want peace after all and could face more U.S. sanctions for the war to end.

Putin expressed his condolences and praised Pope Francis for his “dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches as well as constructive cooperation between Russia and the Holy See.” However, the Kremlin announced on April 22 that he would not attend the funeral.

Tensions between nuclear-armed countries escalate after attack killed 26 people in disputed territory

Indian and Pakistani troops have exchanged gunfire across the volatile frontier in Kashmir for a second day, amid growing tensions after a brazen attack that killed 26 people at a popular tourist resort.

The massacre has sent relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours into a dangerous downward spin. India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which is divided between them but claimed fully by both.

India's military said Pakistani soldiers opened fire from “multiple posts” along the heavily militarised ceasefire line, and Indian forces “responded appropriately” to what it called “unprovoked” firing. No casualties were reported. Pakistan did not immediately comment.

The clashes followed the attack last Tuesday, when gunmen opened fire in a meadow near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attackers reportedly asked the victims, all male, whether they were Hindu or Muslim and shot the Hindus. Violence had been steadily abating in Kashmir, and the attack struck a heavy blow to the region's recovering tourism industry.

An obscure group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility. India links the group to the outlawed Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, but Pakistan denies involvement.

In an apparent attempt to ease tensions, Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, offered to cooperate with a “neutral investigation”. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has vowed to “track and punish every terrorist and their backers” and pursue the killers “to the ends of the earth”.

“Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent and credible investigation,” Sharif said, while warning Pakistan's forces stood ready to repel “any misadventure” by India.

In tit-for-tat moves, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact, expelled Pakistani diplomats and cancelled Pakistani visas. Islamabad retaliated by expelling Indian diplomats, cancelling Indians' visas and closing its airspace. It also suspended the 1972 Shimla accord, a key framework for dialogue.

India's resources minister, C R Patil, said the country would move to ensure “not a single drop” of river water flowed into Pakistan after the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. Pakistan has warned any attempt to block water would be an “act of war”, with the Pakistan People's party chief, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, declaring: “Either our water will flow through it, or their blood.”

Experts say disrupting the flow would require big investment and years of work. “India lacks the hydro infrastructure needed to actually impede the flow of water to Pakistan in the short term,” Brahma Chellaney, an analyst, said. “So the action is largely symbolic.”

Photographs released by the Ukrainian presidency show President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sitting down to talk inside the ornate surroundings of the Vatican just minutes before the start of Pope Francis' funeral. It comes as the White House is eager to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. President Zelensky thanked Trump for the “good meeting” in a post on social media. CNN's Nic Robertson reports.

Environment groups say Thursday order ignores effort to adopt rules to prevent harmful mining of ocean floor

Environmental groups are decrying an executive order signed by Donald Trump to expedite deep-sea mining for minerals, saying it could irreparably harm marine ecosystems and ignores an ongoing process to adopt international rules for the practice.

Trump's Thursday order directed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to fast-track permits for companies to mine the ocean floor in both US and international waters.

The move comes as China controls many critical minerals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese used in hi-tech manufacturing, including for military uses. Trump said his order “establishes the US as a global leader in seabed mineral exploration and development both within and beyond national jurisdiction.”

The order also comes after the Canada-based Metals Company said it would request approval through a US subsidiary for mining in international waters.

The company issued a statement on its website on Friday saying it planned to apply for permits this year to mine nodules that contain valuable minerals “to strengthen US critical mineral supply chains”.

“As always, we remain committed to acting in the best interests of our sponsoring states, partners, investors, and the planet,” said Gerard Barron, the company's chairman and chief executive.

But environmentalists worry it could harm fisheries and even affect oceans' ability to absorb and store carbon dioxide, the main driver of global warming caused by the burning of coal, gas and other fossil fuels.

More than 30 countries, as well as fisheries trade groups, environmentalists and some auto and tech companies, have called for a moratorium on seabed mining.

“Scientists agree that deep-sea mining is a deeply dangerous endeavor for our ocean and all of us who depend on it,” said Jeff Watters, vice-president for external affairs at the Ocean Conservancy. “The harm caused by deep-sea mining isn't restricted to the ocean floor: it will impact the entire water column, top to bottom, and everyone and everything relying on it.'

Such concerns prompted most countries in the 1990s to join a United Nations-affiliated International Seabed Authority to govern seabed mining in international waters. But the US never signed on to the effort, and has not yet adopted rules.

Watters warned that ignoring those efforts “is opening a door for other countries to do the same” before safeguards are adopted. The ramifications could resonate beyond deep-sea mining, affecting agreements on fishing, shipping, navigation and marine research, warned Duncan Currie, legal adviser for the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.

The world also must ask if it can afford to not mine deep-sea minerals that could help develop low-carbon technologies to fight climate change and whether the impacts can be managed, said Assheton Stewart Carter, chief executive of the global consulting firm TDi Sustainability.

“We face tough choices and the prospect of uncomfortable trade-offs if we are to face and find solutions to serious climate change problems,” he said.

But Katie Matthews, chief scientist at the advocacy group Oceana, said Trump's order to expedite the process now “is a clear case of putting mining companies' greed over common sense … Any attempt to accelerate deep-sea mining without proper safeguards will only speed up the destruction of our oceans.”

Pope Francis's funeral took the shape of a mass pilgrimage and unofficial global summit as the Vatican's St. Peter's Square filled to bursting with pilgrims, presidents, and refugees. 

The Vatican estimated that more than 200,000 pilgrims from all over the world had arrived before the funeral started at 10 a.m., making it one of the largest funerals in Vatican – and European – history. They began filling the square well before dawn, a testament to the popularity of Francis among Catholics and non-Catholics alike.

The crowds spilled into the streets around the basilica and onto two bridges over the nearby Tiber River, where they had no view of the event but could hear the hymns. Some of the faithful, unable to get near St. Peter's Basilica, entered nearby churches to pray in silence.

Francis died at age 88 on the morning of Easter Monday after a stroke and subsequent heart failure. His final public appearance came the day before, when he celebrated Easter mass from the loggia of the basilica even though he was plainly weak and able to say only a few words. It would be his farewell to the world, and his last blessing of Catholics.

The heads of state or government at the funeral included Donald Trump of the United States, Emmanuel Macron of France, Javier Milei from Francis's native Argentina, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Britain's Keir Starmer, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and former U.S. President Joe Biden. At least 50 heads of state and 10 reigning monarchs attended the funeral, the Vatican said, plus dozens of other delegations. 

Canada was represented by Governor-General Mary Simon and her contingent. Prime Minister Mark Carney was unable to attend so close to Monday's election. 

Ms. Simon met Francis several times during his tour of Canada in 2022, when he apologized to the Indigenous peoples for the residential school tragedies.

“The apology that Pope Francis made to most of the residential school survivors was very meaningful and very powerful and helped to address the grief and pain that they endured for so long,” she told The Globe and Mail after the funeral. 

“Reconciliation is continuing and will continue and hopefully we will carry on Pope Francis's legacy of bringing people together and talking about the dark history of different countries – for us it's Canada –and the relationship with Indigenous peoples,” she said.

The gathering of leaders was awkward in the sense that some of the leaders, including Ms. Meloni, Mr. Trump and Mr. Milei were at philosophical odds with Francis's empathy and support for migrants and asylum seekers. 

What happens after Pope Francis's death? An ancient process shrouded in mystery and white smoke

Ms. Meloni, who was elected prime minister in 2022 partly on an anti-migrant platform, once said Italy should “repatriate migrants back to their countries and then sink the boats that rescued them.” Francis was highly critical of Mr. Trump's anti-migrant stance. “Anyone who wants to build walls and not bridges is not a Christian,” he once said. 

Francis, who was warm and open to divorced and gay Catholics – “Who am I to judge?” he said in one of his most famous remarks – believed the Church “is a home for all,” Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who led the funeral, said in his homily.

Francis was guided by his conviction that the Church “is capable of bending down to every person, regardless of their beliefs or condition, and healing their wounds,” the Cardinal said.

Mr. Zelensky, who was dressed in dark military clothes, received a round of applause as he left the basilica, where he paid his respects in front of Francis's coffin just ahead of the funeral ceremony. He and Mr. Trump met before the funeral and reportedly were to meet again later in the day. White House communications director Steven Cheung said the pair “had a very productive discussion” before the funeral. 

After the funeral, Mr. Zelensky used X to thank Mr. Trump for the meeting. “We discussed a lot one on one. Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out,” he wrote.

Some of the Catholic faithful travelled for days to attend the funeral, which was held on a sunny, breezy day in Rome, though thousands shivered in the pre-dawn chill.

One group of disabled pilgrims had travelled to Rome with the Kairos Forum, a British consultancy that helps the disabled, and were to meet Francis on Tuesday. They were deeply saddened by the Pope's death only a day before the meeting was to take place.

But many of the 150 in the group were thrilled to have seen Francis celebrate Easter mass on Sunday. “Under Francis, this was a church were everyone belonged,” said Zachariah Duke, the senior lecturer in theology of Australian Catholic University who was co-ordinating the Kairos visit. “I would like to see the next pope be able to connect with all humanity like Francis did.”

Jessica Dal Ri, 29, who works in tourism and marketing, travelled from Italy's far north to attend the funeral with her father. “For the young generation, he was our pope,” she said. “He knew how to connect to the young in a way Benedict did not.” She was referring the Francis's predecessor, the German-born Pope Benedict XVI, a religious scholar who often seemed aloof and distant. 

Invited to his funeral mass were delegations from Mediterranea Saving Humans, an Italian charity that protects refugees who cross the Mediterranean, and Refugees in Libya, a charity that campaigns on behalf of migrants and refugees held in detention camps. Francis was close to both groups.

Francis's coffin was sealed on Friday evening in St. Peter's Basilica, where he lay in state for three days. The Vatican said that day that 250,000 visitors have filed past his then-open coffin to pay their respects. Some of the faithful were annoyed by visitors posing for selfies near the open coffin.

The funeral started at 10 a.m. local time and ended at noon, after which the funeral procession took the coffin through the streets of Rome to Santa Maria Maggiore, Francis's favourite basilica in Rome. He broke with tradition by asking to be buried there, not in the crypts beneath St. Peter's, which hold the tombs of some 140 popes. 

In keeping with his desire for simplicity, Francis chose to be buried in a simple wooden coffin. 

Presidents, royalty and a multitude of mourners bade farewell to Pope Francis on Saturday at his funeral, where a cardinal said the pontiff's legacy of caring for migrants, the downtrodden and the environment must not die with him. Fiona Jones reports.

MOSCOW, April 26. /TASS/. Britain may resort to provocations against Russia on the territory of any state, Director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Sergey Naryshkin told TASS, responding to a question about London's potential subversive acts with the use of chemical weapons on Ukraine's soil.

"Britain may resort to provocations on the territory of any state, if Britain is interested in that. And we actually see that British special services pursue quite actively such a rude line, primarily in relation to the Russian Federation," the SVR chief said.

Russian Ambassador to the UK Andrey Kelin said earlier in an interview with TASS that the latest publications in Western newspapers indicated that Great Britain was conducting undeclared hostile actions against Russia.

A Russian space satellite that U.S. officials tie to its nuclear anti-satellite weapon program seems to be spinning uncontrollably and may no longer be functioning, Reuters reported on April 25, citing U.S. experts.

The Cosmos 2553 satellite, which Russia denies is a part of its space weapon efforts, was launched by Russia weeks before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 

Last year, the satellite had prompted U.S. allegations that for years, Russia has been developing a space nuclear weapon that could destroy hundreds of satellites in low orbit with a blast, such as SpaceX's network of Starlink internet system used by Ukrainian troops.

Over the past year, the Cosmos 2553 satellite had episodes of errant spinning, Reuters reported, citing Doppler radar data from space-tracking firm LeoLabs and optical data from Slingshot Aerospace.

In December 2024, LeoLabs suggested with "high confidence" that the satellite was tumbling based on additional radar data and imagery of the satellite taken by another space company, the news agency says.

"This observation strongly suggests the satellite is no longer operational," the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, said of LeoLabs' analysis in its annual Space Threat Assessment, published on April 25.

U.S. Space Command, which tracks objects in space and has condemned Russian military satellites in the past, said it was aware of a change in Cosmos 2553's altitude, accordig to Reuters.

However, according to the latest observations of Slingshot, whose global telescope network has been tracking the spacecraft since its launch in 2022, Cosmos 2553 appears to have stabilized, the article says.

Russian officials have claimed that the Cosmos-2553 is "intended for scientific research," which the U.S. officials say is unlikely. The Kremlin has earlier denied any intention to put nuclear weapons in space.

VATICAN CITY, April 26. /TASS/. A funeral Mass has begun in St. Peter's Square in the presence of dozens of world leaders, reigning monarchs and religious figures to pay last respects to late Pope Francis.

The funeral of the first Latin American pope is being attended by over 160 delegations, including more than 60 heads of state and governments and also leaders of the European Union, according to the data of the Holy See's press office.

Aside from the European leaders, the funeral ceremony is being attended by US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, President of Argentina Javier Milei and India's President Droupadi Murmu. Russia is represented by Culture Minister Olga Lyubimova.

Pope Francis died on April 21 at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke. He took the helm of the Catholic Church as the 266th pope in 2013, following the resignation of his predecessor Benedict XVI (1927-2022).

Francis will be buried at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.

DA leader John Steenhuisen said President Cyril Ramaphosa's meet-up with US President Donald Trump would be a chance to clarify that “terrible things” are not happening in South Africa.

Steenhuisen stressed that this would be a moment to show that the country was not a picture that was painted to him by “some”.

”There's no mass expropriation of land. There's no genocide taking place at all. I am very glad that the two presidents have spoken,” he said.

Steenhuisen, who is also a Minister of Agriculture, spoke to IOL on Thursday on the sidelines of the official working visit to South Africa by Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.

On Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced imminent talks with Trump to address critical US-South Africa relations.

”We both agreed to meet soon to address various matters regarding US-South Africa relations.

”We also spoke about the need to foster good relations between our two countries,” he said.

Trump made a bold statement that terrible things were happening in South Africa.

This was after AfriForum and the Solidarity movement lied to Trump's administration that white people in South Africa were targeted by the government.

The government has dismissed the claims, labelling them as false and misleading information.

Trump has cut off aid to South Africa and recently introduced 30% tariffs for the country.

He offered refugee status to Afrikaners over fears of land expropriation and discrimination. But AfriForum turned down Trump's offer, saying they can't afford to leave their country.

Steenhuisen urged citizens to tread carefully and use the next 90-day period “very wisely and very cleverly” to be able to avoid the tariff increase.

The Associated Press

11:45 JST, April 26, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump can't stop contradicting himself on his own tariff plans.

He says he's on a path to cut several new trade deals in a few weeks — but has also suggested it's “physically impossible” to hold all the needed meetings.

Trump has said he will simply set new tariff rates negotiated internally within the U.S. government over the next few weeks — although he already did that on his April 2 “Liberation Day,” which caused the world economy to shudder.

The Republican president says he's actively negotiating with the Chinese government on tariffs — while the Chinese and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said talks have yet to start.

What should one believe? The sure bet is that uncertainty will persist in ways that employers and consumers alike expect to damage the economy and that leave foreign leaders scratching their heads in bewilderment.

And the consequences of all this tariffs turmoil are enormous.

Trump placed tariffs totaling 145% on China, leading China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S. — essentially triggering a trade war between the world's two largest economies with the potential to bring on a recession.

The president told Time magazine in an interview released Friday that 20%, 30% or 50% tariffs a year from now would be a “total victory,” even though a financial market panic led him to temporarily reduce his baseline import taxes to 10% for 90 days while talks take place.

“The deal is a deal that I choose,” Trump said in the interview. “What I'm doing is I will, at a certain point in the not too distant future, I will set a fair price of tariffs for different countries.”

If that is confusing for the nation's trading partners, it's also sowing anxiety at home.

The Federal Reserve's beige book, a compilation of anecdotes from U.S. businesses prepared eight times a year, on Wednesday reported a huge spike in uncertainty among American companies that has caused them to pull back on hiring and investment in new projects. The word “uncertainty” cropped up 80 times, compared with 45 in early March and just 14 in January.

Beyond the idea that Trump plans to keep some level of tariffs in place, the world finance ministers and corporate executives who gathered this past week in Washington for the International Monetary Fund conference said in private discussions that the Trump administration was providing no real clarity on its goals for substantive talks.

“There's not a coherent strategy at the moment on what the tariffs are supposed to achieve,” said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the GeoEconomics Center at The Atlantic Council. “My conversations with the ministers and governors this week at the IMF meetings have been they don't understand completely what the White House wants, nor who they should be negotiating with.”

Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, in an interview with broadcaster SRF released Friday, said after a meeting with Bessent that Switzerland would be one of 15 countries with which the United States plans to conduct “privileged” negotiations. But she said a memorandum of understanding would have to be reached for talks to formally begin.

She was happy to at least know whom to talk to, saying that “we have also been assigned a specific contact person. This is not easy in the U.S. administration.”

Nations are deploying various negotiating tactics.

The South Korean officials who met with their U.S. counterparts this week say they specifically asked for the tariffs to be lifted with the goal of working toward an agreement by July. The European Union has pushed for cutting tariffs to zero for both parties, though Trump objects to European countries charging a value-added tax, which is akin to a sales tax that he says hurts U.S. goods.

Trump continues to radiate optimism that negotiated deals with other countries will occur despite his claims that he will set his own deals and a lack of clarity about how the process goes forward.

“I'm getting along very well with Japan,” Trump told reporters on Friday. “We're very close to a deal.”

As part of a deal with Japan, the Trump administration has publicly called on the Japanese government to change its auto safety standards that put a greater focus on pedestrian safety. But the steering wheels on autos sold in Japan are on the right-hand side, while U.S. automakers put their steering wheels on the left.

“I don't think left-hand drive cars sell in Japan,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told a parliamentary session this week.

“We want to make sure we aren't seen as being unfair,” Ishiba said, suggesting a possibility of reviewing Japanese car safety standards.

As Trump continues to make conflicting statements about tariffs, companies are actively looking at higher prices, lower sales and possibly bare shelves in stores due to fewer shipments from China.

Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a supply chain company, said on the social media site X: “In the 3 weeks since the tariffs took effect, ocean container bookings from China to the United States are down over 60% industry wide.”

Consumers are getting notices via email and social media from retailers that lamps, furniture and other housewares will now include tariff-related charges.

The showerhead company Afina on Wednesday reported on a test to see if people would buy an American-made product that cost more than an import. Their Chinese-made filtered showerhead retails for $129, but to manufacture the same product domestically would take the price up to $239.

When customers on the company's website were given a choice between a showerhead made in the USA or a cheaper one made in Asia, there were 584 purchases of the $129 model made abroad and not one sale of the domestically produced showerhead.

Ramon van Meer, Afina's founder, said in an interview that the “scale and the speed” of the tariffs were part of the challenge for smaller businesses looking to adapt, adding that part of the challenge is that Trump imposed the import taxes “without proper planning or announcements.”

He concluded in his written analysis: “If policymakers and pundits want to rebuild American industry, they need to grapple with this truth: idealism doesn't always survive contact with a price tag.”

            Russian authorities say they have detained a man described as a “Ukrainian special services agent” in connection with a car explosion that killed Russian General Yaroslav Moskalik on Friday.
    


            The suspect allegedly purchased the car that exploded in Balashikha, less than 20 miles east of Moscow, according to TASS citing Russia's Federal Security Service. The suspect's nationality is unclear; according to the FSB, he has a residence permit in Ukraine.
    


            The FSB also accused him of planting an explosive device in the car, but said that it was detonated from Ukraine. Video published by TASS on Saturday appeared to show charred electronics and parts of the car. Russia's Investigative Committee had previously said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device packed with shrapnel.
    


            Russian General Moskalik was deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces. The influential Russian military blog Rybar said Moskalik was not in the Volkswagen car when it exploded but was close to it after walking out of a nearby building. CNN cannot independently verify this report.
    


            Photos released by Russian authorities appear to show the suspect driving a dark green Volkswagen with license plates that match those purportedly found at the site of the blast.
    


            TASS video also showed the man being put into a van, and included footage of him apparently in custody describing his alleged recruitment by Ukraine's special services. It's unclear if he was under duress during the confession.
    


            No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion. CNN has reached out to Ukraine's foreign ministry for comment on the suspect's alleged links to Ukraine.
    


            Moskalik was killed on the same day US special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin to discuss efforts to end Russia's war on Ukraine.
    


            After the three-hour meeting, US President Donald Trump initially voiced optimism that both sides were “very close to a deal.”
    


            But the next day, Trump questioned whether Putin wants a peace deal shortly after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican for Pope Francis' funeral.
    


            In a Truth Social post sent as he returned from Rome after the meeting, Trump raised the prospect of apply﻿ing new sanctions on Russia after its assault on Kyiv last week.
    


            “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking' or ‘Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!”

            US President Donald Trump is finding out that getting through to Russian President Vladimir Putin is not as easy as he might have thought. But he's only the latest US leader to fail at an attempt to get Russia and its longtime president on board.
    


            The Trump administration's attempts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Ukraine have largely stalled, despite a flurry of diplomatic activity.
    


            Since returning to the White House, Trump has held at least two lengthy phone calls with Putin and has repeatedly sent his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet the Russian leader in person in Moscow, with the latest trip on Friday.
    


            Unsurprisingly to many Kremlin-watchers, none of these meetings have led to an agreement. Not only did Witkoff come back empty-handed, he also repeated several key Kremlin talking points.
    


            The latest US proposal includes recognizing Russian control of Crimea – a long-standing red line for Ukraine and its European allies, officials familiar with the details have told CNN.
    


            “I would say the negotiations are going very well — from Putin's point of view,” Angela Stent, a foreign policy expert and former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, told CNN.
    


            “He has no intention of stopping the war, but what he wants, and what he's getting, is a restoration of US-Russian diplomatic relations.”
    


            “Putin is playing a waiting game because he believes that time is on his side and that he can force Ukraine into a more disadvantageous position and persuade Kyiv and its European allies with the help of Washington that there is no alternative to a peace settlement on Russian terms,” John Lough, the head of foreign policy at New Eurasian Strategies Centre, a think tank based in London and Washington, told CNN.

The Trump administration says Europe is taking advantage of the US. That's not exactly true



            Stalling, haggling over every detail, or saying no without explicitly saying “no” is a classic Russian tactic, employed by Putin and his top negotiators on several occasions in the past, such as during the negotiations for a ceasefire in Syria.
    


            It's unclear whether the Trump administration didn't see it coming because it doesn't have the expertise that would have led it to expect such behavior, or if it has simply decided to play along.
    


            Trump's words since coming back into office indicate that he sees the world in a similar way to Putin, Stent said – as consisting of a handful of great powers to whom smaller countries should submit.
    


            “Trump talks about great power competition (between China and the US), that he should be able to take over Canada and Greenland, and Panama, and from Putin's point of view, that's okay. Remember, he hasn't criticized Trump for any of these things,” she said.
    


            Ultimately, Trump has made it clear that he has little interest in the future of Ukraine – even suggesting Ukraine “might be Russia someday.”
    


            So, if Putin continues to drag the process along, it may give Trump a way out.
    


            Lough said that Putin's KGB training has shaped the way he approaches negotiations.
    


            “Putin famously described his job in the KGB as ‘work with people.' He was trained in the art of manipulating interlocutors. He is known to prepare meticulously for negotiations and is a master of detail,” Lough told CNN, adding that the Russian leader is known to be “quick on his feet and can charm and intimidate in the same breath.”
    


            Putin has employed this technique on Trump in the past, according to Kalina Zhekova, an associate professor at University College London (UCL) who specializes in Russian foreign policy.

            When the two met in Helsinki in 2018, the Russian leader handed Trump a ball from the 2018 World Cup during the news conference, saying “now the ball is in your court,” in reference to efforts to improve the strained US-Russia relationship.
    


            “This was indicative of Putin's calculated ‘tit-for-tat' approach that views diplomacy as a game with winners and losers. He was also likely aware that his counterpart is someone with a fragile ego who is easily impressed by theatrical gestures and gifts,” Zhekova said, adding that the summit was widely seen as a win for Putin, because Trump was reluctant to denounce Moscow's interference in the 2016 US presidential election, contradicting US intelligence reports and effectively siding with the Kremlin.
    


            Putin has many tricks in his diplomatic toolbox. He likes to keep his counterparts waiting by turning up late for meetings – sometimes by several hours. He often creates chaotic situations to get more options and can change his mind when it suits him, which makes it even more difficult to negotiate with him.
    


            He is also known to use other ways to assert his power. In 2007, for example, “Putin allowed his Labrador to approach (German Chancellor) Merkel during a photo opportunity, although her fear of dogs was communicated to Russian officials prior to the meeting,” Zhekova said.
    


            Witkoff, a real estate magnate with zero previous experience in politics or diplomacy, has been trying to strike a deal with a former KGB lieutenant colonel who has outlasted five US presidents, eight UK prime ministers, three Chinese leaders and six NATO chiefs, having personally negotiated with many of them.
    


            Stent pointed to the fact that Gen. Keith Kellogg, officially Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has been largely sidelined in the talks with Russia, despite, she said, having the most relevant experience. “Of course, he's a general, he's not a diplomat, but at least he has some experience with Russia and thinking about these things, but of course, he's only dealing with Ukraine.”
    


            The mismatch in expertise extends beyond Witkoff to the rest of the US negotiating team too.
    


            Instead of Kellogg, Witkoff was accompanied on some of his trips by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Both are experienced politicians but have no proven track record when it comes to Russia.
    


            Meanwhile, the Russian delegation included longtime Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the former ambassador to Washington, Yuri Ushakov, and Kirill Dimitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund who studied at Stanford and Harvard. All three speak fluent English and are experienced diplomats who know how to deal with Americans.
    


            Moscow might be dragging its feet in hopes that Trump will lose his patience and abandon his goal of ending the war.
    


            Signs of that are already emerging: Rubio said last week that the US could walk away within “days” if there are no signs of progress. And CNN reported this week that Trump is getting frustrated with the lack of progress and privately told advisers that mediating a deal has been more difficult than he anticipated.
    


            “(The Trump administration) are eager to have a deal, but unwilling to pay a high cost for that deal – so no US security guarantees, no boots on the ground (and) they're unwilling to surge US aid to Ukraine as a stick to try to get Russia to make concessions,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, the director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a think tank that advocates for more restrained US foreign policy.

            She added that, for Trump, getting the US out of Ukraine and stabilizing relations with Russia are more important than achieving peace.
    


            Putin knows this. Russia's launch of several major attacks against Ukraine over the past few weeks, including on Kyiv, indicates the Kremlin's belief that the leverage US has – or is willing to use – is limited.
    


            Trump, of course, is not the first US president to believe he can build a good relationship with Russia.
    


            “Every US administration in my memory has come in with some idea that they're going to reset – they all use that word – the relationship with Russia, that they have an opportunity to turn the page and start again. And they have always been wrong,” Sam Greene, director for Democratic Resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told CNN.
    


            Greene, who is also a professor of Russian politics at King's College London, said that this succession of failures has meant that Moscow “has come to see the United States as fundamentally inconsistent.”
    


            Some former presidents tried to build personal relationships with Putin – George W. Bush invited the Russian leader to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, where he drove him around in a Ford pickup truck. Bush famously wrote later that he “looked the man in the eye” and “was able to get a sense of his soul.”
    


            But while Putin was initially agreeable to cooperating with the Bush administration, being the first world leader to call Bush after the 9/11 attacks, their relationship soured fairly quickly.
    


            “I think the real reason for the collapse of that reset was because Putin wanted the United States to treat Russia as an equal and to recognize that it has a right to a sphere of influence in the post-Soviet states. And that's not what the Bush administration was prepared to do,” Stent said.
    


            Other US administrations have tried a different approach, attempting to get Russia more interested in cooperation by welcoming the country into global institutions – such as the G7 in 1997 during Bill Clinton's presidency, or the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2012 under the Obama administration.
    


            “And that hasn't worked either, largely because both sides, over time, underestimated the depth of the structural disconnect between the West and where Russia was headed,” Greene said.
    


            America's relationship with Russia did somewhat ease under the Obama administration – but mostly because Putin wasn't officially in the top seat for some of that time. He stepped down in 2008 to become prime minister because of term limits. He returned as president in 2012 and has since changed the constitution.
    


            The key problem, experts say, is that the US and Russia simply do not understand each other – now or in decades past.
    


            “I don't think that most US administrations have understood really the depth of Russia's shift towards not just authoritarianism, but to a brand of authoritarianism that sees the existence of Western power and particularly sort of the unity of the transatlantic relationship as deeply threatening to Russia's interests,” Greene said.
    


            Thomas Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who was the senior director for Russia on the National Security Council staff from 2004 to 2007, said that the key mistake American presidents made after the breakup of the Soviet Union was thinking that it was possible to develop a broad strategic partnership with Russia.
    


            “I would argue that given Russian interest, given Russian history and Russian traditions, that was never really on the cards. And so we tended to exaggerate the possibilities for cooperation, and then were deeply disappointed when we didn't get it,” he told CNN.
    


            Graham, who served as a special assistant to Bush, said that the only way forward is to understand that Russia and the US will always have a complex, competitive relationship.
    


            “It's important to remember that there are different ways of rivalry. We could have the type of very profound adversarial relationship that we have at this point, with, I would say, an unacceptably high risk of military confrontation between Russia and the United States … or we could have something that I like to call competitive coexistence, where the competition is largely in an economic, commercial, cultural, ideological, diplomatic realm, and not so much in the military realm,” he said.
    


            The point, Graham and others say, is that Russia will not disappear. It will continue to exist and have an interest in European security, in Ukraine and in competing with the Western world.

Iran and the United States began in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, talks that likely will hinge on the Islamic Republic's enrichment of uranium. Iranian state television reported the talks had begun in Muscat, the mountain-wrapped capital of this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Iran and the United States held in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, ending the discussions with a promise for more talks and perhaps another high-level meeting next weekend.

The talks ran for several hours in Muscat, the mountain-wrapped capital of this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula. 

A person close to Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, acknowledged that the meeting had started and later ended. The source spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. Iranian state television also reported their conclusion.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state television after the talks that the parties exchanged written points throughout the day in discussions that he described as “very serious and work-focused.”

“This time, the negotiations were much more serious than in the past, and we gradually entered into deeper and more detailed discussions,” he said. “We have moved somewhat away from broader, general discussions — though it is not the case that all disagreements have been resolved. Differences still exist both on major issues and on the details.”

A senior U.S. administration official said that the talks were “positive and productive.” 

“This latest round of direct and indirect discussions lasted over four hours,” the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. “There is still much to do, but further progress was made on getting to a deal. We agreed to meet again soon, in Europe, and we thank our Omani partners for facilitating these talks.”




Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has mediated the two previous round of talks in Muscat and Rome, offered a positive note at the end of Saturday's negotiations. 

Iran and the U.S. “identified a shared aspiration to reach agreement based on mutual respect and enduring commitments,” al-Busaidi posted on X. “Core principles, objectives and technical concerns were all addressed. Talks will continue next week with a further high level meeting provisionally scheduled for May 3.”

Araghchi arrived Friday in Oman on the eve of the talks and visited the Muscat International Book Fair, surrounded by television cameras and photojournalists. Witkoff was in Moscow on Friday to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and arrived on Saturday to Oman.

Meanwhile on Saturday, a major explosion rocked a port in southern Iran just after the talks began, killing four people and injuring more than 500 others. Authorities offered no immediate cause for the blast, which appeared to have been caused by a highly combustible material — though officials ruled out its oil and gas industry. The private security firm also linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant to the port as well.

The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on a half-century of enmity. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.

Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. 

Trump, traveling to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, again said that he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't.

“The Iran situation is coming out very well,” Trump said on Air Force One. “We've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.”

He added: “There are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal — a much nastier deal — and I don't want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.”

From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi headed up Tehran's expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.

The U.S. technical team was led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Anton doesn't have the nuclear policy experience of those who led Washington's efforts in the 2015 talks. 

Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. The demand that all enrichment stop also has been repeated by Rubio. 

However, Iranians remain hopeful that the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows during which it took more than 1 million rials to buy $1.

“It's OK to negotiate, to make the nuclear program smaller or bigger, and reach a deal,” Tehran resident Farzin Keivan said. “Of course we shouldn't give them everything. After all, we've suffered a lot for this program.”

LONDON (AP) — A lettercard penned by one of the Titanic's most well-known survivors from onboard the ship, days before it sank, has sold for 300,000 pounds ($399,000) at auction.

In the note, written to the seller's great-uncle on April 10, 1912, first-class passenger Archibald Gracie wrote of the ill-fated steamship: “It is a fine ship but I shall await my journeys end before I pass judgment on her.” 

The letter was sold to a private collector from the United States on Saturday, according to auction house Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, England. The hammer price far exceeded the initial estimate price of 60,000 pounds.

The letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage.

Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an “exceptional museum grade piece.”

Gracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write “The Truth about the Titanic,” an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City. 

Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912. 

The letter was postmarked Queenstown, Ireland, one of two stops the Titanic made before sinking.

Former Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman slammed NFL teams for not drafting University of Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who was not selected until the fifth round of the 2025 NFL draft, claiming race played a factor in their decision.

Sanders, the son of hall of fame NFL cornerback Deion Sanders, was hyped as one of the top NFL draft prospects by many analysts. Bowman, who lost his House seat last year after a primary challenge, ranted about his draft slide in a post on X Friday morning.

“The NFL doesn't like Shaduer Sanders because he wears gold chains and talks like a rapper. They don't care that he's a leader, intelligent, tough and completed 77% of his passes with no o line and no running game,” Bowman said.

Bowman also referred to former Ole Miss quarterback Eli Manning, also from a famous football family, refusing to play for the then-San Diego Chargers in 2004, eventually forcing a trade to the New York Giants, in claiming a double standard.

“He's entitled but Eli Manning wasn't entitled when he refused to be drafted by San Diego? He's not athletic, but that didn't stop Joe Montana, Drew Brees or Tom Brady. America continues to fear strong black men who come from means and have a strong sense of themselves without submitting to the ‘dominant' culture,” he added.

While some have pointed to race as a determining factor, others have expressed skepticism about such claims. The first overall pick in the draft, and first QB selected, was Cameron Ward — an African-American quarterback from the University of Miami. University of Alabama's black signal caller Jalen Milroe was also selected ahead of Sanders.

Every QB-needy team that passed up on Sanders currently or recently rostered or drafted a black quarterback.

Sanders has been criticized as a prospect for lacking elite arm strength and athleticism, taking too many sacks due to poor pocket presence and holding onto the ball too long, an average win-loss record at Colorado, and a lack of maturity. While he has been touted as one of the more accurate passers in the draft, his completion percentage was inflated by the large number of short screen passes his team's offense ran.

Questions about his maturity were put in the national spotlight when he publicly blamed his offensive line after a loss to Nebraska in 2024, and they were amplified shortly before the draft when scouts leaked how terrible his team interviews during the NFL combine allegedly went.

One NFL assistant coach said his interview with Sanders was “the worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life. He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates… But the biggest thing is, he's not that good.”

In addition to questions about the player, there are also concerns about his father creating unnecessary distractions. The outspoken hall of famer made a number of controversial comments prior to the draft, leading some to speculate whether that would lead to problems with team chemistry or negative headlines.

ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith blasted Sanders not being picked in the first three rounds as a “damn disgrace” and claimed it was similar to former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick not being signed after protesting the national anthem — although Kaepernick's playing ability had noticeably declined prior to the protests.

This is a damn disgrace. How in the hell is @Shedeur not off the board, not drafted yet. Y'all still think this doesn't have anything to do with teams hatin on @DeionSanders. This kid is a first rounder. In a different way, this is Kaepernick all over again…..being kept out. A…

“This is a damn disgrace. How in the hell is @Shedeur not off the board, not drafted yet. Y'all still think this doesn't have anything to do with teams hatin on @DeionSanders. This kid is a first rounder. In a different way, this is Kaepernick all over again… being kept out. A damn disgrace. I don't care what anyone says!” Smith said.

Bowman and Smith have an unlikely ally in their frustration with Sanders not being drafted, as President Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to call the NFL owners “STUPID” for not drafting Sanders, who he claimed “is all set for Greatness.”

“What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID? Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He's also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be ‘picked' IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!” Trump said.

Sanders was drafted 144th overall to the Browns, who also selected Oregon QB Dillon Gabriel in the third round. He was the team's seventh selection in the draft, and the sixth pick in the fifth round.

TRUMP SLAMS NFL OWNERS FOR SNUBBING SHEDEUR SANDERS IN DRAFT: ‘ARE THEY STUPID?'

After the Browns passed up on him in the first round, his father mocked the organization whose QB room consisted of former Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco and former first round pick Kenny Pickett. 

“Flacco my age!” the retired player-turned-coach said with a smile. Sanders will now be Flacco's teammate and will battle for a spot on the 53-man roster or practice squad in the preseason as the team is unlikely to keep four quarterbacks.

In honor of National Prescription Take Back Day the DEA has set up anonymous drop sites across the country.

Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is urging Americans to dispose of their prescription medications properly. He addressed the issue in a video posted on X, marking National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, which is April 26.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has set up free, anonymous drop-off sites across the country where Americans can leave their unused prescription medications.

While some may think that flushing prescriptions down the toilet is a safe alternative to throwing them away and can prevent people from accidentally ingesting it, Kennedy warns that there are dangers to that too. The HHS chief explained that once flushed, the medications will go into the water system, potentially exposing anyone who drinks the water to those substances.

"We don't fully know the effects of low levels of birth control hormones or antibiotics or chemotherapy agents and so on, in the water, but it's not good," Kennedy said in the video.

However, there are some medications that are safe to flush. According to the FDA's "Flush List," there are several opioid medications that are safe to flush, including Vicodin, OxyContin and Percocet. However, the FDA warns that drugs that do not appear on its Flush List should not be flushed down the toilet.

The DEA sees National Prescription Drug Take Back Day as more than a way for Americans to clear out unwanted or unused medication. On its website advertising the take back day, the DEA frames it as a way to prevent "medication misuse and opioid addiction from ever starting."

During its most recent take back day in October 2024, the DEA collected 629,953 pounds, or 314 tons, of medication across 4,644 collection sites.

For those who miss National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, there are drug take-back sites open year-round. The FDA provides instructions on how to safely dispose of medications, as well as needles and syringes safely.

WHY SHORT WOMEN LIKE DATING TALL MEN AND VICE VERSA, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS

In 2023, Kelleher-Andrews previously spoke with Fox News Digital to share her insight on a relationship trend at the time – why short women like dating tall men and vice versa. 

Kelleher-Andrews, who's from Montecito, California, told Fox News Digital that while women tend to be paired with tall men, confident men don't seem to care as much.

"My most confident male clientele don't have a height preference at all," said Kelleher-Andrews. "They are completely comfortable with the female partner being any height, including much taller."

She added, "I have noticed that these extremely confident men are so secure in who they are and what they bring to the table that they don't find those extra inches as a must-have or a prerequisite for love."

However, the majority of her male clients have voiced a height preference, and eight times out of 10 they've requested to be partnered with a woman who's shorter than them, said Kelleher-Andrews.

With more than 30 years of experience in the match-making field, Kelleher-Andrews said she believed men generally "feel more masculine, confident or protective when they are significantly taller than their female partner."

Editor's note: A version of this story appeared in CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            Legends of young heroes fighting lions to the death appear in Roman records and artwork, but scant physical evidence of these beastly battles exists.
    


            Perhaps, that is, until now.
    


            A new study sheds light on the story of a young man, likely between the ages of 26 and 35, discovered with a fatal bite mark from a large animal.
    


            His remains were buried between 1,825 and 1,725 years ago in what archaeologists believe to be a “gladiator graveyard” — hundreds of miles from Rome — in York, England.
    


            The findings highlight the Roman Empire's sweeping impact across Britain — lending direct evidence that Roman culture and lifestyle spread far beyond the Colosseum.
    


            The human remains at the heart of the new study  have puzzled researchers since the burial site was uncovered in 2010.
    


            Scientists involved in the expedition, led by the York Archaeological Trust, suspected the divots in the man's pelvis were the work of a carnivore.
    


            But delving into the precise culprit showed the markings “were likely made by a lion, which confirms that the skeletons buried at the cemetery were gladiators, rather than soldiers or slaves, as initially thought,” said study coauthor Malin Holst of the University of York.
    


            Here's what the bone analysis revealed about the man and how the researchers determined what was behind the lethal bite markings.
    


            Watch chimpanzees sharing fermented fruit, which contains intoxicating traces of alcohol. The first-of-its kind footage could highlight how the closest living relatives to humans may partake in a boozy treat to strengthen bonds that's similar to our social rites.
    


            What's nearly as long as a bus, has teeth the size of bananas and has a scientific name that translates to “terror crocodile”?
    


            Behold: Deinosuchus.
    


            The roughly 26-foot-long creature of nightmares is believed to have lived between 82 million and 75 million years ago, dining on dinosaurs in the rivers and estuaries of North America.
    


            While prior research on the giant reptile's evolutionary background has put it in the same group as alligators and their ancient relatives, a new analysis of fossils and DNA suggests it belongs on a different branch of the crocodilian family tree.
    


            That assessment boils down to one key trait: Deinosuchus had special glands and a tolerance for salt water, according to the study.
    


            Further animating our understanding of the creatures that populated prehistoric Earth are trace fossils — or ancient animal tracks frozen in time.
    


            Researching these fascinating rocks is like “trying to study ghosts,” said Conner Bennett, lead author of a study that described the story behind several trace fossils in the collection of Oregon's John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.
    


            The footprint fossils can pick up where bones leave off, confirming the presence of animals.
    


            For example, one set of tracks estimated to be about 50 million years old tells the story of a small wading bird pausing near a lakeshore in central Oregon to search for food.
    


            Without the footprints, the unprecedented evidence of birds in the ancient ecosystem may have been lost to time: Their fragile, hollow skeletons don't hold up well.
    


            Tucked away in one of the world's largest collections of fossilized insects, the oldest recorded ant species nearly remained overlooked.
    


            Anderson Lepeco, a researcher at the University of São Paulo's Museum of Zoology in Brazil, spotted the “extraordinary” specimen as he was perusing some of the museum's fossils.
    


            That's when he came across the hell ant, preserved in limestone. The critter was believed to have lived among dinosaurs some 113 million years ago — several millennia before previously found ants, according to new research.
    


            “I was just shocked to see that weird projection in front of this (insect's) head,” Lepeco said. “Other hell ants have been described with odd mandibles, but always as amber specimens.”
    


            At wildlife conservancies in Africa, four-legged friends are invigorating efforts to combat poaching.
    


            Professional dog trainers Darren Priddle and Jacqui Law of Carmarthen, Wales, spearhead the initiative, called Dogs4Wildlife. After they saw a picture of a poached African rhino on social media in 2015, they set out to use their expertise training animals to help combat illegal hunting.
    


            “It was quite a horrific image. We sat down and we said, ‘OK, that's really affected us,'” Priddle told CNN.
    


            The duo has since sent 15 stalwart canines to five sub-Saharan African countries, including Shinga, a Belgian Malinois, and Murwi, a Dutch shepherd, who protect big game at Zimbabwe's Imire Rhino and Wildlife Conservancy.

Emily Kramer-Golinkoff can't get enough oxygen with each breath. Advanced cystic fibrosis makes even simple things like walking or showering arduous and exhausting.

She has the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S., which afflicts 40,000 Americans. But her case is caused by a rare genetic mutation, so medications that work for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis won't help her. 

The same dynamic plays out in other genetic conditions. Stunning advances in genetic science have revealed the subtle, insidious culprits behind these brutal diseases and have started paving the way for treatments. But patients with these exceedingly rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than those with more typical forms of these diseases — and many are now pinning hopes on experimental gene therapies.

“We feel such pure joy for our friends who have been lifted from this sinking ship,” said Kramer-Golinkoff, 40. “But we just feel so eager and desperate to join them. It's really hard to be in this minority of people left behind.”

It's not just science that is working against these patients, it's market forces. Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations. 

“You need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,” said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is “mutational discrimination.”




Charities – including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily's Entourage – are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.

While it likely won't be available for years, “just to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,” Kramer-Golinkoff said.

Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body. 

It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.

“As I've gotten older … my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,” Kramer-Golinkoff said.

Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master's degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She's prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.

“CF is a real monster of a disease,” she said.

Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with “CFTR modulator” therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients' overall quality of life.

Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.

Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.

For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations – affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don't benefit from modulator therapies.

While there's little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop “mutation agnostic” gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.

“There's a huge push to develop these therapies,” said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center. 

Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.

One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily's Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.

Kramer-Golinkoff said she's more optimistic about her future these days, even as her own illness worsens. At this point, she's living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily.

“You have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that's really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,” she said.

“We're incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies. They can't come soon enough.”

Criminal defense attorney Brian Claypool discusses how Democratic leadership in California has impacted the rise of violent crime in San Francisco.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., offered a dire warning to fellow Democrats recalling an exchange he had with a Target cashier in San Francisco, insisting his party has a "major problem."

During a panel discussion on Friday's "Real Time with Bill Maher," Schiff was asked to weigh in on the current state of the Democratic Party and how it governs, particularly in a state like California. 

"So we're gonna to have to change how we do business in California," Schiff told Bill Maher. "We're gonna to have to address people's legitimate concerns about crime."

Schiff then recalled an experience he had two years ago in San Francisco when his luggage was stolen out of his car, admitting it was the one time he did not heed warnings from others about not leaving valuables in vehicles while in the city. 

"And what was most memorable about the experience for me as I went to this Target in South San Francisco, 10 o'clock at night, and I'm getting the toiletries I'm gonna need for my next two days in the city," Schiff said. "First of all, I had to get the clerk, which is hard to find, to unlock the shampoo or the whatever. So that's one thing."

"And then I get to the cashier. The cashier asked me if I want one of those Target bags with a little bullseye on it. And I said, ‘Yes, that Target bag is gonna be my luggage for the next two days," Schiff continued. "And she asked me what happened, and I told her, and she basically said in not so many words, 'Yeah, Democrats are a---h---s.' And I thought, you know, if the cashier in South San Francisco at 10 o'clock at night believes that Democrats are a---h---s because the shampoo was locked up and my stuff got stolen out of the trunk, we've got a major problem that we have to address."

"That's an awesome story," Maher reacted. "That says a lot. I hope all the Democrats listen to that story."

Schiff expressed hope in San Francisco's new Democratic mayor Daniel Lurie, who he says is "helping lead the way in how we kind of reinvent how Democrats are doing governance."

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) backed a bill Friday that would print the number for a suicide hotline and LGBT crisis center on the back of all public middle and high school student ID cards. 

The move is in direct opposition to President Donald Trump‘s administration plan to cut funding for a nonprofit network that provides LGBT-specific youth counseling at the suicide hotline. The California governor criticized the plan, claiming the government is “walk[ing] away from its responsibility” to provide such resources.

“Suicide is the second leading cause of death among LGBT youth. Cutting off kids' access to help is indefensible,” Newsom told Politico. “While the Trump administration walks away from its responsibility, California will continue to expand access to life-saving resources, because the life of every child — straight, gay, trans — is worth fighting for.”

California has largely led the charge against the Trump administration's policies. It was the first to sue Trump over tariffs and is also challenging the Department of Government Efficiency‘s cuts to AmeriCorps. 

The California bill was introduced by Assembly member Mark González, a Democrat from Los Angeles, and would put the number for the Trevor Project on student ID cards.

The Trevor Project is one of the nonprofit groups that would lose funding under Trump's budget. Social conservatives have criticized the organization, with the California Family Council claiming it “undermines families” and creates a “playground for predators.”

The nonprofit organization is the leading suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBT youth. They provide around-the-clock support, including a toll-free hotline, online chats, and text message support that connects people in crisis with trained counselors. 

PROMINENT JEFFREY EPSTEIN VICTIM VIRGINIA GIUFFRE DIES BY SUICIDE 

During the bill's first hearing in April, Republican assembly member Josh Hoover pushed back on why it was necessary to add a LGBT-specific hotline number when there is already a general hotline number on student IDs.

“My concern has nothing to do with the ability to call a hotline, obviously, that is something that I support,” Hoover told Politico. “But if you go right now to the Trevor Project website, there are a number of resources provided that are very political in nature. There is access to a number of things that I would argue a lot of parents would be uncomfortable with.”

Urban Meyer joins Colin Cowherd to share his thoughts on Shedeur Sanders falling out of Round 1 of the NFL Draft.

When quarterback prospect Shedeur Sanders fell out of the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft, there were some who couldn't believe he hadn't been picked by an organization, although it wasn't considered a total shock. 

But with Friday night seeing three more quarterbacks not named Sanders come off the draft board, the reaction was pure shock. 

Sanders, the Colorado Buffaloes quarterback who was a Heisman Trophy finalist this past college season, remains available heading into the third and final day of the NFL Draft. There have been 102 prospects taken off the board, and with Round 4 beginning at noon in Green Bay, everyone is wondering which NFL team will finally pull the trigger on Sanders.

Surprise and shock might not even be the words to describe this fall down the draft board, arguably being the biggest we've seen in recent memory for someone whom many considered to be, at the very least, a Day 2 selection.  

Why is this happening for Sanders? It's the question on everyone's mind, including ESPN's Booger McFarland, who thinks the answer lies beyond the tape.

"It's gotta be about more than football," he said during the NFL Draft broadcast on the network. "He's the best pure passer you can draft. When you start to see developmental projects like Jalen Milroe and Dillon Gabriel – and nothing against those guys, but they're not nearly the player that Shedeur Sanders is. When they go before him, the only thing you can say is that it's more than football."

Tyler Shough (New Orleans Saints), Milroe (Seattle Seahawks), and Gabriel (Cleveland Browns) were all selected on Friday night in respective order. Gabriel, especially, was the icing on the cake for those who were baffled that Sanders hadn't gone off the board, as some experts didn't have him on their top five quarterback rankings heading into the draft. 

Mel Kiper Jr., the longtime NFL Draft analyst with ESPN, has been adamant about Sanders' talent, ranking him the highest-graded prospect on his big board. He was vocal about Sanders making it out of the first round on Thursday night, but he was appalled to see what happened the next day. 

"I think it's disgusting," he said during a lengthy rant after Day 2 came and went. "I don't understand what the heck's going on with this. . . . Somebody's gonna have to explain that one to me."

Joel Klatt, who called several Buffaloes games this past college season for Fox Sports, has seen what Sanders can do for a football program in person.

During NFL Network's broadcast, Klatt pointed the finger at the narratives that were built about Sanders during the pre-draft process as to a reason why he's slipping. 

"Shedeur represents everything I dislike about the NFL Draft, and it's only one thing: it's narratives. It's narratives that are built up, lazy, and quite frankly, trash. When you come out as an anonymous source about some meeting that you had, and you don't think that some kid measured up to what you wanted him to be when he walked in your room, I think that's trash.

"Shedeur Sanders is going to be a good quarterback in the National Football League, and I think he's going to go make some head coach and some fan base very happy, because he's already done that in his career in what I think is a very difficult spotlight for his dad at the University of Colorado and a program that was nothing before he got there for two decades."

SHEDEUR SANDERS STAYING CONFIDENT AS STUNNING NFL DRAFT FALL HITS FINAL DAY: ‘THANK YOU GOD FOR EVERYTHING'

At the same time, Klatt also believes this is time for Sanders to reflect, because the analyst feels it isn't the tape that's causing this freefall. 

"His play on the field would suggest he should already have been selected," Klatt explained. "There were some quarterbacks, their play on the field probably doesn't warrant a selection over his play on the field. 

"The reason he's undrafted at this point is because of the person that sat with those teams and did not, for whatever reason, jell with them."

It's not just the analysts opining about Sanders' draft situation – even President Donald Trump jumped into the mix to say how crazy it was. 

"What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID? Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He's also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. 

ESPN host Stephen A. Smith called it "a damn disgrace." Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton, who already has a young quarterback after taking Bo Nix in the first round last years, admitted his surprise and even the Buffaloes football account on X posted 10 minutes worth of Sanders highlights, just to remind everyone of how good he can be on the gridiron. 

These reactions are just the tip of the iceberg, as the football world continues to be bewildered at Sanders being available heading into the fourth round on Saturday.

After the final pick was made in Round 3, Sanders, who has been surrounded by friends and family at home, including his father and Colorado coach Deion Sanders, posted on X. 

"Thank you GOD for EVERYTHING," he wrote.  

Of the teams still in search for a potential new quarterback on the depth chart, the Pittsburgh Steelers, believed to be an option in Rounds 1 and 3, remain a frontrunner, as do the Las Vegas Raiders.

Fox News Digital was on hand for the White House Egg Roll on Monday, April 21, 2025. Here are some of the festivities enjoyed by Americans who gathered as President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump mingled with visitors.

Melania Trump is celebrating her birthday on April 26 as she's been resuming her White House duties for the second time. 

To commemorate the first lady's 55th year, Fox News Digital takes a look back at her path from growing up in Slovenia to stepping into her role in the White House.

Trump was born on April 26, 1970, in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, at Splošna bolnišnica Novo mesto General Hospital, to parents Viktor and Amalija Knavs, according to public records.

The first lady was christened at the Church of St. Lawrence in Novo Mesto, where she was given her name, Melania.

She reportedly spent the first few years of her life living in an apartment in Sevnica.

Her family then relocated to a home in the same town.

Fox News Digital also spoke with the first lady's fifth-grade teacher, Milena Krajnc.

Krajnc shared that Trump was a good student and was always willing to help classmates who were falling behind.

Srečko Ocvrik, the mayor of Sevnica, told Fox News Digital that the Knavs family were pleasant and actively involved in the community.

"While I did not know the family personally, local narratives consistently portray the Knavs family warmly, highlighting their positive influence and presence in the community," said Ocvrik.

The mayor shared that it would have been an "undoubtedly happy time for those who were young" growing up in the 1970s and '80s, "as economic progress was evident."

"We must consider that Slovenia and Sevnica are part of Central Europe, characterized by a quality of life that is inclusive and hardworking," he went on.

At the time that Melania Trump was growing up, the area was part of the former country of Yugoslavia, which dissolved in the 1990s, according to the mayor. 

"Slovenia, as the westernmost republic of Yugoslavia, was significantly more aligned with Western culture and standards compared to the southern republics," he added.

Editor's note: This story contains quotes of abusive language toward Katherine Legge that were released to CNN by her team.



            British racing driver Katherine Legge told CNN Sports that she has been inundated with thousands of hateful messages, death threats, vulgar and inappropriate comments across multiple social media platforms since she entered NASCAR in March.



            One direct message on X said that she should hang herself, the same account adding in a separate, public, post, “You need to be assassinated.” Another advised her to “swallow a shotgun.”
    


            Initially, she wanted to ignore her trolls and deny them the oxygen of publicity, but after a difficult weekend on the track at Rockingham she decided to speak out.
    


            Speaking exclusively to CNN about the abuse, Legge says that while she welcomes fan engagement online, the amount of vitriol is only getting worse.
    


            “Online bullying is getting more toxic, and I think that somebody needs to call it out,” she said. “It's shocking to read some of the vile things that people write, there just seems to be this whole online movement where people think that it's OK to say these things that they would never have the courage to say to people in real life; or absolutely shouldn't.”
    


            Female athletes have recently spoken out about the threats they have received online. At the conclusion of her college career, the basketball star Angel Reese said tearfully, “I've been through so much, I've seen so much. I've been attacked so many times. Death threats, I've been sexualized, I've been threatened.” WNBA star Breanna Stewart said that police were investigating homophobic death threats that had been sent to her wife and the French tennis player Caroline Garcia reported comments on X that told her to consider suicide and, “I hope your mom dies soon.”
    


            Legge has observed the abuse that athletes endure in other sports, and even some of the invective that is aimed at male drivers in NASCAR. However, she is currently the only female driver on the circuit, and she suspects that as a result, her treatment is worse.
    


            “I think it's more prevalent with women in sports, especially with women in male dominated sports, because we stick out more, you know? There is the opinion that we are a gimmick, or we shouldn't be there because we're DEI hires and we haven't earned our spot,” she told CNN.
    


            CNN has seen many of the X posts in which Legge has been targeted for abuse online, ranging from “Please get the f**k out of NASCAR” and “I hope you wreck every car you drive in” to sickening vulgarities that are too offensive to print. Her team say that many more toxic messages have been posted on YouTube and Facebook. It's a sad fact of modern-day life that Legge has become numb to it.
    


            “It's just noise,” she explained. “I have a thick skin. It's not worth my time or energy. I can honestly say it doesn't phase me one way or the other, because they are people who I would not ask an opinion of. The people I respect, team members, my bosses, my partners, my family, my friends, and those who have been there and done it, are the voices that I listen to.”
    


            She added, “It's just mind-blowing to me because I would never do it. I would ever go online and try and bring somebody else down to raise myself up and so I feel sorry for them, I guess, is the best way of putting it.”
    


            Legge says she doesn't think that any of the death threats would seriously be carried out, but NASCAR is providing a security detail for her upcoming races and the sport's head of security has alerted law enforcement in her hometown of the situation.
    


            Speaking to CNN, NASCAR Commissioner Steve Phelps described the posts as incredibly upsetting.
    


            “I want to be crystal clear about this, we condemn this behavior. It is unacceptable, this is not appropriate for NASCAR, sports, or the world,” he said.
    


            Phelps also defended Legge against any of her critics who thinks she is somehow undeserving of her place on the track.
    


            “This is a woman who has competed very successfully in all forms of motorsports and we want her here at NASCAR. They can take their opinions and their hate right out of NASCAR, because there's just no place for it,” he said.
    


            Legge's two races so far this season have resulted in DNFs (did not finish,) one of which she takes personal responsibility for. At the age of 44, she's a highly experienced driver, competing in IndyCar, Open Wheel, electric cars and sports cars.
    


            “You name it, I've driven it,” she told CNN earlier this year – but she admits she is relatively inexperienced in NASCAR.
    


            She's been contracted for 11 more races in the Xfinity and Cup series, driving for the Chevrolet-backed teams Jordan Anderson and Live Fast.
    


            “I'm having a great time on these awesome tracks, driving these beasts,” she said with a smile. “I'm hoping to get some results towards the end of the year. All I can do is keep improving and, if they have the capacity, they will change their opinions, and it will die down a little bit. But time will tell.”
    


            Beyond hoping that being a more successful competitor will dampen the online abuse, Legge said the only way to truly extinguish it in society is to make it socially unacceptable.
    


            “The reasonable people in the population think that it's unacceptable, right? It's bullying. It's something that you're taught as a child isn't cool,” she said.
    


            “I didn't set out to be a role model,” she added. “I just set out be a racing driver and with that comes a responsibility.”
    


Events beyond her control have now forced her to further embrace that responsibility, and she hopes her example will inspire others to speak up or, at the very least, learn how to cope with being bullied.
    


            “I tried to be the best role model that I could be for like, a nine-year-old Katherine, act as a beacon of light and maybe somebody being bullied somewhere, even if it's just one person, if they see this and they think, ‘OK, I'm gonna ignore it,' then it's been worth it,” she said.

The former MTV star's new life in Canada is the subject of a reality TV series on Prime Video, ‘Tom Green Country.' He also has a stand-up special, ‘Tom Green: I Got a Mule!' and a documentary, ‘This Is the Tom Green Documentary.'

After living in Hollywood for 20 years, Tom Green was ready to go home.

It was 2021 when the comedian and actor moved back to his native country of Canada. Today, he resides on a 150-acre farm in a remote area of Ontario alongside chickens, a donkey and a 1,500-pound mule, among other animals.

"I'm often in the wilderness," the 53-year-old told Fox News Digital. "There's not a lot outside the farm as far as restaurants and conveniences. In California, it was nice to be able to do stand-up comedy every night. It was nice to be able to have 200 different sushi restaurants you could go to. But… there's nothing really I miss about living there, to be honest with you. It's nice to be living in the country at the farm."

The MTV star who famously pranked everyone during the Y2K era — including his parents — is chronicling his new life in a series on Prime Video, "Tom Green Country." 

The streaming giant is also offering "This Is the Tom Green Documentary" about his rise to fame, as well as his stand-up special, "Tom Green: I Got a Mule!". He also has a new country album, "Home to the Country," a love letter to his new life.

"I've kept all of this footage for years of my old public access show and videos that I used to make and my MTV show," Green explained about why he decided to be the subject of a tell-all now.

"The show was pretty outrageous and kind of a crazy show," he reflected. "It was done in those early days of home video before social media. I think it sometimes shocked people, confused people. I was playing a little bit of a character or an amplified wild and crazy version of myself. I think I wanted to put this documentary together to… set the record straight and let people… get to know what I'm all about."

Green said his desire to leave California started during the pandemic. His stand-up comedy tour was postponed for the year. So, he decided to go out into the desert in a camper van.

"I was traveling all around the southwestern United States in a camper van doing videos for my YouTube channel and just recording podcasts," he explained. "Then I just realized I love being out in nature so much. I grew up in Canada, and I always spent a lot of time fishing and being out in the wilderness there. I just decided I wanted to live like that."

"So, I moved back home," he noted.

Green's farm is located "not far from where I grew up," he shared. It's also close to his parents, who've forgiven him since he famously put a cow's head on their bed, "Godfather"-style.

"They still talk to me," he said. "Getting a farm close to my family, it's been the best decision I've made, I think ever, really… It's a lot different from Los Angeles, and I'm happy to be on the farm."

"I've never really felt completely at home in Los Angeles… it always felt foreign to me," Green reflected. "It always felt strange to me to be in Los Angeles and in that world. I had a lot of fun there. I started doing stand-up comedy again in Los Angeles 20 years ago… I performed at the great comedy clubs of LA… But I always felt like I was missing home, and I wanted to be living closer to my family."

Green has picked up some unexpected skills along the way.

"Riding my mule," he boasted. "I didn't know anything about riding horses or mules. Certainly didn't know how to get up in the morning and go out and take care of a giant 1,500-pound animal."

His new lady has been an inspiration, he said.

"Fanny is a massive rideable mule, maybe the biggest rideable mule in Canada… I saddle her up every morning. I ride her out into the wilderness. I've really gotten to become very comfortable riding Fanny and using her just to get around the property. And it's also been an extremely beautiful experience to be able to bond with an animal like that," he said.

"I never really lived on a farm when I grew up," Green shared. "I lived in the city of Ottawa… [But] I would go out into nature. I'd go fishing, and I'd go out in the country. We had a cabin as a kid that we would go out and fish at, but I never actually had farm animals and all of that."

Escaping the glitz and glam of Hollywood has brought Green newfound peace. He spends his morning riding Fanny and feeding his chickens. He also works around his 1857 farmhouse with his dog Charley always nearby. You may even spot him on an ATV with his fiancée, Amanda Nelson. He was previously married to Drew Barrymore from 2001 to 2002.

"When I was living in Los Angeles, and I was working in show business, it was always go-go-go," he said. "You're always trying to figure out what you're doing next, and you can get stressed out. It's nice to live in a simpler, calmer environment and just be in the presence of these animals. It's a very calming and peaceful thing. I think it makes me a much happier person for sure."

Today, Green is living life on his terms. He still hits the road to perform comedy. But then he goes right back home, where his animals eagerly greet him.

Anyone can do it too, he insisted. Just know what you're signing up for.

"If you do want to move to the country and leave the city, you have to genuinely like that rural lifestyle," Green said. "You have to want not just peace and quiet, but you have to enjoy all aspects of it. I love getting up in the morning and walking in the wilderness. Maybe there'll be a few mosquitoes here and there. Maybe there'll be some muddy boots. But it's something that's in your blood."

"Doing things like fishing, hunting or just being outdoors can be very cathartic if it's really in your heart," he said. "If you feel that it's in your heart, and you want to live a simpler, more rural lifestyle, you should do it, because I think you won't regret it. It's not for everyone, but it was a great choice for me."

    Editor's Note: “My Happy Place,” a CNN Original Series following celebrities on deeply personal journeys, airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT. CNN also tapped anchors and correspondents to share their happy places. CNN's Boris Sanchez finds happiness scuba diving in Key Largo, Florida.



            People wandering down to spend a little time in the Florida Keys often end up staying much, much longer.
    


            “Thirty-one years ago, I came here on vacation,” said Eric Johnson, a tour guide on tiny Pigeon Key.
    


            Johnson met a guy in Miami on a Thursday who said he could come sleep on his couch in Marathon. “On Saturday morning, I was here.” He left for the winter, came back in the spring and has lived in the Keys ever since.
    


            He's far from the only local who's dropped in for a visit and ended up staying for decades.
    


            With views of Florida Bay on one side and the Atlantic on the other, the allure of this island chain is easy to see as you drive south into the Keys. But it's the Overseas Highway itself — the 113-mile-long engineering marvel under your tires with the ghost of a railway whispering below — that's allowed motorists to answer the call of the Keys for nearly a century.
    


            This is no blank-slate stretch of asphalt — the route, leapfrogging from one key to the next over 42 bridges, has seen tragedy and more than its share of colorful characters. Along this part of US 1 from mainland Florida to Key West, you'll find relics of a historic railroad and plenty of ways to make the most of the aquamarine water all around you.
    


            Driving straight from Miami to Key West can take about four hours if things go smoothly. But if you're beelining down to Mile Marker 0, you'll be missing out.
    


            “I think people are learning more about the joy of the other Keys,” said Will Keizer, a captain at Captain Hook's Marina and Dive Center, which has three locations in the Keys. “If you want bar-to-bar-to-bar busy, Key West is your jam — no doubt about it,” said Keizer, who's originally from Michigan and has lived in the Florida Keys for about eight years.
    


            But “if you want to slow down, take in the sights,” he says, it's time to explore beyond Key West. Here are some stops along the way.
    


            Key Largo — the largest of the Keys and the first destination along the route — immediately delivers the underwater riches that bring divers here in droves.
    


            For wreck divers, the 510-foot Navy dock landing ship USS Spiegel Grove now serves as an artificial reef six miles offshore. Local dive shops run trips to the wreck, where sea turtles mingle with coral, sponges and cascades of colorful fish. (And for seafood lovers, the pink-orange hogfish fries up nicely at The Fish House).
    


            Also on Key Largo at Mile Marker 103, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park — the first undersea park in the US — offers snorkeling and scuba trips and glass-bottom boat tours.
    


            Down the road another 11 miles in Tavernier, the Blond Giraffe bakes up several delicious variations of the famous key lime pie, made from the zesty little limes that were once grown here commercially.



            Drive on and you'll soon find yourself in Islamorada, a community stretching across five inhabited islands.
    


            Just east of US 1, near Mile Marker 82, a monument to the victims of the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane serves as a reminder of the tragedy that cost hundreds of lives and spurred the creation of the new highway.
    


            Among the more than 400 dead were hundreds of World War I veterans who were working on a section of the Overseas Highway. Extensive damage from the hurricane put an end to a railroad dating back to 1912, the first direct, over-island route to Key West.
    


            “The state wound up taking over the railroad right of way and essentially made that rail line … a new version of the highway,” said Corey Malcom, lead historian at the Florida Keys History Center in Key West. “And that opened in 1938 and was connected by bridges. And people could then, from 1938 on, drive straight through from the mainland all the way to Key West.”
    


            While the Keys' railroad chapter has long-since closed, reminders of the ambitious project are visible along the route, and its stories are told in exhibits throughout the islands.
    


            The Over-Sea Railroad was part of the Florida East Coast Railway, owned by Standard Oil partner Henry Flagler. The extension to Key West — inspired by plans for the Panama Canal and its trade possibilities — was dubbed “Flagler's folly” by skeptics, but the first train reached Key West on January 22, 1912.
    


            After the 1935 hurricane hastened the railway's demise, the railroad bed was used for the new road and some of the railroad bridges were converted for cars — narrow, white-knuckle affairs that live on in memories, in ruins and in a span that's recently been revived as a pedestrian and biking path.
    


            Continuing south along US 1 in Islamorada, you can't miss Robbie's on Lower Matecumbe Key  —  a one-stop compound  for kitschy souvenirs, sport-fishing charters, cold drinks, hot meals and a tarpon feeding frenzy. For $2.50 you can access the dock and another $5 buys a bucket of fish to feed the tarpon. (For a quieter feeding atmosphere, Bud N' Mary's, a couple miles before you hit Robbie's, doesn't charge admission to its dock.)
    


            Some daredevils will let tarpon, which can grow up to 8 feet long, gulp their hands to the wrist for a great video moment, but Robbie's visitors on a relatively quiet day in March were dangling fish through holes in a net, seemingly reluctant to participate in any unnerving limb gulping.
    


            Also in the menagerie was a manatee named Samantha and an aggressive flock of pelicans poised to snatch fish not promptly gobbled up by the tarpon. And policing the dock with a padded stick to maintain order was Ron Hauter, a Robbie's employee whose right hand showed signs of tangling with the critters.
    


            At the time, Hauter, who had just moved down from Crystal River, Florida, was two weeks into his dream of living in the Keys.
    


            Florida native Carl Hiaasen, a novelist and former Miami Herald reporter and columnist, had the same dream growing up in Broward County and lived it for about nine years before he sold his house on Lower Matecumbe Key. But the island chain has served as the backdrop for some of his satirical crime novels, including “Bad Monkey,” which recently became an Apple TV+ series starring Vince Vaughn.
    


            “I've set several novels in the Keys because I still find it an intriguing place, not just for the natural beauty, but for the people — the characters — it's attracting … You have an outlaw component, who's drawn to the Keys, and you have dreamers, and you have families, and you have retirees and … just retired scoundrels,” Hiaasen said.
    


            Traffic snarls are one reason why Hiaasen ultimately returned to eastern Florida. The Upper Keys can be “a parking lot on the weekends,” he said.
    


            But for each resident who gets fed up with some of the hassles of Keys life, there's someone like Ron Hauter ready to give it a shot.
    


            “Everything here is beautiful,” Hauter, 20, said enthusiastically. “The wildlife is so active — and aggressive. Everything is so aggressive in the Keys — I love it.”
    


            Regular traffic can be fierce along Route 1 — and when there's a wreck? Well, with essentially one road in and one road out, it's good to have some flexibility.
    


            Case in point: A Monday afternoon accident on the Seven Mile Bridge — the longest and most impressive modern span in the Florida Keys — snarled traffic for hours in early March.
    


            Fortunately, the Turtle Hospital, at Mile Marker 48.5, required less than a mile of backtracking, and a planned overnight in Marathon allowed for leisurely waterfront dining instead of hauling down to Key West, feeling hours behind schedule.
    


            The Turtle Hospital rescues, rehabilitates and, in many cases, releases sea turtles brought in because of boat strikes, disease and other hurdles encountered by the five species found in local waters.
    


            The 90-minute guided visit involves turtle education, a look at the medical facility and an outdoor tour to see (but not touch) turtles awaiting release as well as others deemed too vulnerable to live in the wild.
    


            Marathon, a community of 13 islands, also offers casual waterside dining where marine wildlife adds to the ambiance.
    


Castaway features a sushi roll with lionfish — the restaurant's effort to help rid the Keys of the invasive species. And the manatees jostling in the canal for a sip of cool water dripping from an air-conditioning system keep diners very much in touch with the aquatic environment.
    


            Over on the Gulf side of Marathon, Keys Fisheries offers order-at-the-window seafood, a full bar and waterfront seating with sunset views and glimpses of the sharks, tarpon and pelicans that patrol the marina.
    


            Down the highway, near Mile Marker 47, the old Seven Mile Bridge — nicknamed “Old Seven” — is a prime place to get out and explore on foot.
    


            A 2.2-mile section of the old railway bridge, which was converted for highway traffic in the ‘30s and used until a new bridge was completed in 1982, reopened in 2022 to pedestrians and cyclists.
    


            At the end of the repurposed section, you can access Pigeon Key, a tiny island where hundreds of railway construction workers lived from 1908 to 1912. Admission is $15 for adults arriving on their own via Old Seven or $28 for those who opt to ride a tourist train from a parking lot a few miles back.
    


            Admission includes a guided tour, and you can picnic, snorkel and fish while you're on the island.
    


            The railway construction workers toiled six days a week, 70 to 80 hours per week for $1.50 per day, according to guide Eric Johnson. There's a small museum dedicated to their work on the island and several original buildings.
    


            Walking back on the paved pedestrian stretch, with traffic zipping along the wider Seven Mile Bridge nearby, you can see the eras of this route's history. When the railway was first converted into a highway, the tracks were removed and a 22-foot sheet of steel was laid down and paved. The old train tracks became railings on either side.
    


            The narrow highway eventually earned the nickname “Highway of Mirrors,” according to Pigeon Key history, because cars passed so close to one another that their side mirrors were knocked off, littering the road.
    


            Back in the car, after crossing over the newer — technically 6.79-mile — Seven Mile Bridge, history buffs will find another impressive railroad ruin: the old steel truss Bahia Honda Bridge.
    


            Today, the area around the bridge at Mile Marker 37 is part of Bahia Honda State Park, where a trail follows the route that was once US 1 up onto the old bridge, where you can walk on one section.
    


Snorkeling trips run from the park out to Looe Key, a protected reef about 9 miles southwest of the park. Captain Hook's also runs expeditions to Looe Key.
    


            At Looe, an hour spent floating above colorful parrotfish, angelfish and barracuda brings time to a near-standstill. Bobbing on the ocean's surface, the value becomes clear of slowing down, breathing deeply and soaking up the pleasures of the other Keys.
    


            Some 30 miles down the highway, Key West awaits — with its rollicking bars, rooster soundtrack, Jimmy Buffett lore and historic sites tied to Harry S. Truman and Ernest Hemingway. But you should resist the urge to race to Key West straight from the airport in Miami or Fort Lauderdale, says Cori Convertito, a curator and historian at the Key West Art & Historical Society.
    


            “You're going to get to Key West,” she said. “Hopefully Key West isn't going anywhere anytime soon — so take your time.”
    


            Delight in the journey.

            In one community on Long Island, New York, there's a motto that's hard to miss.
    


            It's on bumper stickers and proudly proclaimed by many living in the middle-class shoreline hamlet that has President Donald Trump's attention.
    


            “There's a saying here in Massapequa: ‘Once a Chief, always a Chief,” said longtime resident Morris Miller, as he waited his turn Tuesday in the chair at Abraham's Barber Shop.
    


            The retired US military veteran is referring to the logo that has been used by Massapequa High School since opening down the block seven decades ago.
    


            The logo, of a centuries-old chief in Native American headdress, is painted on a massive wall mural adjacent to campus, a few doors down from the barber shop.
    


            “I don't see it as a negative thing towards anyone,” said Anthony Grimaldi, another patron.
    


            The New York Department of Education does not see it that way, maintaining such Native American images “have shown to perpetuate negative stereotypes that are demonstrably harmful to children.”
    


            The state's education department banned Native American mascots in public schools two years ago, amid a national effort to drop language and imagery disrespectful of Indigenous peoples. Most school districts – at risk of losing state funding – have since complied with the order, with the Massapequa Union Free School District in particular standing out in defiance of it and taking the matter to court.
    


            The district's stance is a source of frustration for one resident, who played hockey for the Massapequa High Chiefs and later in life learned he was of Native American descent.
    


            “I understand the attachment to the mascot,” Adam Drexler, 60, told CNN, saying his issue is not so much the ban but with how people are discussing it in his community.
    


            “They talk about respecting and honoring Native Americans that were here first but they're not,” Drexler said. “If they were, they would revisit the image.”
    


            The school district sued the state in federal court in September 2023 in an attempt to keep the chief as its mascot, embarking on a subsequent legal battle that came to a head last month, with a judge dismissing the case. 



            In her March 27 ruling, the judge stated the plaintiff failed to support its claim. US District Court Chief Judge Margo K. Brodie gave Massapequa schools 30 days to modify its claim or face permanent closure of the case. On Friday, the judge granted the plaintiff's request for an extension, setting May 12 as the deadline to file an amended claim.
    


Trump weighed in on the matter on social media this week, voicing support for the school system in a region he comfortably won in 2024. He called the name change “ridiculous” and noted the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs aren't changing its name anytime soon.
    


            The president's support for the district is consistent with his stance against diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which has recently played out in his administration's crackdown on higher education institutions.
    


            “I agree with the people in Massapequa, Long Island, who are fighting furiously to keep the Massapequa Chiefs logo on their Teams and School,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “I am asking my highly capable Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, to fight for the people of Massapequa on this very important issue.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the US Department of Education for more on possible actions it may take.
    


            Trump addressed the issue again on Wednesday when asked about the NFL's Washington Commanders changing its name from the Washington Redskins, telling reporters it's “demeaning” and “degrading to the Indian populations” to “erase” a Native American name from sports teams and logos.
    


            In a joint statement, the Massapequa Board of Education referred to Trump's stance as “affirmation” of what the district was fighting for.
    


            “The Massapequa community has been working hard to preserve our identity and protect local decision-making. We are honored that President Trump has recognized our efforts and brought national attention to our cause,” read the statement. CNN has inquired if officials in Massapequa reached out to the president for assistance after the legal setback.
    


            The state education department has remained steadfast in its position insisting the 2023 regulation was adopted to prevent “demeaning Indigenous names and mascots in New York's public schools.”
    


            “It is ironic that the federal government now seeks to intervene on an issue that is squarely reserved to the States,” state education department spokesperson JP O'Hare said in a statement to CNN.
    


            The Massapequa school district, which serves around 6,500 students, led three other Long Island public school systems into civil court seeking to overturn the ban, arguing it constituted government overreach and violated the First Amendment.
    


            “The ‘Chiefs' mascot is not just a school sports mascot, it is a mindset that unifies the Massapequa community and encourages them to strive for excellence,” the lawsuit says.
    


            The suit referenced an April 18, 2023, letter to the Massapequa community stating the mascot “honors Chief (Sachem) Tackapausha, who, according to local history sources, sold the area now known as Massapequa Park to a group of settlers in 1658.”
    


            The letter also stated, “from our very name of Massapequa to the many historical plaques located throughout town, we pay our respects to 365 years of history.”
    


            The lawsuit notes that the name Massapequa itself “is derived from the Native American term “Marspeag” or “Mashpeag,” which translates to “great waterland.”
    


            O'Hare said Massapequa school officials “stayed silent during the regulatory process,” adding they did not reach out to Indigenous leaders or engage the department's Mascot Advisory Committee to determine whether its Native American team name and mascot would be permissible – which requires the approval of “local tribal leaders.”
    


            “Instead, Massapequa decided to pursue litigation challenging the State's regulations. Unsurprisingly, these cases have been dismissed,” O'Hare said in his statement to CNN.
    


            In their complaint, attorneys for the school district said, “Native American tribes and individuals cannot be the sole decision-makers on whether a school district's use of an Indigenous name, logo or mascot is legal or not.”
    


            Long Island is home to two recognized Indian tribes, the Shinnecock Nation and the Unkechaug Nation, which are based on two separate reservations east of Massapequa. CNN has reached out to representatives of both Nations for comment.
    


            In his statement, O'Hare quoted Germain Smith, former general council secretary of the Shinnecock Nation, as supporting the education department's position: “Speaking for myself as a tribal leader and as an Indigenous person, the message that is being sent by [the state regulations] is that we're not a symbol, we're not a mascot, we're not history. We're real people that are still here and still exist.”
    


            Drexler, the former Chiefs hockey player, was reluctant to get into the politics of it all. He focused on the appropriateness of the image, in particular the headdress, which he called, “the Hollywood romanticized image of the Native American.”

            Drexler said in 2000 he re-connected with his biological mother who informed him of his heritage. He is a member of the Chickasaw Nation.
    


            “I was adopted into White Jewish family only to find out at 35 that I was Native American…. I can't claim what it feels like to be Native American. I look like a typical White boy,” said Drexler, who works in commercial sales but spends time researching Indigenous history since his “life-changing moment.”
    


            While walking near the chief mural on Tuesday, Donna Schneider, said she agreed with fellow residents that the Chief logo should not be switched but she wished the White House would stay out of it. Schneider said she works with the Massapequa school district's administration department.
    


            “Don't get me started. He's got bigger fish to fry,” said Schneider, referring to the president. “I don't think this should be on his platform at all. I just don't think it's a Trump issue or presidential issue.”
    


            Back inside the barber shop, the president's attempt to intervene in the bitter battle between the district and the state was well-received.
    


            “I think it affects everybody. He represents us….I'm glad he's standing up for this,” Grimaldi said as he got his haircut.
    


            While the school district may ultimately lose the legal battle over its use of Chiefs, the associated image likely will remain a staple in the community: Tackapausha's profile adorns the Massapequa Chamber of Commerce welcome sign and is featured on its fire department's trucks and patches.

            One victim had recently returned home after decades working abroad to enjoy a retirement filled with travel and family time; another hoped the trip into the beauty of Indian-administered Kashmir would cheer the spirits of his semi-paralyzed wife.
    


            Both men were among 26 tourists shot dead by militants this week in a massacre that has ripped open old wounds between India and its neighbor Pakistan, tipping them a step closer to military escalation.
    


            Both countries claim Kashmir in its entirety, but each control only part. They have fought three wars over the territory – which is famous for its dramatic mountains and lush meadows – since their independence from Britain in 1947.
    


            A bloody, decades-long insurgency in India's part of the region has killed tens of thousands, waged by militant groups demanding either independence or a merger with Pakistan.
    


            India says those groups are supported by Pakistan, which Islamabad denies.
    


            Tuesday's attack – during which men were singled out and gunned down from close range, according to survivors' testimony – was the latest in a list of bloody incidents to stain the region.
    


            Balachandran Menonparambil feels as though he's lost his “right hand,” after his friend of six decades Ramachandran Narayanamenon was killed in the attack.
    


            Having spent decades working in Qatar, Narayanamenon “looked forward to a life of retirement,” according to his friend, who described him as “a happy man,” caring and reliable.
    


            “He was on a trip with his wife Shiela, daughter Aarti, and two grandchildren and was looking forward to enjoying himself with his grandchildren,” said the 70-year-old.
    


            He recalled how “excited” Narayanamenon, 69, sounded in their last call before he boarded the flight to Kashmir on Monday.
    


            A day later, Menonparambil was told that his friend was dead.
    


            “I was watching TV and they began to show what was happening in Kashmir… so I called him, but he did not pick up,” he said.
    


            He then reached out to Narayanamenon's son Arvind, who told him that “Dad is gone.”
    


            He said people came up to offer condolences to him at the cremation. “Everybody was asking me what I will do, only half of me is working now. I told them he is there with me in my heart,” he said.
    


            Other survivors speaking to local media said the gunmen accused some of the victims of supporting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
    


            In 2019, Modi's Hindu-nationalist government stripped Muslim-majority Kashmir of its previous autonomy, sparking protests.
    


            After Tuesday's massacre, New Delhi swiftly pointed the finger at Pakistan, downgrading ties and suspending its participation in a crucial water-sharing treaty. Pakistan has denied involvement and said any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to it would be considered an act of war.
    


            Kavita Lele lost her husband Sanjay, 50, and two cousins – Hemant Joshi, 45, and Atul Mone, 43 – in the attack, her brother-in-law Rajesh Kadam told CNN.
    


            All three men, described as “loving fathers” and family breadwinners, came from just outside the megacity of Mumbai. They had taken the trip to Pahalgam together, according to Kadam.
    


            Sanjay and Hemant were both accountants working for small private firms, while Atul worked for the Indian Railways, he said.
    


            For the Leles, Kadam said, the trip was long planned. His sister-in-law suffers from a form of paralysis on the left side of her body that means she walks with difficulty.

            “They had been planning this trip for a while but because of her health issues… it had gotten postponed. Once her health was doing better, they finally all lined up their schedules and managed to go,” he said.
    


            “Lele told his wife that if you won't go, none of us will go. So she agreed and finally they all went,” said Kadam.
    


            Kadam himself did not go on the trip, but later traveled to Kashmir to help bring the shell-shocked survivors from his family back home.
    


            The holidaying family bought food from a stall not long before the attack. Unaccustomed to the realities of the restive region, they initially mistook the sound of gunfire for fireworks, Kadam said, but were warned to take shelter by locals who sensed danger.
    


            All three men were shot shortly after, he said. A bullet grazed his 20-year-old nephew Harshal's hand.
    


            It took almost four hours for disabled Kavita to struggle down the hill to safety, he said.
    


            He said the families have taken hope from protests in India demanding justice for the victims and their families.
    


            Still, their lives have been changed forever.
    


            “This is not something that can end,” he said.
    


            “We have to now live with this.”

TORONTO (AP) — Canadians will vote for a new government on Monday in an election that has been upended by U.S. President Donald Trump ‘s trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state.

Prime Minister Mark Carney and the governing Liberal Party appeared poised for a historic election defeat until Trump slapped heavy tariffs on Canada and began threatening its sovereignty. 

Trump's attacks have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips to their southern neighbor and avoiding buying American goods when they can. The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberals' poll numbers.

The opposition Conservative Party had hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity cratered as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.

Voters nationwide will elect all 343 member of the House of Commons, one for each constituency. There are no primaries or runoffs — just a single round of voting.

Like the U.K., Canada uses a “first-past-the-post” voting system, meaning the candidate who finishes first in each constituency will be elected, even if they don't get 50% of the vote.

This has generally cemented the dominance of the two largest parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, because it's difficult for smaller parties to win seats unless they have concentrated support in particular areas.




The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.

Carney replaced Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader, Carney, on March 9.

Carney was sworn in as Canada's 24th prime minister on March 14. He hopes to retain the job and avoid becoming one of Canada's shortest-serving prime ministers.

Carney, 60, is one of the two main candidates. He successfully navigated financial crises when he headed the Bank of Canada and later ran the Bank of England, becoming the first non-U.K. citizen to do so since its 1694 founding.

A highly educated economist, Carney worked for 13 years for Goldman Sachs in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He has financial industry and public service credentials.

Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney's main challenger. He and the party seemed headed for a big victory in the election until Trump's near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them.

Poilievre, 45, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put “Canada first.” For years his party's go-to attack dog, he frequently criticizes the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada's public broadcaster. 

There are two other parties that have official status in Parliament. If the Liberals or Conservatives secure the most seats in the House of Commons but fail to win a majority, they would need to rely on either the New Democrats, a progressive party, or the separatist Quebec party Bloc Québécois to pass legislation.

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will return on Saturday to the secluded sultanate of Oman, where experts on both sides will start hammering out the technical details of a possible deal. 

The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on half a century of enmity. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.

Neither Iran nor the U.S. has offered any explanation on why the talks will return to Muscat, the Omani capital nestled in the Hajar Mountains. Oman has been a mediator between Tehran and Washington. Last weekend's talks in Rome offered a more-equal flight distance between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who are leading the negotiations. 

But Rome remains in mourning after the death of Pope Francis, whose funeral will be held on Saturday. And Iranian state television, in covering last weekend's talks, complained at length on air about the “paparazzi” gathered across the street from the Omani Embassy in Rome's Camilluccia neighborhood.

Araghchi himself took time out Friday night to sign copies of his latest memoir, “The Power of Negotiation,” at the Muscat International Book Fair. But he found himself swarmed by cameras even in the Omani capital, showing the intense international interest in the talks. 

Asked by The Associated Press about the negotiations on Saturday, Aragchi simply replied: “I'm here for the book.”

The Muscat talks come as Iran appears to have lined up Chinese and Russian support. Araghchi traveled to Moscow last week and this week visited Beijing. 

On Thursday, Chinese, Iranian and Russian representatives met the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that likely will verify compliance with any accord like it did with Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. That deal included China and Russia, as well as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in addition to Iran and the U.S. 

However, Iran has greatly restricted the IAEA's inspections — leading to fears internationally that centrifuges and other nuclear material could be diverted for non-peaceful purposes. 

The IAEA offered no readout from the talks, but China's state-run Xinhua news agency on Friday described the three nations as saying the agency has “the necessary potential and expertise to contribute constructively to this process.” 

“China, Russia and Iran emphasized that political and diplomatic engagement based on mutual respect remains the only viable and practical path for resolving the Iran nuclear issue,” the report said. It added that China respects Iran's “right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”

The Trump administration has kept France, Germany and the U.K. out of its direct negotiations with Iran, something similarly reflected in Witkoff's negotiations with Russia over ending its war on Ukraine. Witkoff traveled Friday to Moscow ahead of Saturday's meeting in Muscat. 

Araghchi meanwhile has said he's open to visiting Berlin, London and Paris to discuss the negotiations. 

“The ball is now in the E3's court,” Araghchi wrote on the social platform X on Thursday, using an acronym for the countries. “They have an opportunity to do away with the grip of Special Interest groups and forge a different path.”

From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi will lead Tehran's expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.

The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America's efforts in the 2015 talks. 

He was an early supporter of Trump, describing the 2016 election as a “charge the cockpit or you die” vote. “A Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto,” Anton wrote. “With Trump, at least you can spin the cylinder and take your chances.” He also criticized “Iran sycophancy” in the same essay.

Rubio, speaking on a podcast released this week, also kept up a Trump line that Iran needed to stop its enrichment of uranium entirely.

“If Iran wants a civil nuclear program, they can have one just like many other countries can have one, and that is they import enriched material,” Rubio said.

However, former CIA director Bill Burns, who took part in the secret negotiations that led to the 2015 nuclear deal, expressed skepticism Iran would give up its program like Libya did in 2003. 

“I don't personally think that this Iranian regime is going to agree to ... zero domestic enrichment,” Burns said in a talk Monday at the University of Chicago. “To hold out for the Libya model is virtually to ensure that you're not going to be able to reach an agreement.” 

But Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. Witkoff also has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. 

Meanwhile, one more wildcard is Israel, whose devastating war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip grinds on. Trump initially announced the Iran talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his side. But Israel, which for years has targeted Iran's nuclear program with attacks on its facilities and scientists, has kept open the possibility of airstrikes to destroy Tehran's enrichment sites. 

On Monday, Israel's military conducted drills preparing for possible new Iranian missile attacks, the country's public broadcaster KAN reported. Araghchi has described Iranian security services as being “on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.”

However, Iranians on Friday in Tehran remained hopeful the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows.

“It's OK to negotiate, to make the nuclear program smaller or bigger, and reach a deal,” Tehran resident Farzin Keivan said. “Of course we shouldn't give them everything. After all, we've suffered a lot for this program.”

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will move Saturday in Oman to what's known as the “expert level” — a sign analysts say shows that the talks are moving forward rapidly. 

However, experts not involved in the talks who spoke with The Associated Press warn that this doesn't necessarily signal a deal is imminent. Instead, it means that the talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff haven't broken down at what likely is the top-level trade — Tehran limiting its atomic program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. 

“Agreeing to technical talks suggests both sides are expressing pragmatic, realistic objectives for the negotiations and want to explore the details,” said Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association who long has studied Iran's nuclear program. 

“If Witkoff was making maximalist demands during his talks with Araghchi, such as dismantlement of the enrichment program, Iran would have no incentive to meet at the technical level.”

That technical level, however, remains filled with possible landmines. Just how much enrichment by Iran would be comfortable for the United States? What about Tehran's ballistic missile program, which U.S. President Donald Trump first cited in pulling America unilaterally out of the accord in 2018? Which sanctions could be lifted and which would be remain in place on the Islamic Republic? 




“The most important determinant of expert talks' value lies in whether there is a political commitment to do something and experts just need to figure out what,” said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who worked on Iran sanctions while at the U.S. State Department during negotiations over what became the 2015 nuclear deal.

“If the experts also have to discuss big concepts, without political agreement, it can just result in spun wheels.”

The 2015 nuclear deal saw senior experts involved in both sides of the deal. For the U.S. under President Barack Obama, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz reached an understanding working with Ali Akbar Salehi, then the leader of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Both men's technical background proved key to nailing down the specifics of the deal. 

Under the 2015 agreement, Iran agreed to enrich uranium only to 3.67% purity and keep a stockpile of only 300 kilograms (661 pounds). Today, Iran enriches some uranium up to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency put Iran's overall uranium stockpile in February at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds). 

The deal also limited the types of centrifuges Iran could spin, further slowing Tehran's ability to rush for a bomb, if it chose to do so. It also set out the provisions of how and when sanctions would be lifted, as well as time limits for the accord itself. 

Reaching limits, relief and timelines require the knowledge of experts, analysts say.

“A nonproliferation agreement is meaningless if it cannot be effectively implemented and verified,” Davenport said. “The United States needs a strong technical team to negotiate the detailed restrictions and intrusive monitoring that will be necessary to ensure any move by Iran toward nuclear weapons is quickly detected and there is sufficient time to respond.” 

The U.S. expert team will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi will lead Tehran's expert team. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.

Both the Americans and the Iranians have been tightlipped over exactly what's been discussed so far, though both sides have expressed optimism about the pace. However, there has been one noticeable dispute stemming from comments Witkoff made in a television interview, suggesting Tehran could be able to enrich up to 3.67% purity. However, analysts noted that was the level set by the 2015 deal under Obama.

Witkoff hours later issued a statement suggesting that comparison struck a nerve: “A deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.”

“Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,” Witkoff added. 

Araghchi responded by warning that Iran must be able to enrich.

“The core issue of enrichment itself is not negotiable,” he said.

Despite that, experts who spoke to the AP said they remained positive about the talks' trajectory so far. 

“Although still early stages, I'm encouraged so far,” said Alan Eyre, a former U.S. diplomat once involved in past nuclear negotiations with Tehran. “The pace of negotiations ... is good.” 

He added that so far, there didn't appear to be any “mutually exclusive red lines” for the talks as well — signaling there likely wasn't immediately any roadblocks to reaching a deal. 

Nephew similarly described reaching the expert level as a “positive sign.” However, he cautioned that the hard work potentially was just beginning for the negotiations. 

“They imply the need to get into real details, to discuss concepts that senior (officials) might not understand and to answer questions. I also think too much can be read into them starting,” Nephew said. “Expert talks can sometimes be a fudge for seniors to avoid working on tough issues — ‘let's have experts discuss it while we move on to other things' — or to sidestep big political decisions.”

Corey Hinderstein, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former U.S. government nuclear expert, described herself as feeling “cautious optimism” over the expert talks beginning. 

“Heads of delegation are responsible for setting strategic goals and defining success,” she said. “But if there is a deal to be made, the technical experts are the ones who will get it done.”

Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, has died by suicide.

Her death was reported by NBC News and announced by her family. She was 41 years old and died in Neergabby, Australia, where she had lived for several years.

“It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,” Giuffre's family said in a statement to NBC News. “She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.”

“Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors,” they added. “In the end, the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.”

Giuffre met Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell as a teenager in 1999. She groomed Giuffre, who was then underage, to service Epstein and his other associates sexually from that time until 2002. She alleged that Epstein forced her to have sex with him and other high-profile men, including Prince Andrew.

Giuffre met her husband, Robert Giuffre, while on an assignment to bring a girl back from Thailand in 2002. The two quickly married and she ended her association with Epstein.

She first came forward publicly with her accusations in 2011. She founded the nonprofit group Victims Refuse Silence, relaunched as Speak Out, Act, Reclaim, or SOAR, in 2021. She settled a lawsuit against Andrew in February 2022, which involved an apology for his association with Epstein and the treatment of Giuffre. He also sent a “substantial donation” of unknown value to Giuffre's charity.

Giuffre is survived by three children. She separated from her husband in 2023 and told People earlier this month that he had abused her for years. Her brother, Sky Roberts, alleged she almost died as a result of a physical assault in January.

On March 30, Giuffre posted a picture of herself badly bruised on Instagram, the result of a car crash involving a school bus. She said doctors gave her four days to live.

“I've gone into kidney renal failure, they've given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology. I'm ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time, but you know what they say about wishes. S*** in one hand and wish in the other & I guarantee it's still going to be s*** at the end of the day. Thank you all for being the wonderful people of the world and for being a great part of my life. Godbless you all xx Virginia,” she said.

PRINCE ANDREW REACHES SETTLEMENT IN VIRGINIA GIUFFRE LAWSUIT

Her brother, Danny Wilson, told NBC News that her suicide was likely motivated by a combination of physical pain from the crash and psychological pain from past abuse.

“Her biggest push was, ‘If I don't do this, nobody's going to do it,'” he said, referring to her advocacy. “She was in real physical pain — suffered from renal failure. But I think that the mental pain was worse.”

Agents arrested former Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, at their home Thursday.

A former New Mexico judge and his wife allegedly tried to hide incriminating images and videos of an illegal immigrant believed to be a member of Venezuela's notorious Tren de Aragua gang and harbored other migrants, the Justice Department said Friday.

Former Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano, 68, and his wife, Nancy Cano, 67, were arrested Thursday after federal agents raided their Las Cruces home. The pair face charges of evidence tampering amid allegations they harbored Cristhian Ortega-Lopez.

"Judges are responsible for upholding our country's laws. It is beyond egregious for a former judge and his wife to engage in evidence tampering on behalf of a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member accused of illegally possessing firearms," said U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison. 

"The U.S. Attorney's Office is committed to dismantling this foreign terrorist organization by disrupting its criminal operations in New Mexico. That starts by prosecuting those who support gang members — including judges."

Ortega-Lopez was put on the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) radar after a tipster said he was in the U.S. illegally and had guns. He initially entered the country Dec. 15, 2023, near Eagle Pass, Texas. He was taken into custody and released due to overcrowding at the U.S. Border Patrol facility.

Ortega-Lopez apparently posted multiple images and videos on social media showing him with other illegal immigrants handling guns at a shooting range in Las Cruces, federal prosecutors said. Among the weapons were a SIG Sauer P365 pistol, an AR-15 rifle equipped with a suppressor and other high-powered guns and ammunition.

His social media activity revealed content suggesting ties with the Venezuelan gang, including gang-related tattoos, hand gestures and clothing, prosecutors said. He also mocked a $5,000 reward to catch TdA members, Attorney General Pam Bondi said. 

Among the images were also two people who were decapitated, she said. 

In January, federal agents received a tip that Ortega-Lopez was living with other illegal immigrants on a property belonging to Cano, who was still a judge at the time, and his wife. 

Authorities seized four guns during a Feb. 28 search of the property.

(U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement )

The four guns, along with three cellphones belonging to Ortega-Lopez, were seized, and he was arrested. During the search, Ortega-Lopez was allowed to make a phone call before being taken to the Doña Ana County Detention Center (DACDC). 

He told the agents that the phone he wanted to use was not among the devices recovered. Video calls from DACDC later showed Nancy Cano holding a black iPhone believed to be Ortega's fourth phone, prosecutors said.

During a March 7 call with Ortega-Lopez, Nancy Cano allegedly used the device to contact someone named "Michelle" via WhatsApp, before facilitating a FaceTime call between Michelle and Ortega-Lopez using her personal phone.

In an April 20 call, Nancy Cano and Ortega-Lopez discussed deleting his Facebook account, which he allegedly used to share incriminating content, including gang affiliations and images with guns.

On April 24, federal agents searched the Cano home to locate Ortega-Lopez's missing phone. During questioning, Joel Cano admitted smashing the device with a hammer five weeks earlier because he believed it contained incriminating photos and videos of Ortega-Lopez with guns, and throwing it into a dumpster, said Bondi. 

A forensic analysis of the recovered phones revealed messages linked to Ortega's alleged criminal activities, including links with the TdA gang and images of him with guns, authorities said. 

Joel and Nancy Cano face up to 15 years in prison.

"The rule of law is very simple: It doesn't matter what line of work you're in. If you break the law, we will follow the facts, and we will prosecute you," Bondi said in a video message Friday.

Another judge arrested for allegedly interfering in the arrest of an illegal immigrant in Wisconsin also faces federal charges. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, 65, allegedly confronted federal agents inside a courthouse April 18 and ordered them to leave as they were trying to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican citizen who was previously deported and recently charged with multiple counts of domestic abuse-related battery.

Flores-Ruiz allegedly punched a man 30 times and struck a woman, Bondi said. Both victims were in court when Dugan learned that ICE was outside to arrest him.

"After being made aware of a valid immigration arrest warrant, Judge Dugan told agents that they needed a judicial warrant and demanded that they go to the Chief Judge's office, the Justice Department said in a news release Friday. "Once the agents were no longer in the vicinity of her courtroom, Judge Dugan allegedly elected not to conduct a hearing on Flores-Ruiz's criminal case despite the fact that victims of his offense were present and instead personally escorted Flores-Ruiz and his attorney through a restricted ‘jury door' exit not typically used by defendants or attorneys."

The doorway led to a nonpublic hallway, which Flores-Ruiz and his attorney used to leave Dugan's courtroom, prosecutors said. He was eventually arrested outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase. 

Dugan is charged with obstruction of proceedings before a department or agency of the United States and concealing a person to prevent arrest. She faces up to six years in prison.

Flores-Ruiz was previously deported in 2013 and reentered the U.S. illegally, authorities said. 

"Sanctuary jurisdictions that shield criminal aliens endanger American communities," said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. "This Justice Department will not stand by as local officials put politics over public safety. Reckless sanctuary city policies create a sanctuary for one class — criminals. Those days are over."

Canada's Election:

Mark Carney

Mark Carney said he expects US President Donald Trump will try to extract “major concessions” from Canada in negotiations, and that he takes seriously the president's stated desire to turn the country into a US state. 

“Take what the president says literally. I take it literally. I always have,” the Canadian prime minister told reporters on the final weekend before national elections.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday floated the possibility of stronger sanctions on Moscow and questioned whether Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to "stop the war" against Ukraine.

Trump's social media post about Putin came just after he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met in Rome for their first in-person session since an Oval Office sitdown that devolved into a shouting match. They met just before the funeral of Pope Francis.

"There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days," Trump wrote on Truth Social. Vice President JD Vance posted Trump's statement on his X account. 

"It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through "Banking" or "Secondary Sanctions?" Too many people are dying!!!" Trump said.

The White House said that Trump and Zelenskyy "had a very productive discussion," but did not include additional details on what was discussed.

Zelensky said that it was a "good meeting," adding: "Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results."

Trump's remarks come as he's increasing pressure for the two countries to strike a peace deal. Earlier this week, Trump presented the two countries with an offer to end the war. The deal reportedly included, in part, recognition of Crimea under Russian control, which Zelenskyy has repeatedly said is a red line.

In his Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump said Russia stole Crimea from Ukraine, a rare acknowledgement from the U.S. president that Russia illegally annexed the region.

Trump took aim at former U.S. President Barack Obama and suggested that he "made it possible for Russia to steal Crimea from Ukraine without even a shot being fired."

Trump told TIME earlier this month that "Crimea will stay with Russia," adding: "Zelenskyy understands that, and everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time. It's been with them long before Trump came along."

After his comments, Zelenskyy reiterated that Crimea belongs to Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Trump said Friday that Russia and Ukraine are "very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to 'finish it off.' "

He wrote on Truth Social that "most of the major points are agreed to."

OKLAHOMA CITY — Amazon and Nvidia told a room of oil and gas executives this week that all options are on the table to power artificial intelligence including fossil fuels such as natural gas.

The tech and energy industries gathered in Oklahoma City at the Hamm Institute for American Energy to discuss how the U.S. can meet the growing energy needs for AI data centers. 

The Big Tech companies have invested mostly in renewable power in an effort to slash their carbon dioxide emissions, but they are now navigating a changed political environment. President Donald Trump has ditched U.S. commitments to fight climate change as he seeks to increase fossil fuel production, particularly natural gas.

There is now growing public acknowledgment from the tech industry that gas will be needed, at least in the near term, to help fuel AI.

"To have the energy we need for the grid, it's going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time," Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, said during a panel discussion Thursday. "We're not surprised by the fact that we're going to need to add some thermal generation to meet the needs in the short term."

Amazon remains focused on slashing its carbon emissions, Miller said. It is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy and is investing in advanced nuclear and carbon capture technology to reduce the environmental impact of its energy consumption, the executive said.

But those advanced technologies will not come online until the 2030s and Amazon needs steady and secure power now, Miller said.

"We're very explicit that meeting customers' demands for capacity is first and foremost in our priority list, and so having access to power is first and foremost what we focus on," Miller said. "And we have a goal to be net-zero carbon as a company by 2040 and are very focused on that."

Nvidia is also focused on environmental impact but wants "all options on the table" as AI faces an energy crunch, said Josh Parker, the chipmaker's senior director of corporate sustainability.

"At the end of the day, we need power. We just need power," Parker said at the panel. "We have some customers who really prioritize the clean energy, and some customers who don't care as much," the executive said.

Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark called for data center developers to be realistic about the energy sources that are currently available. Anthropic estimates that 50 gigawatts of new power is needed by 2027, equivalent to about 50 nuclear reactors. AI demand can help drive the development of "new and novel sources" of power over the longer term, he said.

The idea of using coal, however, was met with unease. Trump recently signed an order that aims to boost coal production, citing demand from AI. The Amazon and Nvidia executives did not answer directly when asked during the panel whether they thought coal had a role play in powering AI.

"You have a broader set of options than just coal," Clark said. "We would certainly consider it, but I don't think I'd say it's at the top of our list."

Is a recession brewing in row 33?

Airline CEOs this month warned Wall Street that passengers' appetite for domestic trips is coming in lighter than they had hoped when they set forecasts high at the start of 2025.

On a series of earnings calls, they said the reasons range from President Donald Trump's whipsawing tariff policies to volatile markets and, most notably, economic uncertainty.

"Nobody really relishes uncertainty when they're talking about what they could do on a vacation and spend hard-earned dollars," American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said on a quarterly earnings call on Thursday. 

That means airlines have too many seats on their hands — again. Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines said they will cut back their capacity growth plans after what they still hope to be a strong summer travel season.

Delta, Southwest, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines pulled their 2025 financial outlooks this month, saying the U.S. economy is too tough to predict right now. United Airlines provided two outlooks, one if if the U.S. falls into a recession and said it expects to be profitable in either scenario.

That is leading to cheaper plane tickets. Airfare fell 5.3% in March from last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest data. Easter, a peak travel period that coincides with many school vacations, fell in March of last year, though fares also dropped 4% in February this year.

Adding to pressure, executives said, is slower-than-expected growth from corporate travel, which is facing the same challenges many households are. Government travel plunged, too, amid the Trump administration's cost cuts and mass layoffs this year.

"If uncertainty pops up, the first thing that goes away is corporate travel," said Conor Cunningham a travel and transportation analyst at Melius Research .

Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on April 9 that corporate travel was trending up 10% year on year at the start of 2025, but that growth has since flattened. 

Business travel is key to major carriers because those customers are less price-sensitive and often book last minute when tickets are likely to be more expensive.

The overhang of seats in the domestic skies is forcing airlines to cut prices to fill their planes.

Alaska Airlines warned Wednesday that weaker-than-expected demand will likely eat into second-quarter earnings. Chief Financial Officer Shane Tackett told CNBC that demand has not plunged, but the carrier has lowered some fares to fill seats.

"The fares aren't as strong as they were in the fourth quarter of last year and coming into January and first part of February," Tackett said in an interview Wednesday. "Demand is still quite high for the industry, but it's just not at the peak that we all anticipated might continue coming out of last year."

At the front of the plane, executives say demand is holding up far better, while U.S.-based customers are still flying overseas in droves.

But lingering concerns are still weighing on the industry.

"Certainty will restore the economy, and I think it will restore it pretty quickly," Isom said.

Inventor James Dyson is famous for his namesake vacuums which use his patented cyclone technology. His net worth is $16.8 billion per Bloomberg's Billionaire Index.

But he says that, "mine is a life of failure."

In a video interview with The Wall Street Journal published Saturday. Dyson — who said he created 5,127 prototypes over five years before launching his bagless vacuum cleaner in 1993 — said that embracing failure was essential to life.

"It's true for writers and filmmakers and all sorts of people. It's a life of failure. It takes a long time before you find the one that works," he said. "You just have to get used to that."

Dyson, 77, said he enjoyed the misfires and struggles he's had across his career, saying that real wisdom comes from experience.

"At school, you're taught to get the answer right the first time," he said. While a clever student may get to the answer quickly, he said, they are at a disadvantage to those who take their time getting to an answer, as they haven't "viscerally experienced failure and overcoming failure."

For Dyson, resilience and adaptability are some of the most important skills someone can learn. "Life is about making things work," he said.

He continued: "That's what you have to do. It's trial and error. When something works, it's less challenging, it's less interesting."

Aside from the many prototypes it took him to invent the first vacuum with his namesake brand, Dyson famously abandoned plans to enter the electric car market in 2019 after spending more than $600 million on developing a vehicle that he came to realize was not commercially viable.

"The route to success is never linear. This is not the first project which has changed direction and it will not be the last," he wrote in a letter announcing the decision.

He said of his scrapped EV vehicle, "I could see that it was just too risky."

A growing number of Americans are using buy now, pay later loans to buy groceries, and more people are paying those bills late, according to new Lending Tree data released Friday. 

The figures are the latest indicator that some consumers are cracking under the pressure of an uncertain economy and are having trouble affording essentials such as groceries as they contend with persistent inflation, high interest rates and concerns around tariffs. 

In a survey conducted April 2-3 of 2,000 U.S. consumers ages 18 to 79, around half reported having used buy now, pay later services. Of those consumers, 25% of respondents said they were using BNPL loans to buy groceries, up from 14% in 2024 and 21% in 2023, the firm said.

Meanwhile, 41% of respondents said they made a late payment on a BNPL loan in the past year, up from 34% in the year prior, the survey found.

Lending Tree's chief consumer finance analyst, Matt Schulz, said that of those respondents who said they paid a BNPL bill late, most said it was by no more than a week or so.

"A lot of people are struggling and looking for ways to extend their budget," Schulz said. "Inflation is still a problem. Interest rates are still really high. There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs and other economic issues, and it's all going to add up to a lot of people looking for ways to extend their budget however they can."

"For an awful lot of people, that's going to mean leaning on buy now, pay later loans, for better or for worse," he said. 

He stopped short of calling the results a recession indicator but said conditions are expected to decline further before they get better.  

"I do think it's going to get worse, at least in the short term," said Schulz. "I don't know that there's a whole lot of reason to expect these numbers to get better in the near term."

The loans, which allow consumers to split up purchases into several smaller payments, are a popular alternative to credit cards because they often don't charge interest. But consumers can see high fees if they pay late, and they can run into problems if they stack up multiple loans. In Lending Tree's survey, 60% of BNPL users said they've had multiple loans at once, with nearly a fourth saying they have held three or more at once. 

"It's just really important for people to be cautious when they use these things, because even though they can be a really good interest-free tool to help you kind of make it from one paycheck to the next, there's also a lot of risk in mismanaging it," said Schulz. "So people should tread lightly." 

Lending Tree's findings come after Billboard revealed that about 60% of general admission Coachella attendees funded their concert tickets with buy now, pay later loans, sparking a debate on the state of the economy and how consumers are using debt to keep up their lifestyles. A recent announcement from DoorDash that it would begin accepting BNPL financing from Klarna for food deliveries led to widespread mockery and jokes that Americans were struggling so much that they were now being forced to finance cheeseburgers and burritos.

Over the last few years, consumers have held up relatively well, even in the face of persistent inflation and high interest rates, because the job market was strong and wage growth had kept up with inflation — at least for some workers. 

Earlier this year, however, large companies including Walmart and Delta Airlines began warning that the dynamic had begun to shift and they were seeing cracks in demand, which was leading to worse-than-expected sales forecasts.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, met one-on-one in a marble-lined Vatican basilica on Saturday to try to revive faltering efforts to end Russia's war with Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said the meeting could prove historic if it delivers the kind of peace he is hoping for, and a White House spokesman called it "very productive."

The two leaders, leaning in close to each other with no aides around them while seated in St Peter's Basilica, spoke for about 15 minutes, according to Zelenskyy's office, which also released photographs of the meeting.

The meeting at the Vatican, their first since an angry encounter in the Oval Office in Washington in February, comes at a critical time in negotiations aimed at bringing an end to fighting between Ukraine and Russia.

In a post on social media platform Telegram, Zelenskyy wrote: "Good meeting. One-on-one, we managed to discuss a lot. We hope for a result from all the things that were spoken about."

He said those topics included: "The protection of the lives of our people. A complete and unconditional ceasefire. A reliable and lasting peace that will prevent a recurrence of war."

Zelenskyy added: "It was a very symbolic meeting that has the potential to become historic if we achieve joint results. Thank you, President Donald Trump!"

Steven Cheung, White House communications director, said the two leaders had met privately and had "a very productive discussion. More details about the meeting will follow."

A Zelenskyy spokesman had earlier said aides to the two leaders were working on arrangements for a follow-up meeting in Rome later on Saturday. However, Trump's aircraft departed Rome with no word on the second meeting. It was not clear if it had taken place.

In one photograph released by Zelenskyy's office, the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders sat opposite each other in a hall of the basilica, around two feet apart, and were leaning in towards each other in conversation. No aides could be seen in the image.

In a second photograph, from the same location, Zelenskyy, Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were shown standing in a tight huddle. Macron had his hand on Zelenskiy's shoulder.

After Trump and Zelenskyy met in the basilica, the two men joined other world leaders outside in Saint Peter's Square at the funeral service for Pope Francis, who made the pursuit of peace, including in Ukraine, a motif of his papacy.

Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who gave the sermon at the funeral service, recalled how Pope Francis did not stop raising his voice to call for negotiations to end conflicts.

"War always leaves the world worse than it was before: it is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone," the cardinal said.

Trump, who has been pressing both sides to agree to a ceasefire, said on Friday that there had been productive talks between his envoy and the Russian leadership in Moscow, and called for a high-level meeting between Kyiv and Moscow to close a deal.

Trump had previously warned his administration would walk away from its efforts to achieve a peace if the two sides do not agree to a deal soon.

After a round of shuttle diplomacy this week, differences have emerged between the position of the Trump White House on peace talks and the stance of Ukraine and its European allies, according to documents from the talks obtained by Reuters.

Washington is proposing a legal recognition that Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014, is Russian territory, something that Kyiv and its allies in Europe say is a red line they will not cross.

There are also differences on how quickly sanctions on Russia would be lifted if a peace deal was signed, what kind of security guarantees Ukraine would have, and how Ukraine would be financially compensated.

Trump and Zelenskyy have had a rocky personal relationship. At their Oval Office meeting, Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of "gambling with World War Three."

Since then, Kyiv has tried to repair relations, but the barbs have continued. Zelenskyy has said Trump was trapped in a "disinformation bubble" that favored Moscow, while the U.S. leader accused Zelenskyy of foot-dragging on a peace deal and making "inflammatory" statements.

But the two men need each other. Trump requires Zelenskyy's buy-in to achieve his stated ambition of bringing a swift peace between Russia and Ukraine, while Kyiv needs Trump to pressure Moscow into diluting some of the more onerous conditions it has set for a truce.

At the Oval Office meeting in February, a reporter who was present from a conservative U.S. news network accused Zelenskyy of disrespecting the occasion by not wearing a suit.

Zelenskyy, since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, has eschewed suits in favor of military-style attire, saying it is his way of showing solidarity with his countryman fighting to defend Ukraine.

In Rome on Saturday, Zelenskyy again decided against a suit, and instead wore a dark shirt, buttoned up to the neck with no tie, and wore a dark military-style jacket over the top of that.

Gold is going up because all the bad things that could happen seem to be happening at once. 

 Maybe you need more gold?

 If you haven't got a basement full of bullion, you'll be feeling a bit left out by now. The price of gold is up 43% in the last year, 26% year-to-date and 10% in the last month. That's a lot in a very short time, but it makes perfect sense (to us at least).

Elon Musk's xAI Holdings is in discussions with investors to raise about $20 billion, Bloomberg News reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The funding would value the company at over $120 billion, according to the report.

Musk was looking to assign "proper value" to xAI, sources told CNBC's David Faber earlier this month. The remarks were made during a call with xAI investors, sources familiar with the matter told Faber. The Tesla CEO at that time didn't explicitly mention any upcoming funding round, but the sources suggested xAI was preparing for a substantial capital raise in the near future.

The funding amount could be more than $20 billion as the exact figure had not been decided, the Bloomberg report added.

Artificial intelligence startup xAI didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment outside of U.S. business hours.

The AI firm last month acquired X in an all-stock deal that valued xAI at $80 billion and the social media platform at $33 billion.

"xAI and X's futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent," Musk said on X, announcing the deal. "This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach."

Gaming tokens have seemingly been on the sidelines since the 2021 crypto boom. In fact, data from SoSoValue shows that they were the worst-performing crypto basket over the last 12-month period, enduring a 62% drop in the period, compared to a 174% rise on PayFi tokens.

However, under the Trump administration's crypto-friendly stance, it might be changing.

Gala Games—a blockchain-based gaming platform—says it became the first crypto gaming company to partner with the White House, bringing a Web3 game Easter Egg Hunt to the 2025 Easter Egg Roll. White House official X's account also mentioned on the social media platform about the tie-up amid a plethora of other collaborations with tech giants.

The GALA token has risen roughly 18% since the announcement, GameFi tokens went up 13%, and the broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, rose 8%.

The effort aimed to introduce blockchain to families without overwhelming them. 

The game, hosted at easter.gala.games, offered a "free and simple" experience where players collected virtual eggs to win unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) stored on GalaChain, Gala's proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, the company said in an announcement shared with CoinDesk.

Players were able to log in, explore, and collect eggs without needing a crypto wallet experience, Gala Games said. Every NFT reward was stored on GalaChain, hinting at future use across Gala's entertainment projects, including Gala Music and Gala Film.

The Web3 gaming firm told CoinDesk that over 300,000 games have been played since the event launched, with about 100,000 new accounts created. Roughly 17% of participants went on to explore Gala's other projects, suggesting real user engagement beyond the Easter event.

The project, founded in 2019 by Zynga co-founder Eric Schiermeyer, has been laying the groundwork for broader adoption through partnerships with DreamWorks Animation, NBCUniversal, and collaborations with artists like Snoop Dogg. Earlier this month, Gala Film announced a partnership with LG Electronics to bring Web3 entertainment to TVs, and the company hinted it is working with a government agency on transparency efforts.

The Easter game marks a real-world test for the project and the broader GameFi sector. 

When asked about the lead-up to the event, Schiermeyer shared that the project has been focusing on the high-level tie-up. "We have a team dedicated to government outreach," they said. "I also spent time at Mar-a-Lago and spoke with the President. But mainly we wanted to help make the event more fun, and I think that sentiment was well received."

Industry reactions were mixed. Some praised the visibility, while others pointed out that more work is needed for the mass adoption of the GameFi industry.  

Jack O'Holleran, CEO of SKALE Labs, told CoinDesk that GameFi has never stopped expanding, but its issue has been visibility instead. The technology, on top of that, has matured. "In the past, you needed to manage your own crypto wallets and pay high gas fees just to play," he said. "Now, gas-free blockchains and seamless onboarding remove those barriers."

“Functional values and utility that blockchain brings to gaming cannot be suppressed for much longer," he added. 

Still, a broader adoption of the GameFi sector will require further meaningful collaboration with mainstream gaming outlets. This could potentially open the “floodgates," O'Holleran added, as player bases for the traditional gaming sector are far beyond the crypto sector's user count. If so, the “floodgates will be open.” 

Meanwhile, Mitja Goroshevsky, co-founder of Gosh, praised the visibility of Gala Games and the GameFi sector via the White House tie-up but warned that the industry must still solve its identity crisis. 

"It's caught between being about gaming and being about trading," he said.

"Until blockchain games introduce fundamentally new experiences, government partnerships alone won't drive mass adoption."

The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on Saturday partnered with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by United States President Donald Trump, to advance cryptocurrency applications and boost blockchain adoption.

Trump and his affiliates hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, which launched last year. The US president has promised to regulate the industry favourably and his administration has eased enforcement actions against several big industry players.

A press release from the finance ministry said a WLF delegation visited Islamabad today and signed a letter of intent with the PCC. The delegation comprised Zachary Folkman, Chase Herro and Zachary Witkoff, the son of Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.

“[The] WLF … has signed a landmark Letter of Intent with the PCC to accelerate blockchain innovation, stablecoin adoption and decentralised finance integration across Pakistan,” the press release reads.

It added that the delegation met the prime minister, chief of army staff, deputy prime minister, information and defence ministers to formalise cooperation, “marking a major step toward positioning Pakistan as a global leader in the digital finance revolution”.

The statement said the government has signalled plans to announce comprehensive crypto legalisation policies soon, to bolster “Pakistan's position as one of the fastest-growing crypto markets in the world”.

The letter was signed during a meeting between the WLF and the PCC, which was attended by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb via video link. PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the State Bank governor were also present.

“The scope of cooperation between [the] PCC and WLF outlines collaboration in key areas including: launching regulatory sandboxes for blockchain financial product testing; facilitating the responsible growth of DeFi (decentralised finance) protocols; exploring [the] tokenisation of real-world assets like real estate and commodities; expanding stablecoin applications for remittances and trade; and providing strategic advisory on blockchain infrastructure and global regulatory trends,” the press release reads.

Aurangzeb was quoted as saying, “Pakistan's youth and technology sector are our greatest assets. Through partnerships like this, we are opening new doors for investment, innovation and global leadership in the blockchain economy.”

Saqib, meanwhile, said the agreement was “more than just a partnership, it's a strategic move to empower our young population and integrate Pakistan into the future of global finance”.

The statement said the WLF leadership praised Pakistan's dynamism, stating that Pakistan's energy, vision and talent made it one of the most exciting places in the world to build the future of decentralised finance.

The finance ministry stated that Pakistan, with 64pc of its population under the age of 30, offered one of the world's most promising digital economies.

“The country ranks among the top in global crypto adoption, with an estimated $300 billion in annual crypto transactions and 25 million active crypto users,” the press release said.

“With rising mobile penetration, a vibrant freelance economy, and strong government interest in blockchain, Pakistan's youth are uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of Web3 innovation.”

Last month, Saqib said that the country planned to legalise cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Saqib said Pakistan aimed to create “a clear regulatory framework for governing digital-asset activities to boost the local ecosystem”.

“Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines,” he said, adding that they wanted to attract international investment because the country was a low-cost high-growth market with 60pc of the population under 30.

April 27, 2025 by Kashif Saleem 

Ethereum has been pushing back against recent market struggles, now trading at $1,809. The 13.41% increase over the past week has caught the eyes of analysts who are digging into the numbers for clues on whether this uptick can last or if turbulence is on the horizon.

Even with this fresh momentum, Ethereum is still sitting about 63% lower than its record high of $4,891, a peak it hit back in 2021. The broader downtrend that began in late 2021 still hangs over the market, reminding everyone that the road to recovery could be long and uneven.

Adding complexity to the current picture, recent data from on-chain movements and exchange activity hints that its future price swings might be influenced more by larger economic trends and strategic moves by big traders rather than organic growth.

A notable recent development is the sharp increase in Ethereum transfers to derivative exchanges. Analysts often view such behavior as a sign of increased speculative trading or shifts in traders' expectations for upcoming volatility.

In a recent post, Amr Taha, a contributor for CryptoQuant's QuickTake, noted that Ethereum experienced unusually large inflows to derivatives platforms in the past two days, with one particular surge crossing the 80,000 ETH mark. These spikes often occur when traders are either bracing for large price swings or preparing to leverage new positions.

Although that kind of movement is not a guaranteed signal for where the market might head, it does show rising anticipation among traders. A market on edge can break either way, and with so much ETH flowing into derivatives, caution is now setting the tone.

Taha highlighted that this spike in derivative inflows came around the same time as a key announcement from former US President Donald Trump. Trump confirmed that he has no plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a statement that reassured markets about the independence of the Fed.

Markets quickly interpreted this as a sign that there would be less political pressure on monetary policy, a crucial factor for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. While macroeconomic signals are not everything, in a jittery market, they still carry significant weight.

Taha emphasized how closely cryptocurrency markets are tied to central bank policy and broader economic health. A measure of stability on that front could help, but technical factors still seem to be leading Ethereum's current moves.

Looking outside Ethereum, movements in the Bitcoin market could have an indirect impact on ETH's price. On April 23, more than $600 million worth of Bitcoin was transferred from whale wallets to exchanges, the largest single-day inflow seen in weeks.

This happened after a surge in the BTC/GBP trading pair, which triggered major short liquidations. According to Taha, the transfer of such a large amount of Bitcoin might suggest that the market is setting up for a fall, especially if fresh selling pressure appears.

For Ethereum, this creates the risk of a short-term pullback. If Bitcoin faces heavy selling, it could drag Ethereum and other digital assets down as well. The buildup of long positions just under Ethereum's current price levels combined with more ETH available on exchanges points to a landscape where liquidity tests are likely.

As Taha put it, “with the buildup of long liquidity below current price, and we might be looking at the classic ‘pump-then-dump' setup, at least short-term.”

DeFi Development Corp. (JNVR), formerly known as Janover, is doubling down on its plan to buy more Solana for its treasury as it looks to offer up to $1 billion worth of securities. 

The firm, formerly a commercial real estate lending tech platform, revealed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that it plans on using the funds for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Solana.” The offering will include common and preferred stock, debt instruments, warrants, and units.

DeFi Development has already acquired approximately $48.2 million of SOL and plans to operate validators on the Solana blockchain to earn staking rewards.

Taking a playbook out of Michael Saylor's bitcoin buying strategy, corporations have been increasingly buying SOL for their balance sheets to provide TradFi investors with exposure to the token. 

SOL Strategies, the publicly traded company helmed by CEO Leah Wald—former co-founder of digital asset manager Valkyrie Investments—spearheaded the movement. Recently, the firm announced that it had secured an up to $500 million convertible note facility to ramp up its investments in the Solana network.

DeFi Development's new offering comes after a significant leadership shakeup earlier this month. Former Kraken executive Joseph Onorati took over as CEO and chairman, and Parker White, another ex-Kraken engineer, was named chief operating officer and chief investment officer. The company also brought on John Han, a former Binance and Kraken executive, as CFO. DeFi Development adopted a treasury strategy centered around Solana as part of its new direction.

In addition to the $1 billion shelf registration, DeFi Development also filed to register 1.24 million shares on behalf of early investors, including Pantera Capital, Payward (parent company of Kraken), and Arrington Capital.

Shares of DeFi Development Corp surged more than 970% following the leadership shakeup and moved up roughly 4% in after-hours trading on Friday to now stand at $54 per share.

 DeFi Development Corp is seeking to raise more capital for its Solana treasury and operational expenses. 

DeFi Development Corp (formerly Janover) aims to raise over $1 billion worth of capital to invest in Solana, the industry's sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

The Nasdaq-listed firm, previously a real estate financing platform connecting commercial property lenders and buyers, announced its plans in a Form S-3 registration statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 25.

The filing states that the funds will be used for general corporate purposes, including Solana (SOL) token acquisitions.

According to the filing, the company may use proceeds from the offering to purchase more Solana, noting:

The company also warned that fluctuations in Solana's price could lead to it converting the tokens into cash at a value “substantially below” the net proceeds raised.

Janover was a real estate financing company connecting lenders and buyers of commercial properties before a team of former Kraken exchange executives bought 728,632 shares of its common stock on April 7. Joseph Onorati, former chief strategy officer at Kraken, has since been appointed as chairman and CEO.

The announcement comes shortly after the leadership of DeFi Development Corp adopted a Solana treasury reserve, “by applying a proven public-market treasury model to an asset that's earlier in its lifecycle, structurally reflexive, and vastly underexposed as compared to Bitcoins.”

The firm's new Solana investment treasury has drawn comparisons to Michael Saylor's Strategy, which has amassed over 538,200 Bitcoin (BTC) as of April 20 — the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder.

The firm's board of directors approved the company's Solana-focused treasury policy on April 4, authorizing long-term accumulation and the launch of Solana validators to enable the staking of its treasury asset.

Parker White, the firm's chief investment officer, who previously served as an engineering director at Kraken exchange, already runs a Solana validator with $75 million in delegated stake.

While the Solana-focused treasury implementation marks a significant step for altcoin adoption, the firm remains concerned by the potential effects of opaque crypto regulations, according to the filing:

The firm cites unclear regulations around digital assets, which may “adversely affect the price of Solana” and, in turn, impact “the market price of our common stock.”

The firm noted that Solana's potential “reclassifying” as a security remains a particular concern, which may lead to the firm being classified as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

However, the firm's share price has been benefiting from its Solana acquisitions. Its shares rose by over 12% when DeFi Development Corp added $11.5 million worth of Solana tokens to its treasury on April 22, Cointelegraph reported.

“The decision by commercial property platform Janover to add SOL to its treasury is truly groundbreaking,” Chris Chung, founder of Solana-based swap platform Titan, told Cointelegraph. “I'm confident we will see many other businesses follow suit before long as crypto becomes increasingly adopted by traditional finance.”

The Trump administration is pressuring trading partners to Buy American — American energy, defense and agricultural products, that is, and as The Wall Street Journal reports, many anxious global leaders, eager to placate the commander in chief and avoid a prolonged trade war, have voiced support for the idea.

However, just as foreign leaders are saying they'll buy American goods and services, foreign investors, from Japanese pensioners to European mutual funds to state actors are Selling American — specifically American stocks, corporate debt and, worryingly, the treasury bonds America relies on to finance trillions in government spending.

Ross Perot gained political fame (or infamy, depending on who you ask) in the 1990s by arguing that the flow of factory jobs from the Midwest to Mexico from NAFTA would cause a “giant sucking sound going south.” We're hearing a new sucking sound, but this time it's capital, rather than jobs, that's whooshing out of our national doors.

Since the beginning of the year, the US dollar has weakened against nearly every major currency, falling more than 10% against the Euro and Japanese Yen, and more than 8% against the British pound. And while US stock markets are reeling under pressure from Trump's tariffs, European and British markets are up. 

Some fear the damage from tariffs to American business, US financial markets and even the dollar itself could be long lasting. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says Barry Eichengreen, an economist and professor at the University of Berkeley, adding “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.”

Predictions that current policy will lead America down the road to ruin are probably overblown. But this dollar angst raises a pressing and real concern that the US could run out of buyers for its government debt as traditional investors shun treasuries along with other US assets.

In a worst case scenario, China may even dump US debt intentionally to retaliate for tariffs, sending rates higher, impacting everything from car loans to mortgage payments. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to calm markets of these worries, saying, “If a foreign rival were weaponizing the US government bond market or attempting to destabilize it for political gain, I am sure that we would do something.”

So, the US needs to fund key government spending at reasonable rates of interest, but legacy buyers may not line up as eagerly in the future to buy the debt. Now what?

The good news is that a new buyer of US treasuries is emerging, made possible by the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Blockchain-based stablecoins are now the seventh largest buyer of US government debt, exceeding Germany, Australia and other big countries. And they're growing quickly — surpassing $200 billion in size this year and nearly $250 billion today. 

Because stablecoins are fully backed 1:1 by dollar reserves, typically US government debt, they are a persistent and growing buyer of new treasury issuances. Increasingly, government leaders see their potential. In a June 2024 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said, “Dollar-backed stablecoins are becoming an important net purchaser of US government debt.” 

To be sure, stablecoins are still a small piece of the enormous treasury market. But the trend suggests that stablecoins will continue to grow, perhaps capturing as much as 5%-10% share of the global money supply, or $5-$10 trillion, over the next decade. 

Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, the largest American stablecoin issuer, said that the stablecoin market could reach $3 trillion by 2030. For context, a $3 trillion stablecoin market would soak up more US debt than China, Japan or the UK, the three largest current owners of US government debt, combined. 

The US has benefited enormously from the US dollar being the global reserve currency. Despite accounting for about 25% of the world's GDP, the greenback is involved in most of global trade. 

At White House Crypto Summit in February, Scott Bessent said, “We are going to keep the US [dollar] the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that.” China and the rest of the world may be closing a door on America's dollar and on an old regime where the US relied on foreign governments to buy its debt. Stablecoins could be opening a window to its future.

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes says Bitcoin (BTC) will likely benefit from the ongoing trade war and a US-China decoupling.

In a new interview with the host of the Forward Guidance YouTube channel, Felix Jauvin, Hayes says governments around the world will likely have to print money to offset the impacts of the trade war, which has ignited massive Bitcoin rallies in the past.

“China's not alone. It's every major economy needs to print a bunch of money to basically cushion the effects of this attempted divorce, this decline in globalization. But at the end of the day, yeah, they're going to print money – Bitcoin benefits. 

Now the reciprocal of the current account deficit in the US is our financial account surplus. And so all these dollars that got earned, the trillions of dollars that got earned selling stuff to America, got recycled into Treasury bonds and stocks and Mag 7, all the big US tech stocks. So mathematically, if [US President Donald] Trump is serious about reducing the current account to zero, then foreigners have to sell stocks – period. It's just math. 

And then the question is, okay, well, can the US government survive financially if there's a big decline in capital gains taxes because the market's not going up? I don't think so. Therefore, we get a printing money function and Bitcoin benefits. It finally decouples from tech because of the structural flows and what needs to happen from an affordability standpoint for the US government.”

While some in the crypto space suggest the market turmoil may prompt central banks to start accumulating Bitcoin to diversify their asset holdings, Hayes believes central banks will continue to turn to gold as a hedge, not the flagship crypto asset.

“I actually don't think that they're mentally prepared for that sort of leap. They understand gold. They've been trained in gold. They've read history books about gold.” 

Bitcoin is trading for $94,832 at time of writing, up 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

 Senator Cynthia Lummis' doubts about the Federal Reserve's recent decision come as many prominent crypto entrepreneurs have voiced their support. 

United States Senator Cynthia Lummis suggests the crypto industry may be celebrating too soon over the US Federal Reserve softening its crypto guidance for banks.

“The Fed withdrawing crypto guidance is just noise, not real progress,” Lummis said in an April 25 X post. Lummis called the Fed's April 24 announcement — withdrawing its 2022 supervisory letter that had discouraged banks from engaging with crypto and stablecoin activities — “just lip service.”

Lummis, a pro-crypto advocate known for introducing the Bitcoin (BTC) Strategic Reserve Bill in July 2024, pointed out several flaws in the Fed's announcement, even as Strategy founder Michael Saylor and crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano suggested it was a step forward for banks and crypto.

She argued that the Fed continues to “illegally flout the law on master accounts” and still relies on reputational risk in its bank supervision practices. It comes as the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC) is working on a rule to stop examiners from considering reputational risk when reviewing a bank's operations, according to a recent Bloomberg report.

Lummis also highlighted the Fed's policy statement in Section 9(13), which hasn't been withdrawn, stating that Bitcoin and digital assets are considered “unsafe and unsound.”

She also reiterated many of the same staff behind Operation Chokepoint 2.0 are still involved in crypto policy today.

“I will continue to hold the Fed accountable until the digital asset industry gets more than a life jacket, Chair Powell — they need a fair shake,” Lummis said.

Custodia Bank founder and CEO Caitlin Long seemed to share a similar view to Lummis.

“THANK YOU for seeing this for what it is,” Long said.

However, other crypto executives praised the Fed's announcement as a positive development for the industry. Saylor said in an April 25 X post that the Fed's move means that “banks are now free to begin supporting Bitcoin.”

Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum, said the Fed's decision “is a significant development, as it will simplify the path to institutional adoption.”

Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is saying Bitcoin (BTC) is primed to continue outperforming altcoins over the near term.

Cowen tells his 894,000 YouTube subscribers that, based on the social risk metric, which gauges crypto market sentiment based on the social media activity of market participants, altcoins could continue underperforming the crypto king.

“I have often said Ethereum is sort of like the index of the altcoin market. If it's doing poorly, interest in crypto is not that high and altcoins aren't really doing that great. And you can see that as Ethereum has collapsed, so too did the social risk. So when we talk about the social interest in crypto and it being low, what it means is that altcoins will likely keep bleeding to Bitcoin.”

According to the widely followed analyst, the loosening of the US monetary policy could turn the tide in favor of altcoins.

“Despite what people say, they truly want altcoin season. That's what they want. And because they keep not getting it, altcoins keep bleeding to Bitcoin…

…in order to see this change, you need monetary policy to change, which can ultimately lead to people getting more interested in the asset class…

…the way you get monetary policy change is you get pain in the markets. We are getting pain in the markets right now. We have seen a lot of pain in the markets. And the more pain that the markets get, the higher the chance that loose monetary policy comes. But in order to see change, you have to have the pain.

Welcome to the pain. I don't know how long the pain is going to last, but it's this type of pain in the markets that you see persist over a long time that then leads to changes in monetary policy.”

Each mining transaction drains a massive amount of electrical power from the grid.

Crypto is all memes and moonshots until you look at how much power it uses up. 

Digital currencies like Bitcoin require an energy consumption that rivals that of entire countries. Still, there are solutions out there to clean up the field, according to The Regulatory Review.

Crypto coins are a type of digital currency that gained popularity for their nontraditional structure and as investments. A big part of their value stems from being traded on a highly secure platform called the blockchain. 

However, to get onto the blockchain, a "mining" process must occur, which is what gives crypto its bad energy rap. Each mining transaction drains a massive amount of electrical power from the grid. 

The energy impact is "astronomical" and has increased power bills in some areas by more than 30%, Suffolk University Law School professor Steven Ferrey wrote in a recent paper, per The Regulatory Review. 

Aside from making regular utilities more expensive, the power supply for cryptocurrency also comes largely from polluting sources — although some coins are greener than others. 

That reliance on dirty energy means that crypto worsens the planet's trends of rising temperatures and extreme weather events. 

Ferrey argues that there is a real structural issue here. His reasoning could fill a textbook, but the basics are that there is not enough clean energy available to handle crypto mining, in part because many regions have shot down clean electricity projects. As a result, the field's environmental impact continues to run unchecked. 

He calls this reality the "legal dark side" of how cryptocurrency gets its power and said that it will send the United States down the "highway to climate hell." 

Advocates for greener cryptocurrency, from experts like Professor Ferrey to groups like Earthjustice, Sierra Club, and the Crypto Climate Accord, all agree: Better interventions in currency mining and energy use is the best path toward a future that is safe and healthy for all.

Ferrey noted that legislating sanctions on crypto has worked in the past, as has incentivizing broad clean energy adoption. He encouraged officials to build more regulations and policies that could protect consumers from rate hikes and even leverage clean energy tax credits to move crypto miners away from polluting energy, The Regulatory Review explained.

Crypto companies can also get the benefits of clean energy directly. One study found that using solar energy for Bitcoin mining lowered developers' operating costs, and another found that they could save millions of dollars by making green investments,according to The Regulatory Review.

              Highlights            



                        New SEC Chairman Paul Atkins pledged to create clear, innovation-friendly crypto regulations, moving away from the enforcement-driven approach of the previous administration.                      


                        Panelists at the SEC roundtable urged a shift from outdated “physical possession” custody rules toward flexible, principles-based standards that are a better fit for blockchain technology.                      


                        Industry leaders warned that without swift regulatory clarity, the U.S. risks losing blockchain innovation to foreign markets that have already embraced clearer crypto frameworks.                      

In his fourth day on the job, the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins took a pro-innovation stance on cryptocurrency in a marked departure from the prior administration's enforcement-first approach.

Speaking at the agency's third Crypto Task Force roundtable on Friday (April 25), Atkins sharply criticized the regulatory direction taken under the Biden administration and pledged to tackle the “long festering issues” surrounding digital assets and blockchain technology.

“Innovation has been stifled for the last several years due to market and regulatory uncertainty that unfortunately the SEC has fostered,” said Atkins, who previously served two terms under former President George W. Bush.

The remarks of the SEC chair set the stage for a major pivot in U.S. crypto policy, one that could encourage the growth of the digital assets market domestically rather than pushing it abroad.

Market participants “deserve clear regulatory rules of the road,” Atkins said, adding that he will work to establish a “rational fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets.”

Atkins said SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce will be leading efforts to create this framework. He praised her “principled and tireless advocacy for common sense crypto policy,” noting she has “justly earned the title of ‘crypto mom.'”

“This is important work,” he said. “As entrepreneurs across the United States are harnessing blockchain technology to modernize aspects of the financial system, I expect huge benefits from this market innovation in terms of efficiency, cost reduction, transparency and risk mitigation.”

The SEC roundtable centered on one of the thorniest regulatory challenges: how broker-dealers and investment firms can safely hold custody of digital assets in compliance with federal securities laws.

Seamus Rocca, CEO of bitcoin-enabled Xapo Bank, told PYMNTS that the SEC's renewed focus on crypto customer is a “welcome step.”

“Secure custody of digital assets isn't a technical nice-to-have — it's the foundation of investor trust. But rules must reflect reality,” Rocca said.

Crypto custody is fundamentally different from traditional finance and needs “purpose-built infrastructure, not a retrofitted playbook. While crypto exchanges may seek to provide bank-like services, it's vital to ensure that consumers are aware of the stark difference in compliance and oversight,” he added.

A big issue causing no small angst is that today's regulatory framework — built around physical possession of paper stock certificates — is not well-suited to blockchain technology. 

“We just have a different system now with the digital asset ecosystem, and it doesn't fit squarely within the rules that were written for a completely different system,” said Susan Gault-Brown, a partner at Allen Overy Shearman Sterling LLP.

Other panelists at the roundtable echoed the sentiment that traditional models of custody don't fit.

“In crypto, we've created a technological infrastructure where you don't need intermediaries and you don't need counterparties,” said Larry Florio, general counsel of 1kx, a crypto fund manager. “There's unique abilities that come with that, and there's unique risks too.”

Adam Levitin, law and finance professor at Georgetown Law, noted: “We're trying to fit a technology designed to be a peer-to-peer payment system into a system for centralized trading, and it's not a good match.”

Levitin said the traditional understanding of a custodian is someone who's going to physically hold your assets. 

“They're going to have a vault or something, and we're going to make sure that the door is a sufficient number of inches thick, and then it's fireproof for 24 hours,” he said. “That's a really different set of skills than are required to secure crypto.”

Several panelists advocated for a principles-based approach to custody regulation rather than focusing on the technology since it's hard for rules to keep up with digital advances. 

“Principles-based rule is probably better than a technology-based one (since) technology is changing quickly,” said Mark Greenberg, vice president of consumer business and product at Kraken. “Keys should be held in systems, not by people, and that means that the old rule of ‘not my keys, not my crypto' probably doesn't apply anymore in that respect.”

A recurring theme was the need for regulatory flexibility to accommodate rapid technological change. If custody rules are too prescriptive, several panelists warned, they risk becoming obsolete as technology evolves.

Several panelists said lack of regulatory clarity drives innovation overseas.

“What was probably most shameful about the last four years was that we received approvals in multiple foreign jurisdictions, and we were essentially hamstrung in our hometown,” said Baylor Myers, vice president of corporate development at BitGo. “It was really shameful and sad, and hopefully that's about to change.”

Brandon Russell, CEO of Etana Custody, agreed. He said that foreign regulators were clearer about their rules, which helped crypto firms a lot.

“If you're going to look to foreign regulation as some kind of guiding light, that's probably the biggest takeaway — there was clarification pretty early on that allowed those markets to evolve,” he said.

If you want to understand the geology of our home planet, studying the mantle is a great place to start. Separating the planet's rocky crust and the molten outer core, the mantle makes up 70 percent of the Earth's mass and 84 percent of its volume. But despite its outsized influence on the planet's geologic processes, scientists have never directly sampled rocks from this immensely important geologic layer. 

And that's understandable, especially when you consider that the crust is roughly 9 to 12 miles thick on average. Luckily, that average contains outliers—areas of the world where the crust is actually incredibly thin and faulting exposes the mantle through cracks. One such area is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, specifically near an underwater mountain called the Atlantis Massif.  

On the south side of this massif is an area known as the Lost City—a hydrothermal field whose vent fluids are highly alkaline and rich in hydrogen, methane, and other carbon compounds. This makes the area a particularly compelling candidate for explaining how early life evolved on Earth. Additionally, it contains mantle rock that interacts with seawater in a process known as “serpentinization,” which alters the rock's structure and gives it a green, marble-like appearance. 

It was here, 800 meters south of this field, in May 2023 that members of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP)—aboard the JOIDES Resolution, a 470-foot-long research vessel rented by the U.S. National Science Foundation—extracted a 1,268-meter core containing abyssal peridotites, which are the primary rocks that make up the Earth's upper mantle. The results of the study were published in the journal Science.

Although this makes this particular drill core the deepest sample of the mantle yet, going that deep into the rock wasn't the goal of this record-breaking expedition. 

“We had only planned to drill for 200 meters, because that was the deepest people had ever managed to drill in mantle rock,” Johan Lissenberg, a petrologist at Cardiff University and co-author of the study, told Nature. He said that the drilling was so easy that they progressed three times faster than usual. The team eventually drilled a staggering 1,268 meters, and only stopped due to the mission's limited operations window. 

Andrew McCaig—study co-author and University of Leeds scientist—said in an article from The Conversation that, according to a preliminary analysis of the rock, the core's composition contains a variety of peridotite called harzburgite that forms via partial melting of mantle rock. It also contained rocks known as gabbros, which are coarse-grained igneous rocks. Both of these rocks then chemically reacted with seawater, changing their composition. 

While this core represents an incredibly opportunity to learn more about the Earth's mantle, as well as give an in-depth look at the geologic substrate upon which the Lost City rests, the mission didn't quite complete the “grand challenge” of crossing the Mohorovičić discontinuity. Otherwise known as the Moho, the Mohorovičić discontinuity is recognized as the true boundary between the crust and pristine mantle. 

Future missions could continue exploring this site near the Atlantis Massif, but sadly, those missions won't include JOIDES Resolution—the NSF declined to fund more core drilling past 2024. Just as scientists are finally knocking on the door to the Earth's most ubiquitous geologic layer, the future of these kinds of drilling missions is now uncertain.

Metrics details

Members of the proteinase-activated receptor (PAR) subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play critical roles in processes like hemostasis, thrombosis, development, wound healing, inflammation, and cancer progression. Comprising PAR1-PAR4, these receptors are specifically activated by protease cleavage at their extracellular amino terminus, revealing a ‘tethered ligand' that self-activates the receptor. This triggers complex intracellular signaling via G proteins and beta-arrestins, linking external protease signals to cellular functions. To date, direct structural visualization of these ligand-receptor complexes has been limited. Here, we present structural snapshots of activated PAR1 and PAR2 bound to their endogenous tethered ligands, revealing a shallow and constricted orthosteric binding pocket. Comparisons with antagonist-bound structures show minimal conformational changes in the TM6 helix and larger movements of TM7 upon activation. These findings reveal a common activation mechanism for PAR1 and PAR2, highlighting critical residues involved in ligand recognition. Additionally, the structure of PAR2 bound to a pathway selective antagonist, GB88, demonstrates how potent orthosteric engagement can be achieved by a small molecule mimicking the endogenous tethered ligand's interactions.

Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) are a distinct subgroup within the broader family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are essential to a myriad of biological processes1,2,3. These receptors are activated through proteolytic cleavage by various serine proteases, which exposes a ‘tethered ligand' within the receptor's N-terminal region. This tethered ligand subsequently binds intramolecularly to initiate signaling, distinguishing PARs from other GPCRs that are typically activated intermolecularly by soluble ligands4. Like many GPCRs, PAR1 and PAR2 play crucial roles in human physiology and pathology, particularly in processes such as inflammation, coagulation, and immune responses4,5,6.

PAR1, the first identified member of the PAR family, has been widely studied for its critical roles in hemostasis and thrombosis7,8. Predominantly expressed on platelets, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, PAR1 is primarily activated by thrombin, a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade9,10,11,12. This highlights PAR1's pivotal role in vascular biology and its potential as a therapeutic target for novel antithrombotic therapies designed to reduce thrombotic risk while minimizing the bleeding complications often linked to conventional anticoagulants13.

In contrast, PAR2 is predominantly activated by trypsin and tryptase, playing diverse roles in inflammation and immune response14. Unlike PAR1, PAR2's functions are implicated in conditions such as chronic inflammation, pulmonary disorders, and cancer progression15,16. Its ability to respond to multiple proteases underscores its broader physiological significance and complexity, making it an attractive target for pharmaceutical development aimed at treating a range of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders17.

Mutational scanning methods were first applied to investigate the mechanism of PARs, revealing that residues from the tethered ligands are in contact with extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) of the receptor18. Subsequent crystal structures of thrombin bound to PAR1's N-terminus revealed their interactions and hypothesized how these interactions may cause allosteric effects on GPCR activation, in addition to proteolysis linked activation of PAR119,20,21. The crystal structure of PAR1 in complex with vorapaxar, a highly selective tricyclic himbacine-derived inhibitor of PAR1, marked a significant milestone in the structural study of PARs22. This work revealed unprecedented details of the interaction between PAR1 and the antagonistic compound. Separately, a study reported the crystal structures of PAR2 in complex with the allosteric antagonists AZ3451 and AZ883823. While these structures provided unparalleled detail, the activation mechanism of PARs and details of tethered ligand-GPCR interactions within the orthosteric pocket remain poorly understood.

Building on this foundational knowledge, our research delves further into the structural analysis of PAR1 and PAR2, revealing important details of their activation mechanisms. We have resolved the structures of PAR1 and PAR2 in complex with their endogenous tethered ligands and G proteins, providing details of receptor activation rearrangements. Our analysis reveals that both PAR1 and PAR2 feature shallow, constricted orthosteric binding pockets essential for ligand recognition and receptor activation. This structural characterization not only deepens our understanding of their molecular functionality, but also identifies residues that are critical to ligand binding and receptor activation. Surprisingly, our comparative studies with antagonist-bound structures reveal minimal conformational shifts in the TM6 helix, suggesting a subtle yet effective activation mechanism distinct from the dramatic transformations observed in other GPCRs. These insights are vital for comprehending the specificity of receptor activation and signaling and allow us to propose a unified model for the activation of PARs.

To further our understanding of PAR2 druggability, we determined the structure of GB88 bound to an activated PAR2 heterotrimeric G-protein complex. GB88 is a biased antagonist of PAR2 that selectively inhibits the PAR2/Gq/11/Ca2+/PKC signaling pathway, resulting in anti-inflammatory effects in vivo24. At the same time, it acts as an agonist in three other PAR2-activated pathways (cAMP, ERK, Rho) in human cells24. Our structure of PAR2 bound to this versatile molecule reveals it to bind deep within the constricted orthosteric pocket by effectively mimicking key interactions that we observe in our tethered ligand structure of PAR2.

Here, we report the structural basis of PAR1 and PAR2 activation, revealing key molecular interactions involved in tethered ligand binding and receptor activation. Our findings identify conserved residues critical for orthosteric pocket interactions and reveal minimal conformational shifts in TM6, paired with distinct TM7 movements, driving a unified activation mechanism for PAR1 and PAR2. Additionally, we present the structure of PAR2 bound to GB88, illustrating its mimicry of endogenous ligand interactions for potent orthosteric engagement. Overall, this work enhances our understanding of ligand-receptor and small molecule-receptor interactions, providing a foundation for designing therapies targeting the PAR1 and PAR2 orthosteric binding sites.

To elucidate the agonist-binding and activation mechanisms of PAR1 and PAR2, we focused on their natural agonist, the tethered ligand. We employed consistent strategies in designing constructs for both receptors. Briefly, PAR1 (residues 42-425) and PAR2 (residues 37-397) were cloned into the pFastbac vector following the signal peptide (Supplementary Fig. 1A). This arrangement simulates protease cleavage, thereby exposing the first amino acid of the tethered ligand, which is crucial for receptor activation. To stabilize the PAR1 and PAR2 complexes with Gαq proteins, we implemented the NanoBiT tethering strategy by attaching the large BiT (LgBiT) to the C-terminus of each receptor, followed by a Flag tag for purification purposes25.

Additionally, we utilized an engineered Gαq protein (GqiN), in which the N-terminus (residue 1–32) of Gαq was replaced with the N-terminus (residue 1–28) of Gαi26. This modification significantly enhances the protein's affinity for the scFv16 antibody, a tool that has been instrumental in elucidating numerous receptor/G-protein complexes. The Gβ subunit in both the PAR1 and PAR2 complexes features a C-terminal HiBiT, which pairs with the LgBiT25 (Supplementary Fig. 1A).

To assemble the PAR1-Gαq and PAR2-Gαq complexes, receptor subunits, Gαq, Gβ, Gγ, and scFv16 were co-expressed in Hi5 insect cells. The complexes were then purified using Flag affinity resin (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The structures of the PAR1-Gαq and PAR2-Gαq complexes were resolved via cryo-EM to resolutions of 2.7 Å and 3.1 Å (Figs. 1,  2 and Supplementary Fig. 2–4), respectively. The clarity of the cryo-EM density maps enabled modeling of most side chains of the receptors, the Gαβγ heterotrimer, the tethered ligands and scFv16 (Figs. 1A–D,  2A–D, Supplementary Fig. 3). Both complexes exhibit a highly similar overall structural fold, adopting a canonical seven-transmembrane helix domain (TMD), with root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 1.07 Å over 205 Cα atoms. The tethered ligands bind at the orthosteric pocket formed by transmembrane helices TM5, TM6, TM7, the N-terminal loop, and ECL2 (Figs. 1,  2).

PAR1 is uniquely activated by thrombin through a specialized proteolytic mechanism that sets it apart from most other G protein-coupled receptors. This activation begins when thrombin cleaves PAR1 at residue R41N-term located within its extracellular N-terminal domain27. This proteolytic event exposes a new sequence motif SFLLR, beginning at S42TL, and acts as the tethered ligand. Our PAR1-Gαq cryo-EM map reveals density for these initial five residues (Fig. 1B). They adopt an extended conformation that binds into a shallow pocket at the center of the 7 TM bundle of PAR1, forming contacts with residues from TM1, TM5, TM6, TM7, and ECL2 (Fig. 1D). The tethered ligand is nestled into a shallow and narrow pocket with the deepest residue, S42TL, in hydrogen bonds distance with residues H255ECL2 of ECL2 and Y3376.59 of TM6 (Fig. 1D). The adjacent residues, F43TL, L44TL, and L45TL, contribute van der Waals interactions with Y3507.32 of TM7, and additional H-bonds with D256ECL2 and L258ECL2, illustrating a complex network of interactions that facilitate the activation of the receptor (Fig. 1D).

In comparison, PAR2 activation involves a direct mechanism by trypsin, which cleaves the receptor at R36N-term. This cleavage reveals a new N-terminal sequence starting with SLIG, beginning at S37TL, that serves as a tethered ligand28. This ligand then folds back onto the receptor itself, binding intramolecularly and inducing significant conformational changes that are essential for receptor activation. Our cryo-EM density map of the PAR2-Gαq complex has effectively resolved the initial three residues, SLI, showing a similar pattern of interactions (Fig. 2B) that are observed in PAR1. This tethered ligand also binds to a shallow pocket, engaging in key interactions with residues from TM1, TM5, TM6, TM7, and ECL2 (Fig. 2D). Notably, residues S37TL and L38TL play important roles in this binding. S37TL reaches into the base of the pocket, forming putative hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl of H227ECL2 and the sidechain of Y3116.59 while L38TL is involved in a polar interaction with L230ECL2 and forms van der Waals interactions with Y3237.32, as well as forming a putative H-bond with D228ECL2 (Fig. 2D), illustrating the detailed mechanism of ligand-receptor interactions that lead to the activation of PAR2. Alignment of the PAR1 and PAR2 structures reveal that they share highly similar binding modes of the tethered ligands and overall conformation (Supplementary Fig. 5).

The structure of PAR1 bound to the antagonist vorapaxar (PDB 3VW7) illustrates how vorapaxar partially occupies the orthosteric site of PAR1, effectively inhibiting its activation by sterically preventing rearrangements necessary for activation22. Vorapaxar stabilizes PAR1 in its inactive conformation through multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with multiple residues. These interactions hinder the conformational changes required for G protein coupling and physically block the tethered ligand binding site, with the tricyclic ring of vorapaxar occupying the same position as S42TL when the tethered ligand is bound. In our cryo-EM structure, the tethered ligand is demonstrated to be positioned higher than vorapaxar's methylpyridine core and distal chlorophenyl ring, that both penetrate deep within the receptor, sterically obstructing the large conformational rearrangements of bulky tyrosine residues Y3507.32 and Y3537.35, (Fig. 3A–D) and virtually irreversibly inhibiting receptor activation by PAR1's tethered ligand22.

The tethered peptide is colored in yellow spheres, while vorapaxar is shown in gray spheres. C Key residues conformations in PAR1 bound to the antagonist vorapaxar. D Key residue conformations in PAR1 bound to the tethered ligand.

Vorapaxar is a highly lipophilic molecule, speculated to enter the receptor through the lipid bilayer between TMs 6 and 7. In the vorapaxar-bound inactive state, TM6 and TM7 are spaced apart; upon receptor activation, these helices move towards each other by ~3 Å (Fig. 3A, B), eliminating the space necessary to accommodate vorapaxar's ethyl carbamate tail, and possibly vorapaxar's hypothesized entry into the helical bundle via the membrane.

The most significant structural change during activation is an inward movement of the extracellular side of TM5 by ~5.6 Å, narrowing the pocket between TM4 and TM5 that accommodates vorapaxar's fluorophenyl pyridine tail (Fig. 3B, C). In contrast, residues of the tethered ligand bind within the relatively superficial orthosteric pocket formed by TM1, TM5, TM6, TM7, and ECL2 (Fig. 3D).

Unlike other Class A and B GPCRs, which typically exhibit significant activation-associated movements in the intracellular end of TM6 (such as an ~9 Å outward shift in rhodopsin29 and ~16 Å in GLP1R when engaged with G proteins30), PAR1 shows a more modest 4.7 Å outward movement of TM6 in the active state compared to the inactivated vorapaxar-bound state (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the intracellular end of TM5 exhibits an ~2.6 Å outward movement in the ligand-bound state compared to the inactive state, underscoring the unique activation dynamics of PAR1 (Fig. 3A).

Significant conformational shifts induced by the tethered peptide are observed in Y1833.33, F2715.39, Y3376.59, Y3507.32, and Y3537.35 are also observed. Mutagenesis of these residues to alanine significantly diminishes the potency of the tethered ligand in activating PAR131. In the vorapaxar-bound structure, Y3507.32 is located at a position that is poised to form a hydrogen bond with H255ECL2 on ECL2, stabilizing Y3507.32 and helping to maintain TM7 in the inactive conformation (Fig. 3C). However, when bound, the tethered ligand forces these residues downward (Fig. 3D). The sidechain of Y3507.32 on TM7 breaks the H-bond with H255 ECL2 and forms an H-bond with Y1833.33 of TM3, leading to the downward movement of TM6 and subsequent receptor activation (Fig. 3A, B). Mutation of Y1833.33 exhibited loss of inhibition by vorapaxar and indicates that interactions between Y1833.33 and Y3507.32 may stabilize an inactive conformation22.

Previous structures of PAR2 have revealed an inactive conformation and detailed, distinct allosteric binding mechanisms of PAR2 antagonists. The antagonist AZ8838 (PDB 5NDD) demonstrates slow binding kinetics and binds to an occluded pocket23 below the tethered ligand orthosteric pocket we describe here (Fig. 4A–C). Additionally, AZ3451 (PDB 5NDZ), was found to bind to a distant allosteric site on the outside the helical bundle, preventing necessary structural rearrangements for receptor activation and signaling23,32.

E Detailed view of TM6 and TM7 highlighting residues that propagate agonist binding rearrangements in the active state (coral) compared to relative position in the inactive state (yellow). Red arrows denote steric forces applied by moving residues on neighboring residues.

In our tethered ligand bound PAR2 structure, we also observe a superficial orthosteric site that is comparable to PAR1 (Supplementary Fig. 5) and dissimilar to other Class A or Class B GPCRs. Analogous to our PAR1-Gαq complex, activated PAR2 exhibits minimal movement of TM6, with a 3.4 Å outward tilt and a 2 Å downwards movement towards the intracellular side. Additionally, TM5 exhibits an ~2.6 Å outward movement to accommodate the helix-5 of the G protein (Fig. 4A, B).

The tethered ligand occupies a non-overlapping site to that of AZ8838, which is completely solvent inaccessible in a small, deep binding pocket below the orthosteric site of the tethered ligand (Fig. 4C). Concomitant with this key difference, the tethered ligand induces a different conformation of TM6 around the binding pocket, causing an ~2.1 Å shift on the extracellular side of TM6 (Fig. 4B). Upon binding at the orthosteric pocket, the sidechain of L38TL sterically pushes Y3237.32 of TM7 downwards, forming a stabilizing H-bond with D228ECL2 via the sidechain hydroxyl group (Fig. 4D). This movement causes another sterically driven downward movement of Y3267.35 of TM7. Commensurate with activation is the breaking of an H-bond between H227ECL2 and Y1563.33 and the formation of a stabilizing H-bond between the sidechains of Y3267.35 and Y1563.33 (Fig. 4D). Mutations in Y3237.32, D228 ECL2, Y1563.33, and Y3267.35 each were shown to have critical impacts on PAR2 activation33,34, which correlates with our structural observations. Once stabilized, Y3267.35 of TM7 sterically pushes TM6 outwards through interactions with L3076.55 of TM6, as well as further propagating the shift of TM7 downward via L3307.39 to L3327.41 leading to movement of I2986.46 further down TM6 (Fig. 4E).

Our structures reveal how tethered ligand induced reorientations of TM6 and TM7 lead to the transmission of the activation signal through a series of conserved tyrosine residues. They further reveal how binding at the orthosteric site results in coupled activation of G-protein binding on the intracellular side of PARs.

PAR1 and PAR2 exhibit similar G-protein coupling profiles, both leading to strong Gαq-mediated signaling pathways35,36. Nevertheless, structural alignments between Gαq in PAR1 and PAR2 complexes reveal notable conformational differences. The α5 helix of Gαq in both receptors shows a tilt of ~7°, and a spatial separation of ~6.4 Å is observed in their respective αN helices (Fig. 5). These findings highlight the intricate and receptor-specific nature of GPCR-G protein interactions, emphasizing that insights from one receptor subtype cannot be directly transferred to another. Our study elucidates G-protein coupling specificities in PAR1 and PAR2, revealing the complex interplay of structural elements that govern these interactions.

Our agonist bound structures and comparison with antagonists bound structures of PAR1 and PAR2 reveals a shared activation mechanism involving the downward movement of TM7 and subsequent displacement of TM6 (Fig. 6). The key ligand-induced driver of TM7 movement is the downward force exerted by the second residue of the tethered ligand (L38TL in PAR1 and F43TL in PAR2) directly on Y3507.32 in PAR1 and Y3237.32 in PAR2. This then promotes the sliding downward movement of TM6 through concomitate downward force on Y3537.35 and Y3267.35 in PAR1 and 2 respectively. The downward shift of TM6 and TM7 sets in motion a cascade of rearrangements of other bulky sidechains, most notably F1823.32, Y1833.33, M1863.36 and the PIF motif residue I1903.40 in PAR1 and similarly the corresponding conserved residues F1553.32, Y1563.33, M1593.36 and I1633.40 in PAR2. These rearrangements proliferate agonist binding signaling to canonical GPCR motifs, that are crucial for G protein coupling, and consisting of residues (PAR1/PAR2, respectively) P282/254, I190/I163 and F322/Y296 (P5.50 I3.40 F/Y6.44; PIF/Y motif), D367/D340, P368/P341 and Y371/Y344 (D7.49 P7.50xxY7.53; DPxxY motif), and D199/Q172, R200/R173 and F201/Y174 (D/N3.49 R3.50 F3.51; DRF/NRY motif). The rearrangements of these motifs are highly analogous between PAR1 and PAR2, concomitant with their critical role in stabilizing the G-protein binding interface. Correspondingly, in PAR1, mutations of these residues were shown to significantly impede the activation of PAR1 and disrupted G protein signaling31.

GB88 is an intriguing molecule, that was initially reported as a PAR2 selective antagonist37. The true functional profile of the compound has recently been shown to be nuanced, demonstrating partial agonist properties against several PAR2 signaling arms, including Gαq/11 directed pathways, and the ability to internalize the receptor post activation24. To gain insight into GB88's ability to act as a small molecule PAR2 agonist, we determined the structure of the co-complex formed between GB88, PAR2, and heterotrimeric G-proteins using a chimeric Gαq (Fig. 7A, B).

F Structural overlay (receptor not shown) of the GB88 and the tethered agonist structures to demonstrate GB88's mimicry of the tethered ligand within the orthosteric site. GB88 is shown in cyan with chemical substituents labeled also in cyan. The tethered ligand is shown in green with residues labeled also in green.

Our structure reveals that GB88 binds with its isoxazole group deeply situated within the orthosteric pocket of PAR2 (Fig. 7C–E), burying 73.2% of the molecule's accessible surface area (590 Å2) and interfacing with 22 residues from ECL2, TM1, TM6 and TM7 of PAR2. Many of these interactions are contributed by ECL2 residues in the region 217-236. Intriguingly, GB88 overlays very closely with the bound tethered ligand (Fig. 7F) forming several common interactions, most notably with ECL2 residues D228ECL2 and L230 ECL2 and residues H3106.58, S320ECL3 and Y3116.59 from ECL3 and TM6 (Fig. 7E).

The isoxazole group of GB88 has been shown to confer antagonist properties38. In our structure, the isoxazole oxygen accepts an H-bond from H3106.58 with the nitrogen accepting an H-bond from Y3116.59. Adjacent to this, the bulky cyclohexane is positioned where L38TL of the tethered agonist resides, pushing L69N-term and shifting the top of TM1 outwards by ~2-3 Å when compared to the tethered ligand bound structure, to accommodate the bulky C-terminus spiroindene-piperdidine. Of note is the almost identical interaction with the activation residue Y3237.32, which propagates TM7 movement during receptor activation. Similar to interactions formed by the tethered ligand agonist, the backbone amides of GB88 form H-bond interactions by donating to the carbonyl oxygen of D228ECL2 and accepting H-bonds from both L230 ECL2 and S320 ECL3. Previous studies demonstrated key SAR around both of GB88's backbone amides38. Our structure supports the proposed hypothesis that this is due to preference for maintaining a preferred conformation for hydrogen bonding to receptor residues. Next, GB88's isoleucine moiety mimics the position of I39TL in the activated PAR2 structure, partially filling in the hydrophobic pocket formed between V2365.32 and I3146.62.While the structure does not readily reveal the basis for GB88 selectivity for PAR2 over PAR1, it is of note that two regions of the molecule appear to be less compatible with PAR1's orthosteric pocket, namely in the bulky regions of the cyclohexane and the C-terminal spiroindene -piperdidine.

A robust understanding of the molecular basis of GPCR agonism and antagonism, as well as orthosteric pocket information and ligand-receptor interactions are critical for leveraging rational SBDD during drug discovery campaigns. Until now, such information has largely not been available for the PARs. In this study, we first sought to advance our understanding of the structural mechanisms underlying the activation of PAR1 and PAR2 by their endogenous tethered ligand. Our cryo-EM structures provide a detailed view of the ligand-binding sites in PAR1 and PAR2, outlining residues that define the location and dimensions of their relative orthosteric binding pockets. Unlike previous findings of PAR1 and PAR2 in complex with small molecules17,18 the binding pockets of these proteins for endogenous ligands are shallow and much closer to the extracellular side of the receptor than previous hypothesized32. Unlike most Class A and Class B GPCRs, the movement of TM6 in PAR1 and PAR2 is surprisingly minimal, indicating a G protein coupling mechanism that is so far unique to the PARs. Both our endogenous peptide bound structures reveal a common activation mechanism, where the tethered ligand sterically pushes two key tyrosine residues, which are conserved across all 4 human PARs, downward, leading to TM6 movement and subsequent activation. Given this, it is highly likely that all four PARs share a conserved orthosteric activation mechanism triggered by downward movement of conserved tyrosine residues on TM7 and TM6.

The constricted nature of the orthosteric pocket in the region of these bulky agonist switches rationalizes the limited successes in discovery of a clinically successful small molecule antagonist against PAR2 activity. Vorapaxar appears to circumvent triggering orthosteric activation of PAR1, as it is hypothesized to bind the receptor laterally through the membrane22. The crystal structure demonstrates that vorapaxar binds to PAR1 in an atypical manner, using a superficial binding pocket with minimal solvent exposure. Once bound, it sterically prevents the movement of tyrosine switches to initiate activation, explaining how a small molecule can achieve receptor inactivation22.

Unlike PAR1, the search for a PAR2 selective orthosteric antagonist has proven extremely difficult17. Here, we present the structure of PAR2 bound to the small molecule GB88, an intriguing orthosteric engager that selectively inhibits the PAR2/Gq/11/Ca2 + /PKC signaling pathway, resulting in anti-inflammatory effects in vivo24. Potent orthosteric engagement is achieved by GB88's ability to mimic many of the same interactions that the tethered agonist forms with orthosteric pocket residues located on ECL2, TM1, TM6 and TM7. A structural understanding of GB88's unique pharmacology holds the potential to rationally develop improved small molecule engagers that can target specific PAR2-linked signaling pathways implicated in diseases without disrupting beneficial PAR2 signaling in normal physiology.

During review of this manuscript, two cryo-EM structures of PAR1 bound to the tethered ligand agonist in complex with Gq and Gi heterotrimers were reported31. The overall structure of the PAR1–Gq complex is like that of the PAR1–Gi complex; suggesting the activation mechanism of PAR1 is not likely dependent on the G protein. Overall, these structures are in strong agreement with this study in several key findings, including similar overall structure, proposed activation mechanism, and key residues involved in tethered ligand binding.

The human PAR1 and PAR2 gene were subcloned into the pFastBac plasmid with a prolactin-signal peptide sequence on its N-terminus and the LgBiT fused to its c-terminus followed by a Flag tag for purification. The first 41 residues (residue 1-41) of PAR1 and the first 36 residues (residue 1-36) of PAR2 were truncated to mimic the protease cleavage. HiBiT was fused to the c-terminus of human Gβ1 and cloned into pFastBac plasmid as described in the VIP1R paper25 The N-terminus (residue 1-32) of human Gαq was replaced by the N-terminus of Gi (residue 1–28) and subcloned into pFastBac plasmid. The wild-type human Gγ2 was cloned into pFastBac plasmid. The scFv16 that encodes the single-chain variable fragment of mAb16 was subcloned into pFastBac plasmid.

Bacmid preparation and virus production were performed according to the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system manual (Gibco, Invitrogen). For expression, the Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells at density of 2 × 106 cells per ml were co-infected with baculovirus encoding the PAR1-LgBiT-Flag, GqiN, Gβ, Gγ, scFv16 and Ric8A protein at a ratio of 1:500 (virus volume vs cells volume). Cells were harvested 48 h after infection. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and homogenized by douncing ~30 times. Apyase was added to the lysis at a final concentration of 0.5 mU/ml. To keep the complex stable, the lysate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with flipping. Then, lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG, Anatrace) was added at the final concentration of 0.5% to solubilize the membrane at 4 °C for 2 h. Then the lysis was ultracentrifuged at 56,000 g (45,000 rpm) at 4 °C for 40 min. The supernatant was collected and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 resin for 2 h. The resin was washed with a buffer of 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl and 0.001% LMNG, and 0.0005% cholesteryl hemi-succinate (CHS), then eluted with the same buffer plus 100 µb/ml FLAG peptide. The elution was concentrated and separated on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE health science) gel infiltration column with a buffer of 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 0.001% LMNG. The peak corresponding to the PAR1-Gαq and PAR2-Gαq complex was concentrated at about 3 mg/ml for later cryo-EM grid preparation.

For the GB88-bound PAR2-Gαq complex, the same procedure as the tethered ligand PAR2 complex described above was followed, with the incorporation of 10 µM GB88 into all purification steps.

Three microliters of PAR1-Gαq and PAR2-Gαq complex (including the GB88 preparation) sample at ~3 mg/ml was applied to a glow discharged UltraFoil R1.2/1.3 grids (Quantifoil GmbH). The grids were vitrified in liquid ethane using Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) instrument with the settings of blot force 5, blot time of 5 s, relative humidity of 100%, chamber temperature of 4 °C. Single-particle cryo-EM data were collected using EPU package on a Thermo Fisher Glacios transmission electron microscope operating at 200 keV using parallel illumination conditions. Micrographs were collected using a Falcon 4i direct electron detector with corrected pixel size of 0.69 Å/pix, a total electron exposure of 45 e– /Å–2, with a defocus range of −0.8 to −2 μm.

The cryoSPARC Live application of cryoSPARC v. 4 (Structura Biotechnology) was used to streamline the movie processing, CTF estimation, particle picking, and 2D classification. Preprocessing involved anisotropic motion correction and local CTF estimation. The data were curated by only retaining images with better than 4.5 Å CTF fit resolution. Particle picking started with blob picking ~150 Å in diameter. Once a small set of particles was extracted and 2D class averages were obtained, the good 2D classes were used as templates for picking on the entire dataset. From the ~7 million (PAR1), ~6 million (PAR2) particles initially picked, ~3.1 million, ~1.9 million particles were kept from the good 2D classes, respectively. Then ab initio 3D reconstruction was carried out in cryoSPARC v. 4 and one out of three classes was giving the reconstruction of the designed complex from ~1.9 million and ~0.4 million particles for PAR1 and PAR2, respectively. Multiple rounds of iterative homogenous refinement, heterogenous refinement, and nonuniform, coupled with global CTF refinements gave the final 3D reconstructions at 2.74 Å (PAR1) and 3.1 Å (PAR2) resolution, respectively (0.143 gold standard FSC with correction of masking effects)39. DeepEMHancer was used to improve the map quality40. A similar strategy was utilized for the PAR2-GB88 complex, where ~4 million particles were initially picked and ~1 million particles were kept from the suitable 2D classes (Supplementary Table 1). During pre-processing with cryoSPARC Live, templated from the PAR2 dataset were used for particle picking. These picks were used in 2 cycles of heterogeneous refinement using models from the PAR1 dataset as seed. The best set of particles was then used for an ab initio reconstruction. Particles from the best model were used in homogeneous and non-uniform refinement, resulting in a 2.9 Å resolution map. DeepEMHancer was further utilized to help with the map quality.

Starting models for PAR1, PAR2, Gαq, Gβ1γ2, and scFv16 were based on Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries 3VW722, 5NDD23, 6OIJ41, respectively. All models were docked into the electron microscopy density map using UCSF ChimeraX42. The resulting model was subjected to iterative manual adjustment using Coot43, followed by a Rosetta cryo-EM refinement at relax model and Phenix real_space refinement44. The model statistics were validated using MolProbity. All structure alignments described were done by aligning the GPCR only instead of the whole complex in UCSF Chimera. Structural figures were prepared in UCSF ChimeraX and PyMOL (https://pymol.org/2/). The statistics for data collection and refinement are included in Supplementary Table 1.

Between scrubbing government websites of information about everything from vaccine efficacy to LGBT health matters and the ongoing war with higher education, the Trump administration seems to have a problem with freely available information that doesn't align with its particular ideology. That war on knowledge appears to have extended to Wikipedia. Earlier this week, a Trump appointed attorney sent a letter to the Wikimedia Foundation accusing it of allowing the spread of propaganda and threatening its nonprofit status.

The letter—which was sent by Ed Martin, the acting US attorney for the District of Columbia, and first obtained by The Free Press—alleges that Wikipedia's host organization may be “engaging in a series of activities that could violate its obligations under Section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of the United States Code”—the law that allows the organization to operate as a tax-exempt nonprofit.

Martin accuses the Wikimedia Foundation of falling short of te requirements to maintain that status because, he claims, Wikipedia is “allowing foreign actors to manipulate information and spread propaganda,” and “permitting information manipulation on its platform, including the rewriting of key, historical events and biographical information of current and previous American leaders, as well as other matters implicating the national security and the interests of the United States.” He also claims that because the foundation's board is made up of “primarily foreign nationals,” that it is “subverting the interests of American taxpayers.”

In order to quell these supposed concerns that read more like a thinly veiled threat to fall in line with the administration's preferred version of history, Martin requested documents and responses to a slew of questions, including details about the organization's safeguards to prevent propaganda and processes in place to prevent foreign influence campaigns. The Wikimedia Foundation has until May 15 to respond to the inquiry.

This type of attack made on Department of Justice letterhead has become Martin's calling card, so Wikipedia is in good company for a very bad precedent. Martin also sent letters to CHEST Journal, the New England Journal of Medicine, and Obstetrics and Gynecology in recent weeks, accusing the peer-reviewed scientific journals of being “partisans in various scientific debates” and failing to include scientists with “competing viewpoints” in their publications.

Martin is also the guy who threatened to take legal action against publications that reported on employees working for the Department of Government Efficiency and demanded that multiple lawmakers who spoke out against Elon Musk's ongoing dismantling of the federal government clarify their statements that he alleged were threats against him. Given that Musk has made Wikipedia a target, calling it “Wokepedia” and claiming that it is “an extension of legacy media propaganda,” it's no surprise that Martin turned his attention to the free, community-managed online encyclopedia.

He's serving as the government's attack dog, and frankly he comes off as a petty little tyrant about the whole thing. He's drawn the ire of free speech organizations who see through his pretty transparent efforts to scare people into subduing criticisms of the administration and silencing the spread of anything that may go against the party line. But credit where it's due, he's very good at sending letters.

Microsoft just added a new function to its voice typing feature: the ability to disable the profanity filter. This function arrives with Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26200.550 on the Dev Channel.

The function is accessible when you press Win + H, then select the settings icon. From there, you can click on the Filter profanity toggle to disable it, allowing your PC to record your curse words and type them as they are. What's more interesting is that Microsoft introduced this feature to “address the top customer feedback for voice typing by rolling out a new setting that lets you control the profanity filter.”

Before this feature became available, you could not write curse words using voice typing because Windows would automatically censor them. So, instead of typing what you want, all you'll get are asterisks denoting that you swore at your PC. But with the profanity filter turned off, you're free to say what you want, how you want, and it will jot down precisely what it heard. Thankfully, the filter is on by default, ensuring you won't get any surprise expletives in your voice-typed document.



This feature is currently limited to Windows Insiders. But if it doesn't have any bugs and Microsoft does not receive a glut of complaints, you can expect the profanity filter switch to get a general release in the coming months.

Aside from this interesting toggle, the Dev Channel also gets to test a couple of new features. This includes Click-to-Do, which is an AI-powered feature that gives you contextual actions based on what's on your screen. It's similar to the right-click function PC users have been familiar with over the decades, but is supercharged with local AI processing. We're also getting Improved Search, allowing you to use natural language to find files saved on your PC, instead of relying on file names and keywords.

However, unlike the Windows voice typing feature, which you can use on any PC running Windows 11 and is connected online, these AI-powered features run locally. So, you need a Copilot+ PC with an NPU that can deliver at least 40 TOPs to enjoy them.

Amazon is raising eyebrows with the timing of its big book sale for 2025, which runs from April 23 to 28 — which means it's competing directly with Independent Bookstore Day.

As writer Maris Kreisman explained in Lit Hub, Independent Bookstore Day is an annual event organized by the American Booksellers Association (ABA), with events, special guests, and exclusive merchandise at 1,600 participating bookstores. And this year, it's taking place on April 26 (today).

“I implore you: if you live near an indie bookstore (and I know that many of us still don't and I hope one day we all do), you must go,” Kreizman said.

Indie bookstores do appear to be on the upswing in the United States, at least according to last year's numbers from the ABA. But of course, Amazon remains dominant — in 2020, a House committee estimated that the company controlled more than 50% of the total online and offline print book market, and it's even more dominant in e-books.

So it's not exactly a good look for the company to time its big sale to compete with a nationwide, celebratory bookstore event.

In fact, Bookshop.org — an Amazon competitor that partners with indie bookstores — emailed customers with a note from CEO Andy Hunter describing Amazon's sale as “a calculated move by a company that has already put half the bookstores in the country out of business, controls over 60% of the market and sells far more books than all indie bookstores combined.”

“The people at Amazon responsible for the timing of their ‘Book Sale' should be ashamed, but they are shameless,” Hunter said.

Amazon, however, released a statement describing the timing overlap as “unintentional”: “The dates for our sale were set this year to accommodate additional participating countries.”

Given the company's scale, it's certainly possible that Independent Bookstore Day barely registered with the people scheduling the sale. Even so, ABA CEO Allison Hill told Vulture, “At best it's insensitive and at worst it seems like a tactic to hurt small businesses.”

The company is feeling the pinch due to the newly introduced import tariffs

Hyte, a popular case manufacturer known for sleek designs like the Y60 and Y70 Touch, has temporarily paused shipments of certain products to the U.S. The move comes as the company prepares for new tariffs on Chinese-manufactured goods implemented by the Trump administration.

In a recent AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on Reddit, Hyte's Product Director, Rob Teller, said that while the company is still fulfilling open customer pre-orders, all other shipments have been paused or redirected to other regions. He also added that the company strives to be as transparent as possible regarding shipment timelines for delayed orders, though some uncertainty remains with their manufacturing partners.

A recent deep-dive video by Gamers Nexus on the ongoing tariffs fiasco gives more critical information. Hyte was quite transparent in sharing a complete cost breakdown of its Y40 PC case, where it is making a mere 5% profit, roughly $5 per unit sold before the tariffs. This means that any tariff increase would push the company into selling the product at a loss unless it raised prices.

While PC cases have been temporarily exempted from the newly announced 145% tariff on Chinese imports, they are still subject to pre-existing duties, including a 20% tariff on general imports and an additional 25% on aluminum derivative products. An extra 25% tariff under Section 301 is also expected to be implemented by the end of May. Meanwhile, other PC components like fans, coolers, and power supplies have not been spared, complicating matters for companies like Hyte that sell complete ecosystems of components.

Responding to a Gamers Nexus inquiry about why Hyte doesn't manufacture its products in the U.S. instead of China, Teller explained that the costs would be prohibitively high. Currently, Hyte is exploring plans to shift a significant portion of its production to Vietnam and Thailand, although even this move is expected to increase costs by an estimated 30–40%.

Teller reassured customers that Hyte is working on longer-term solutions, including shifting manufacturing where possible and adapting logistics strategies to minimize disruptions. However, if tariffs continue to impact costs, chances are that some price adjustments across Hyte's product lines might be unavoidable.

For now, customers in the U.S. with existing pre-orders can expect their shipments to arrive as planned. Still, those looking to purchase new Hyte products may face limited availability and potentially higher prices in the coming months.

There are still a couple of times a year when having a decent printer handy can be a lifesaver. Whether printing important documents, last-minute forms or vital reports, the need hasn't disappeared completely.

Instead of spending $500 on a pricey model, there is a better and less expensive option: the HP LaserJet M209d. This black and white compact laser printer is now available on Amazon for just $69, which is a huge 42% markdown from its original price of $119.

See at Amazon

The compact size of this laser printer enables it to find a comfortable home in any small work space or home office without occupying much real estate. Although small in stature, the HP M209d offers breathtaking speed and quality. With a print speed of up to 30 pages per minute for single-sided prints and up to 19 images per minute for automatic duplex printing, you'll not be kept waiting long for your documents to finish. The initial page is out in as little as 6.9 seconds.

The HP LaserJet M209d produces clear black-and-white prints at a resolution of 600 x 600 dpi which is perfect for text documents, forms, and business reports. The printer has a 150-sheet paper input tray, which means that you will not need to reload paper frequently – not even for large print jobs. The output tray can hold up to 100 sheets and the device supports numerous media sizes and types.

The HP LaserJet M209d is simple to install: The printer is plugged into your computer with the supplied USB cable and does not require complicated wireless installation. Only when required, smart-guided control panel buttons illuminate and allows simple usage even for those who are not tech-savvy. HP's Auto-On/Auto-Off technology makes the printer power efficient, switching on when in use and off when idle.

If you've been waiting for the perfect moment to upgrade your kitchen with a top-rated air fryer, now is the perfect time to act. The COSORI air fryer 9-in-1 is one of the most popular (if not the most popular) models on the market, and it is currently on sale for just $89 on Amazon.

This is only $2 cheaper than its record low price history and a huge decrease from its standard $119 price tag, so this sale is just too good to pass up. Over 20,000 units alone have sold so far this month, and clearly, this air fryer is a home cooking enthusiast who is looking for convenience.

See at Amazon

The COSORI 9-in-1 air fryer has a revolutionary TurboBlaze technology, boasting a 3600 rpm fan and up to 450°F temperatures. The combination of these two technologies yields perfectly crispy and juicy results whether air frying chicken wings, roasting vegetables or baking desserts. The higher airflow system and precise temperature control make sure each dish cooks with perfect consistency so you've consistent textures and flavors with every bite. With nine separate functions including air fry, roast, bake, broil, dehydrate, proof, reheat, frozen, and keep warm, this machine wipes out an array of kitchen appliances and enables you to experiment with an unlimited amount of recipes.

The COSORI's state-of-the-art five-fan speed design and wide temperature range of 90°F to 450°F let you cook slow-proofed dough to quickly crispy snacks. The compact yet spacious 6-quart square basket allows enough space to cook family-serving sizes without claiming too much precious counter real estate. Its deeper and broader build means you can prepare more in a single sitting which makes it ideal for families or those who love meal prep.

With TurboBlaze technology, cooking times are significantly less than with old-fashioned ovens or even other air fryers. This lets you cook perfectly crispy fries or a batch of chicken tenders in record time even on the most hectic weeknights. All that power and the air fryer still operates at under 53 dB so your kitchen is quiet and comfortable.

Health-conscious chefs will appreciate that this air fryer uses up to 95% less oil than deep frying so you can enjoy all your favorite crispy foods with a lot less guilt. The nonstick basket and the accessories are dishwasher-safe. A customizable preheat function offers the option to optimize results or skip preheating for an even faster start.

This COSORI air fryer is not frequently priced below $119, so to be able to get it today for $89 is a really great opportunity.

It needs so much more power than what the grid delivers.

The Colossus Supercomputer may be a colossal problem for the world's richest man.

Last July Elon Musk fired up the Colossus, a supercomputer that uses 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs on a single fabric. The site could draw only 7 MW at its launch, however, enough to power just 4% of its GPUs. To solve this, Musk deployed several massive mobile generators to deliver the site's electrical demands.

This was supposed to be a temporary solution. At the same time, the Memphis facility awaited approval from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for at least 50 MW of supply and the completion of its 150 MW substation (which was supposed to be finished by 4Q24).

It's already 2Q25, and Ars Technica reports that residents say the site is still using over 30 gas turbines, which “release harmful pollution that is tied to asthma, respiratory illnesses, and certain types of cancers.”

Currently, xAI has an ongoing application with the Memphis authorities for 15 turbines. But when the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) partnered with South Wings to photograph the site with thermal imaging cameras, they discovered over 30 hotspots, indicating the number of generators operating on the site.

These power sources operate without permits because a legal loophole allows generators to be used for 364 days without one. But with July 2025 coming quickly, xAI needs to have its applications approved. Otherwise, it risks slowing down its operations (or shutting down completely) without access to the electricity it needs for all its GPUs.

We have to note that we only spot eight bright hotspots on the image shared by Ars Technica, which probably indicates an operating generator. The other hotspots are dimmer, which might suggest that they're either idle or cooling down. So, it could be that these generators are being used in shifts to avoid excessive damage to a unit. Still, we cannot know how many are running concurrently until we see actual records.

The Colossus Supercomputer has already been approved for 150 MW, but experts say it needs at least 155 MW to run all 100,000 GPUs concurrently. Furthermore, Musk is aggressively expanding his AI dreams, and the site has doubled its computing power to 200,000 GPUs in just 92 days.

If xAI is running all of these AI GPUs simultaneously, it would require at least 310 MW of power — this doesn't include its miscellaneous power requirements, including electricity for lights, air conditioning, security systems, and more. With the tech billionaire reportedly raising more money to scale the site to a million GPUs, the Memphis site will likely require more power, at least 1.55 GW, to operate.

Residents are complaining because xAI uses multiple methane gas turbines to cover the shortfall in its electrical needs. They told Ars Technica that it “likely make[s] xAI the largest emitter of smog-forming” pollution, and that they're now working with the SELC to petition the Shelby County Health Department to reject xAI's gas generator applications. The latter's Pollution Control Branch has even scheduled a public hearing so that people living within the area can weigh in on the issue.

What's disconcerting is that flyers from an anonymous group called “Facts Over Fiction” have started appearing around the affected neighborhoods. These brochures claim that “xAI has low emissions” and that the turbines used on the site are “specially designed to protect the air we all breathe.” The people behind these notices cannot be traced directly back to xAI or Musk. Still, Justin Pearson, a Tennessee House of Representatives member, has urged local authorities to determine who was behind them.

Move over, PayPal mafia: There's a new tech mafia in Silicon Valley. As the startup behind ChatGPT, OpenAI is arguably the biggest AI player in town. Its meteoric rise to a $300 billion valuation has spurred many employees to leave the AI giant to create startups of their own.

The hype around OpenAI is so high that some of these startups, like Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence and Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab, have been able to raise billions of dollars without even launching a product. 

But there are lots of other startups in the OpenAI mafia ecosystem. These range from AI search giant Perplexity to xAI, the new owner of X (formerly Twitter.) There's also smaller outfits with some futuristic plans, like Living Carbon, which is creating plants that suck more carbon out of the atmosphere, or Prosper Robotics, which is building a robot butler.

Below is a roundup of the most notable startups founded by OpenAI alumni.

Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in 2021 to form their own startup, San Francisco-based Anthropic, that has long touted a focus on AI safety.  Later, OpenAI co-founder John Schulman joined Anthropic in 2024, pledging to build a “safe AGI.” OpenAI reportedly remains multiple times larger than Anthropic by revenue ($3.7 billion compared to $1 billion for 2024, The Information reported). But Anthropic has quickly grown to become OpenAI's biggest rival and was valued at $61.5 billion in March 2025.

OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever left OpenAI in May 2024 after he was reportedly part of a failed effort to replace CEO Sam Altman. Shortly afterward, he co-founded Safe Superintelligence, or SSI, with “one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence,” he says. Details about what exactly the startup is up to are scant: It has no product and no revenue yet. But investors are clamoring for a piece anyway, and it's been able to raise $2 billion, with its latest valuation reportedly rising to $32 billion this month. SSI is based in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel.

Mira Murati, OpenAI's CTO, left OpenAI last year to found her own company, Thinking Machines Lab, which emerged from stealth in February 2025, announcing (rather vaguely) that it will build AI that's more “customizable” and “capable.” The San Francisco AI startup has no product or revenue but plenty of former top OpenAI researchers and is reportedly in the process of raising a massive $2 billion seed round valuing it at $10 billion, minimum.

Aravind Srinivas worked as a research scientist at OpenAI for a year until 2022, when he left the company to co-found AI search engine Perplexity. His startup has attracted a string of high-profile investors like Jeff Bezos and Nvidia, although it's also caused controversy over alleged unethical web scraping. Perplexity, which is based in San Francisco, is currently raising about $1 billion at an $18 billion valuation as of March 2025. 

Kyle Kosic left OpenAI in 2023 to become a co-founder and infrastructure lead of xAI, Elon Musk's AI startup that offers a rival chatbot, Grok. In 2024, however, he hopped back to OpenAI. Palo Alto-based xAI recently acquired X, formerly Twitter, and gave the combined entity a valuation of $113 billion. The all-stock transaction raised some eyebrows but is a good deal if you're betting on Musk's empire.

Emmett Shear is the former CEO of Twitch who was OpenAI's interim CEO in November 2023 for a few days before Sam Altman rejoined the company. Shear is working on his own stealth startup, called Stem AI, TechCrunch revealed in 2024. Although there are few details about its activity and fundraising so far, it has already attracted funding from Andreessen Horowitz.

Computer vision expert Andrej Karpathy was a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI, leaving the startup to join Tesla in 2017 to lead its autopilot program. Karpathy is also well-known for his YouTube videos explaining core AI concepts. He left Tesla in 2024 to found his own education technology startup, Eureka Labs, a San Francisco-based startup that is building AI teaching assistants.

Jeff Arnold worked as OpenAI's head of operations for five months in 2016 before co-founding San Francisco-based accounting startup Pilot in 2017. Pilot, which focused initially on doing accounting for startups, last raised a $100 million Series C in 2021 at a $1.2 billion valuation and has attracted investors like Jeff Bezos. Arnold worked as Pilot's COO until leaving in 2024 to launch a VC fund.

David Luan was OpenAI's engineering VP until he left in 2020. After a stint at Google, in 2021 he co-founded Adept AI Labs, a startup that builds AI tools for employees. The startup last raised $350 million at a valuation north of $1 billion in 2023, but Luan left in late 2024 to oversee Amazon's AI agents lab after Amazon hired Adept's founders.

Tim Shi was an early member of OpenAI's team, where he focused on building safe artificial general intelligence (AGI), according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked at OpenAI for a year in 2017 but left to found Cresta, a San Francisco-based AI contact center startup that has raised over $270 million from VCs like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and others, according to a press release.

The trio all worked at OpenAI in 2016 and 2017 as research scientists before founding Covariant, a Berkeley, California-based startup that builds foundation AI models for robots. In 2024, Amazon hired all three of the Covariant founders and about a quarter of its staff. The quasi acquisition was viewed by some as part of a broader trend of Big Tech attempting to avoid antitrust scrutiny. 

Maddie Hall worked on “special projects” at OpenAI but left in 2019 to co-found Living Carbon, a San Francisco-based startup that aims to create engineered plants that can suck more carbon out of the sky to fight climate change. Living Carbon raised a $21 million Series A round in 2023, bringing its total funding until then to $36 million, according to a press release.

Shariq Hashme worked for OpenAI for 9 months in 2017 on a bot that could play the popular video game Dota, per his LinkedIn profile. After a few years at data-labeling startup Scale AI, he co-founded London-based Prosper Robotics in 2021. The startup says it's working on a robot butler for people's homes, a hot trend in robotics that other players like Norway's 1X and Texas-based Apptronik are also working on.

Jonas Schneider led OpenAI's software engineering for robotics team but left in 2019 to co-found Daedalus, which builds advanced factories for precision components. The San Francisco-based startup raised a $21 million Series A last year with backing from Khosla Ventures, among others.

Margaret Jennings worked at OpenAI in 2022 and 2023 until she left to co-found Kindo, which markets itself as an AI chatbot for enterprises. Kindo has raised over $27 million in funding, last raising a $20.6 million Series A in 2024. Jennings left Kindo in 2024 to head product and research at French AI startup Mistral, according to her LinkedIn profile.

If you've been considering swapping out your home sound system (or simply seeking a better way to watch movies), you need to take a good hard look at this sale on the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar.

Today, Amazon is offering this very popular soundbar for just $98 which is a record-low and a staggering 25% off its normal price ($129). With the tariffs increase looming that would soon enough apply to all electronics, having this type of deal now is a wise move not to be hurt by any shock later.

See at Amazon

The Sony S100F is an excellent choice if you're looking to upgrade the sound of your TV without the hassle of a traditional home theater system. Thin (35.5 inches wide by 2.5 inches high) but powerful, this soundbar delivers robust and clean sound from its 120W S-Master digital amplifier and 2.0 channel design. The S100F's internal Bass Reflex speaker lets you experience rich and punchy bass without sacrificing clarity. You will also love the S100F voice boost feature so that every word can be heard clearly and loudly.

It's super easy to install the S100F and the installation as straightforward and uncomplicated as it gets: It hooks into your TV via just an HDMI ARC cable, keeping things tidy and cable-free. You can also connect it using the supplied optical cable or USB input if you wish. The S-Force Pro Front Surround technology used in the soundbar creates a virtual surround sound for a sound that envelops your room but is much bigger than something of its size would provide.

One of the great things about the Sony S100F is that it is Bluetooth-enabled: That means the soundbar is not just for TV use-only-you can also plug in your smartphone or laptop and use it as a powerful wireless speaker. The Bluetooth connectivity makes it very convenient. The soundbar also supports USB playback so you can plug in a flash drive and play your favorite albums immediately.

While tariffs on electronics rise, those kinds of sales are not common. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock.

Who hasn't been left stranded with a dead phone in the worst possible moment? If you're traveling, working late hours or just hanging with friends, a dead battery is a real nuisance. The good news is that now there's an inexpensive way to guarantee you'll never again go through that inconvenience. For just $15 on Amazon, down from $24 (36% off the normal price), you can buy the INIU portable charger which is one of the top-rated power banks on the market.

See at Amazon

What's really amazing about this deal isn't the price but the quality and features packed into such a small package. This charger is the thinnest 10,000mAh power bank available on the market right now, just 0.5 inches thick. That means it can slip into any pocket, bag or backpack and is perfect for daily commutes or extended flights. Despite its ultra-slim profile, this power bank packs enough juice to fully recharge all the latest iPhone 16, Galaxy S25 and more, several times.

The speed is also very impressive: Because of its 3A high-speed charging, you can charge your phone up to 78% in an hour twice as fast as with most standard chargers. Power bank's AutoFit technology automatically detects and delivers the optimal charging speed for your device so you get the fastest (and safest) charge every time.

Safety is INIU's top priority and this power bank has a unique 15-layer SmartProtect system: The advanced safety net guards against overheating, overcharging, and damaging your batteries so that you can charge your devices with complete confidence. There's also a top-tier three-year warranty which gives you confidence that this power bank is built to last and will keep your devices safe.

As you'd probably imagine, this power bank is compatible with most devices including the latest iPhones and Samsung Galaxies, Pixels, iPads, Bluetooth headphones, fitness trackers, and more. Whether you have to charge your phone, tablet or even smaller devices like AirPods and smartwatches, the INIU power bank will be able to accommodate that.

Deals this good don't last long – and with this charger, you'll never have to worry about running out of battery again.

Offers six Zen 3+ cores and the Radeon 660M iGPU.

The Ryzen 5 7533HS is a new Rembrandt-R-based APU that AMD quietly introduced to the market last year and is just now appearing in budget laptops via realVictor_M at X. To clarify, this isn't exactly a brand-new chip; it is simply a rebadged Ryzen 5 7535HS, with lower boost clocks and presumably a more attractive price tag for partner(s).

The Ryzen 5 7533HS breaks away from AMD's original naming convention for the Ryzen 7000/8000 series, where the last digit was used to indicate versions within an architecture ('0' for the lower model and '5' for the upper model), like Zen 3 (7530) versus Zen 3+ (7535). This isn't entirely surprising as AMD has a history of abandoning naming schemes, evident with their latest shift to "Ryzen AI". The Ryzen 5 7533HS is tagged under the Rembrandt-R family, with Zen 3+ cores and an RDNA 2-based iGPU.

In terms of specifications, the Ryzen 5 7533HS is nothing special. It wields a six-core / twelve-thread layout, along with 3MB of L2 and 16MB of L3 cache. The included Radeon 660M iGPU offers six RDNA2-based Compute Units. There's a 150 MHz drop in boost clocks compared to the Ryzen 5 7535HS. As the 'HS' modifier indicates, the APU has a configurable TDP between 35W and 54W, with support for DDR5-4800 (SODIMM) and LPDDR5-6400 (Soldered RAM) memory types.

While the Ryzen 5 7533HS won't certainly top any performance charts, it still appears to be a solid choice for affordable laptops. On that note, this chip has only appeared in several of Lenovo's newest laptops, like the ThinkBook 16 Gen 7, IdeaPad Slim 3/5, just to name a few. This strongly hints at Lenovo exclusivity, and that's not surprising considering that rumors suggest AMD's latest Ryzen Z2 Go, launched in January, was developed explicitly for Lenovo's Legion Go S.

As it stands, AMD's mobile portfolio looks something like this (in order of descending price and performance): Strix Halo (Ryzen AI Max), Strix Point (Ryzen AI 360/370), Krackan Point (Ryzen AI 340/350), Hawk Point (Ryzen 200), and Rembrandt-R (Ryzen 7035). There might be some shuffling with a potential Gorgon Point (Strix Point Refresh), but don't expect any massive changes until Medusa Point (Zen 6 APUs).

Fujifilm's Instax cameras have taken over what Polaroid started so many decades ago. There are still Polaroid cameras, but Instax is the far more popular choice. Fujifilm's cameras are simple and fun. No matter which Instax camera you buy, it's fun. You point, you shoot, you see the results.

The latest in Fujifilm's Instax line is the new Instax Mini 41, a budget option like the very popular Mini 12, but with a more retro, camera-like design. It lacks the manual controls that photographers might want, but it's simple and fun in a way that more capable cameras often aren't.

The Mini 41 is a very plastic camera, though it doesn't look like it. The design makes it look a little like Fujifilm's insanely popular X100VI. Once you pick up the Mini 41, however, the plastic really comes out. It feels like an Instax Mini 12 in a different suit of clothes. This is both good and bad. It's good in that the simplicity and automation remain, but it's not so good in that the plasticky vibes are strong. This is definitely not the Mini 99.

The Mini 12 comes in at $80, the Mini 99 is $200, and the Mini 41 arrives at $129. Why spend more than $80 for nearly the same features? Essentially, you get a camera that looks more like a “camera.” It still has the same fully automatic features of the Mini 12, (including some not-so-good features, like the automated flash that occasionally washes out photos in bright daylight), but it doesn't have the bubbly cartoonish design of the Mini 12.

The old-school camera styling extends to some plastic knurling on the body and around the lens. This is perhaps where the plasticness comes out the most. The minute you touch it, it feels not like actual knurling but like plastic imitating knurling. If that makes sense. Baudrillard would love it. I found it functional enough, if not entirely pleasant to hold.

One big improvement over the previous model is the new lens design, which matches what we've seen in nearly every Instax released in the past year. The lens twists to turn on, then twists further if you want to put it in close-focus mode. This is simple and intuitive and much better than the push level approach of the Mini 40.

This lens offers parallax correction as well, which helps center close-up images (including selfies) by adjusting the position of the “focus” mark in the viewfinder. And fear not, kids, there is still a selfie mirror on the side of the lens.

The Mini 41 is indeed mini, measuring 4.8 by 4 inches and only 2.4 inches deep. It weighs just under a pound (15.1 ounces) with batteries and film loaded. It probably won't fit in your pant's pocket, but it was small enough that I carried it around in a jacket pocket. The batteries are AA, which is nice. Grab yourself a four-pack of rechargable AAs and you'll never have to worry about replacing the batteries.

Images eject out of the top of the camera and take about a minute and half to develop. I found the automatic focus worked well, and adjusting between normal range and close focus gives you a little extra control. (Be careful, though. The images where I did miss focus were all images where I forgot that I had it in close-focus mode.)

Ostensibly, picture quality should be on par with the Mini 12, and in many situations it is, but the Mini 41 also produced the single best image I've ever taken with an Instax camera. Call it a fluke if you want, or perhaps it was just the right combination of elements that make for a great Instax image. I kind of doubt either of those explanations, though, because I shot it into the rising sun and somehow ended up with a great image. Whatever the case, I love that image. Unfortunately my dog did, too. It's the image above with tooth marks in it—a strong argument for the Mini Evo, which would have a digital copy and allow me to reprint.

The wallet-sized image area (1.8 by 2.4 inches) of Instax Mini film does not lend itself to complex photographic compositions but should feel very familiar to anyone used to shooting portrait-oriented images, which is to say everyone. It's also the cheapest film at just over $1 per print.

If you want a budget Instax camera, with fully automatic controls that looks good and is simple to use, the new Mini 41 fits the bill. For anyone who wanted the Mini 12 but didn't want to carry around the Mini 12, this is the camera to get.

The changes from the previous model (most notably the on/off mechanism) make this a better choice. On the other hand, if you want any manual control or creative options, you'll want to look at more expensive Instax models like the Mini 99 ($200) or the Mini Evo ($200).

It is extremely difficult to find a high-quality electric scooter for under $200 anymore, especially in 2025 when the most popular ones easily cost over $500.

But Amazon is currently offering the Maxshot electric scooter for just $199 which is a huge 29% discount from its regular price of $279. This great deal has made it the #1 best seller in its category and shows just how popular (and value-for-money) this scooter is. Also keep in mind that this is the record low price for this model.

See at Amazon

The Maxshot electric scooter is built to meet the needs of daily commuters and weekend adventurers. It is fitted with 8.5-inch tires, for a smooth and stable ride on urban roads and rough surfaces. The scooter comes in models with a 350W motor which allows riders the choice of the power and speed level that suits their lifestyle. At a top speed of 19 to 22 mph, it's fast enough to keep up with city traffic but slow and safe enough to maneuver for most adults.

Depending on your journey, you can ride anywhere between 21 to 28 miles per charge which is more than most people commute, run errands or enjoy leisure rides for each day. The dual suspension provides you with a smooth ride even on bumpier roads and holds fold which makes it easy to carry onto public transportation or store in small crevices at home or in the office.

The Maxshot scooter also comes equipped with a smart app so that you can monitor speed, battery, and ride statistics from your smartphone. That level of connectivity is typically reserved on much more expensive scooters so it's even more astonishing to see it featured here at this $200 price point. Safety hasn't been left behind either: there is decent braking and decent lights for nighttime riding or low-light conditions.

If you've been waiting for the ideal moment to invest in an electric scooter, this is the opportunity you really don't want (and should not) to miss. Deals like this, especially on a best-selling and feature-packed model, don't come around frequently. At $199, this electric scooter offers a combination of performance, range, and smart features that's practically never found at this price.

If you're looking to turbocharge your PC, laptop, or PlayStation 5 with the kind of storage performance that leaves loading screens in the dust, now's your chance to do it! Amazon's Easter weekend flash sales have dropped the Samsung 990 PRO 2TB internal SSD to just $169 which is a massive 32% off its usual $249. And if your storage needs are a little more modest, the 1TB version is also on sale for a low $99, a great 38% discount from its regular price of $159. The 4TB model is at $299 down from $464. With upcoming tariff hikes likely push electronics prices even higher in the US, this is a great opportunity you should not miss.

The 2TB Samsung 990 PRO is the undisputed star of this flash sale: It's not just the abundance of storage that makes it stand out but also the sheer performance packed into this slender M.2 drive. With up to 7,450 MB/s sequential reads and up to 6,900 MB/s sequential writes, it's built to take full advantage of the PCIe 4.0 interface and makes it perect for everything from massive game libraries and 4K video editing projects to lightning-quick system load times.

Random read and write speeds reach as high as 1.4 million and 1.55 million IOPS, respectively, which means you'll experience nearly instantaneous file transfers and app launches even when juggling huge datasets. Samsung's V-NAND technology and a robust 2GB DDR4 cache ensure that performance remains consistent even during long and intensive sessions.

What you will absolutely love about the Samsung 990 PRO (be it the 1 or 2TB model) is its power efficiency: You get up to 50% more performance per watt over the previous 980 PRO, all while remaining cool thanks to Samsung's smart nickel-coated controller and improved thermal control. This drive is built to last, too, with a 1,200 TBW endurance rating and a five-year warranty that makes it a good investment if you need storage that will be able to keep up with years of heavy use. If you're a gamer, you will appreciate up to 65% improved random performance for faster load times.

Keep in mind that the 1TB and 2TB capacities are all supported by Samsung's Magician software which offers easy access to optimization tools, health indication, and firmware updates to ensure your SSD continues to perform at its best.

These short-term sales are well-timed given the current market scenario. With tariff increases just around the corner, prices of high-end electronics like SSDs are going to increase massively in the near future. Amazon's Easter weekend sale is maybe the last-chance to grab these high-end drives at a fraction of their usual price before new stock arrives at increased prices. Even compared to Black Friday, these deals stand out as some of the best we've seen all year.

Portable power stations such as the EcoFlow (or Anker Solix) have been hugely popular over the last decade-and with good reason: They provide a secure supply of electricity wherever you are which makes them vital for emergencies and ideal for boosting your holidays. With summer just around the corner, having a reliable source of power in reserve is more essential than ever whether you're camping, road-tripping or just taking in the great outdoors.

Right now, Amazon has reduced the EcoFlow Delta 2 to its Black Friday deal which is a great excellent opportunity to purchase this power station at a record low price : The regular-priced $699 Delta 2 is now being offered at just $449 as an instant price reduction. But wait, there's more: Amazon is also tacking on a 10% off coupon that's automatically applied during checkout which brings the final price down to an all-time low of $405, down from $699. This is the lowest price ever listed for this model.

See at Amazon

The EcoFlow Delta 2 features an amazing 1024Wh battery with long lifespan and high capacity. Most portable batteries don't last, but the Delta 2 is built to endure with a battery chemistry that will survive over 3000 full charge cycles before it will drop to 80% capacity. That means you can rely on it for years of heavy use whether charging up at home or on the go.

Summer is the perfect season for outdoor fun and the Delta 2 is designed to make that fun even better. Taking a weekend camping trip? The Delta 2 can charge your mini-fridge, lights, fans, and even small cooking appliances. Its 1800W AC output can power more than 90% of home devices so you can bring the comforts of home to the great outdoors. Heading to the beach or park picnic? The Delta 2's multiple USB and AC receptacles (15 outlets!) ensure you can keep all devices charged, from cell phones and tablets to speakers and cameras.

Delta 2 is an RV user and road tripper's lifesaver. It's small enough to fit into your vehicle and can be charged through a variety of means including solar panels (optional), wall outlets, or even your car's 12V outlet. Because it's able to charge from 0 to 80% in just 50 minutes, you won't be sitting around for long before you're back on the road. And if you're hosting a summer garden party or barbecue, the Delta 2 can power lights and music systems (and a lot more) so that the fun doesn't stop when the sun goes down.

Apart from recreation, the Delta 2 is a reliable backup power source for outages and emergencies: It is stored safely with its smart battery management system and expandable capacity allows you to add more batteries for longer power supply if needed. You can even monitor and control the Deta 2 remotely using the EcoFlow app whether you're connected with Wi-Fi or off the grid using Bluetooth.

If you desire to enjoy the best of your summer activities and be ready for whatever comes next, it's time now to grab the Delta 2 before this record-breaking sale vanishes. Keep in mind that the Delta 2 is the most popular model at EcoFlow, and that at current price point, it's a lot cheaper that its rival from Anker.

This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The tricky thing about generating electricity is that for the most part, you pretty much have to use it or lose it.

This fundamental fact has governed and constrained the development of the world's largest machine: the $2 trillion US power grid. Massive generators send electrons along a continent-wide network of conductors, transformers, cables, and wires into millions of homes and businesses, delicately balancing supply and demand so that every light switch, computer, television, stove, and charging cable will turn on 99.95 percent of the time.

Making sure there are always enough generators spooled up to send electricity to every single power outlet in the country requires precise coordination. And while the amount of electricity actually used can swing drastically throughout the day and year, the grid is built to meet the brief periods of peak demand, like the hot summer days when air conditioning use can double average electricity consumption. Imagine building a 30-lane highway to make sure no driver ever has to tap their brakes. That's effectively what those who design and run the grid have had to do.

But what if you could just hold onto electricity for a bit and save it for later? You wouldn't have to overbuild the grid or spend so much effort keeping power generation in equilibrium with users. You could smooth over the drawbacks of intermittent power sources that don't emit carbon dioxide, like wind and solar. You could have easy local backup power in emergencies when transmission lines are damaged. You may not even need a giant, centralized power grid at all.

That's the promise of grid-scale energy storage. And while the US has actually been using a crude form of energy storage called pumped hydroelectric power storage for decades, the country is now experiencing a gargantuan surge in energy storage capacity, this time from a technology that most of us are carrying around in our pockets: lithium-ion batteries. Between 2021 and 2024, grid battery capacity increased fivefold. In 2024, the US installed 12.3 gigawatts of energy storage. This year, new grid battery installations are on track to almost double compared to last year. Battery storage capacity now exceeds pumped hydro capacity, totaling more than 26 gigawatts.

There's still plenty of room to expand—and a pressing need to do so. The power sector remains the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and there will be no way to add enough intermittent clean energy to sufficiently decarbonize the grid without cheap and plentiful storage.

The aging US grid is also in dire need of upgrades, and batteries can cushion the shock of adding gigawatts of wind and solar while buying some time to perform more extensive renovations. Some power markets are finally starting to understand all the services batteries can provide—frequency regulation, peak shaving, demand response—creating new lines of business. Batteries are also a key tool in building smaller, localized versions of the power grid. These microgrids can power remote communities with reliable power and one day shift the entire power grid into a more decentralized system that can better withstand disruptions like extreme weather.

If we can get it right, true grid-scale battery storage won't just be an enabler of clean energy, but a way to upgrade the power system for a new era.

Back in 2011, one of my first reporting assignments was heading to a wind farm in West Virginia to attend the inauguration of what was at the time the world's largest battery energy storage system. Built by AES Energy Storage, it involved thousands of lithium-ion cells in storage containers that together combined to provide 32 megawatts of power and deliver it for about 15 minutes.

“It was eight megawatt-hours total,” said John Zahurancik, who was vice president of AES Energy Storage at the time and showed me around the facility back then. That was about the amount of electricity used by 260 homes in a day.

In the years since, battery storage has increased by orders of magnitude, as Zahurancik's new job demonstrates. He is now the president of Fluence, a joint venture between AES and Siemens that has deployed 38 gigawatt-hours of storage to date around the world. “The things that we're building today, many of our projects are over a gigawatt-hour in size,” Zahurancik said.

Last year, the largest storage facility to come online in the US was California's Edwards & Sanborn Project, which can dispatch 33 GW for several hours. That's roughly equivalent to the electricity needed to power 4.4 million homes for a day.

It wasn't a steady climb to this point, however. Overall grid battery capacity in the US barely budged for more than a decade. Then, around 2020, it began to spike upward. What changed?

One shift is that the most common battery storage technology, lithium-ion cells, saw huge price drops and energy density increases. “The very first project we did was in 2008 and it was on the order of $3,000 a kilowatt-hour for the price of the batteries,” said Zahurancik. “Now we're looking at systems that are on the order of $150, $200 a kilowatt-hour for the full system install.”

That's partly because the cells on the power grid aren't that different from those in mobile devices and electric vehicles, so grid batteries have benefited from manufacturing improvements that went into those products.

“It's all one big pipeline,” said Micah Ziegler, a professor at Georgia Tech who studies clean energy technologies. “The batteries in phones, cars, and the grid all share common characteristics.” Seeing this rising demand, China went big on battery manufacturing and, much as it did in solar panels, created economies of scale to drive global prices down. China now produces 80 percent of the world's lithium-ion batteries.

The blooming of wind and solar energy created even more demand for batteries and increased the pressure to improve them. The wind and the sun are often the cheapest sources of new electricity, and batteries help compensate for their variability, providing even more reason to scale up storage. “The benefits of this relationship are apparent in the increasing number of power plants that are being proposed and that have already been deployed that combine these resources,” Ziegler said. The combination of solar plus storage accounted for 84 percent of new US power added in 2024.

And because grid batteries don't have to be small enough to be mobile—unlike the batteries in your laptop or phone—they can take advantage of cheaper, less dense batteries that otherwise might not be suited for something that has to fit in your pocket. There's even talk of giving old EV batteries a second life on the power grid.

Regulation has also helped. A major hurdle for deploying grid energy storage systems is that they don't generate electricity on their own, so the rules for how they should connect to the grid and how much battery developers should get paid for their services were messy and restrictive in the past. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order 841 removed some of the barriers for energy storage systems to plug into wholesale markets and compete with other forms of power. Though the regulation was issued in 2018, it cleared a major legal challenge in 2020, paving the way for more batteries to plug into the grid.

Eleven states to date including California, Illinois, and Maryland have also set specific procurement targets for energy storage, which require utilities to install a certain amount of storage capacity, creating a push for more grid batteries. Together, these factors created a whole new businesses for power companies, spawned new grid battery companies, and fertilized the ground for a bumper crop of energy storage.

Energy storage is the peanut butter to the chocolate of renewable energy, making all the best traits about clean energy even better and balancing out some of its downsides. But it's also an important ingredient in grid stability, reliability, and resilience, helping ensure a steady flow of megawatts during blackouts and extreme weather.

The most common use is frequency response. The alternating current going through power lines in the US cycles at a frequency of 60 hertz. If the grid dips below this frequency when a power-hungry user switches on, it can trip circuit breakers and cause power instability. Since batteries have nearly zero startup time, unlike thermal generators, they can quickly absorb or transmit power as needed to keep the grid humming the right tune.

Grid batteries can also step in as reserve power when a generator goes offline or when a large power user unexpectedly turns on. They can smooth out the hills and valleys of power load over the course of the day. They also let power providers save electricity when it's cheap to produce, and sell it back on the grid at times when demand is high and power is expensive. It's often faster to build a battery facility than an equivalent power plant, and since there are no smokestacks, it's easier to get permits and approvals.

Batteries have already proven useful for overstressed power networks. As temperatures reached triple digits in Texas last year, batteries provided a record amount of power on the Lone Star State's grid. ERCOT, the Texas grid operator, didn't have to ask Texans to turn down their power use like it did in 2023. Between 2020 and 2024, Texas saw a 4,100 percent increase in utility-scale batteries, topping 5.7 gigawatts.

Grid batteries have a halo effect for other power generators too. Most thermal power plants—coal, gas, nuclear—prefer to run at a steady pace. Ramping up and down to match demand takes time and costs money, but with batteries soaking up some of the variability, thermal power plants can stay closer to their most efficient pace, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping costs in check.

“It's kind of like hybridizing your car,” Zahurancik said. “If you think about a Prius, you have an electric motor and you have a gasoline motor and you make the gas consumption better because the battery absorbs all the variation.”

Another grid battery feature is that they can reduce the need for expensive grid upgrades, said Stephanie Smith, chief operating officer at Eolian, which funds and develops grid energy storage systems. You don't have to build power lines to accommodate absolute maximum electricity needs if you have a battery—on the generator side or on the demand side—to dish out a few more electrons when needed.

“What we do with stand-alone batteries, the more and more of those you get, you start to alleviate needs or at least abridge things like new transmission build,” Smith said. These batteries also allow the grid to adapt faster to changing energy needs, like when a factory shuts down or when a new data center powers up.

On balance this leads to a more stable, efficient, cheaper, and cleaner power grid.

As good as they are, lithium-ion batteries have their limits. Most grid batteries are designed to store and dispatch electricity over the course of two to eight hours, but the grid also needs ways to stash power for days, weeks, and even months since power demand shifts throughout the year.

There are also some fundamental looming challenges for grid-scale storage. Like most grid-level technologies, energy storage requires a big upfront investment that takes decades to pay back, but there's a lot of uncertainty right now about how the Trump administration's tariffs will affect battery imports, whether there will be a recession, and if this disruption will slow electricity demand growth in the years to come. The extraordinary appetite for batteries is increasing competition for the required raw materials, which may increase their prices.

Though China currently dominates the global battery supply chain, the US is working to edge its way in. Under the previous administration, the US Department of Energy invested billions in energy storage factories, supply chains, and research. There are dozens of battery factories in the US now, though most are aimed at electric vehicles. There are 10 US factories slated to start up this year, which would raise the total EV battery manufacturing capacity to 421.5 gigawatt-hours per year. Total global battery manufacturing is projected to reach around 7,900 gigawatt-hours in 2025.

There's also a long and growing line of projects waiting to connect to the power grid. Interconnection queues for all energy systems, but particularly solar, wind, and batteries, typically last three years or more as project developers produce reliability studies and cope with mounting regulatory paperwork delays.

The Trump administration is also working to undo incentives around clean energy, particularly the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The law established robust incentives for clean energy, including tax credits for stand-alone grid energy projects. “I do worry about the IRA because it will change the curve, and quite honestly we cannot afford to change the curve right now with any form of clean energy,” Smith said. On the other hand, Trump's tariffs may eventually spur even more battery manufacturing within the US.

Still, utility-scale energy storage is a tiny slice of the sprawling US power grid, and there's enormous room to expand. “Even though we've been accelerating and going fast, by and large, we don't have that much of it,” Zahurancik said. “You could easily see storage becoming 20 or 30 percent of the installed power capacity.”

At a speedy event in New York City this week, Roku announced its plans for 2025, which includes two new streaming sticks, some nice software updates, and upgrades to its top two Roku TVs—most notably the value-forward Plus Series.

The new Roku Streaming Stick has two big selling points—it's compact and it's $30, but like the previous Roku Express, it's confined to HD content. That limits its value, but it could make a solid addition to a small den or kitchen TV, thanks to the addition of the Roku voice remote for searching across the breezy streaming platform. For $10 more, the similarly slim 4K UHD Streaming Stick Plus is the hotter value. Both devices can be powered by most TVs directly, meaning no need to plug them into a wall outlet, and they include new software features like a “Coming Soon to Theaters” row and personalized sports highlights.

On the TV front, Roku's top-line Pro Series TVs get a modest update, including “custom factory calibration” to ensure a more accurate picture. However, it's the affordable Plus Series that receives the more significant makeover, including the addition of mini-LED backlighting. While we'll have to put it to the test, this should help improve dimming control for better contrast and deeper black levels with less light bleed. All Roku TVs will also now include a Bluetooth headphone mode for quick sound swapping.

The new streaming sticks are available for preorder and are expected to ship on May 6, while Roku will announce new TV pricing and availability later this year. —Ryan Waniata

Meta has announced the rollout of its AI-powered real-time translation feature for the Meta Ray-Bans smart glasses to all markets. That means if you're traveling to another country, you can download the language pack and hold conversations in English, French, Italian, or Spanish without connecting to Wi-Fi or a cellular network. Just say “Hey Meta, start live translation” and you'll hear them talking in your preferred language through the speakers in the glasses, while the other person can view a translated transcript on your phone.

I've experienced Meta's translation with text before and found it adequate for reading my children's books in Spanish; Meta AI even offered, unprompted, some funny insights. When traveling, my coworker Kate Knibbs discovered that live translation is a little awkward when it's limited to the written word. Live translation with other speakers should make it much more useful.

The company also announced new frame styles and colors, like the Skyler cat-eye style in chalky gray, as well as a few more software features. You'll now be able to send and receive messages from Instagram on your glasses, ask Meta AI to play music from an expanded list of music apps (as long as you ask in English), or ask Meta AI to identify songs in passing. Meta is also expanding access to Meta AI in other countries in the European Union, as well as launching the glasses themselves in Mexico, India, and the United Arab Emirates. —Adrienne So

Kia EVs are finally part of the Tesla Supercharger club, the company has confirmed, and its cars can now access more than 21,500 of Tesla's DC fast chargers in North America.

The move, which was originally approved in January, expands Kia's charging network by more than 80 percent and sees the automaker joining the likes of Ford, Rivian, Volvo, and Mercedes-Benz in tapping into Tesla's resources.

As part of the move, the company announced that its refreshed 2025 EV6 and the 2026 EV9 will come with Tesla-compatible NACS connectors, but existing Kia EV owners with a CCS1 charging port can get adapters from their dealer. —Verity Burns

Anyone for coffee? This week, Cuisinart announced what it's touting as its very first espresso bar collection—a Mama, Papa, and Baby Bear of three bottomless portafilter machines. The range starts with a vanishingly slim profile, 15-bar EM-160 Espresso Bar Slim retailing at $230, and tops out with a $600 “Grind and Brew” EM-640 model with 16 espresso grind settings. The mid-sized $300 machine, EM-320, doesn't have a grinder but adds 5 bars of pressure compared to the Slim.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

This is hardly Cuisinart's first foray into espresso, but it does amount to a bit of a reboot for the American brand. Each device in the Espresso Bar collection comes equipped with a frothing wand, a 52-millimeter stainless steel bottomless portafilter, and an option on cold-extracted espresso for iced lattes or martini lovers. The devices offer a fairly tall profile: Cuisinart advertises that each will allow room for a 20-ounce travel mug. Likely the most distinctive of the three machines, the lowest-priced “Slim” device is less than 7 inches wide.

Tuesday was the official launch for the new line, but retailers like Williams-Sonoma and Crate & Barrel quietly added the Cuisinart appliances to their websites in mid-April—an increasingly common strategy from manufacturers who want advance reviews on retailer websites by the time the company's PR officially declares liftoff. —Matthew Korfhage

The coffee news doesn't stop there. With the fanfare and tightly controlled pre-hype usually reserved for iPhone launches, San Francisco coffee device maker Fellow announced its first espresso machine. The retro-futuristic-looking Espresso Series 1 comes in black, cherry red, or malted chocolate. It offers adaptive pressure at the coffee puck, guided brewing, and a steam wand with a thermostat that stops frothing at the designated temp.

Fellow reserved its biggest excitement for the Espresso Series 1's patented new boiler system, which the company says will offer what it calls the “holy grail of espresso”—true temperature and pressure stability, in a home espresso machine market best known for wild fluctuations and slow heat-ups.

The company's research and development head, Nick Terzulli, explained the tech at a livestreamed launch event from the company's San Francisco office. The new “boosted boiler” involves three independent heating elements combining fast heating with a thermal mass heater, a mini-boiler, and a heated group head for tight temperature control at the output. With all three in concert, Terzulli says, you can achieve the thermal stability of a commercial dual boiler on a 120-volt circuit, with less than two minutes heating time. “If you understand physics, you understand why my head is exploding inside my body, right?” Terzulli said.

The device costs $1,500, but anyone who buys during the first two weeks of the presale can reserve the Espresso Series 1 for $1,200 and get $100 in free coffee. —Matthew Korfhage

Strange things are happening over at Duolingo's headquarters. After its infamous green owl mascot faked his death earlier this year, the language learning app continues its abnormal behavior and wants to teach a new subject that transcends language: chess. It's still in early testing with a limited number of Duolingo users, but it will roll out to iOS in English in the coming weeks, with other platforms to follow in the following months.

OK, teaching chess isn't all that abnormal for Duolingo. The company began its first non-language courses in 2023 with music and math. Chess is the latest, and it continues the signature gamified learning experience the app is known for. The course is built for people who might find the game intimidating and starts with basics like how each piece moves, patterns, and strategies. You can play fast-paced mini-matches to hone your skills or full games against Duolingo's in-app chess coach.

Elon Musk's xAI Holdings is in talks to raise $20 billion in fresh funding, potentially valuing the AI and social media combo at over $120 billion, according to a new Bloomberg report that says talks are in the “early stages.” If successful, the deal would be the second-largest startup funding round ever, behind only OpenAI's $40 billion raise last month.

The funding could help alleviate X's substantial debt burden, which is costing the company a whopping $200 million monthly in servicing fees, per Bloomberg's sources, with annual interest expenses exceeding $1.3 billion by the end of last year.

A raise of this size would also showcase AI's continued investor appeal, as well as reflect Musk's surprising emergence as a political power player inside President Trump's White House.

Musk will likely draw from some of the same backers who've consistently funded his ventures, from Tesla to SpaceX, including Antonio Gracias of Valor Equity Partners and Luke Nosek of Gigafund. Gracias has even taken on a role as a lieutenant in Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.

xAI didn't respond immediately to comment.

As the opioid crisis continues, the number of babies born with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) – a condition that affects infants whose mothers used opioids during pregnancy – has risen 5-fold over the past 20 years. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there are 20,000 infants a year in the United States born with signs of NOWS. These infants often require extended hospital stays and, in some cases, treatment with medications like morphine to relieve withdrawal symptoms.

A new study from Walter Kraft, MD, an internist and clinical pharmacologist at Thomas Jefferson University, and his team further explored the potential of ondansetron, a medication commonly used to treat nausea and considered safe during pregnancy, to help reduce withdrawal symptoms in newborns with NOWS.

The research expands on data from Dr. Kraft's previous work, along with collaborators at Stanford University, of a clinical trial conducted at Jefferson and other sites. That study explored the impact of ondansetron in 90 infants and found that it significantly reduced the severity of withdrawal symptoms. 

The current investigation, led by first author Kevin Lam, PharmD, used Bayesian population pharmacokinetic modeling – a mathematical method that describes how different patients process a drug – to identify the concentration of ondansetron that would lead to symptom relief. The model can be used to simulate optimized ondansetron doses.

In the past, we might have used gut intuition and said, 'Let's just double the dose'. Now we can use mathematical modeling to be much more likely to find an effective dose and require fewer patients to enroll in a clinical trial."

Dr. Kraft, who is also a faculty member at Sidney Kimmel Medical College, says his team is seeking funding for future clinical trials to explore whether ondansetron can reduce the number of symptoms experienced by infants with NOWS or shorten their hospital stay.

"This is a complex medical and societal issue. There's unlikely to be a single solution," Dr. Kraft said. "We're optimistic that ondansetron may be part of a multi-pronged approach to improving care for these infants."

Manchester City mean business when they will travel to the United States to participate in the FIFA Club World Cup between June and July, defender Josko Gvardiol has stressed.

The Premier League champions will represent England at the 32-club tournament alongside Chelsea in a bid to secure another piece of silverware and finish what has been a largely underwhelming campaign on a high.

Kevin De Bruyne is not expected to feature for Pep Guardiola's side in any capacity at the Club World Cup, with the 33-year-old Belgian expected to part ways with Manchester City as the ongoing league campaign finishes.

     

However, City can still finish in the top five in the Premier League to secure Champions League football for the 2025-26 season and go on to win the FA Cup for an eighth time in the club's history if they get past Nottingham Forest in the semi-final at Wembley on Sunday.

After a mixed bag season, Josko Gvardiol is looking forward to the Club World Cup and has doubled down on the importance of the tournament, stating that Manchester City will not slack off when they are in the United States.

“I can't wait to have the opportunity to play there and maybe to achieve something really special,” the 23-year-old said in a recent interview with FIFA, as quoted by Manchester City's official website.

“Of course, everyone wants to lift the trophy, but there is only one team who can lift it. Hopefully, we can be that one team, especially after the whole season and what we've been through.

“We're not going there for a holiday or a vacation. We're going there for a new challenge, to try to achieve something and to win a trophy. Last year, we went on pre-season in America. I didn't expect we'd have so many fans there! When we went for a walk in New York, and there were just so many people following us.

“This tournament is something a bit different. We're going to have the opportunity to see how the atmosphere is from fans around the world. I think there will be a good atmosphere, not just at the stadiums, but also around the cities. It's going to be really beautiful.”

In a world where image is currency, Qatar has built itself a gleaming facade. From hosting the 2022 World Cup to owning elite clubs like Paris Saint-Germain and pouring billions into European football leagues, this small Gulf nation has placed itself center stage on the global map.But behind the glittering surface of stadiums, billboards, and superstar athletes lies a far more troubling reality. According to multiple reports in the American press, Qatar is not just an emerging sports powerhouse; it is also a key player in financing international terrorism. And sports, it seems, are a convenient smokescreen.  As early as 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported: “Qatar is playing a double game – on one hand presenting itself as a modern global hub and on the other, continuing to funnel money to terror groups like Hamas and al-Qaeda.”Is the soccer field being used as a political tool?Ahead of the 2022 World Cup, The New York Times noted that “Qatar's use of soccer is not just a marketing tactic – it is a political instrument for shaping a new global narrative.” Football is no longer just a pastime or investment; it is a statecraft strategy.

Beyond sports, Qatar has made massive investments in Western media and infrastructure – including direct stakes in ESPN, hotel chains in London, real estate in Manhattan, and global advertising networks – all designed to secure vast cultural influence.

How can the world's leading superpower allow this tiny nation to serve as a lifeline for extremist Islam? Qatar often labels its financial transfers to Gaza as “humanitarian aid.” However, a 2020 US Treasury report revealed that significant portions of those funds ended up in the hands of Hamas, used for military purposes such as paying salaries to terrorists, digging tunnels, and producing rockets.In the American press, Qatar is frequently cited as the principal financial backer of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement linked to numerous terror attacks in Europe over the past decade.What's most alarming is the West's silence in the face of this mounting threat to the free world. AdvertisementCountries ignore the darker side of the Qatari regimeMANY COUNTRIES benefit from Qatari investments and prefer to ignore the darker side of its regime. Some even reward Qatar with awards, contracts, and favorable media coverage.One of the organizations receiving Qatari patronage is the International Union of Muslim Scholars. Founded in 2004 and headed by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, the union's clerics have consistently claimed that Palestinian suicide bombings against Israelis are istishhad (martyrdom) and that Hamas is not a terrorist organization.In his latest publication, the union's current head, Sheikh Ali al-Qaradaghi, elaborated on the importance of issuing a fatwa (legal ruling) calling for jihad against the “Zionist enemy.” Among his declarations: “It is the duty of every able Muslim in the Islamic world to take up arms against the occupation in Palestine.” The fatwa further states that a full blockade by land, sea, and air must be imposed on the Zionist occupier.  The union is headquartered in Qatar, enjoys Qatari funding, and its leader resides in Doha.Qatar's influence over Europe has also grown, particularly in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which forced the European Union to urgently seek alternatives to Russian gas. As of Q2 this year, Qatar ranks as the EU's third-largest supplier of liquefied natural gas, trailing only the US and Russia.At the same time, several mosques across Europe funded by Qatar have become hubs of radicalization and terrorist sympathies.Militarily and strategically, the US and Qatar share strong ties. The US Central Command's headquarters in the Persian Gulf is located in Qatar, home to the Al Udeid Air Base and the As Sayliyah Army Base. While Qatar relies on the US for security, it is also a strategic asset for Washington.A report by the National Association of Scholars, a US-based conservative academic watchdog, revealed that Qatar donated $4.7 billion to American academic institutions between 2001 and 2021.UN Secretary-General António Guterres has maintained a notably warm relationship with Qatar. In 2018, Qatar signed a series of agreements with him, pledging $500 million to various UN programs and funding new offices in Doha.Qatar also finances the United Nations Office of Counter-TerrorismIRONICALLY, QATAR, which funds Hamas, also finances the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism. As of October 31, 2023, Qatar was the office's top donor, providing nearly 40% of its total budget, almost $140 million.According to Bloomberg, Qatar's sovereign wealth funds now control more than $450b. in assets worldwide, giving it powerful leverage over banks, investment firms, academic institutions, journalists, and politicians alike.And Qatar's reach doesn't end on Earth; it extends into space. The country's satellite company, Es'hailSat, partnered with Eutelsat to launch two major communication satellites into orbit via the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket. The satellites serve civilian, radio, television, and governmental purposes.Qatar has also begun developing satellite surveillance capabilities and a military satellite program. The nation claims these are for defense, yet no one at the ESA seems to have asked: Why does Qatar need a military satellite?It's not unreasonable to suspect that intelligence gathered via this satellite could be shared with Iran or used to disrupt Western satellite communications.The consequences are already evident: Terror networks are growing stronger, religious extremism is spreading, and Western democracies are struggling to combat the rising Islamist wave. The gap between Qatar's polished global image and its actual role in security destabilization is dangerous. It breeds moral and political paralysis and enables terror infrastructures to thrive under a veil of money.If the West wants to preserve its values and independence, it must act decisively. That means enforcing transparency in foreign investments, requiring every sports club, university, and financial institution to disclose its funding sources.It also means legislating oversight over international sports bodies and enforcing accountability against countries that exploit the arena to whitewash regimes like Qatar's.Qatar should be officially designated a state sponsor of terrorism, at least until it halts the flow of funds to terror-linked organizations.Sanctions should be placed on journalists and influencers funded by Qatar, and their financial ties must be brought to light, even if that means challenging powerful interests.Qatar has successfully branded itself as a Western-friendly, open, touristic, and sporty nation.

Qatar often labels its financial transfers to Gaza as “humanitarian aid.” However, a 2020 US Treasury report revealed that significant portions of those funds ended up in the hands of Hamas, used for military purposes such as paying salaries to terrorists, digging tunnels, and producing rockets.In the American press, Qatar is frequently cited as the principal financial backer of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement linked to numerous terror attacks in Europe over the past decade.What's most alarming is the West's silence in the face of this mounting threat to the free world.

Qatar's influence over Europe has also grown, particularly in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which forced the European Union to urgently seek alternatives to Russian gas. As of Q2 this year, Qatar ranks as the EU's third-largest supplier of liquefied natural gas, trailing only the US and Russia.At the same time, several mosques across Europe funded by Qatar have become hubs of radicalization and terrorist sympathies.Militarily and strategically, the US and Qatar share strong ties. The US Central Command's headquarters in the Persian Gulf is located in Qatar, home to the Al Udeid Air Base and the As Sayliyah Army Base. While Qatar relies on the US for security, it is also a strategic asset for Washington.A report by the National Association of Scholars, a US-based conservative academic watchdog, revealed that Qatar donated $4.7 billion to American academic institutions between 2001 and 2021.UN Secretary-General António Guterres has maintained a notably warm relationship with Qatar. In 2018, Qatar signed a series of agreements with him, pledging $500 million to various UN programs and funding new offices in Doha.Qatar also finances the United Nations Office of Counter-TerrorismIRONICALLY, QATAR, which funds Hamas, also finances the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism. As of October 31, 2023, Qatar was the office's top donor, providing nearly 40% of its total budget, almost $140 million.According to Bloomberg, Qatar's sovereign wealth funds now control more than $450b. in assets worldwide, giving it powerful leverage over banks, investment firms, academic institutions, journalists, and politicians alike.And Qatar's reach doesn't end on Earth; it extends into space. The country's satellite company, Es'hailSat, partnered with Eutelsat to launch two major communication satellites into orbit via the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket. The satellites serve civilian, radio, television, and governmental purposes.Qatar has also begun developing satellite surveillance capabilities and a military satellite program. The nation claims these are for defense, yet no one at the ESA seems to have asked: Why does Qatar need a military satellite?It's not unreasonable to suspect that intelligence gathered via this satellite could be shared with Iran or used to disrupt Western satellite communications.The consequences are already evident: Terror networks are growing stronger, religious extremism is spreading, and Western democracies are struggling to combat the rising Islamist wave. The gap between Qatar's polished global image and its actual role in security destabilization is dangerous. It breeds moral and political paralysis and enables terror infrastructures to thrive under a veil of money.If the West wants to preserve its values and independence, it must act decisively. That means enforcing transparency in foreign investments, requiring every sports club, university, and financial institution to disclose its funding sources.It also means legislating oversight over international sports bodies and enforcing accountability against countries that exploit the arena to whitewash regimes like Qatar's.Qatar should be officially designated a state sponsor of terrorism, at least until it halts the flow of funds to terror-linked organizations.Sanctions should be placed on journalists and influencers funded by Qatar, and their financial ties must be brought to light, even if that means challenging powerful interests.Qatar has successfully branded itself as a Western-friendly, open, touristic, and sporty nation.

...

Chelsea's stance on a possible swoop for Kevin De Bruyne has been revealed in a new report as the Manchester City midfielder prepares for a new chapter ahead of leaving the club in the coming months.

De Bruyne is set to part ways with the four-in-a-row Premier League champions after being told he is not part of Pep Guardiola's plans for the 2025-26 campaign, with the 33-year-old having struggled for fitness and consistency in the last 12-18 months.

The Belgium international has – since announcing his upcoming departure – revealed he was left shocked when club bosses relayed their decision on his future as De Bruyne holds a firm belief he still has plenty to offer and compete at the highest level.

     

It remains to be seen where the six-time Premier League winner will be playing next season as clubs across Europe, Saudi Arabia and the United States queue up to secure the arrival of one of the world's best midfielders.

Aston Villa are the latest club in the Premier League known to have held internal talks over a potential move for De Bruyne after the Belgian refused to rule out staying in England and joining one of Manchester City's direct rivals.

Clubs in the Major League Soccer and Saudi Arabia have held a long-standing interest in the Manchester City midfielder, who is believed to prefer the United States to settle his family over Saudi Arabia as a destination.

De Bruyne is also understood to be wary of featuring for Manchester City in the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States between June and July – as a precaution to avoid any further injury setbacks that could derail him joining his next club.

As a result, the playmaker has reportedly informed Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola of his desire to leave the club at the end of their Premier League campaign so as to recover and take some time off with his family to assess offers and make a decision on his future.

Elsewhere in the Premier League, Chelsea are unlikely to make a move for De Bruyne and bring their former player back to Stamford Bridge ahead of what is expected to be a busy summer of transfer dealings in west London, as reported by Matt Law writing for the Daily Telegraph.

De Bruyne joined Chelsea from boyhood club Genk in 2012 and after a loan spell at German side Werder Bremen, the midfielder was deemed surplus to requirements by then Blues manager Jose Mourinho, who sold De Bruyne to Wolfsburg in January 2014.

The Lionesses winger could be a decisive figure as the Gunners head to France needing to beat the eight-time European champions

Arsenal are certainly up against it this weekend. After losing the home leg of their Champions League semi-final clash with Lyon by a 2-1 scoreline, the Gunners have to beat the eight-time European champions on their own patch on Sunday if they are to reach the final of this competition for the first time since they triumphed in it back in 2007.

Lyon's last home defeat came over a year ago, when they were beaten on penalties by Fleury in the semi-finals of the Coupe de France. Their last home defeat in 90 minutes was over two years ago, when Chelsea were 1-0 winners in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie. In short, it's not often that OL are beaten in their own backyard.

But there are reasons for Arsenal to believe. The Gunners created plenty of chances in that first leg, they just didn't take them; in the last round, they completed an unlikely comeback, overturning a 2-0 deficit against Real Madrid by winning 3-0 at home; and, crucially, both Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly should be fitter and sharper this time around. If that quarter-final triumph is anything to go by, then the latter's creativity could well make the difference, too.

The Pole's unavailability for the Copa del Rey final is a big blow for the Blaugrana, but they do have a potentially deadly replacement

Ferran Torres attempted to fill the considerable void left behind in Barcelona's attack by the injured Robert Lewandowski in Tuesday's Liga clash with Mallorca. As auditions go, it was hardly impressive.

Barca won the game thanks to Dani Olmo's second-half strike, but Torres didn't play particularly well and copped quite a bit of criticism for failing to exhibit the kind of killer instinct one would expect from a forward nicknamed 'The Shark'.

However, whereas such a setback would have once hit Torres hard, now he's made from sterner stuff. Consequently, it would be a major surprise if he does not get another chance to fill in for Lewandowski in Saturday's Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid. Because if he's proven anything over the past couple of years, it's that he is nothing if not resilient.

The countdown to the French Open 2025 has begun, and the tennis world is buzzing with excitement as top players gear up to battle it out for glory on the clay courts of Roland Garros. With just a month left until the tournament kicks off in Paris from May 25 to June 08, fans are eagerly anticipating the showdown between the giants of the sport.

Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain is expected to make a strong bid to retain his title after a sensational victory last year over Alexander Zverev. The young phenom stunned the world with his remarkable performance in a thrilling five-set final. But standing in his way is world number one Jannik Sinner, who is set to make his comeback at the Rome Masters ahead of the French Open, following a doping scandal that kept him out of action for three months.

Not to be overlooked is the legendary Novak Djokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam champion and Serbia's pride, who will undoubtedly be a force to be reckoned with at Roland Garros. Despite the star power of Alcaraz, Sinner, and Djokovic, it is Norway's Casper Ruud who holds the title of the most successful player at the French Open in the last five years.

Ruud, at just 26 years old, has amassed an impressive 120 wins at Roland Garros, making him a formidable contender for the championship. With two runner-up finishes in 2022 and 2023, including losses to Rafael Nadal and Djokovic, Ruud has proven himself as a consistent performer on the clay courts. Following closely behind him is Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, with 94 wins to his name.

As the tennis world braces for the upcoming French Open, all eyes will be on these top players vying for supremacy on one of the sport's most prestigious stages. Stay tuned for what promises to be a thrilling and unpredictable tournament filled with passion, drama, and unforgettable moments on the red dirt of Roland Garros.

The Serbian is currently winless on clay this season.ByEd McGroganPublished Apr 26, 2025 copy_link

There were signs of trouble from the very beginning of Novak Djokovic's opening-round match at the Mutua Madrid Open.One hour and 40 minutes later, it was clear those signs were accurate.The 37-year-old's quest for a 100th career title—and first on the ATP Tour since the 2023 season-ending championships—will not continue in Madrid, following a 6-3, 6-4 loss to 44th-ranked Matteo Arnaldi.

Arnaldi broke Djokovic right away for a 2-0 lead, and closed out the center-court contest with a hold at 15. The return of serve may be the 24-time Grand Slam champion's signature shot, but it was ineffective against the Italian in this must-break situation, and during the match at large. Arnaldi saved four of five break points and prevailed in straight sets despite winning just 55 percent of his first-serve points.Returning at 3-4 in the second set, Djokovic got to 15-40, but Arnaldi held strong, showing virtually no nerves against a player he idolizes. Serving at 3-4 in the first set, Djokovic double faulted on break point."It was a rough day for Novak Djokovic," said Tennis Channel's Prakash Amritraj. "I didn't see a pep in his step."Arnaldi concurred, in so many words: "He's my idol. He's always been. I'm just glad I could play him," said the 24-year-old. "Playing him in a stage like this was already a victory for me. But you know, he's not at his best right now."

This is the third time Djokovic has lost three consecutive matches since 2018, but the second time already this year. His most recent slump began in the Miami Open final, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) to Jakub Mensik, then continued in Monte Carlo, 6-3, 6-4 to Alejandro Tabilo.Same score, same result on Saturday in Madrid.

The pursuit of greater prize money in tennis continues to be a major topic of discussion.

Earlier this year, the Professional Tennis Players Association [PTPA] launched a significant claim against the tennis tours.

The PTPA asked for several changes to the sport, perhaps none more significant than a greater distribution of prize money.

Shortly after, the top 20 players in men's and women's tennis sent a letter to the four Grand Slams, demanding a ‘substantial increase' in prize money at the events.

One of the ATP Tour's most outspoken stars has now been asked just how far he and others would be willing to go to make change happen.

Appearing as a guest on the Changeover podcast, Frances Tiafoe was asked whether he'd join his fellow ATP stars in a hypothetical boycott of the US Open in a bid for changes such as an increase in prize money.

“The problem is, though, and you need the best players in the world to do it, the problem is, though, I just don't trust these guys out here,” said Tiafoe.

“I feel like they're fake.

“Everyone would be like, oh, yeah, [in] the meeting before, yeah, man, screw this, man, f— this, man.

“I ain't playing, like, we all need money. It's about the tour, it's about the next generation, this and that.

“Next day, you see everybody tying their shoes, over there doing bands and all that.

“You don't know who's really about it or not, because you say it, and then you —– around and pull out, and then all these dudes stayed in.”

Tiafoe believes it will be tricky to make change happen until players get on the ‘same page'.

“That's how I feel about the PTPA and the lawsuits, it's like, it's cool and whatever, and you know, those guys who are in support of it, or behind it, I'm sure are trying to do good things for the game,” he said.

“But until we get real unity, and everyone's really on the same page, for me personally, it doesn't really move the needle.”

It would likely be hard for Tiafoe to agree not to take part at Flushing Meadows, considering his previous successes at the US Open.

Twice, the 27-year-old has reached the last four in New York, his most successful Grand Slam tournament, by quite some distance.

In 2024, Tiafoe lost to Taylor Fritz in the semi-finals of the US Open, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 4-6, 1-6, narrowly missing out on a place in his first Major final.

Some have, however, expressed concerns over his level at the event compared to others, as Jon Wertheim questioned whether Tiafoe puts ‘too much emphasis' on the US Open, in a discussion with Andy Roddick last year.

The American is yet to truly get going in 2025, potentially proving Wertheim correct.

Approaching the end of April, Tiafoe has accumulated just 500 points on the ATP Tour, fewer than 46 other players in men's tennis.

Tiafoe has had real issue stringing wins together this year, often winning just a singular match at a tournament before falling to defeat.

He enjoyed his best week this year in Houston, when Tiafoe lost to Jenson Brooksby in the final of the US Men's Clay Court Championships.

Tiafoe will hope to enjoy another strong showing on the clay at this week's Madrid Open tournament.

The American will take to the court against Luciano Darderi in the second round on Saturday, April 27.

Novak Djokovic has given himself a brutal reality check after crashing out of the Madrid Open. The Serb is now on a three-match losing streak, suffering back-to-back opening-round exits in Monte-Carlo and Madrid. Djokovic has made it no secret that his main focus is the French Open, the next Grand Slam tournament of the season.

However, after losing to Matteo Arnaldi on Saturday, the 24-time Major winner claimed he would not be one of the “favourites” at Roland Garros, despite being a three-time former champion at the Parisian clay event.

Djokovic's expectations were low coming into the Madrid Open. The world No. 5 had not played the tournament in three years, and this was just his second appearance since 2019.

However, his outing still went worse than planned. “I was hoping I can play one more match than I played in Monte-Carlo,” the three-time former champion in Madrid said.

“Kind of new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis.

“So it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kind of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments.

“But, you know, that's, I guess, the circle of life and the career, eventually it was going to happen.”

Djokovic had also lost his opening match at the Monte-Carlo Masters earlier this month and said his sole focus for the clay season was the French Open. However, he now accepts that he might not be at his best in Paris.

The 37-year-old continued: “Now I'm trying to use this as a driving force for the future. Obviously Grand Slams, I was saying many times, are the most important tournaments for me.

“Which doesn't mean that I don't want to win here, of course I wanted to, but, you know, Grand Slams is where I really want to play the best tennis. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that in Roland Garros, but I'll do my best.”

Djokovic is running out of time to get some clay wins under his belt before the French Open. He is entered into the Masters 1000 in Rome, which begins on May 7.

There are also some smaller ATP events held in the week before Roland Garros, and he could take a late wildcard as he did last year in Geneva.

But the Serb has come to accept that he won't be a huge title contender at the French, and it's something he hopes will work in his favour.

“I'll do my best for the future. Grand Slam, I'm not going into Roland Garros as one of the main favorites. Maybe that can help, I don't know, we'll see,” he said.

  AFC Wimbledon assistant manager Terry Skiverton insists the Dons are "still in a good place" despite losing to Port Vale ahead of the final game of the season.



  Wimbledon were beaten by Port Vale today (April 26) in the last scheduled game at the Cherry Red Records Stadium for the season - elongating a poor run of form.



  Vale, who secured their automatic promotion to League One, scored twice in quick succession although the second goal in particular was draped in controversy as referee Declan Bourne failed to stop the game for a head injury to Wimbledon defender Riley Harbottle.



  In the aftermath of the second goal, manager Johnnie Jackson was shown a red card for his protests against the referee's decision.



  "Harbottle gets a head injury and the referee plays on for 20 seconds and Vale go on to score," said Jackson's right hand man - Terry Skiverton.



  “Harbottle was then down for five and a half minutes and then had to go off for the same injury.



Terry Skiverton was disappointed with the referee not stopping play for Harbottle's head injury (Image: Kirk Pritchard) “Seven minutes later, one of their players goes down with a head injury whilst we're on the attack and guess what the referee does? He blows up for a head injury – we are really disappointed with that."



  Despite feeling hard done by, Skiverton admitted that Port Vale deserved to be promoted today.



  He said: “They're a really good side with experienced players and they got promoted today through being professional, slowing the game down, not allowing us to gain momentum and they've got the likes of Ronan Curtis to come on and see the game out



  “It's disappointing from our point of view but it's a good lesson and it's good to see a team get promoted against you because now we know what we have to do.



  “That support base turned up in numbers today and got behind us but we need to give them more in attacking threat – we didn't give them enough today and we're aware of that."



  “The fans are still 100 per cent behind us – we could feel that."



Marcus Browne was brought on in the second half after being sidelined with an injury for the past few weeks (Image: Kirk Pritchard) Marcus Browne and Myles Hippolyte both featured from the bench in the loss - their first appearances in weeks due to injury.



  “We're still in a good place – we've got the skipper (Jake Reeves) back, we've got Browne back, we've got Hippolyte back and we're going into this last game of the season with a fully fit squad.



  “This club's not been in this situation for a good few years and we need to make sure that we stick together and not let the doom and gloom get to us.



  “If someone said to us that we're going to go into this last game of the season to get play-offs and potentially get promoted we'd have bitten their hand off.”



  Skiverton claimed that the red card shown to Jackson "doesn't change anything" ahead of the Dons' trip to Grimsby next Saturday (May 3).



  "The gaffer will still be there watching, he'll have a voice down to the bench and the players will continue to give it everything they can," he said.



  “The big thing we've got to take away from today is putting more emphasis on the opposing goal – we need to create more chances and be a bit braver in our attacks."



  A win at Grimsby next weekend would secure a play-off place for the Dons.

Andrey Rublev has endured a strange start to his 2025 season, as he struggles to find consistency.

The Russian began his year with a shock defeat at the Australian Open, when Rublev lost to Joao Fonseca in three sets.

He failed to impress at his next two tournaments in Montpellier and Rotterdam, before Rublev won the Qatar Open, seemingly out of nowhere.

Since then, Rublev has won just two matches on the ATP Tour and looks set to drop out of the world's top ten.

Looking to return to winning ways at this year's Madrid Open, the Russian reflected on the time he won the biggest title of his career while feeling ‘super sick'.

Speaking on the ATP Tour's YouTube channel, Rublev looked back on how he felt physically during his second Masters 1000 title win.

“For sure, the title in Madrid, the things I faced there, I never faced in my life,” he said.

“I was super sick there, basically. I could not eat, I could not sleep.”

Remarkably, the sickness allowed Rublev to find an extra gear, which helped him secure victory.

“That sickness somehow gave me disconnection from all my personality. So I was not thinking about anything related to my life,” he said.

“Only that I hope if I lay [in bed] for an extra five minutes I feel a bit better.

“With that thought, somehow my head was completely clear, and feeling the worst physically, I was playing some of my best tennis.”

His best tennis saw him take down the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz on his way to the final.

Rublev then beat Felix Auger-Aliassime to lift a Masters 1000 title for the second time in his career, having won in Monte-Carlo one year earlier.

The world number eight would no doubt love to repeat the feat in 2025 and retain both his title and place in the top ten.

Rublev advanced to the third round of the 2025 Madrid Open without ever taking to the court, as Frenchman Gael Monfils withdrew from the event.

His route to the final is tough, however, and he could face a tricky test against in-form Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals.

Rublev and Zverev have faced off ten times previously on the ATP Tour, with the German enjoying the better of proceedings, winning on seven occasions.

The Russian did, however, win their most recent encounter on clay, securing his place in the 2023 Bastad semi-finals with a comfortable straight sets win.

If he were to advance past Zverev things likely wouldn't get much easier as he could then take on two players he holds a losing record against in the semi-finals and final.

Only time will tell if Rublev can defy the odds and defend his Madrid Open title, but it certainly looks like he'll be up against it.

Rublev will make his first appearance at this year's tournament on Sunday, April 27, when he takes on Alexander Bublik for a place in the fourth round.

Holger Rune withdrew with what looked like a thigh injury after the first set against Flavio Cobolli in the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Madrid.

The eighth-seeded Dane withdrew with a muscle injury in his thigh after losing the first set 2-6 to Italian Flavio Cobolli in the second round of the clay tournament.

This marks Rune's third retirement of the year, following Acapulco and Monte-Carlo. 

It otherwise started off promisingly for Rune, who arrived in the Spanish capital on the back of having won the ATP 500 tournament in Barcelona last week.

Trailing 2-3, Rune took a medical timeout, and chose to continue after the treatment. 

But Rune seemed physically inhibited and quickly showed signs of resignation on court.

The Italian won four successive games, after which Rune chose to withdraw. The 22-year-old Italian will play American Brandon Nakashima, the No 31 seed, next.

The American took to the courts for the first time in weeks, hoping to remain symptom-free as she prepares for the second Slam of the year.ByLiya DavidovPublished Apr 26, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 26, 2025

Two-time Grand Slam champion Taylor Townsend came clean on social media about missing out on the beginning of the clay-court season.Since reaching the doubles semifinals at the Miami Open, the second-ranked doubles player has pulled out of tournaments, all the way through next week's Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome.“I'm sure you guys have been wondering where I've been, why I've been withdrawing from tournaments,” the American said on Instagram. “In Miami, I fell and ended up getting a mild concussion in my quarterfinal doubles match and had two days off, played my semifinal match on Friday, and ended up getting a lot worse, so it's my first time back out on court in almost a month.”

Tests later confirmed she suffered a concussion, an injury Townsend only recently began recovering from.“I was hoping to be ready for Madrid but ended up doing some workouts and some tests and all of my symptoms came back, so these last three or four days have been the first time that I have had no headaches,” she said, “which is really great and I'm happy to be back on court.“I really wanted to give myself a chance to heal. I was really scared about my head and that's not something I want to play with, so I'm just giving myself an opportunity to really heal.”Read More: **Jessica Pegula and her dogs have been a winning pair**

Cautiously optimistic about her recovery, Townsend assures the tennis world that she plans on competing in the clay season—more specifically, the most prestigious clay-court tournament on the calendar.“I will be ready front and center at Roland Garros,” she said. “So, you guys, stay tuned for my comeback, I love you all.”

Sinner has not played since winning the Australian Open at the start of the season and accepted a ban in February following a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had challenged a tribunal's decision to clear him after two positive tests.

The 23-year-old was allowed to return to training on April 13th, and his suspension will end on May 4th, before his competitive return at the Italian Open, which gets underway three days later.

Sinner, who spent time building fitness mindful of the French Open starting on May 25th, was assured of retaining the top ranking for his home tournament after his closest challenger, Alexander Zverev, crashed to an early defeat in Monte Carlo.

"We're training very hard. Hopefully, we'll get some momentum going again ahead of the clay season. It certainly won't be easy for me," Sinner told broadcaster ORF Sudtirol.

"The first games will be really difficult. But hopefully I'll be able to get back into the rhythm and then we'll see how it goes."

Sinner, who trained with Britain's world number six Jack Draper at the Tennis Club de Beaulieu in France recently, said there were plenty of positives from his enforced absence from the tour.

"I think at the beginning of the three months, it was quite nice," Sinner added.

"A bit of time away from all the grind, I spent time with family, with friends. I was doing new things and getting to know myself better, finding out where I stand.

"I think it helped me a lot."

Novak Djokovic was as unequivocal as an athlete could be earlier this month, when he was asked what his goals were for the ongoing clay-court season.

“Roland Garros,” he answered, referring to the French Open, in late May and early June, after losing his opening match in Monte Carlo, Monaco, to Alejandro Tabilo. “That's it.”

Understood. So what's a player like that doing at a tournament like the Madrid Open?

Sure, Madrid, which got underway this week, takes place on the red clay, just as the French Open does, but the similarities largely end there.

The Spanish capital sits more than 2,000 feet above sea level, which allows the ball to fly and bounce during tennis matches in ways it won't in Paris. The air is also dry, allowing the sun to bake the surface and make it behave more like a hard court than a clay one — if it gets hot enough during the day. Then at night, it can get quite cold.

Add that all up and few players would argue that Madrid provides much in the way of preparation for doing battle in the French capital a month later. There's a reason Rafael Nadal, the greatest male clay-court player, won Madrid “just” five times — and one of those came when it was a hard-court event. Four titles still sounds pretty good, but for these clay-court swing facts: Nadal won the French Open 14 times, the Barcelona Open 12 times, the Monte Carlo Masters 11 times and the Italian Open 10 times.

Nadal, and others, have long said the latter event in Rome, which traditionally follows Madrid on the calendar, serves as the closest facsimile for what awaits at Roland Garros. But here is Djokovic, a three-time Madrid champion, taking to the courts there for the first time in three years and for only the second since 2019, when he last won the event.

His presence is part of the peculiar riddle that Djokovic, who turns 38 on May 22, has been trying to solve for going on two years now. What is the best way to try to win a 25th Grand Slam title at an age when players don't win Grand Slam titles anymore?

The answer mostly lies in finding the right balance between rest and match fitness, but at this moment, Djokovic is returning to a tournament he hasn't played since 2022 because he has to pay attention to something that he swore more than a year ago would never concern him again: the ATP rankings.

After securing the year-end No. 1 for a record eighth time in 2023, points and places ceased to matter to the greatest player of the modern era. Now they matter once more, because they hold one of the keys to his only clay-court season goal.

Entering Madrid, Djokovic was the world No. 5, with 4,130 points, within shouting distance of Taylor Fritz at No. 4, who had 4,725. A deficit of 595 points might sound like a lot, but it's really not. The Madrid Open is an ATP Masters 1,000 event, so named for the number of ranking points it awards to its eventual champion.

With Djokovic not having played Madrid last year, he's not playing against his own achievements. He has no ranking points to defend, which makes the next 10 days the closest thing to a free hit tennis has to offer. Every match he wins adds to his points total. He will have earned 10 points as soon as he hits a ball in his first match Saturday, since he was given a bye in the opening round and gets the money and the points for having won at that initial stage.

Fritz is in the opposite position. He made the semifinals in Madrid a year ago, which means he's defending 390 points. That makes Djokovic's deficit more like 205 because the American will only improve his tally if he gets to the final, and if he is eliminated before the semifinals, he will lose points.

That looks more likely than not, largely because Fritz has been carrying an abdominal strain since the Australian Open in January.

In Miami last month, where he lost in the semifinals to Jakub Menšík, he said he couldn't try to block back his opponent's powerful serve because he thought it would put too much of a strain on his sore muscle. He then skipped Monte Carlo to recuperate and optimize his chances of defending his Madrid points.

Having beaten Christopher O'Connell 6-1, 6-4 in his first match Friday (the second round), he will play Benjamin Bonzi in the third Sunday. Fritz has made a clay-court final before, but the red dirt is his worst surface.

Still, why should the greatest player of the modern era care whether he is ranked fourth or fifth in the world today, or whether he is ahead or behind a player he is a perfect 10 for 10 against in their head-to-head meetings?

This is where Roland Garros comes in.



If Djokovic can overtake Fritz before Paris and enter the tournament as the fourth seed, he can ensure he will not face Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz before the semifinals.

There's even a scenario where he might not have to face either of them until the final:

Last weekend, Alcaraz lost to Holger Rune in the Barcelona Open final, just after Alexander Zverev won the Munich Open against Ben Shelton. Those results put Zverev up to No. 2 and Alcaraz fell to No. 3. Additionally, Alcaraz is now dropping his Madrid points from last year — 200 of them — because he has withdrawn due to a muscle injury. If Zverev is still second and Alcaraz third by the time the French Open rolls around, Djokovic could end up in the opposite half of the draw to both Sinner and Alcaraz.

Djokovic could end up there regardless of his seeding in that scenario. But at No. 4, he has the guarantee of playing a minimum five matches before he faces one of his sternest tests, which at least offers a window of opportunity to try to tap back into his once-peerless ability to play himself into peak form at a major.

At this year's Australian Open, Djokovic faced Alcaraz in the last eight. The stress of that test and the pressure the Spaniard puts on opponents likely contributed to Djokovic tearing a muscle in the back of his leg in the first set. While he prevailed in four sets, having managed to scramble his opponent's brain when all Alcaraz needed to do was keep doing what he had been doing, Djokovic had to retire from his semifinal against Zverev three days later after losing an attritional first set in a tiebreak.

Playing Alcaraz and Sinner takes more out of Djokovic — and just about anybody else — than playing anyone else does. In his case, it's best to face them as late as possible in a tournament, if he has to at all.

There are also the non-mathematical considerations.

Djokovic is living through a common misconception about what happens to elite athletes declining from their peaks.

Those apexes stay sharp and accessible in fleeting moments, even when they need them most: he found his on his otherworldly run to the gold medal at last year's Olympics in Paris. It's the stability that erodes, the repetitions that are necessary to maintain their excellence.

Djokovic's clay season didn't go well last year. He was serviceable in Monte Carlo, where he reached the semifinals, but he has never been dominant at that event. Then he took the next three weeks off, with the idea of minimizing the mileage in his legs during a year when his top goal was winning Olympic gold.

He assumed he could get enough French Open preparation under his belt in Rome, where he had made the final in four of the previous five years. He won his opening match (in the second round) at a canter, but while signing autographs, a metal water bottle accidentally fell from a spectator's rucksack and struck him hard on the head. Djokovic played his third-round match, but looked understandably off-kilter and lost to Tabilo.

Then he scrambled to gain entry into the Geneva Open, a move that betrayed something like panic, since he never plays a tournament the week before a Grand Slam. He was flat there, too, struggling at times to stay upright and gasping to catch his breath, especially during an ugly semifinal defeat to Tomáš Macháč.

Then came the French Open, where he played himself in just like the Djokovic of old before getting past Lorenzo Musetti in a five-set third-round epic that finished after three in the morning local time. That understandably took something out of him, and he tore the medial meniscus in his right knee during his next match, an improbable win over Francisco Cerundolo. Instead of playing his quarterfinal against Casper Ruud, he withdrew and had surgery. Returning weeks later, he made the final at Wimbledon before winning that Olympic gold medal he craved above all else.

Still, he did not win another title and the season overall was a staccato, up-and-down affair, as his schedule has been for a few years while still delivering elite results. Not so much in 2025. Djokovic played the Brisbane International before the Australian Open and played in both Indian Wells, Calif. and Miami — the Sunshine Double — for the first time since 2018.

Although he only really cares about winning at least one more Grand Slam and beating Margaret Court's 24-title record, which he currently shares, Djokovic appears to have decided that being a part-time tennis player doesn't work either for his body or his brain. Playing more often may take a toll on his ageing frame, but he has to do it to try to become sharp on the clay and get his legs ready for the test of five-set tennis that awaits him at the French Open.

More matches might mean there will be more nights he plays like a shadow of his best self, as he did in Monte Carlo against Tabilo.

“It was horrible,” he said of that straight-sets defeat two weeks ago. “I did not have high expectations, really. I knew I'm going to have a tough opponent and I knew I'm going to probably play pretty bad. But this bad, I didn't expect.”

These days, that is the price he has to pay for proper preparation.

But if it ends up helping him land in the top four at the French Open, it will probably have been worth it.

Tennis fans might be shocked to learn who has been the game's most successful male player on clay in the past five years. The French Open at Roland Garros gets underway next month, with the current Madrid Open forming an integral part of the build-up.

The returning Jannik Sinner will head in as the No.1 seed. However, it's Carlos Alcaraz who is the defending champion after winning the Grand Slam for the first time last year, following in the footsteps of his compatriot Rafael Nadal. The ‘King of Clay' remains the most dominant player in history at the tournament, finishing his career having won it 14 times.

Novak Djokovic is also expected to challenge strongly in France as he bids for a record-breaking 25th Slam title. However, the Serbian had a chastening outing at the Monte-Carlo Masters, surprisingly beaten in the first round by Alejandro Tabilo.

However, neither Djokovic nor Alcaraz top the list for most matches won on clay since the start of 2020. Instead, that honour goes to Casper Ruud, who lost in the final at Roland Garros to Nadal in 2022 and Djokovic a year later.

The Norwegian has won 120 matches on the surface in that period. Stefanos Tsitsipas, another player still searching for a first Slam win, is second on the list with 94.

World No.3 Alcaraz sits on 90 victories. However, it is also worth noting that the 21-year-old only made his ATP Tour debut in 2020, and it wasn't until the following year that he emerged as a player capable of challenging the elite.

Fourth on the list is Alexander Zverev at 85. As a result of the injury lay-offs Djokovic has endured, he doesn't even make the top five, with Paraguayan star Alexander Baez following Zverev with 81.

Ruud, 26, is likely to have played considerably more matches on clay than fellow top stars, though. His last tournament win on the surface came last year, when he beat Tsitsipas in the final of the Barcelona Open.

Carlos Alcaraz has opened up on the extreme measures Wimbledon organisers take to maintain the competition's reputation as the most prestigious in tennis.

The back-to-back defending champion has won the tournament twice on the bounce, having beaten Novak Djokovic in 2023 and again successfully fended off the Serbian last year.

Alcaraz's success in 2024 made him the ninth man in the Open Era to defend the Wimbledon title and the youngest to achieve this feat since the legendary Roger Federer.

In doing so, the 21-year-old also became the first male player born in the 2000s to win both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year.

But Alcaraz's triumphs in SW19 were almost halted by a seemingly peculiar rule by the powers above.

The Spaniard explained that his coloured underwear almost landed him a suspension at Wimbledon, as they were deemed to be in violation of the tournament's all-white kit policy.

Alcaraz explained that the briefs were visible through his shorts, and that organisers told him he would not be allowed to play if he repeated the offence. 

The world No 3 told the Netflix docuseries, My Way: 'I think Wimbledon is one of the most elegant tournaments in the world, if not the most elegant one, be it for its prestige or its rules.

'You can't step onto the court unless you're dressed in all white.

'I was wearing colour briefs and you could see them through my shorts, and they called me out on them, saying, "Next time, we won't let you play."

'I mean, this really goes to show you just how strict they can be!'

Victory at Wimbledon this year would secure Alcaraz a third title in a row. In doing so, he would become the youngest man in the Open Era to do so at the All England Club.

However, this achievement would still be a far cry from the record for the most consecutive titles on the hallowed grass courts.

Both Roger Federer (2003 to 2007) and Bjorn Borg (1976 to 1980) won five successive crowns at Wimbledon, meaning the Spanish superstar still has a ways to go yet.

Novak Djokovic makes his 2025 Madrid debut against tough Italian Matteo Arnaldi during second-round action on Saturday. Stefanos Tsitsipas, who retired in Barcelona, takes on struggling veteran Jan-Lennard Struff.

(4) Novak Djokovic vs. Matteo Arnaldi

This year has been a bit of a struggle for Novak Djokovic. The world No. 5 hasn't won an ATP title since 2023, although he did win the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last year. He got close in Miami, but he lost in two tiebreakers to the young Czech Jakub Mensik. Djokovic has not won a match on clay yet this season, with a shock opening loss to Alejandro Tabilo in Monte-Carlo two weeks ago. He was miserably out of sorts; Tabilo is ranked No. 32 in the world and at no point did the Serb even threaten to take control.

Fortunately for Djokovic, Matteo Arnaldi is also off the boil. The Italian holds a 9-9 record on the season, including his three-set win over Borna Coric in the first round earlier this week. Arnaldi would ordinarily be dangerous for Djokovic, especially because he has already played a match. But in this case Djokovic will be motivated to get more play in before Roland Garros. It's likely to be patchy at times, but look for the first meeting between Djokovic and Arnaldi to go the favorite's way.

(17) Stefanos Tsitsipas vs. Jan-Lennard Struff

April has not been kind to Stefanos Tsitsipas. The former world No. 3 is ranked 18th in the world in part because he failed to defend his 2024 title in Monte-Carlo. Of more concern, the Greek withdrew from his quarterfinal match against Arthur Fils last week in Barcelona, with some speculation that Tsitsipas had injured his back. The 17th seed got a first-round bye in Madrid, so his injury hasn't been tested yet.

Jan-Lennard Struff has been a tricky matchup for Tsitsipas. The former French Open runner-up holds a scant 5-4 record over the German. Struff is a good clay-court player, so the surface won't give Tsitsipas much of an advantage. The bad news for Struff is that he has had a miserable season. He is 3-10 on the year, not counting his “win” in the first round with the retirement of Botic van de Zandschulp. Struff's last completed match win came way back in February in Marseille, so there is no indication that Struff has enough in the tank right now to dispatch a player of Tsitsipas' caliber.

Two quite horrible matches! Logically you'd go for Tsitsipas 2-0. HOWEVER, it was only a week ago when he had to retire with a back injury. We've seen so many walkovers this tournament daily so it wouldn't suprise me if we saw Stef retire. Struff looking marginally better than he has been vs Botic, slightly less errors. He's got some points to defend here so I do think he will pose a challenge + leads clay H2H. As for Djoko, anything can happen. He could just walk over Arnaldi, or Arnaldi could raise his level as many do vs Djoko and make it a close battle.

Sorry I think Djoko in 3 sets. Struff in 3 (with a clause being if Tsitsi isn't fully fit)

Struff would only win by retirement

WWW?

Now that Fils is out it opens it up for Tsitsi.

if 100 percent

Djokovic out

You REALLY need to wonder about Novak. Even Murray magic seems to be not enough.

Days after revealing the happy news that she's back on set for her latest Hallmark movie, actress Taylor Cole switched gears on social media to vulnerably share how hard it's been trying to start a family. Her post drew a flood of support from fans, friends, and family.  

On April 26, 2025 — the last day of National Infertility Awareness Week — Cole, 40, told her Instagram followers she'd “been going back and forth about sharing my fertility journey on social media for a long time.” But two loving, creative endeavors from friends — a touching song written by one and an inspiring new book written by the other — prompted her to share.

“Opening up like this is not easy,” she wrote. “But if sharing my journey can bring even one person a little bit of comfort, or help someone feel seen in their own struggle, then it's more than worth it.”

A post shared by Taylor Cole (@taylorquinncole)

On April 22, Cole revealed in a funny joint post with Ryan McPartlin, who last appeared in 2024's “A Very Vermont Christmas,” that they're currently filming a new movie together. She confirmed to a fan in the comment section that it is, indeed, a Hallmark project. 

Three days later, the actress, who has been married to movie producer Cameron Larson since 2020, shared her post about her fertility journey and explained her decision to finally open up about their hard path to starting a family.

“It's such a deeply personal experience,” she wrote, “and I promised myself I would know when the time felt right — even if our story doesn't have the ending we've been dreaming of… yet.”

The actress, who has starred in over 20 Hallmark movies since 2016, posted a video of herself flipping through the pages of a new paperback book called “The Garden of Maybe” by her friend Daniel Weaver. 

“Before anything else, I want to say a heartfelt thank you to Daniel Weaver, the author of a truly beautiful children's book that he wrote for me — and for anyone walking through a season of darkness,” she wrote.

According to the illustrated book's synopsis, “The Garden of Maybe” is about Finn, “a joyful puppy who lives on a peaceful farm with his loving mother. He dreams of growing gardenias—his favorite flower—but no matter how carefully they plant, water, and wait, the blooms never come. As Finn wrestles with sadness and self-doubt, he learns that not all growth is visible… and not every gift we give the world comes from the ground.”

Cole wrote of Weaver's book, “His gift is a reminder that even in the hardest moments, we carry a light within us that no darkness can extinguish — and that holding onto it is an act of quiet, powerful hope.”

In her video, Cole stopped on a page where Weaver wrote a dedication to her that said, “For Taylor — Whose smile, like a gardenia in bloom, brightens hearts in ways words rarely capture. This story is a quiet echo of the love, grace, and hope you plant in the lives of others — especially when you don't even know it.” 

Cole alluded to her struggles with infertility in December, when she shared what a difficult year 2024 had been via an Instagram post, noting that it had been marked by “unbearable losses and heartbreaking failures.” 

When a fan inquired about her struggles, Cole replied, “I lost my best friend to cancer this year while shooting ‘A Reason For The Season'. Coupled with too many failed attempts trying to get pregnant made it a tough year. Thank you for the love. It will get better.”

In her April 26 post, Cole expressed her gratitude for those who have supported her and inspired her, writing, “Thank you for being here, and for holding space for stories that are still being written #itwontbelong” 

That hashtag referenced the song Cole chose to serve as a soundtrack to her Instagram video — “It Won't Be Long,” a newly-released tune by country singer George Birge. It was co-written with top Nashville songwriter Trannie Anderson, who's a friend of Cole's. 

The “Aloha Heart” star wrote in her post, “A huge thank you @trannieanderson for being brave enough to write a song that inspired me to share my journey.” 

Anderson was one of many friends who shared words of comfort and support in Cole's comment section, writing, “Love you friend ❤️❤️ praying alongside you for a sweet baby for y'all!”

“Dateline NBC” correspondent and Hallmark screenwriter Andrea Canning, who wrote Cole's “Ruby Herring Mysteries” movies, left three emoji — “🙌🙌🙌” in Cole's comments. The actress replied, “you have helped me through it all 💝”

Actor Shawn Christian, Cole's stepdad and a Hallmark alum, chimed in, “❤️ There is an infinite amount of love within you Tay and knowing you….there is an infinite amount of love that you share daily. This chapter in life, however uncertain, can never extinguish that love…these moments become gentle reminders of how your gifts, our gifts, must shine even brighter in more places of darkness that need your precious gift of love. Keep shining your light of infinite love. ❤️”

Hallmark friend Ashley Williams also wrote, “Taylor I love you. ❤️❤️❤️”

Many fans also left comments of support, inspired by Cole's honesty and outlook, including someone who wrote, “Thank you for sharing your story with us. Please know that we send our love and prayers to you. Love always finds a way. ❤️❤️”

Bryce Dallas Howard may still not have gotten a chance to direct her dad, Ron, but she's at least been able to see someone else do so. Speaking at a recent Q&A for a live version of Josh Horowitz's “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Bryce revealed that she was on hand for her father's recent cameo on Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's hit Hollywood satire “The Studio.” The Apple TV+ comedy sees Howard play a much more aggressive version of himself caught up in the middle of a difficult editing process with executives.

“I was very nervous for him, so I went with him. I was like a ‘momager,'” said Bryce. “I went with him to set. I liked what he was wearing, I approved of that.”

Bryce also joked about making sure “he was hydrated.” In truth though, Ron proved a pro, being “so on point” during a rehearsal that “everyone was sort of baffled by it, frankly.” To be fair, Howard has played himself before, but Bryce felt this was a different level entirely. Not only did he have multiple scenes to learn, but the style of the show required him to know his lines backwards and forwards.

“He's done some stuff in ‘Arrested Development,'” she said, “he's done some cameos here and there, but [this was] a real part — with, like, dialogue — and they are shooting it all with ‘oners', you cannot mess up!”

After watching her dad in action, Bryce was convinced he must have picked up a few tricks from one of his stalwart collaborators.

“I guess you have learned a bit from Tom Hanks over the years,” Bryce said to her father on stage during the live Q&A. “You were great before Tom Hanks, but he definitely rubbed off on you.”

Howard and Hanks have worked on five films together including “Apollo 13” and “The Da Vinci Code.” Though she hasn't directed her father, Bryce was recently produced by him, as his company Imagine Entertainment worked with her on the new Disney+ documentary “Pets.”

“It's kind of an out-of-body experience,” Ron said of watching Bryce flourish as a director. In watching the final cut of “Pets” with the New York audience at the 92nd Street Y, he added, “I thought I had seen the final cut and yet you were still at it. It's even funnier and more emotional than the last time I had seen it.”

Watch her full Q&A with “Happy Sad Confused” below.

 










“The Studio” is currently streaming on Apple TV+.

Former The Voice Kids‘ contestant Karen Silva has passed away, less than a week after being admitted to the hospital. On April 20, a message was posted on her Instagram.

“Singer Karen Silva is facing a health problem and, at the moment, she is still under medical care, with the support and affection of her family and team. We ask for respect, empathy and prayers as she recovers peacefully. Any updates will be made by our official channels We thank everyone for the love.”

A post shared by K A R E N (@eukarensilvaoficial)

Sadly, the 17-year-old died four days later. 

Silva passed away at 5 am on April 24 at the São João Batista Hospital in Volta Redonda, according to The Daily Mail. Doctors say she suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, due to bleeding into her brain caused by a blood vessel rupturing. 

Her family is devastated and in shock at the suddenness of her death. Her father told local media that she seemed fine the last time he saw her. “She left home to have lunch on Friday, and three hours later she was in a coma. For this year, 2025, we had big plans. For her, her clothing brand, new songs for her album.”

“To know my daughter passed like this, it hurts so much,” he continued. “It still hasn't sunk in.”

Silva was only 12 when she appeared on The Voice Kids in Brazil. She mesmerized both the judges and the audience, advancing to the semi-finals in the competition.

Silva's final Instagram post, made on March 6, featured a carousel of photos and videos from February's Carnival.

A post shared by K A R E N (@eukarensilvaoficial)

After her death was announced, a tribute to the rising star was posted to her Instagram page with the caption, *Note of sorrow* 

“It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of the young singer Karen Silva, aged 17, occurred after days of hospitalization at São João Batista Hospital, in Volta Redonda, as a result of a hemorrhagic stroke.

Karen enchanted Brazil with her powerful voice and striking presence even in childhood, when she participated in The Voice Kids in 2020. Since then, he has followed a luminous path, uniting talent, charisma and representation at every step.

More than an up-and-coming artist, Karen was a symbol of empowerment, especially for Black girls who found in her inspiration and strength to dream. Her music, her message and her joy leave a deep mark on all who met her and followed her journey.

In this moment of great pain, we send our solidarity to their parents, Manoella and Fernando, with friends, family and fans. May the memory of your light continue to guide us.”

Kim Richards made a rare public appearance in New Jersey. On April 25, the former “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star appeared at the Chiller Theatre Expo at the Hilton in Parsippany, NJ.

EntertainmentNOW was on hand to get exclusive photos of Richards, 60, who appeared to be in great spirits as she met up with fans at the sci-fi and pop culture convention.

Richards was set up at a booth as she greeted fans at the convention. The former Bravo star was surrounded by photos from her acting career as well as a poster from her “Real Housewives” days. Richards was in her element as she posed for photos with fans and signed autographs.

The former RHOBH star looked happy and healthy as she spent time with fans who have followed her since her days as a child star in TV shows and films such as “Nanny and the Professor” and “Escape to Witch Mountain.”

The Kim Richards sighting comes two months after her sisters Kyle Richards and Kathy Hilton confirmed she has been spending time in Florida.

In addition to Richards, other celebrity guests at the weekend-long “Chiller Theatre” fan fest include “The Exorcist” star Linda Blair, “MASH” legends Loretta Swit and Jamie Farr, and “Cheers” alum John Ratzenberger.

A post shared by Hollywood Show (@hollywoodshow1)

Richards has been out of the public eye in recent months. She did not appear at all on the most recent season of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” In January, she traveled back to the West Coast for a meet and greet at The Hollywood Show. The fan expo was held January 10 and 11 at the Los Angeles Marriott Burbank Hotel.

While greeting fans, she spoke to podcast host David Yontef. The “Behind the Velvet Rope” host raved about Richards' “lovely energy” as she met up with fans.

“Let's not forget Kim Richards is an actress,” Yontef told his podcast listeners. “She was on ‘Escape from Witch Mountain.' There are people that are a very huge fans of that show and all the other work that she's done.”

In September 2024, TMZ reported that Richards had an alleged relapse with alcohol.  But during the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” reunion, her sisters both said she was doing much better now.

	Although Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthal reunite for some an action-packed bromance in The Accountant 2, one familiar face is missing from the sequel.


	Franchise director Gavin O'Connor recently teased that he plans to have Anna Kendrick reprise her role as accountant Dana Cummings for a future third installment, as Affleck said he's “just waiting for another great script.”


	O'Connor told The New York Times that he and screenwriter Bill Dubuque “have had some preliminary conversations. I am personally running from another puzzle movie, which we've done twice now. One thing weve talked about is the idea of bringing Anna Kendrick [who plays Christian's love interest in the first movie] back. Maybe Christian can finally get the love that he deserves.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“We're hoping she still likes us,” said Affleck, to which O'Connor updated him, “Actually, Ben, she and I have been texting. She said she's a hundred percent in if we want.”


	After Kendrick's Dana sparked romance with Affleck's titular Christian Wolff in the original 2016 action thriller, O'Connor explained to Entertainment Weekly that the “whole point” of the long-awaited sequel “was exploring the brothers and that emotional line between them. That was always the intention, so she was never going to be in the second.”


	In The Accountant 2, now in theaters, Affleck returns as an accountant on the autism spectrum who un-cooks books and launders money for criminal organizations around the world. Following his emotional reunion with brother Braxton (Bernthal) in the previous film, the pair teams up to solve the assassination of Christian's Treasury Department contact Raymond King (J.K. Simmons).

An enigmatic aura was a key ingredient to what made Don Draper one of the most compelling TV characters of all time, but this might not have been possible had “Mad Men” creator Matthew Weiner not fought to cast a relatively unknown entity. Speaking in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter for its “Awards Chatter” podcast, current “Your Friends and Neighbors” star Jon Hamm reminisced about the casting process for the show and the lengths executives went through to prove he had what it took to be a leading man. Ultimately, Hamm shared it came down to Weiner communicating the need to embrace the actor's anonymity as a feature, not a flaw.

“The whole point of this show is that nobody knows who this guy is,” Hamm said of what Weiner told executives. “You can't put — for one of the better examples — Rob Lowe into this show. It would be weird. You would go, ‘Oh, it's the Rob Lowe show. Like, okay, cool.' So that actually worked to my benefit rather than against me.”

That being said, convincing the network to put Hamm as #1 on the call sheet still proved quite the trial. He ended up having to audition “six or seven” times before being flown out to New York for a final meeting with the executives at AMC.

“I think that there were some high-level discussions about, ‘Are we really going to make this kid that nobody knows the lead of our show? This is the first show on our network that's ever existed,'” said Hamm of AMC's concerns. “The conventional wisdom was, you hire somebody that has credits or a thing.”

Thankfully though, during the meeting in New York, Hamm was officially offered the part. Beyond the fact that no one really knew who he was, Hamm also used personal experience and history to build his understanding of the role. In particular, he was reminded of his father, who would've been a contemporary of Don and shared many similar qualities. 

“There was a resting kind of melancholy that I think my dad had as well as Don had, which is a little bit like, you have all of this stuff,” he told THR. “You have all of this privilege. You have all of this access. Everything, it seems, is going your way. So why aren't you happier? And I think that that's part of what drove the show as well.”

Hamm can currently be seen on the Apple TV+ series “Your Friends and Neighbors,” co-starring Amanda Peet and Olivia Munn.

 










“Your Friends and Neighbors” streams on Apple TV+ with new episodes dropping Fridays.

Documentary Editor, Awards


	Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has amassed 386 million subscribers for his YouTube channel, more than any other person on Earth. But he's not stopping there. He's expanding into television with the Prime Video series Beast Games, a reality competition show where contestants vie for $5 million, “the largest cash prize in TV history!”


	MrBeast is among the major names set to take part in today's virtual Deadline's Contenders Television: Documentary, Unscripted & Variety  award-season event, which kicks off at 9 a.m. PT. It's your guide to a different kind of competition — one where the ultimate prize is Emmy gold.

	











	Along with MrBeast, we've got Grammy-winning country music superstar Kelsea Ballerini, representing The Voice from Warner Bros Television Group. Four of the queenly contestants from RuPaul's Drag Race will stop by — Lexi Love, Onya Nurve, Jewels Sparkles, and Sam Star. Love Island USA host Ariana Madix will share secrets from the steamy Peacock series.




			Watch on Deadline		







	We've got comedy covered with Seth Meyers, host of Late Night with Seth Meyers; Saturday Night Live cast members Mikey Day and Ego Nwodim; and The Daily Show's Desi Lydic. Standup comic Iliza Shlesinger will tell us about her Prime Video comedy special Iliza Shlesinger: A Different Animal.


	Animals of every description populate The Americas, the nature series from Universal Television Alternative Studio and NBC. Tom Hanks narrates the 11-part show that examines the super continent all the way from Northern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America. Executive producer Mike Gunton will join Contenders to discuss the wonders revealed, like flamingos that hold a “dance off” at the top of the Andes.


	Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson and Joseph Patel, who won Academy Awards for their 2021 documentary Summer of Soul, will tell us about their follow-up: Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius), streaming on Hulu. It explores the brilliant and groundbreaking musician Sly Stone of Sly and the Family Stone whose limitless talent ran up against a streak of self-sabotage.


	Another music legend headlines the Emmy-contending documentary Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, an inside look at the group's latest tour, from rehearsals to spectacular concerts. Director Thom Zimny, who first worked with Springsteen a quarter of a century ago, will share insights on his latest collaboration with the Boss.

	











	Music made Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip hop producer-performer who launched a record label before branching out into fashion, media and more. But it's been a sharp decline for the mogul, who awaits trial on federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges. His career and the allegations that threaten to send him to federal penitentiary are explored in the explosive Investigation Discovery docuseries The Fall of Diddy. Directors-executive producers Emma Schwartz and Yoruba Richen will join Contenders to discuss Diddy's fate.


	We'll explore a climactic chapter from World War II with a panel on The Eyes of the World: From D-Day to V-E Day. And we'll get the straight story on The Traitors, the cunning Peacock series hosted by Alan Cumming, and some trickery from David Blaine, who travels the world in David Blaine Do Not Attempt in search of prodigious prestidigitators.


	Stay with Deadline all day for coverage of all the panels both on the site and on our social channels via #DeadlineContenders. On Monday, we'll launch the event's streaming site with the complete panel videos.

Plus, Rancho Humilde's CEO goes to Harvard.

Senior Editor, Latin


From career milestones to new music releases to major announcements and those little important moments, Billboard editors highlight uplifting moments in Latin music. Here's what happened in the Latin music world this week.


	The tejano superstar was honored with an RIAA Lifetime Achievement plaque in recognition of 17 million certified units across her career, including 62x Platino Dreaming of You — marking the highest certified Latin album. The honor was presented at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital on April 21, “paying tribute to the enduring impact of her music and cultural legacy,” according to a press release. 

	











	“The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) believes music can change lives, connecting generations and unifying those who speak different languages through shared emotion,” RIAA svp, state public policy & Latin music Rafael Fernandez Jr. said in a statement. “We have seen this as Latin Music in the US gains popularity as the fast-growing genre and through Selena's legacy.This special moment with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital ahead of Dia del Niño (International Day of the Child) reminds us of Selena's passion for bettering the lives of children and encourages each of us to make an impact wherever we can.”

	The founder and CEO of powerhouse indie label Rancho Humilde was the keynote speaker for the event Into the Music, which took place at Harvard University last week. Organized by Harvard-Radcliffe Raza and NEON16, the West Coast-based executive shared his vision regarding Mexican music, Chicano identity, and the role of the Latin community in the United States. 


	“I didn't go to college, but I totally understand the crucial role that academia fulfills in our society,” Humilde said during his speech, according to a press release. “As Latinos, we all have a responsibility in the fight for the recognition of our roots, our traditions, and our culture. It's critical that more young people in our community access quality education at universities such as Harvard. That not only opens doors on an individual level, but it also makes us stronger as a community.” 


	Ivy Queen's trailblazing trajectory in the industry has recently inspired Wendy's latest campaign in Puerto Rico, which seeks to inspire authenticity. The reggaetón icon is the new voice of Wendy's Presents the Breakfast Baconator with next-level ‘flow.'

	











	“Ivy Queen represents a milestone in the world of urban music,” Wendy's chief marketing officer Lizmarie Medina said in a statement. “She's the undisputed ‘Queen' who paved the way for other women and is recognized for her impact and legacy in the genre, for being ‘real,' daring, and authentic, similar to what we do at Wendy's. We break molds and make bold decisions in the face of industry challenges.”

	As of May 2, Noel Schajris' recordings will be available exclusively at Barnes & Noble throughout the U.S., including vinyl and collector's CDs. According to a press release, the Argentine singer-songwriter becomes the first artist with an independent label to have national distribution at the bookseller. 


	“For me it is an immense honor to be able to present my album work alongside a brand like Barnes & Noble,” Schajris said in a statement. “To be able to bring these albums to those fans who love the physical product, the art, the booklets, the smell of the paper… that's priceless. It's a way to keep the essence of music alive as a tangible experience.” 


	The third annual Billboard Latin Women in Music took place Thursday (April 24) where Anitta, Belinda, Celia Cruz, Chiquis, Ha*Ash, Natti Natasha, Olga Tañón and Selena Gomez were honored for their groundbreaking careers and contributions to Latin music.

That's not to say that Ben Affleck's 'Accountant' sequel and the 'Star Wars: Episode III' rerelease aren't also feeding the box office boom, with overall revenue up more than 100 percent over last year.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The weekend box office is on fire, with ticket sales up more than 100 percent over the same frame last year.


	The blaze is led by Warner Bros.' Sinners, directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B. Jordan. Heading into its sophomore outing, the film was expected to compete with Ben Affleck-starrer The Accountant 2 for the top spot with anywhere from $20 million to $25 million. 




	But the supernatural period vampire pic continues to defy all the odds and is now on course to easily stay No. 1 domestically with a phenomenal $42 million to $44 million after earning $13 million on Friday (rival studios all are betting on the higher number). Either way, Sinners — which opened to $48 million a week ago — could enjoy one of the smallest drops in history for a movie playing outside of the year-end holidays

					Box Office: 'Sinners' Eyes Astounding $30M-$40M, 'Accountant 2' Gains Edge Over 'Revenge of the Sith'		
			









Graced with virtually perfect audience scores and the best reviews of filmmaker Coogler‘s already acclaimed career, Sinners has transformed into the rare title that has become a runaway water-cooler sensation. It's expected to finish Sunday with a 10-day cume hovering around $120 million in a major victory for Warners' movie chiefs Pamela Abdy and Michael De Luca.




			Popular on THR		







	Amazon MGM Studios' new action-thriller The Accountant 2 and Disney's 20th Anniversary release of Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith are also fueling the boom (ditto for Warners' A Minecraft Movie, which remains high up on the chart in its fourth weekend). Depending upon who you ask, the order of the three movies varies and won't be determined until Sunday or even Monday.


The Accountant 2 is hoping for a second-place finish with a promising $23 million-$25 million after scoring strong reviews and exit scores, including an A- CinemaScore. That would be a win as Amazon MGM ramps up its theatrical ambitions (it's now home of the James Bond franchise).


	The first Accountant, released by Warners, opened to $24.7 million in 2016 on its way to grossing $155.5 million globally and becoming the most-rented digital film in 2017.


	Reuniting Affleck and director Gavin O'Connor, Accountant 2 currently sports a fresh 76 percent critics score on Rotten Tomatoes, compared to a rotten 53 percent for the first film. Consumers are far more entranced, judging by the sequel's current 93 percent audience Rotten Tomatoes score.

	











	Affleck produced the sequel via his and Matt Damon's Artists Equity, alongside Lynette Howell Taylor for 51 Entertainment and Mark Williams for Zero Gravity Management. The film made its world premiere at SXSW last month, winning the audience award for the Headliners section.


	Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Daniella Pineda, Allison Robertson and J.K. Simmons co-star in Accountant 2, which sees Affleck's character compelled to step in and help solve the murder of an old acquaintance with the help of his estranged brother and a U.S. Treasury agent. Together, they uncover a deadly conspiracy, becoming targets of a ruthless network of killers who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets buried.


Revenge of the Sith is looking at a weekend haul of anywhere from $21 million to $23 million, which would be one of the top openings ever for a rerelease (one rival shows the film earning $25 million). The crownholder belongs to 1977's Star Wars, which grossed $35.9 million when it hit theaters again in 1997, not adjusted for inflation, according to Comscore.


	The Star Wars rerelease comes amid the 20th anniversary of the final of George Lucas' prequel films. The prequels, while divisive at the time, have only grown more appreciated in recent years, with a generation of kids who grew up with them considering them their preferred Star Wars trilogy. Star Hayden Christensen received a rock star-esque greeting last week at the Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo, while he and Sith star Ewan McGregor reprised their roles for the Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi in 2022, returning their versions of the characters to the zeitgeist.

	











	In terms of more recent rereleases in the franchise, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace earned $8.7 million on its opening weekend in May 2024, while the rerelease of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi grossed $5.1 million in late April 2023.


	Both Accountant 2 and Sinners are R-rated and are competing with Revenge of the Sith for male attention, although the latter has the advantage of also playing to families.


	Screen Gem and Sony's new horror offering Until Dawn looks to round out the top five with a forgettable opening in the $7 million to $8 million range.

	Rosa DeLauro



Rosa DeLauro represents Connecticut's 3rd District in the House of Representatives. She is the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, as well as on the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee.


	Last December, I wrote about the dangers of Donald Trump's nomination of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the unqualified, dangerous individuals appointed to lead key public health agencies. I made the case that these appointments, starting with Kennedy, were a deliberate attempt to break our health system, and would make Americans sicker.


	As the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, and of the Labor, Health, and Human Services (LHHS) subcommittee, I prioritize funding and oversight for these agencies. I know the importance of their missions.


	I did not expect Kennedy to simply obliterate health agencies that are key to our nation's progress and leadership in public health.

	Over the past four months, President Trump and RFK Jr., along with unchecked billionaire Elon Musk, have followed through on their threats to destroy the agencies that protect our health. As part of their drastic and haphazard purge and reorganization at HHS, they have eliminated entire agencies. Among them are institutions that have saved the lives of someone near to each and every one of us.


	The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which operates the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline — eliminated.


	The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which is responsible for ensuring access to health care for uninsured, isolated, and vulnerable people, like HIV/AIDS patients, mothers and children, and families in rural communities — eliminated.


	The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), which helps us respond to and prepare for public health emergencies — eliminated.


	And even the Administration for Community Living (ACL), the driving force behind programs like Meals on Wheels that curtail senior hunger and isolation — eliminated.

	I do not believe the American people want less health research, more infectious disease outbreaks, and cuts to Medicaid. The president took time in his first address to Congress to recognize a young boy battling brain cancer. But now, the White House and Republicans are taking resources away from people fighting cancer and diseases of all kinds.

	











	The administration has fired or pushed out thousands of experts and experienced staff who help keep Americans safe from infectious diseases, including Measles, HIV, and tuberculosis.


	Take the example of Peter Marks, the country's top vaccine regulator at the Food & Drug Administration, who helped develop the Covid vaccines at record speed under the first Trump administration. This effort helped prevent over three million additional deaths according to a study from the Commonwealth Fund. None of that mattered, because Marks was told to resign or be fired. In his resignation letter, Marks wrote that, quote, “it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.”


	At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where DOGE has already fired or pushed out 2,400 employees, Kennedy has eviscerated the offices that track the most urgent and alarming threats to public health, from HIV to cancer. These offices collected data that allowed everyone from community physicians to parents to make informed decisions about their families' health. Without this data, our public health experts will have a harder time identifying trends and prioritizing resources in our communities.

	HHS has terminated $11 billion in funding for state and local health departments, and DOGE is demanding CDC slash nearly $3 billion in grant funding, illegally cutting CDC's annual discretionary funding by over 30 percent. They are eliminating scores of CDC programs, including HIV prevention and tobacco prevention programs — programs that help save the lives of men, women, and children all across this country.


	Why on Earth are these the places DOGE is searching for so-called waste? The life of a teenager that does not become addicted to cigarettes is not a waste.


	At the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy has fired more than 2,000 employees, including several Directors of NIH's individual institutes. The administration has withheld federal funding from universities that do not adopt their preferred policies, cancelled research on topics they do not like, put tight restraints on NIH grants, and illegally impounded funding appropriated by Congress. The Administration has even terminated research funding for mRNA vaccines — one of the most promising innovations in medical research.


	There are a few glimmers of hope, and we are now seeing pushback at every level. The public is outraged at the enormous harm this effort has wrought. Dozens of courts have put restraining orders on the Administration's actions. But courts can only play defense.

	











	As the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to lead the fight against this shortsighted, dangerous plan. Congress is an institution that responds to external pressure, and we need to bring the pressure from Americans everywhere if we are going to protect ourselves from this lawless and reckless Trump administration.


	I want to close with an example that hits close to home for me and for millions of American families. In my district, scores of research programs at Yale University's graduate programs are funded by NIH grants. One PhD student at Yale, whose passion for science was inspired by their stepmother's melanoma diagnosis, was awarded the NIH Chemistry-Biology Interface Training Grant, which they are using to explore mechanisms of cancer metastasis.

	I am a cancer survivor. I am alive due to the gift of science and biomedical research. One way or another, cancer touches the lives of almost every single American family. Imagine what will happen to those families now, with these agencies obliterated.

	“I had to text Lily-Rose Depp and say I'm sorry,” casting director Kharmel Cochrane explained this afternoon during a Q&A session at Scotland's Sands Film Festival. 


	The apology was on account of Cochrane dismissing Lily-Rose Depp as a serious contender for a leading role in Robert Eggers's Nosferatu. The vampire remake is one of the many buzzy titles Cochrane has cast in recent years. Her other credits include Saltburn, Rye Lane, and Bob Marley: One Love.  


	“I had said absolutely no way to Lily-Rose Depp,” Cochrane continued, breaking down the Nosferatu casting process.

	“I didn't think she could act. I hadn't seen anything that I thought showed she could act. And I'm not even bothered by the nepotism thing. I think that's a whole other conversation. And then she auditioned. I was wrong. And I've got no shame in saying if I'm not right.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Cochrane ultimately cast Depp alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Emma Corrin, Nicholas Hoult, and Willem Dafoe. The film went on to become a surprise box office hit, crossing the $100 million mark and becoming Focus Features' second highest-grossing movie at the domestic box office, surpassing Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain. 


	During this afternoon's session, Cochrane described Eggers as one of her staple directors with whom she feels most comfortable collaborating.


	“It's Emerald Fennell, Alex Garland, Robert [Eggers], and Lena Dunham,” Cochrane said of her favorite directors. “We've just got a really good thing going. And I genuinely feel safe in my workplace with them. I feel like I can say to them, ‘Oh, look what if we do this,' and I'm not worried about getting fired, because that is a real fear, especially when you're on some of the studio stuff. I got fired recently. I don't want to work like that. I can't do my best work if I'm scared to offer an opinion.” 


	Cochrane also gave the audience at Sands an insight into her unique casting process, which has often been praised as dynamic and diverse. The casting vet said she never lets her work be entirely dictated by a film's script or a director's casting brief. She used the idea of a character's race to illustrate her process. 


	“If something is clearly written as white, for example, a script reads ‘she tied her blonde hair back,' but there's no specific reason for it, I will just put people on tape,” Cochrane said.  “And then it's almost like I dare someone to question why I've done it, and they don't. So then it just becomes normal. Years ago, I would get people saying, ‘did you read the brief?' And I'd say yeah, and this is my interpretation of it, just like when you can read a book.”

	











	The casting vet said she is currently catching a lot of heat for her work on Fennell's forthcoming Wuthering Heights adaptation. Aussie-natives Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi have been cast in the film's central roles. 


	“There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot,” Cochrane said. “But just wait till you see it, and then you can decide whether you want to shoot me or not. But you really don't need to be accurate. It's just a book. That is not based on real life. It's all art.”


	Further teasing Fennell's Wuthering Heights, Cochrane said, “there's definitely going to be some English Lit fans that are not going to be happy” in reference to the film's artistic interpretation of the source material. 


	“Wait until you see the set design because that is even more shocking,” Cochrane said. “And there may or may not be a dog collar in it.”


Sands Film Festival runs until April 27.

Bowen Yang is campaigning for swearing to be a part of “SNL.” The “Saturday Night Live” star told former “SNL” cast member Amy Poehler during his “Las Culturistas” podcast, from EW, that the live sketch series should be allowed to include certain curse words.

“[It's] Standards and Practices, we should be able to say at least five shits and five fucks on ‘SNL' per season,” Yang jokingly said. “We are so hampered in our comedy at ‘SNL' by not being able to say shit and fuck. Let us say shit and fuck.”

Yang continued, “It's us, it's ‘Abbott [Elementary]', it's ‘Ghosts.' We're the last network comedies. Can you give ‘SNL' an exception? […] Shit and fuck are so comedically powerful as words. I really think it would help us.”

“The Wedding Banquet” actor added that swearing would “bring a sketch to the next level” on “Saturday Night Live” and “make it so you'd be able to know this is the real world, not sketch reality.”

Poehler, who left the series in 2008, said that perhaps the lack of swearing adds to the comedy instead. “I do think there's something fun about not being able to say it that causes comedic tension that's fun,” she said. “The air may be let out of that balloon when you do, and you might not get the juice. You want it because you can't have it.”

This isn't Yang's first criticism of “SNL”: He recently told Extra that the viral “White POTUS” sketch did take it too far with Sarah Sherman as a caricature of Aimee Lou Wood. 

“[Her reaction] to that sketch is completely valid,” Yang said of Wood's admission of being offended by the April 12 sketch. “With parody, you kind of forget the sort of human, emotional cost that it sort of extols on someone. […] We just think that she should be so proud of the work that she put into the season, it was just water cooler television again that we desperately have a craving for. So I feel like it's this thing that we tend to forget sometimes and this is a reminder and it seems like she has spoken to people at the show about it and hopefully there's room to sort of move on from it. But yeah, you need those reminders every now and then that parody can go too far sometimes and that we, as comedians, can take account for that instead of banging our foot and saying that we should be able to say whatever we want. That's just culture, it's not PC or woke culture, it's just culture.”

The alt-pop star leaned into her Nashville inclinations in her first gig at the California country festival, but mostly just demonstrated how singular she's always sounded. 


													By
												

	Andrew Unterberger



	The more you watch of Lana Del Rey supposedly going country, the more apparent how ridiculous any talk of her pivoting to any genre really is. 


	For 15 years now, LDR has essentially been a genre unto herself: a unique and borderline-illogical blending of obviously classic influences with some game-changingly modern sensibilities, one that mostly befuddled critics and radio and the charts early on, even as she was inarguably becoming one of the most important pop stars of her generation. She's been wildly influential without ever being less than unmistakable; no matter what sonic, thematic or characteristic elements other artists may borrow from her, none of them would ever risk being taken for Lana herself. This is all to say: no matter what style of music she's making, Lana Del Rey has one genre and that's “Lana Del Rey.” 


	But of course, Lana did lean into The Stagecoach of It All while making her debut performance at the Indio, Calif. country festival on Friday (Apr. 25). Singing in a white dress in front of a set of an idyllic-looking rural house at dusk, she looked like she walked on stage straight from an old Loretta Lynn album cover. Early on, she brought out George Birge — himself a Saturday performer at the festival — to duet on his current hit “Cowboy Songs,” an extremely country radio-friendly song Del Rey says she can't get enough of. (You can certainly imagine a Lanafied version of the chorus, though it was strange to hear her singing on such a zippy and muscular hook in 2025.) And of course, she invoked two all-time genre classics during the show by covering Tammy Wynette's “Stand by Your Man” (“You can't do this set without it”), and then closing the proceedings with a family singalong to John Denver's “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” a recent entry into the LDR cover canon.

	But the new songs? Country-ish in their tempo and in some of their thematic content (and occasional lyrics about “all these country singers”), perhaps, but not in any way that feels at a remove from what she's done her whole career: Lana has long centered the emotional abandon and cinematic sway of country in her songs. You could hear that even in some of the crowd-elating classics Lana performed in the midst of her Grand Ole Opry moment — tweak a couple lyrics and add some banjo and “Ride” is basically a The Chicks single; turn down the sex and turn up the sarcasm and “Video Games” could've been penned by Kacey Musgraves. Nothing about the stately balladry and gender-role explorations of songs like set-opening duo “Husband of Mine” and “Henry, Come On” felt without precedent in her catalog; she could have introduced them as deep cuts from Blue Banisters or Chemtrails Over the Country Club and many of her fans probably would've bought it. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	If there was a pronounced difference with Del Rey in Country Mode on Friday night, it was that she seemed… maybe more polite and unassuming than we're used to her being? Watching her express her very sincere-seeming gratitude at being invited to Stagecoach, and about the size and passion of her Friday night crowd, it was very easy to forget that she was once a highly divisive figure in popular music, one prone to controversy in both her lyrics and public statements. There was no trace of any of that in the smiling, hostly, happy-to-be-here performer who took the stage on Friday night. 

	










A post shared by Billboard Country (@billboardcountry)


	Well, almost none. If you missed a little of the unpredictability and ostentatiousness that characterized early-years Lana Del Rey– and still informed highlights from her work up until this decade — then you probably loved “57.5,” a shuffling new song referring to her number (in millions) of monthly listeners on Spotify, which also includes a bridge which begins with LDR proclaiming “I kissed Morgan Wallen” and going onto advise listeners against going ATVing with him. It takes a lot of “yes, really” to explain, but it was still probably the best of the new songs that she debuted: some real country s–t, but more importantly, pure Lana through and through, in a way no other artist or genre could ever totally capture.

Perpetually glazed drone trio Bitchin Bajas and minimalist polyrhythm factory Natural Information Society have once again burbled up from the neon miasma where the cosmos meets your Discogs want list. Totality, an expansive, blissful 43-minute slow boat of nü-kosmische and minimalist rock, comes nearly 10 years after their last full-length collaboration, 2015's Autoimaginary. That album imagined the charged meeting between Terry Riley (circa 1964) and Terry Riley (circa 1969): The Bajas' new-age synth gush and fluttering flutes paved the Curved Rainbow Road, Natural Info Society steadily driving their drums, harmonium, and Moroccan guimbri down the autobahn. In matching up the tangerine dreamers in the former group and the dream syndicate outsiders in the latter, it would be a challenge to not produce something beautiful. The two bands are deeply steeped in the Chicago experimental music community, enthralled by 20th-century minimalism and Sun Ra, constantly aiming for ecstatic peaks, and willing to ride a wavelength indefinitely.

Naturally, their second album together delivers all their gorgeous hallmarks—warm harmonium drone, weightless synths, and Möbius strips of low end courtesy of Natural Information Society leader Joshua Abrams. If you expect a little more this time around, it's only because the bands have come so incredibly far individually in the last decade. Bitchin Bajas have consistently expanded their palette. Bajas Fresh, their 2017 career peak, sharpened their synths into diamonds of arpeggiated euphoria; the 2021 Sun Ra tribute Switched On Ra let them explore more amorphous and nocturnal zones; and 2022's excellent Bajacillators updated their sound with the hyperreal blips of Laurie Spiegel's Music Mouse software, sounding like a connection between the Berlin school and Japanese ambient. For their part, Natural Information Society have simply become one of best American rock bands going: a propulsive, celebratory dance act endlessly grooving somewhere on the perimeters of Afrobeat, avant-jazz, Gnawa music, and Steve Reich.

On Totality, NIS mostly deal in atmosphere and drama. Nearly 17 minutes long, the self-titled opener pulsates and throbs with specks of percussion and errant electronics, spiraling like dank, dazed, psychonautical jams in the vein of the Grateful Dead's “Dark Star” or Black Sabbath's “Planet Caravan.” Around the 12-minute mark, Abrams kicks into a lackadaisical 7/8 bassline and the track slowly morphs into a Jon Hassell-style dance under the moonlight. Side B sprawler “Always 9 Seconds Away” has a similarly sleepy crawl but plays like a doom-jazz version of the memory game Simon, its disjunctive melody growing like lichen.

The album finds its heights on the outliers, a pair of comparatively shorter tracks driven by NIS drummer Mikel Patrick Avery. The Harmonia vibes of “Nothing Does Not Show” are perfectly complemented by Avery's percolating rhythms, giving some focus to the haze. Closer “Clock No Clock” is a true marvel of jazz-motorik, Avery bustling with percussive raindrops, building to a hectic (yet marvelously mellow) climax.

Another sublime slab from two bands seemingly incapable of making a bad record, Totality doesn't really play to either bands' strengths as of late. National Information Society mostly keep cool, instead of firing up a perpetual-motion machine for head-boggling grooves. Bitchin Bajas remain flame-keepers of the sphere where Teutonic poise meets new-age fuzzies, but here they act as patient collaborators instead of scene-stealing spacemen. Still, this seven-headed hydra of head music remains a great ambassador of vibes.

"So, when you bring that word out, you know, I feel like they're the GOAT of evil, and it just conflates," the comedian said during a conversation with Al Gore on Friday's 'Real Time.'


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Bill Maher still defends his White House visit with President Donald Trump.


	During the latest episode of his weekly HBO series, Real Time, the host sat down with Al Gore where the former vice president admitted that he understood why Maher accepted the invitation to meet with Trump, recalling how he himself met with Trump ahead of the Republican president's first term.




	“It's just that [when] somebody comes with an offer and says, this person who's been dominating our life, whether you like him or not, for 10 years like nobody ever has in history, would you like to see it up close?” Maher said on the show. “Would you like to see the Trumpadopoulos up close? You know, I mean, of course, who wouldn't?”

	Earlier in the interview, the duo discussed Gore's recent speech opening San Francisco Climate Week, in which the 2000 Democratic presidential candidate criticized the Trump administration and made headlines for creating parallels between the actions of the Republican president and his team in their second term and what happened in the early days of Nazi Germany.


	“I understand very well why it is wrong to compare Adolf Hitler's Third Reich to any other movement,” Gore said. “It was uniquely evil, full stop. I get it. But there are important lessons from the history of that emergent evil.”


	He added, though, “It was [Jürgen] Habermas' mentor, Theodore Adorno, who wrote that the first step in that nation's descent into hell was, and I quote, ‘the conversion of all questions of truth into questions of power.' He described how the Nazis, and I quote again, ‘attacked the very heart of the distinction between true and false.' End quote. The Trump administration is insisting on trying to create their own preferred version of reality.”


	On Friday's show, Maher said, “I just think Nazi is a hard word to use with nuance. So, when you bring that word out, you know, I feel like they're the GOAT of evil, and it just conflates.”


	Gore defended his speech, though Maher argued that “the side of the country that voted for Trump, [when] they hear Nazi, they just go, ‘Oh, you're calling us Nazis.'”


	He added, “First of all, it's a bit of a false premise, as bad as they are. And also it just says to them, ‘Well, you just hate us.' One thing I've learned in recent years is that the one thing that's more powerful than money is hate.” 

	











	Their conversation came after Maher responded to Larry David's satirical “My Dinner With Adolf” essay that mocked the comedian's visit with Trump where he said the president was “gracious and measured,” and not like the “person who plays a crazy person on TV.” During a Thursday interview with Piers Morgan, the Real Time host said his essay was “insulting to six million dead Jews” and that “it's an argument you kind of lost just to start it.”


	“Look, maybe it's not completely logically fair, but Hitler has really kind of got to stay in his own place,” Maher said Thursday. “He is the GOAT of evil. We're just going to have to leave it like that.” 


	In David's “My Dinner With Adolf” essay, he satirically recalled having dinner “with the world's most reviled man, Adolf Hitler.” He added, “I had been a vocal critic of his on the radio from the beginning, pretty much predicting everything he was going to do on the road to dictatorship. No one I knew encouraged me to go. ‘He's Hitler. He's a monster.' But eventually I concluded that hate gets us nowhere. I knew I couldn't change his views, but we need to talk to the other side — even if it has invaded and annexed other countries and committed unspeakable crimes against humanity.”


	The guest essay pulled similar verbiage from Maher's monologue from his April 11 episode where he recounted his visit with Trump and Kid Rock. During the visit, Maher said, he “never felt I had to walk on eggshells around” the president. 

	











	He added, “Honestly, I voted for [Bill] Clinton and [Barack] Obama, but I would never feel comfortable talking to them the way I was able to talk with Donald Trump. That's just how it went down, make of it what you will.”

SPOILERS: This post contains details about Final Destinations: Bloodlines


	After 25 years, death has a few twists in store for fans of the Final Destination franchise.


	With the sixth installment Final Destination: Bloodlines premiering May 16 in theaters, director Zach Lipovsky recently teased how the upcoming sequel deviates from the series of horror movies.


	“For this film, the first premonition takes place in 1969,” he explained to SFX Magazine. “There are lots of deaths during the premonition, which is what normally happens in the opening sequence of a Final Destination movie, but we then come out of the eye of a different person in the modern day. That's new. For a lot of fans, I think that's going to immediately throw them for a loop. It's going to make them lean forward to try and figure out what's going on.”

	Lipovsky, who co-directed with Adam Stein, added, “As moviegoers, we love it when you have to lean forward in your seat because a movie is being unpredictable. We switch up a lot of the predictability, including who's going to die next and how they are going to die. You might think it's one person, but it's not. There's a delight in that.”


	The deadly 1969 premonition was teased in the first trailer, which dropped last month, surpassing 178.7 million worldwide views to become the second-most viewed horror movie trailer in its first 24 hours.


Final Destination: Bloodlines goes back to the very beginning of Death's twisted sense of justice. Plagued by a violent recurring nightmare, college student Stefanie heads home to track down the one person who might be able to break the cycle and save her family from the grisly demise that inevitably awaits them all.

Virginia Giuffre, the woman who accused the late convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein of trafficking her as a teenager, has died by suicide at the age of 41.


	Giuffre died in Neergabby, Australia, where she had been living, confirmed NBC News. “It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,” her family said in a statement to the outlet. “She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.”


	Giuffre, born Virginia Roberts, had alleged that she was brought into Epstein's circle by his now-convicted sex trafficker associate Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000, when she was 16, with the pair grooming her to provide sexual services to Epstein. At that point, she had already experienced the trauma of sexual assault by a family friend, lived on the streets of South Florida as a child runaway, and suffered abuse at the hands of Miami sex trafficker Ron Eppinger, who pleaded guilty in 2001 to smuggling women from Europe for prostitution.

	











	As the investigation into the harrowing allegations of sexual abuse against Epstein began, Giuffre became the most prominent whistleblower and provided key information to law enforcement that contributed to the conviction of Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for helping Epstein recruit, groom, and abuse girls. Giuffre alleged in depositions that she had been trafficked to powerful men in Epstein's orbit including former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell and Prince Andrew. Both denied the allegations.


	Epstein was arrested and charged by federal prosecutors with sex-trafficking and conspiracy in 2019. Just a month later, as he was being held without bail in Manhattan after pleading not guilty to the federal charges, Epstein was found dead in his jail cell. His death was ruled a suicide.

	In 2015, Giuffre founded Victims Refuse Silence, since renamed as Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (SOAR), a nonprofit advocacy group for survivors of sex trafficking. Following Epstein's death, she sat down with BBC and during the interview Giuffre claimed she had been trafficked to Prince Andrew and raped by the royal on three occasions, echoing allegations she had first made in a 2014 Florida court filing. She later sued Prince Andrew for sexual assault, and he settled the case out of court in 2022, before he would have been forced to give a sworn deposition. Andrew also pledged a donation to Giuffre's charity but did not admit to any of her claims.

	











	“Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking,” her family's statement read. “She was the light that lifted so many survivors.”

The pair's March 21, 2026, show will mark the first stadium comedy show since 2022, amid a recent boom in the live comedy space.

	Comedians Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias and Jo Koy are playing SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on March 21, 2026, officials with the stadium announced earlier this week. 


	Titled One Night Only, the show is produced by comedy promoter Icon Concerts and is anticipating a paid attendance of up to 55,000 fans.


	“We've been wanting to do this show for a number of years but it wasn't until recently that we've been able to make everyone's schedule work,” explains Mike Bernal, vp of Icon Concerts. “Gabriel [Iglesias] is an L.A. hometown hero and Jo is nearby in Seattle and has a huge following in Southern California and sold thousands of tickets in the market.”

	











	Bernal says initial presales have been strong, noting “they are selling evenly across all price points, which is what we like to see.” Ticket prices start at between $69 to $113 for the 500 section, $138 to $170 for the midlevel 300 section and $326 for floor seats.

One Night Only will mark a rare feat in the live comedy business; in the last decade, only a handful of comedians have headlined stadiums, including, most recently, Iglesias, who headlined Dodger Stadium in 2022. In 2015, Kevin Hart performed before an audience of more than 53,000 fans in Philadelphia, and last year, comedian Nate Bargatze became one of the first comedians to sell more than 1 million tickets in a single year, earning $82 million from an impressive 148 shows.


	Comedy is a bigger business than ever in the live space. The top 10 comedy tours generated a combined $397.3 million from 4.3 million fans last year, according to Billboard Boxscore. That's up 52% from 2023, when the top 10 generated $260 million from 2.9 million fans.


	Iglesias came in at No. 3 on Billboard's Top Comedy Tours chart for 2024, grossing $42.8 million with 603,000 tickets sold from 124 shows. Koy ranked No. 10 on the chart, grossing $26 million from 83 shows in front of 368,000 fans. 


	“Since day one, I wanted to bring comedy to the stadium,” explains Adolfo Romero, vp of programming and booking for SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park, which is home to a number of smaller venues, including a new Belgian spiegeltent built for CineVita, the cinema live experience first announced in December.


	“We're at a 750-person capacity in the spiegeltent,” Romero said. The complex also includes the 6,000-capacity YouTube Theater, which has played host to a number of comedy events, including the 2024 Black Comedy Festival.

	











	“We want to make sure that when people go out to see comedy, it's not just the Laugh Factory or in Hollywood,” says Romero, adding that he hopes One Night Only “showcases the stadium in a different way,” noting SoFi's carefully designed sightlines and visual technology designed to enhance the live experience.


	“Sound is really important to them, and we have the five levels of LED screen as well at the stadium [that] they can also use as part of the show,” Romero said. “Their production team is working with our team to ensure that the sound and the sidelines for fans coming in are going to be the best for comedy.”


	Tickets for the show are now on sale at Ticketmaster.com.

Sahiba Bali's gifts disappeared from her room automatically
Sahiba, who is an influencer and also an actress, is someone who likes to be away from the limelight. In a recent story that went viral on Reddit, Sahiba shared that she does not necessarily believe in paranormal activities or ghosts, but she does believe in energies. And it's so weird that she does not know why she is sharing this. The actress made a selfie video and showed on top of the table that she had kept some gifts that she got from Egypt. It had some dates, jewellery, a tomb and a crystal. In her words:

"Now, a tomb basically represents death right, and the crystal was part of the pyramid. And last night I kept everything here so when I woke up in the morning, no one had entered my room. My dates and random jewellery are there but the two things that are not there are the tomb and the crystal, and it is bizarre. And I searched my entire room, I kept it last night before sleeping. I have woken up. Everything is constant except the presence of those two."

These spirits don't always manifest physically." One user wrote, "Sundar log bhi bhootpaglu hotey hai. What's bizzaaareee is she was definitely high."

A netizen blames cricketer, Shreyas Iyer for paranormal activity that took place with Sahiba Bali
For the unversed Punjab Kings (PBKS) player, Shreyas Iyer was earlier seen engaging in playful banter with Sahiba. She had branded him as a rude person as he did not invite her to the gym. Sahiba was seen sitting in the car with Shreyas and telling him that his tattoo was cool and intricate. He said his tattoo was immaculate, to which she told him why he was scolding her. She said she would walk with him as he had his gym class, to which Shreyas did not even call her. A netizen wrote:

When Sahiba Bali shared about having a non-social media life
Earlier, in an interview with the Hindustan Times, Sahiba shared that it is good to have certain boundaries, she supposes. It gives a break to your non-social media life as well. She explained that there are times when she does not like being an influencer. In her words:      


"I recently got a car, and the car dealership knew of me. They were really excited that I purchased the car from them. They said, 'Please make a Reel and put it up'. I said no. They said, 'All influencers and actors do that'. But I didn't want to."

Sahiba, who is an influencer and also an actress, is someone who likes to be away from the limelight. In a recent story that went viral on Reddit, Sahiba shared that she does not necessarily believe in paranormal activities or ghosts, but she does believe in energies. And it's so weird that she does not know why she is sharing this. The actress made a selfie video and showed on top of the table that she had kept some gifts that she got from Egypt. It had some dates, jewellery, a tomb and a crystal. In her words:

"Now, a tomb basically represents death right, and the crystal was part of the pyramid. And last night I kept everything here so when I woke up in the morning, no one had entered my room. My dates and random jewellery are there but the two things that are not there are the tomb and the crystal, and it is bizarre. And I searched my entire room, I kept it last night before sleeping. I have woken up. Everything is constant except the presence of those two."

Netizens discuss Sahiba Bali's tomb souvenir vanishing
A Redditor saw the story of Sahiba's crystal vanishing and shared that sometimes it happens when there is too much negativity. It meant that it took away all the negativity. A Redditor also said, "According to an obscure Egyptian legend, there's a type of protective spirit called a Sah-Hekau- a guardian of objects linked to death. These spirits don't always manifest physically." One user wrote, "Sundar log bhi bhootpaglu hotey hai. What's bizzaaareee is she was definitely high." One also said, "IDK about her incident but I do believe in this!"

The NFL draft slide Shedeur Sanders began in the first round grew into an avalanche in the second and third rounds on Friday, and while teams seemingly ran away from the Colorado quarterback, the explanation as to why started to get murky.

Look, I don't believe the NFL is blackballing Shedeur Sanders. 

Or punishing his father, Deion Sanders. 

Or conspiring to put the next generation of one of the league's most decorated names out of business.

But it would take a damn fool to dismiss the possibility that something is in play either with the teams or the player that extends beyond sheer athletic talent and is causing a problem.

Up until the start of the third round on Friday, I was fully on board with the idea that Shedeur Sanders hadn't been selected in either the first or second round because the league's personnel people simply didn't think he was good enough. 

I based it on all those sacks Sanders took the last two years, and those pro day hiccups, and his good-not-great arm. I was fully invested in the idea that the evaluation process was simply doing its thing.

I didn't blink when Cam Ward went first overall to the Titans because he's the real deal. I agreed with the Giants picking Jaxson Dart because his ceiling is much higher than Sanders'.

Look, I even understood the Tyler Shough selection by the New Orleans Saints because you put his athletic abilities and arm and speed and size next to Sanders, it's clear the Saints picked the more gifted prospect.

But then the third round came and all sorts of weird started happening.

Jalen Milroe got drafted at No. 92 overall by the Seattle Seahawks. And this is where I stipulate that Milroe ran a 4.37 at his pro day and Sanders didn't run at his because it would have been somewhere in the 4.8 range.

But Milroe is less accurate and slower at reading defenses than Sanders.

And Milroe, the latest Alabama quarterback surrounded by a depth chart full of future NFL players, did less with more talent at Alabama than Sanders did at Colorado and Jackson State.

Then things got really wacky. The Cleveland Browns, at one point connected to Sanders with their No. 2 overall pick, selected for the fifth time in this draft.

Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel throws out a pass during the Oregon football's Pro Day Tuesday, March 18, 2025, at the Moshofsky Center in Eugene, Ore.

And after not taking Sanders in the first round, and not taking him with either of their picks in the second round, and not selecting him with their initial pick of the third round, they turned in the card for Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel with the No. 94th overall selection.

The Browns, ladies and gentlemen, lost the plot right there.

Gabriel is not a better prospect than Sanders. He's 5-foot-11 and 205ish pounds, so he's not bigger. He doesn't have an appreciably stronger arm.

He's simply not the superior athlete. Or better prospect. An ESPN draft analyst selected a comparable player in his profile of Gabriel before this draft.

Kellen Moore.

And, yes, Gabriel was productive at Oregon and Oklahoma and UCF.

But is he a better quarterback prospect than Sanders because he processes quicker and reads defenses better and can throw from different arm angles? No.

And that's where I become convinced it's no longer strictly about athleticism and talent and the tape with Sanders. It has to be something else.

And I'm not alone.

"This thing is surprising," Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton said Friday night. "… I think we all are surprised … The talent, holy cow."

Payton, a former quarterback coach and offensive coordinator, knows the quarterback position. And he's certain Sanders can play. And furthermore, Payton is certain when Sanders does play, he's going to make some NFL people look bad.

"Like, there'll be this chip on his shoulder," Payton said. "And beware because this guy is going to play in this league. I think it's hard for any of us to explain what other people are looking for. We're focused on what we're looking for and, yeah, I think it's surprising."

Cleveland Browns general manager Andrew Berry responds to questions during Watson's introductory press conference at the Cleveland Browns Training Facility on March 25, 2022.

So let's ask one of the people who was looking at quarterbacks and picked Dillon Gabriel, why every NFL team seems to be running away from Sanders.

"You know what, I think it's unfair for me to comment, I guess, maybe on behalf of the industry," Browns general manager Andrew Berry said. "All I can say is this: You know, the time that we spent with Shedeur, and what he's done throughout his college career is impressive. He's an impressive young man. He's a really good quarterback.

"Sometimes, fit comes into play, and I'd also say this, there are four more rounds of the draft. Lastly, it's less about where you get picked, and what you do after you get picked. That's really the most important thing.

"Getting to know him over the course of the spring, he has a ton of resolve and I think he's going to find himself in a really good spot."

That doesn't answer the question. It merely suggests the Browns think Sanders will be productive, but are comfortable with that production happening elsewhere.

So there has to be something about Sanders that so far is putting NFL people off. There's something beyond quarterback play because, again, Gabriel and Milroe are not necessarily better players.

So, is it the whole entitlement thing that some anonymous scouts have mentioned? We have to consider that because Sanders can come off as kind of arrogant.

"You think I'm worried about what critics say or what people got to say?" Sanders told reporters at the scouting combine. "You know who my dad is? They hated on him, too. So it's almost normal. Without people hating, it's not normal for us. So we like the adversity. We like everything that comes with the name. That's why we are who we are."

Some teams, frankly, could see this and believe Sanders to be confident and strong-willed.

But others could see him as lacking introspection or the willingness to self-examine. People like that always think it's a you-problem instead of a them-problem. And that is a terrible trait for a quarterback or leader.

Perhaps that, more than physical traits and the tape, is why teams are so far not picking Sanders.

Panic and fear have gripped residents of Musukwani area in Jakara, Kano Municipal Local Government Area, following the mysterious disappearance of two young boys believed to have gone missing inside a large, deep ditch in the neighborhood.

The alarming incident has raised fresh concerns, with locals linking the location to possible supernatural forces due to repeated strange occurrences in the area.

Eyewitnesses say the latest case happened on Monday, April 21, 2025, when one of the boys reportedly removed his clothes and wallet — which contained money — and handed them over to some people nearby before entering the ditch.

“We were sitting here when the boy came, took off his clothes, including his wallet with money, and asked us to keep them for him. He said he was going into the ditch to check something, as they usually store things like rods inside. He never came back. Even after nightfall, we closed our shops and went home. The next morning, there was still no sign of him. His belongings are still with us,” Abdul Basit Yusha'u Safiyanu told DAILY POST.

This is not an isolated incident. Just a few days earlier, another boy named Dan Sani also entered the same ditch with a friend and was never seen again. His disappearance remains unresolved.

Musa Hamza, a community leader and maternal uncle of (Dan Sani) one of the missing boys, expressed deep concern and frustration.

“He's my nephew, about 12 years old. He and his friend came to the ditch. He told his friend to wait while he went in. When the friend noticed he wasn't coming back, he ran home to tell us. We searched everywhere — even the mortuary — but nothing. All we have now are rumors and fear. Even the fire service officers who entered the ditch struggled to get back out,” he lamented.

Efforts to rescue the boys were made by the Kano State Fire Service. According to the commission's spokesperson, Saminu Yusuf Abdullahi, the service received a distress call at exactly 3:55 p.m. on April 21.

“In response to a call from one Hamisu Wakili, our team rushed to the site in Jakara, but unfortunately, we could not find the missing individuals, and had to call off the operation,” he confirmed in a phone interview with DAILY POST.

Residents, however, believe the ditch may have more than meets the eye. Some, like Sadam Saraki, linked the area to paranormal activity, claiming it has long been known as a hub for spiritual and mysterious happenings.

Now, the people of Jakara are calling on the Kano State Government and emergency agencies to urgently investigate and take action before more lives are lost.

“People are scared. We can't sleep with both eyes closed anymore,” one resident said.

The fate of the missing boys remains unknown, as the community anxiously awaits answers.

In Supernatural's 15-year run, Sam and Dean have met demons, angels, monsters, hunters, and more. Some would become friends or unlikely allies, while others would become their enemies. Every new character needed to be introduced, and a number of them were more memorable than others.

While Sam and Dean Winchester have pretty awesome first introductions in the pilot episode, plenty of other characters create lasting impressions with notable debuts. Every so often, Supernatural would introduce a new character in a way that was not only memorable but also revealed who they were in a single scene.

In season seven's "The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons Tattoo," Sam and Dean get an alert from Frank—an eccentric, paranoid hunter, who was looking into Dick Roman. The message warned them that someone was hacking into his files. Enter Charlie Bradbury, a spunky hacker with a special "spark" and a love of sci-fi and fantasy.

"The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons Tattoo"

April 27, 2012

9.1/10

A terrifying member of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse could be the perfect villain for a Supernatural revival. 

 Audiences first meet Felicia Day's Charlie as she rides up on her yellow scooter, puts her headphones on, and goes to work. She cheerfully swipes her badge and steps onto the elevator. Realizing she is alone, Charlie dances like no one's watching. She plays it cool as the doors open to her floor, where she goes to her desk to transfer money from conservative politicians to animal charities. Then she shows pictures of her latest hookup to her co-worker, saying, "If you can't score at a reproductive rights function, then you simply cannot score."

When Sam gets whammied with a love spell by an obsessed fan, Becky Rosen, he no longer wants to hunt with Dean, but with his new bride. Bobby sends another hunter named Garth to help Dean with his investigation. The first time audiences set eyes on the newest Supernatural character, he's happily slurping on a milkshake.

Dean sits down and asks Garth if Bobby filled him in on the case. Garth, being a straight shooter, says, "He told me two things. One, he's tangling with a major-league nest up in Oregon territory. Numero dos, he said you'd be all, uh, surly and premenstrual working with me. But, hey, man, sticks and stones." When Dean shows Garth the newspaper article about their case, Garth immediately flips to the funny pages, laughing and saying, "Oh, Marmaduke, you crazy."

A big, bad demon that wants Sam's head on a pike was teased a few episodes before viewers met her. In "Jus In Bello," Sam, Dean, and a few others fight off a horde of demons working for Lilith. They manage to exercise them, but one gets away and reports what happened.

9.3/10

In its 15-season run, Supernatural introduced some very bizarre concepts and storylines some of which didn't work for the fans.

After Sam and Dean leave, a young girl enters the police station. She sweetly asks about Sam and Dean. The secretary, Nancy, asks for her name, to which she responds, "Lilith." Before anyone can react, her eyes turn gray, she holds up her hand, and a bright light fills the room, killing everyone inside. Using a child as her "meat suit" was a hint at her twisted brand of cruelty that audiences would see later in "No Rest for the Wicked."

 Arthur Ketch was an enforcer and torturer for the British Men of Letters. Ketch was teased before he was officially introduced. First, as the person to call when interrogations weren't yielding answers, more extreme measures were needed. In "American Nightmare," Ketch's face isn't seen, but he is around, following Sam and Dean's investigation. When they let the psychic girl go, he kills her casually and without hesitation.

Audiences meet Arthur Ketch in "LOTUS." When Sam and Dean get stopped by the Secret Service, who are working for Lucifer, a black sedan casually pulls up to the scene, and out steps Ketch with a grenade launcher in hand. He fires a shot into the Secret Service's sedan before strolling over to speak with Sam and Dean, kicking Agent Rick Sanchez in the face along the way. After a couple of quips, he introduces himself with a wry smile, demonstrating his callous, playful attitude towards extreme violence.

 Everyone's favorite crossroads demon first appears in season five. After Lucifer has risen, Sam and Dean seek out Samuel Colt's gun in hopes it can kill the devil. The colt is the possession of Crowley, King of the Crossroads. The boys break into Crowley's estate to steal the gun but find him waiting for them, ready to hand over the powerful weapon.

"Abandon All Hope"

9.2/10

In Supernatural's season four premiere, Castiel's true nature is foreshadowed in a brief exchange between Bobby and Dean.

Before the heist, viewers see Castiel spying on Crowley as he wraps up a crossroads deal. A rich banker wanted to make a deal, but since he was a "big fish," Crowley showed up to seal the deal personally. The banker was put off by the idea of kissing a man, and Crowley had no patience for it, saying, "You can cling to six decades of deep-seated homophobia, or give it up and get a complete bailout for your bank's ridiculous incompetence." The scene shows off Crowley's charisma, intelligence, and love of making people feel uncomfortable in less than ninety seconds.

Cain, the father of murder and the first knight of hell, bore the Mark of Cain. Dean and Crowley seek him out when searching for the First Blade, the only weapon that could kill Abaddon. From the moment Crowley spots Cain tending to his bees, he is on edge. Crowley's fear and discomfort tell Dean just how dangerous Cain is.

Cain lives alone, having retired 150 years ago. He invites Dean and Crowley inside for tea and tells them his story. When demons show up, audiences get to see Cain's power. After transferring the mark to Dean, Cain sends them off to safety and single-handedly takes out the entire army of demons.

Dean Winchester is one of Supernatural's most beloved characters, and there are more than a few reasons that prove why.

Rowena adopts the two women she saved and tells them about magic, revealing that she's a new kind of witch. She doesn't serve demons like other viewers have seen on Supernatural. Rowena possessed latent, natural magical power that she'd cultivated over hundreds of years. At the end of the episode, Crowley identifies her as his mother.

In the first episode of season eleven, a black fog sweeps over the land. As it passes over the Impala, Dean vanishes from the car. Inside the darkness, Dean sees a woman, her head slowly turning to face him. Throughout the episode, viewers catch glimpses of her until the end when she tells Dean they're connected and will always help each other.

The mysterious conversation and Amara's hypnotic voice entrance Dean and the audience in her first scene. Jensen Ackles and Emily Swallow bring the intensity of emotion.

When Dean is mysteriously pulled out of Hell, he is determined to find who or what brought him back. Throughout the episode, the truth about Castiel is gradually revealed, from causing Dean's ears to bleed to burning out Pamela's eyes. In the final scene of the episode, Dean summons Castiel to get some answers.

There are some other great fantasy shows, old and new, that fans can watch to scratch the Supernatural itch. 

Castiel enters a heavily warded building in a shower of sparks as the lightbulbs burst. Dean and Bobby shoot him, and Dean stabs him, but nothing fazes him. He touches a finger to Bobby's forehead, and Bobby collapses, asleep. Castiel tells Dean he is an Angel of the Lord. When Dean doesn't believe him, Castiel summons lightning, revealing his wings as large shadows that stretch out from his back. The image is iconic of Supernatural.

 In "Two Minutes to Midnight," the Pale Horseman strides down the street in an epic slow-motion walk. A man on his phone bumps into Death and collapses a few steps later, dead. Jennifer Titis's "O'Death" plays over the epic introduction to the Grim Reaper.

Death becomes an even more intriguing character when he meets with Dean. Dean finds Death enjoying some deep-dish pizza in Chicago. He invites the hunter to join him and reveals that he's bound by Lucifer to do the devil's bidding, and Death's not happy about it. Dean's fear and reverence for the unstoppable force help create an unsettling first impression of Death.

There are many characters in Supernatural who have done amazing things, but Jack Kline is the only one with a title that fans don't even know.

ABC has always been a mainstay in television with great shows that once changed everything, with three amazing shows in particular.

CBS is moving over an actor from its sitcom Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage to its Fire Country spinoff to play Morena Baccarin's ex-husband.

The underrated fantasy series is perfect for Harry Potter, Twilight, and Outlander fans.

After last week's stunning ending, The Last of Us is set to return next week for season 2, episode 2, and it will be a devastating follow-up.

Dexter is TV's favorite killer and despite a flawed series, there are some episodes that remain flawless from start to finish.
