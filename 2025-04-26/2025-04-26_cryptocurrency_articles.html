                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In fact, data from SoSoValue shows that they were the worst-performing crypto basket over the last 12-month period, enduring a 62% drop in the period, compared to a 174% rise on PayFi tokens. However, under the Trump administration's crypto-friendly stance, it might be changing. White House official X's account also mentioned on the social media platform about the tie-up amid a plethora of other collaborations with tech giants. Shoutout to @GoGalaGames for designing the Digital White House Egg Hunt Game! The game, hosted at easter.gala.games, offered a "free and simple" experience where players collected virtual eggs to win unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) stored on GalaChain, Gala's proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, the company said in an announcement shared with CoinDesk. Players were able to log in, explore, and collect eggs without needing a crypto wallet experience, Gala Games said. The Web3 gaming firm told CoinDesk that over 300,000 games have been played since the event launched, with about 100,000 new accounts created. Roughly 17% of participants went on to explore Gala's other projects, suggesting real user engagement beyond the Easter event. The project, founded in 2019 by Zynga co-founder Eric Schiermeyer, has been laying the groundwork for broader adoption through partnerships with DreamWorks Animation, NBCUniversal, and collaborations with artists like Snoop Dogg. Earlier this month, Gala Film announced a partnership with LG Electronics to bring Web3 entertainment to TVs, and the company hinted it is working with a government agency on transparency efforts. "We have a team dedicated to government outreach," they said. "I also spent time at Mar-a-Lago and spoke with the President. But mainly we wanted to help make the event more fun, and I think that sentiment was well received." Jack O'Holleran, CEO of SKALE Labs, told CoinDesk that GameFi has never stopped expanding, but its issue has been visibility instead. The technology, on top of that, has matured. "In the past, you needed to manage your own crypto wallets and pay high gas fees just to play," he said. "Now, gas-free blockchains and seamless onboarding remove those barriers." “Functional values and utility that blockchain brings to gaming cannot be suppressed for much longer," he added. Still, a broader adoption of the GameFi sector will require further meaningful collaboration with mainstream gaming outlets. "Until blockchain games introduce fundamentally new experiences, government partnerships alone won't drive mass adoption."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Get the latest news and updates from Dawn The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on Saturday partnered with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by United States President Donald Trump, to advance cryptocurrency applications and boost blockchain adoption. Trump and his affiliates hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, which launched last year. The US president has promised to regulate the industry favourably and his administration has eased enforcement actions against several big industry players. The delegation comprised Zachary Folkman, Chase Herro and Zachary Witkoff, the son of Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. It added that the delegation met the prime minister, chief of army staff, deputy prime minister, information and defence ministers to formalise cooperation, “marking a major step toward positioning Pakistan as a global leader in the digital finance revolution”. A delegation from World Liberty Financial meets the Pakistan Crypto Council in Islamabad on April 26. “The scope of cooperation between [the] PCC and WLF outlines collaboration in key areas including: launching regulatory sandboxes for blockchain financial product testing; facilitating the responsible growth of DeFi (decentralised finance) protocols; exploring [the] tokenisation of real-world assets like real estate and commodities; expanding stablecoin applications for remittances and trade; and providing strategic advisory on blockchain infrastructure and global regulatory trends,” the press release reads. Aurangzeb was quoted as saying, “Pakistan's youth and technology sector are our greatest assets. Through partnerships like this, we are opening new doors for investment, innovation and global leadership in the blockchain economy.” Saqib, meanwhile, said the agreement was “more than just a partnership, it's a strategic move to empower our young population and integrate Pakistan into the future of global finance”. “With rising mobile penetration, a vibrant freelance economy, and strong government interest in blockchain, Pakistan's youth are uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of Web3 innovation.” In an interview with Bloomberg, Saqib said Pakistan aimed to create “a clear regulatory framework for governing digital-asset activities to boost the local ecosystem”. “Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines,” he said, adding that they wanted to attract international investment because the country was a low-cost high-growth market with 60pc of the population under 30.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even with this fresh momentum, Ethereum is still sitting about 63% lower than its record high of $4,891, a peak it hit back in 2021. Adding complexity to the current picture, recent data from on-chain movements and exchange activity hints that its future price swings might be influenced more by larger economic trends and strategic moves by big traders rather than organic growth. Analysts often view such behavior as a sign of increased speculative trading or shifts in traders' expectations for upcoming volatility. These spikes often occur when traders are either bracing for large price swings or preparing to leverage new positions. Although that kind of movement is not a guaranteed signal for where the market might head, it does show rising anticipation among traders. A market on edge can break either way, and with so much ETH flowing into derivatives, caution is now setting the tone. Taha highlighted that this spike in derivative inflows came around the same time as a key announcement from former US President Donald Trump. While macroeconomic signals are not everything, in a jittery market, they still carry significant weight. Taha emphasized how closely cryptocurrency markets are tied to central bank policy and broader economic health. A measure of stability on that front could help, but technical factors still seem to be leading Ethereum's current moves. Looking outside Ethereum, movements in the Bitcoin market could have an indirect impact on ETH's price. On April 23, more than $600 million worth of Bitcoin was transferred from whale wallets to exchanges, the largest single-day inflow seen in weeks. This happened after a surge in the BTC/GBP trading pair, which triggered major short liquidations. If Bitcoin faces heavy selling, it could drag Ethereum and other digital assets down as well. The buildup of long positions just under Ethereum's current price levels combined with more ETH available on exchanges points to a landscape where liquidity tests are likely.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The firm, formerly a commercial real estate lending tech platform, revealed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that it plans on using the funds for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Solana.” The offering will include common and preferred stock, debt instruments, warrants, and units. DeFi Development has already acquired approximately $48.2 million of SOL and plans to operate validators on the Solana blockchain to earn staking rewards. Taking a playbook out of Michael Saylor's bitcoin buying strategy, corporations have been increasingly buying SOL for their balance sheets to provide TradFi investors with exposure to the token. Recently, the firm announced that it had secured an up to $500 million convertible note facility to ramp up its investments in the Solana network. DeFi Development's new offering comes after a significant leadership shakeup earlier this month. The company also brought on John Han, a former Binance and Kraken executive, as CFO. DeFi Development adopted a treasury strategy centered around Solana as part of its new direction. In addition to the $1 billion shelf registration, DeFi Development also filed to register 1.24 million shares on behalf of early investors, including Pantera Capital, Payward (parent company of Kraken), and Arrington Capital. Shares of DeFi Development Corp surged more than 970% following the leadership shakeup and moved up roughly 4% in after-hours trading on Friday to now stand at $54 per share.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DeFi Development Corp is seeking to raise more capital for its Solana treasury and operational expenses. The Nasdaq-listed firm, previously a real estate financing platform connecting commercial property lenders and buyers, announced its plans in a Form S-3 registration statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 25. Joseph Onorati, former chief strategy officer at Kraken, has since been appointed as chairman and CEO. The announcement comes shortly after the leadership of DeFi Development Corp adopted a Solana treasury reserve, “by applying a proven public-market treasury model to an asset that's earlier in its lifecycle, structurally reflexive, and vastly underexposed as compared to Bitcoins.” The firm's new Solana investment treasury has drawn comparisons to Michael Saylor's Strategy, which has amassed over 538,200 Bitcoin (BTC) as of April 20 — the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Parker White, the firm's chief investment officer, who previously served as an engineering director at Kraken exchange, already runs a Solana validator with $75 million in delegated stake.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is pressuring trading partners to Buy American — American energy, defense and agricultural products, that is, and as The Wall Street Journal reports, many anxious global leaders, eager to placate the commander in chief and avoid a prolonged trade war, have voiced support for the idea. However, just as foreign leaders are saying they'll buy American goods and services, foreign investors, from Japanese pensioners to European mutual funds to state actors are Selling American — specifically American stocks, corporate debt and, worryingly, the treasury bonds America relies on to finance trillions in government spending. Ross Perot gained political fame (or infamy, depending on who you ask) in the 1990s by arguing that the flow of factory jobs from the Midwest to Mexico from NAFTA would cause a “giant sucking sound going south.” We're hearing a new sucking sound, but this time it's capital, rather than jobs, that's whooshing out of our national doors. Some fear the damage from tariffs to American business, US financial markets and even the dollar itself could be long lasting. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says Barry Eichengreen, an economist and professor at the University of Berkeley, adding “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Predictions that current policy will lead America down the road to ruin are probably overblown. But this dollar angst raises a pressing and real concern that the US could run out of buyers for its government debt as traditional investors shun treasuries along with other US assets. In a worst case scenario, China may even dump US debt intentionally to retaliate for tariffs, sending rates higher, impacting everything from car loans to mortgage payments. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to calm markets of these worries, saying, “If a foreign rival were weaponizing the US government bond market or attempting to destabilize it for political gain, I am sure that we would do something.” The good news is that a new buyer of US treasuries is emerging, made possible by the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Blockchain-based stablecoins are now the seventh largest buyer of US government debt, exceeding Germany, Australia and other big countries. Because stablecoins are fully backed 1:1 by dollar reserves, typically US government debt, they are a persistent and growing buyer of new treasury issuances. In a June 2024 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said, “Dollar-backed stablecoins are becoming an important net purchaser of US government debt.” To be sure, stablecoins are still a small piece of the enormous treasury market. For context, a $3 trillion stablecoin market would soak up more US debt than China, Japan or the UK, the three largest current owners of US government debt, combined. Stablecoins could be opening a window to its future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes says Bitcoin (BTC) will likely benefit from the ongoing trade war and a US-China decoupling. It's every major economy needs to print a bunch of money to basically cushion the effects of this attempted divorce, this decline in globalization. And so all these dollars that got earned, the trillions of dollars that got earned selling stuff to America, got recycled into Treasury bonds and stocks and Mag 7, all the big US tech stocks. So mathematically, if [US President Donald] Trump is serious about reducing the current account to zero, then foreigners have to sell stocks – period. And then the question is, okay, well, can the US government survive financially if there's a big decline in capital gains taxes because the market's not going up? Therefore, we get a printing money function and Bitcoin benefits. It finally decouples from tech because of the structural flows and what needs to happen from an affordability standpoint for the US government.” While some in the crypto space suggest the market turmoil may prompt central banks to start accumulating Bitcoin to diversify their asset holdings, Hayes believes central banks will continue to turn to gold as a hedge, not the flagship crypto asset. Bitcoin is trading for $94,832 at time of writing, up 1.2% in the last 24 hours. Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senator Cynthia Lummis' doubts about the Federal Reserve's recent decision come as many prominent crypto entrepreneurs have voiced their support. United States Senator Cynthia Lummis suggests the crypto industry may be celebrating too soon over the US Federal Reserve softening its crypto guidance for banks. “The Fed withdrawing crypto guidance is just noise, not real progress,” Lummis said in an April 25 X post. Lummis called the Fed's April 24 announcement — withdrawing its 2022 supervisory letter that had discouraged banks from engaging with crypto and stablecoin activities — “just lip service.” Lummis, a pro-crypto advocate known for introducing the Bitcoin (BTC) Strategic Reserve Bill in July 2024, pointed out several flaws in the Fed's announcement, even as Strategy founder Michael Saylor and crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano suggested it was a step forward for banks and crypto. She argued that the Fed continues to “illegally flout the law on master accounts” and still relies on reputational risk in its bank supervision practices. Lummis also highlighted the Fed's policy statement in Section 9(13), which hasn't been withdrawn, stating that Bitcoin and digital assets are considered “unsafe and unsound.” She also reiterated many of the same staff behind Operation Chokepoint 2.0 are still involved in crypto policy today. “I will continue to hold the Fed accountable until the digital asset industry gets more than a life jacket, Chair Powell — they need a fair shake,” Lummis said. Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum, said the Fed's decision “is a significant development, as it will simplify the path to institutional adoption.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cowen tells his 894,000 YouTube subscribers that, based on the social risk metric, which gauges crypto market sentiment based on the social media activity of market participants, altcoins could continue underperforming the crypto king. If it's doing poorly, interest in crypto is not that high and altcoins aren't really doing that great. And you can see that as Ethereum has collapsed, so too did the social risk. So when we talk about the social interest in crypto and it being low, what it means is that altcoins will likely keep bleeding to Bitcoin.” “Despite what people say, they truly want altcoin season. We are getting pain in the markets right now. We have seen a lot of pain in the markets. I don't know how long the pain is going to last, but it's this type of pain in the markets that you see persist over a long time that then leads to changes in monetary policy.” Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Crypto is all memes and moonshots until you look at how much power it uses up. Crypto coins are a type of digital currency that gained popularity for their nontraditional structure and as investments. However, to get onto the blockchain, a "mining" process must occur, which is what gives crypto its bad energy rap. Each mining transaction drains a massive amount of electrical power from the grid. The energy impact is "astronomical" and has increased power bills in some areas by more than 30%, Suffolk University Law School professor Steven Ferrey wrote in a recent paper, per The Regulatory Review. Aside from making regular utilities more expensive, the power supply for cryptocurrency also comes largely from polluting sources — although some coins are greener than others. Ferrey argues that there is a real structural issue here. His reasoning could fill a textbook, but the basics are that there is not enough clean energy available to handle crypto mining, in part because many regions have shot down clean electricity projects. As a result, the field's environmental impact continues to run unchecked. Advocates for greener cryptocurrency, from experts like Professor Ferrey to groups like Earthjustice, Sierra Club, and the Crypto Climate Accord, all agree: Better interventions in currency mining and energy use is the best path toward a future that is safe and healthy for all. 💡These best-sellers from Quince deliver affordable, sustainable luxury for all Do you think our power grid needs to be upgraded? He encouraged officials to build more regulations and policies that could protect consumers from rate hikes and even leverage clean energy tax credits to move crypto miners away from polluting energy, The Regulatory Review explained. Crypto companies can also get the benefits of clean energy directly. One study found that using solar energy for Bitcoin mining lowered developers' operating costs, and another found that they could save millions of dollars by making green investments,according to The Regulatory Review.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Panelists at the SEC roundtable urged a shift from outdated “physical possession” custody rules toward flexible, principles-based standards that are a better fit for blockchain technology. “Innovation has been stifled for the last several years due to market and regulatory uncertainty that unfortunately the SEC has fostered,” said Atkins, who previously served two terms under former President George W. Bush. Market participants “deserve clear regulatory rules of the road,” Atkins said, adding that he will work to establish a “rational fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets.” Atkins said SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce will be leading efforts to create this framework. “As entrepreneurs across the United States are harnessing blockchain technology to modernize aspects of the financial system, I expect huge benefits from this market innovation in terms of efficiency, cost reduction, transparency and risk mitigation.” The SEC roundtable centered on one of the thorniest regulatory challenges: how broker-dealers and investment firms can safely hold custody of digital assets in compliance with federal securities laws. Seamus Rocca, CEO of bitcoin-enabled Xapo Bank, told PYMNTS that the SEC's renewed focus on crypto customer is a “welcome step.” Crypto custody is fundamentally different from traditional finance and needs “purpose-built infrastructure, not a retrofitted playbook. While crypto exchanges may seek to provide bank-like services, it's vital to ensure that consumers are aware of the stark difference in compliance and oversight,” he added. “In crypto, we've created a technological infrastructure where you don't need intermediaries and you don't need counterparties,” said Larry Florio, general counsel of 1kx, a crypto fund manager. Levitin said the traditional understanding of a custodian is someone who's going to physically hold your assets. “They're going to have a vault or something, and we're going to make sure that the door is a sufficient number of inches thick, and then it's fireproof for 24 hours,” he said. “That's a really different set of skills than are required to secure crypto.” Several panelists advocated for a principles-based approach to custody regulation rather than focusing on the technology since it's hard for rules to keep up with digital advances. A recurring theme was the need for regulatory flexibility to accommodate rapid technological change. If custody rules are too prescriptive, several panelists warned, they risk becoming obsolete as technology evolves. “What was probably most shameful about the last four years was that we received approvals in multiple foreign jurisdictions, and we were essentially hamstrung in our hometown,” said Baylor Myers, vice president of corporate development at BitGo. He said that foreign regulators were clearer about their rules, which helped crypto firms a lot. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
