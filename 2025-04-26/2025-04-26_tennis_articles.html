But standing in his way is world number one Jannik Sinner, who is set to make his comeback at the Rome Masters ahead of the French Open, following a doping scandal that kept him out of action for three months. Not to be overlooked is the legendary Novak Djokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam champion and Serbia's pride, who will undoubtedly be a force to be reckoned with at Roland Garros. Ruud, at just 26 years old, has amassed an impressive 120 wins at Roland Garros, making him a formidable contender for the championship. With two runner-up finishes in 2022 and 2023, including losses to Rafael Nadal and Djokovic, Ruud has proven himself as a consistent performer on the clay courts. Following closely behind him is Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, with 94 wins to his name. As the tennis world braces for the upcoming French Open, all eyes will be on these top players vying for supremacy on one of the sport's most prestigious stages. Stay tuned for what promises to be a thrilling and unpredictable tournament filled with passion, drama, and unforgettable moments on the red dirt of Roland Garros.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The PTPA asked for several changes to the sport, perhaps none more significant than a greater distribution of prize money. One of the ATP Tour's most outspoken stars has now been asked just how far he and others would be willing to go to make change happen. Appearing as a guest on the Changeover podcast, Frances Tiafoe was asked whether he'd join his fellow ATP stars in a hypothetical boycott of the US Open in a bid for changes such as an increase in prize money. “I ain't playing, like, we all need money. “Next day, you see everybody tying their shoes, over there doing bands and all that. Tiafoe believes it will be tricky to make change happen until players get on the ‘same page'. “But until we get real unity, and everyone's really on the same page, for me personally, it doesn't really move the needle.” It would likely be hard for Tiafoe to agree not to take part at Flushing Meadows, considering his previous successes at the US Open. Some have, however, expressed concerns over his level at the event compared to others, as Jon Wertheim questioned whether Tiafoe puts ‘too much emphasis' on the US Open, in a discussion with Andy Roddick last year. The American is yet to truly get going in 2025, potentially proving Wertheim correct. Approaching the end of April, Tiafoe has accumulated just 500 points on the ATP Tour, fewer than 46 other players in men's tennis. Tiafoe has had real issue stringing wins together this year, often winning just a singular match at a tournament before falling to defeat. He enjoyed his best week this year in Houston, when Tiafoe lost to Jenson Brooksby in the final of the US Men's Clay Court Championships. Tiafoe will hope to enjoy another strong showing on the clay at this week's Madrid Open tournament.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic has given himself a brutal reality check after crashing out of the Madrid Open. The Serb is now on a three-match losing streak, suffering back-to-back opening-round exits in Monte-Carlo and Madrid. Djokovic's expectations were low coming into the Madrid Open. 5 had not played the tournament in three years, and this was just his second appearance since 2019. “Kind of new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis. “So it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kind of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments. Just in    Serena Williams and Simone Biles spark huge excitement by teasing partnership This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Obviously Grand Slams, I was saying many times, are the most important tournaments for me. Djokovic is running out of time to get some clay wins under his belt before the French Open. He is entered into the Masters 1000 in Rome, which begins on May 7. There are also some smaller ATP events held in the week before Roland Garros, and he could take a late wildcard as he did last year in Geneva. But the Serb has come to accept that he won't be a huge title contender at the French, and it's something he hopes will work in his favour. Grand Slam, I'm not going into Roland Garros as one of the main favorites. Maybe that can help, I don't know, we'll see,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vale, who secured their automatic promotion to League One, scored twice in quick succession although the second goal in particular was draped in controversy as referee Declan Bourne failed to stop the game for a head injury to Wimbledon defender Riley Harbottle. "Harbottle gets a head injury and the referee plays on for 20 seconds and Vale go on to score," said Jackson's right hand man - Terry Skiverton. “Harbottle was then down for five and a half minutes and then had to go off for the same injury. Terry Skiverton was disappointed with the referee not stopping play for Harbottle's head injury (Image: Kirk Pritchard) “Seven minutes later, one of their players goes down with a head injury whilst we're on the attack and guess what the referee does? He blows up for a head injury – we are really disappointed with that." Despite feeling hard done by, Skiverton admitted that Port Vale deserved to be promoted today. He said: “They're a really good side with experienced players and they got promoted today through being professional, slowing the game down, not allowing us to gain momentum and they've got the likes of Ronan Curtis to come on and see the game out “It's disappointing from our point of view but it's a good lesson and it's good to see a team get promoted against you because now we know what we have to do. “That support base turned up in numbers today and got behind us but we need to give them more in attacking threat – we didn't give them enough today and we're aware of that." “The fans are still 100 per cent behind us – we could feel that." Skiverton claimed that the red card shown to Jackson "doesn't change anything" ahead of the Dons' trip to Grimsby next Saturday (May 3). “The big thing we've got to take away from today is putting more emphasis on the opposing goal – we need to create more chances and be a bit braver in our attacks."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Russian began his year with a shock defeat at the Australian Open, when Rublev lost to Joao Fonseca in three sets. He failed to impress at his next two tournaments in Montpellier and Rotterdam, before Rublev won the Qatar Open, seemingly out of nowhere. Since then, Rublev has won just two matches on the ATP Tour and looks set to drop out of the world's top ten. Remarkably, the sickness allowed Rublev to find an extra gear, which helped him secure victory. “That sickness somehow gave me disconnection from all my personality. So I was not thinking about anything related to my life,” he said. “With that thought, somehow my head was completely clear, and feeling the worst physically, I was playing some of my best tennis.” His best tennis saw him take down the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz on his way to the final. Rublev then beat Felix Auger-Aliassime to lift a Masters 1000 title for the second time in his career, having won in Monte-Carlo one year earlier. His route to the final is tough, however, and he could face a tricky test against in-form Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals. The Russian did, however, win their most recent encounter on clay, securing his place in the 2023 Bastad semi-finals with a comfortable straight sets win. Only time will tell if Rublev can defy the odds and defend his Madrid Open title, but it certainly looks like he'll be up against it. Rublev will make his first appearance at this year's tournament on Sunday, April 27, when he takes on Alexander Bublik for a place in the fourth round.</p>

Holger Rune withdrew with what looked like a thigh injury after the first set against Flavio Cobolli in the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Madrid.

The eighth-seeded Dane withdrew with a muscle injury in his thigh after losing the first set 2-6 to Italian Flavio Cobolli in the second round of the clay tournament.

This marks Rune's third retirement of the year, following Acapulco and Monte-Carlo. 

It otherwise started off promisingly for Rune, who arrived in the Spanish capital on the back of having won the ATP 500 tournament in Barcelona last week.

Trailing 2-3, Rune took a medical timeout, and chose to continue after the treatment. 

But Rune seemed physically inhibited and quickly showed signs of resignation on court.

The Italian won four successive games, after which Rune chose to withdraw. The 22-year-old Italian will play American Brandon Nakashima, the No 31 seed, next.</p>

The American took to the courts for the first time in weeks, hoping to remain symptom-free as she prepares for the second Slam of the year.ByLiya DavidovPublished Apr 26, 2025 copy_link

Two-time Grand Slam champion Taylor Townsend came clean on social media about missing out on the beginning of the clay-court season.Since reaching the doubles semifinals at the Miami Open, the second-ranked doubles player has pulled out of tournaments, all the way through next week's Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome.“I'm sure you guys have been wondering where I've been, why I've been withdrawing from tournaments,” the American said on Instagram. “In Miami, I fell and ended up getting a mild concussion in my quarterfinal doubles match and had two days off, played my semifinal match on Friday, and ended up getting a lot worse, so it's my first time back out on court in almost a month.”

Tests later confirmed she suffered a concussion, an injury Townsend only recently began recovering from.“I was hoping to be ready for Madrid but ended up doing some workouts and some tests and all of my symptoms came back, so these last three or four days have been the first time that I have had no headaches,” she said, “which is really great and I'm happy to be back on court.“I really wanted to give myself a chance to heal. I was really scared about my head and that's not something I want to play with, so I'm just giving myself an opportunity to really heal.”Read More: **Jessica Pegula and her dogs have been a winning pair**

Cautiously optimistic about her recovery, Townsend assures the tennis world that she plans on competing in the clay season—more specifically, the most prestigious clay-court tournament on the calendar.“I will be ready front and center at Roland Garros,” she said. “So, you guys, stay tuned for my comeback, I love you all.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner has not played since winning the Australian Open at the start of the season and accepted a ban in February following a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had challenged a tribunal's decision to clear him after two positive tests. The 23-year-old was allowed to return to training on April 13th, and his suspension will end on May 4th, before his competitive return at the Italian Open, which gets underway three days later. Sinner, who spent time building fitness mindful of the French Open starting on May 25th, was assured of retaining the top ranking for his home tournament after his closest challenger, Alexander Zverev, crashed to an early defeat in Monte Carlo. Hopefully, we'll get some momentum going again ahead of the clay season. It certainly won't be easy for me," Sinner told broadcaster ORF Sudtirol. "The first games will be really difficult. But hopefully I'll be able to get back into the rhythm and then we'll see how it goes." Sinner, who trained with Britain's world number six Jack Draper at the Tennis Club de Beaulieu in France recently, said there were plenty of positives from his enforced absence from the tour. "A bit of time away from all the grind, I spent time with family, with friends. "I think it helped me a lot."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic was as unequivocal as an athlete could be earlier this month, when he was asked what his goals were for the ongoing clay-court season. “Roland Garros,” he answered, referring to the French Open, in late May and early June, after losing his opening match in Monte Carlo, Monaco, to Alejandro Tabilo. The Spanish capital sits more than 2,000 feet above sea level, which allows the ball to fly and bounce during tennis matches in ways it won't in Paris. Then at night, it can get quite cold. Add that all up and few players would argue that Madrid provides much in the way of preparation for doing battle in the French capital a month later. There's a reason Rafael Nadal, the greatest male clay-court player, won Madrid “just” five times — and one of those came when it was a hard-court event. His presence is part of the peculiar riddle that Djokovic, who turns 38 on May 22, has been trying to solve for going on two years now. What is the best way to try to win a 25th Grand Slam title at an age when players don't win Grand Slam titles anymore? The answer mostly lies in finding the right balance between rest and match fitness, but at this moment, Djokovic is returning to a tournament he hasn't played since 2022 because he has to pay attention to something that he swore more than a year ago would never concern him again: the ATP rankings. 1 for a record eighth time in 2023, points and places ceased to matter to the greatest player of the modern era. Now they matter once more, because they hold one of the keys to his only clay-court season goal. 5, with 4,130 points, within shouting distance of Taylor Fritz at No. The Madrid Open is an ATP Masters 1,000 event, so named for the number of ranking points it awards to its eventual champion. Every match he wins adds to his points total. He will have earned 10 points as soon as he hits a ball in his first match Saturday, since he was given a bye in the opening round and gets the money and the points for having won at that initial stage. That makes Djokovic's deficit more like 205 because the American will only improve his tally if he gets to the final, and if he is eliminated before the semifinals, he will lose points. That looks more likely than not, largely because Fritz has been carrying an abdominal strain since the Australian Open in January. In Miami last month, where he lost in the semifinals to Jakub Menšík, he said he couldn't try to block back his opponent's powerful serve because he thought it would put too much of a strain on his sore muscle. Having beaten Christopher O'Connell 6-1, 6-4 in his first match Friday (the second round), he will play Benjamin Bonzi in the third Sunday. Fritz has made a clay-court final before, but the red dirt is his worst surface. Still, why should the greatest player of the modern era care whether he is ranked fourth or fifth in the world today, or whether he is ahead or behind a player he is a perfect 10 for 10 against in their head-to-head meetings? If Djokovic can overtake Fritz before Paris and enter the tournament as the fourth seed, he can ensure he will not face Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz before the semifinals. There's even a scenario where he might not have to face either of them until the final: Last weekend, Alcaraz lost to Holger Rune in the Barcelona Open final, just after Alexander Zverev won the Munich Open against Ben Shelton. Additionally, Alcaraz is now dropping his Madrid points from last year — 200 of them — because he has withdrawn due to a muscle injury. Djokovic could end up there regardless of his seeding in that scenario. 4, he has the guarantee of playing a minimum five matches before he faces one of his sternest tests, which at least offers a window of opportunity to try to tap back into his once-peerless ability to play himself into peak form at a major. At this year's Australian Open, Djokovic faced Alcaraz in the last eight. While he prevailed in four sets, having managed to scramble his opponent's brain when all Alcaraz needed to do was keep doing what he had been doing, Djokovic had to retire from his semifinal against Zverev three days later after losing an attritional first set in a tiebreak. Playing Alcaraz and Sinner takes more out of Djokovic — and just about anybody else — than playing anyone else does. In his case, it's best to face them as late as possible in a tournament, if he has to at all. Djokovic is living through a common misconception about what happens to elite athletes declining from their peaks. Those apexes stay sharp and accessible in fleeting moments, even when they need them most: he found his on his otherworldly run to the gold medal at last year's Olympics in Paris. Djokovic's clay season didn't go well last year. Then he took the next three weeks off, with the idea of minimizing the mileage in his legs during a year when his top goal was winning Olympic gold. He won his opening match (in the second round) at a canter, but while signing autographs, a metal water bottle accidentally fell from a spectator's rucksack and struck him hard on the head. Djokovic played his third-round match, but looked understandably off-kilter and lost to Tabilo. Then he scrambled to gain entry into the Geneva Open, a move that betrayed something like panic, since he never plays a tournament the week before a Grand Slam. Then came the French Open, where he played himself in just like the Djokovic of old before getting past Lorenzo Musetti in a five-set third-round epic that finished after three in the morning local time. That understandably took something out of him, and he tore the medial meniscus in his right knee during his next match, an improbable win over Francisco Cerundolo. Instead of playing his quarterfinal against Casper Ruud, he withdrew and had surgery. Returning weeks later, he made the final at Wimbledon before winning that Olympic gold medal he craved above all else. Still, he did not win another title and the season overall was a staccato, up-and-down affair, as his schedule has been for a few years while still delivering elite results. Although he only really cares about winning at least one more Grand Slam and beating Margaret Court's 24-title record, which he currently shares, Djokovic appears to have decided that being a part-time tennis player doesn't work either for his body or his brain. Playing more often may take a toll on his ageing frame, but he has to do it to try to become sharp on the clay and get his legs ready for the test of five-set tennis that awaits him at the French Open. More matches might mean there will be more nights he plays like a shadow of his best self, as he did in Monte Carlo against Tabilo. “It was horrible,” he said of that straight-sets defeat two weeks ago. These days, that is the price he has to pay for proper preparation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis fans might be shocked to learn who has been the game's most successful male player on clay in the past five years. Novak Djokovic is also expected to challenge strongly in France as he bids for a record-breaking 25th Slam title. However, neither Djokovic nor Alcaraz top the list for most matches won on clay since the start of 2020. Instead, that honour goes to Casper Ruud, who lost in the final at Roland Garros to Nadal in 2022 and Djokovic a year later. You can check out at any time. Stefanos Tsitsipas, another player still searching for a first Slam win, is second on the list with 94. However, it is also worth noting that the 21-year-old only made his ATP Tour debut in 2020, and it wasn't until the following year that he emerged as a player capable of challenging the elite.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz has opened up on the extreme measures Wimbledon organisers take to maintain the competition's reputation as the most prestigious in tennis. But Alcaraz's triumphs in SW19 were almost halted by a seemingly peculiar rule by the powers above. The Spaniard explained that his coloured underwear almost landed him a suspension at Wimbledon, as they were deemed to be in violation of the tournament's all-white kit policy. Alcaraz explained that the briefs were visible through his shorts, and that organisers told him he would not be allowed to play if he repeated the offence. 'You can't step onto the court unless you're dressed in all white. 'I was wearing colour briefs and you could see them through my shorts, and they called me out on them, saying, "Next time, we won't let you play." 'I mean, this really goes to show you just how strict they can be!' Victory at Wimbledon this year would secure Alcaraz a third title in a row. However, this achievement would still be a far cry from the record for the most consecutive titles on the hallowed grass courts. Both Roger Federer (2003 to 2007) and Bjorn Borg (1976 to 1980) won five successive crowns at Wimbledon, meaning the Spanish superstar still has a ways to go yet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic makes his 2025 Madrid debut against tough Italian Matteo Arnaldi during second-round action on Saturday. Stefanos Tsitsipas, who retired in Barcelona, takes on struggling veteran Jan-Lennard Struff. 5 hasn't won an ATP title since 2023, although he did win the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last year. He got close in Miami, but he lost in two tiebreakers to the young Czech Jakub Mensik. Djokovic has not won a match on clay yet this season, with a shock opening loss to Alejandro Tabilo in Monte-Carlo two weeks ago. He was miserably out of sorts; Tabilo is ranked No. Fortunately for Djokovic, Matteo Arnaldi is also off the boil. Arnaldi would ordinarily be dangerous for Djokovic, especially because he has already played a match. But in this case Djokovic will be motivated to get more play in before Roland Garros. It's likely to be patchy at times, but look for the first meeting between Djokovic and Arnaldi to go the favorite's way. April has not been kind to Stefanos Tsitsipas. Of more concern, the Greek withdrew from his quarterfinal match against Arthur Fils last week in Barcelona, with some speculation that Tsitsipas had injured his back. The 17th seed got a first-round bye in Madrid, so his injury hasn't been tested yet. Jan-Lennard Struff has been a tricky matchup for Tsitsipas. Struff is a good clay-court player, so the surface won't give Tsitsipas much of an advantage. The bad news for Struff is that he has had a miserable season. Struff's last completed match win came way back in February in Marseille, so there is no indication that Struff has enough in the tank right now to dispatch a player of Tsitsipas' caliber. HOWEVER, it was only a week ago when he had to retire with a back injury. We've seen so many walkovers this tournament daily so it wouldn't suprise me if we saw Stef retire. Struff looking marginally better than he has been vs Botic, slightly less errors. He's got some points to defend here so I do think he will pose a challenge + leads clay H2H. He could just walk over Arnaldi, or Arnaldi could raise his level as many do vs Djoko and make it a close battle. Struff in 3 (with a clause being if Tsitsi isn't fully fit) You REALLY need to wonder about Novak. Even Murray magic seems to be not enough. Your email address will not be published.
