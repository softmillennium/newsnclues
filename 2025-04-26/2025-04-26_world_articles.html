                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A trio of Democratic senators on Thursday demanded answers from embattled Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth regarding U.S. airstrikes in Yemen, which have reportedly killed scores of civilians including numerous women and children since last month. “We write to you concerning reports that U.S. strikes against the Houthis at the Ras Isa fuel terminal in Yemen last week killed dozens of civilians, potentially more than 70,” Sens. “If these reports of civilian casualties are accurate, they should come as no surprise,” the senators said. “Using explosive weapons in populated areas—as these intense strikes appear to do—always carries a high risk of civilian harm.” Getting rid of safeguards designed to limit civilian harm from U.S. military operations & ensure compliance with international humanitarian law undermines our credibility,  jeopardizes our missions & raises the risk of natl security threats. Last month, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon's Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Office and Civilian Protection Center of Excellence, which was established during the Biden administration, would be closed. Hegseth — who has supported pardons for convicted U.S. war criminals — lamented during his Senate confirmation hearing that “restrictive rules of engagement” have “made it more difficult to defeat our enemies,” who “should get bullets, not attorneys,” according to his 2024 book The War on Warriors. Asked during his confirmation hearing whether troops under his leadership would adhere to the Geneva Conventions, Hegseth replied, “What we are not going to do is put international conventions above Americans.” Overall, upward of 400,000 civilians in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen have died as a direct result of the U.S.-led War on Terror, according to the Costs of War Project at Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. Overall, hundreds of thousands of Yemenis have died during the civil war that began in 2014, with international experts attributing more than 150,000 Yemeni deaths to U.S.-backed, Saudi-led bombing and blockade. “President Trump has called himself a ‘peacemaker,' but that claim rings hollow when U.S. military operations kill scores of civilians,” the senators stressed in their letter. “The reported high civilian casualty numbers from U.S. strikes in Yemen demonstrate a serious disregard for civilian life, and call into question this administration's ability to conduct military operations in accordance with U.S. best practices for civilian harm mitigation and international law.” We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president leaves event with first lady just one hour after pontiff's burial Donald Trump departed Rome shortly after the Pope's funeral to treat the first lady Melania to a romantic dinner on Air Force One for her 55th birthday. The US president said he had been too busy to buy his wife a present and would instead treat her to a meal onboard the presidential plane when they return from Rome on Saturday. Mr Trump left his wife as he attended to high-stakes Ukraine diplomacy, meeting with European allies and Volodymyr Zelensky in an extraordinary day of peace talks. The president added that as he prepares to mark the 100th day of a frenetic opening to his second term, seeking deals on tariffs, Ukraine, Iran and Gaza, there hadn't been time to shop for his wife. “I haven't had time to buy presents, it's been pretty busy,” he said. The Trumps have led largely separate lives since he took office, with Melania spending most of her time in New York, where their son Barron, 19, is attending university. But they have made a few joint appearances, including on Monday when they hosted the traditional Easter Egg Roll at the White House. Last year the couple spent her birthday apart, with Melania in Florida while Mr Trump was in New York for a trial over payments of hush money to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels. Mr Trump said at the time: “It'd be nice to be with her, but I'm at a courthouse for a rigged trial.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Another girl fears she won't get to see her Uncle Bobby as much after he gets married, but after spending a day with him and his fiancé, she realizes she's just gaining a new member of her family. They touch on universal topics like bravery, friendship and family. But since the books feature LGBTQ protagonists — the prince falls in love with his knight, Violet's classmate is a girl, Uncle Bobby is gay — they're now at the center of Mahmoud v. Taylor, a Supreme Court case brought by parents who say that the books' inclusion in public schools violates their parental rights and religious freedom. Though accounts differ on its exact origins, the parental rights movement can be traced back at least to 1925, when a biology teacher came under fire for teaching evolution in violation of Tennessee law. Other experts point to when parents used their own rights as a pretext to fight against the prohibition of child labor in the 1920s. (This same argument is cropping up again in 2025 as Florida Republicans push to weaken child labor laws.) What you will notice is that none of these instances has to do with actual civil rights — they're all about enacting a particular right-wing vision for the country. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced learning online in 2020, a new wave of parents began rallying under the banner of parental rights, fighting against school closures and vaccine mandates. Moms for Liberty, formed in 2021, is one of the leading instigators, muscling its far right members onto school boards and ballots. While these groups decry government intervention on the level of public health, they simultaneously advocate for increased state control over education — banning books, cracking down on inclusive teachers and lesson plans, and pushing to undo diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Because, of course, Moms for Liberty and its allies are not fighting for the rights of parents who wish to support their children's access to gender-affirming care. Nor are they supporting parents who help their children obtain abortions. And the parental rights movement makes no mention of the rights of parents whose children are forcibly taken away from them by the state, in a family policing system that disproportionately targets low-income families and Black mothers. A prime example of the movement's impact is Florida's 2022 “Don't Say Gay” law, which was officially titled the Parental Rights in Education Act. The law restricted teachers from referencing sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools, but its parameters were so sweeping and vague they were partially rolled back through a 2024 settlement. As a Vox headline noted last week, Mahmoud v. Taylor now “threatens to bring ‘Don't Say Gay' to every classroom in America.” The case stems from a lawsuit filed in 2023 against the Montgomery County Public Schools district in Maryland. Rather, the texts were made available for students' own reading, classroom read-alouds and other educational activities. Why, conservative justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh asked, could the school district not just reinstate its opt-out policy? But that framing downplays what's actually at stake in Mahmoud v. Taylor. As Nelson Tebbe, a law professor at Cornell Law School, told TIME, “The long standing settlement is that religious parents don't have a right to opt out of elements of the public school curriculum that they disagree with.” If that were the case, parents could opt their children out of learning about evolution, which courts typically haven't supported. “Mere exposure to ideas is not itself considered a burden on religion under these precedents,” said Tebbe. As such, sex education is currently the only area of instruction that students can be entirely exempted from in Montgomery schools. There is no shortage of religious institutions to choose from. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Five people have been killed and more than 700 injured in a huge explosion at the port of Bandar Abbas in southwestern Iran, according to official Iranian media. The explosion sent a huge plume of thick, gray smoke from the Shahid Rajaee part of the port complex, according to videos geolocated by CNN, with the government saying the blast was likely linked to chemicals being stored. A spokesperson for the emergency services earlier said 516 had been injured. Debris was spread over a wide area and many buildings at the port complex were badly damaged, according to state media. Windows within a radius of several kilometers were shattered, they said. Some reports said people were trapped in the wreckage of a building that was reduced to rubble. The region's governor, Mohammad Ashouri Taziani, said injured people were being transferred to Bandar Abbas medical centers and the fire had been contained. The port has been closed and maritime operations suspended, according to state media. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered an investigation into the causes of the incident. A government spokeswoman, Fatemeh Mohajerani, said it would take some time to establish the cause of the explosion – “but so far what has been determined is that containers were stored in a corner of the port that likely contained chemicals which exploded. Shahid Rajaee is a large facility for container shipments, covering 2,400 hectares (around 5,900 acres). It handles 70 million tons of cargo annually, including oil and general shipping. It has nearly 500,000 square meters (5.4 million square feet) of warehouses and 35 shipping berths. CNN's Kareem El Damanhoury and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be among the first to get it. Russian forces have fully recaptured the territory of Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region partially held by Ukraine since last August, the Kremlin claimed on April 26 in a statement later disputed by Kyiv. Ukraine has denied the claim, saying that Russia's statements "do not correspond to reality." "Ukrainian defensive operations in certain areas of Kursk Oblast continue," Ukraine's General Staff said, adding that Kyiv's forces repelled five Russian ground assaults in the area on April 26, with another clash currently ongoing. "The situation is difficult, but our units continue to hold certain positions and carry out tasks as assigned," the statement read, noting that there is no threat of encirclement. A military source also told the Kyiv Independent that Kyiv continues to hold territories in Kursk Oblast. Kyiv and Seoul have previously said that North Korea has dispatched around 11,000 troops to Kursk Oblast, though Moscow has not openly confirmed this until now. Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha. As of April 25, Ukrainian battlefield monitoring service DeepState showed Ukrainian forces holding onto limited positions in Kursk Oblast near the border, namely the villages of Oleshnya and Gomal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a brief one-on-one discussion inside St. Peter's Basilica on April 26 before convening with other leaders to attend Pope Francis's funeral. Pictures showing Trump and Zelenskyy seated in a corner as if they just pulled up a couple of chairs, hunched over deep in discussion, were shared across social media. This was the first face-to-face encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy since their heated meeting in the Oval Office in February that ended with Zelenskyy being asked to leave. Many of those who shared it commented on the significance of their meeting place, including Trump's National Security Advisor, Michael Waltz, who said, “Nothing like some tough diplomacy in one of the most beautiful places in the world.” “President Trump and President Zelenskyy met privately today and had a very productive discussion,” Steven Cheung, White House communications director, told reporters. Zelenskyy thanked Trump and said it was a good meeting. This meeting came less than 24 hours after Trump announced he had “a good day in talks and meetings” with Ukraine and Russia. “They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off.' In a follow-up post to his social media platform, Trump reiterated his stance that President Barack Obama was responsible for allowing Crimea to fall into Russian hands, and that the ongoing conflict belongs to President Joe Biden. However, he expressed doubt that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not want peace after all and could face more U.S. sanctions for the war to end.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tensions between nuclear-armed countries escalate after attack killed 26 people in disputed territory Indian and Pakistani troops have exchanged gunfire across the volatile frontier in Kashmir for a second day, amid growing tensions after a brazen attack that killed 26 people at a popular tourist resort. India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which is divided between them but claimed fully by both. India's military said Pakistani soldiers opened fire from “multiple posts” along the heavily militarised ceasefire line, and Indian forces “responded appropriately” to what it called “unprovoked” firing. The clashes followed the attack last Tuesday, when gunmen opened fire in a meadow near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. Violence had been steadily abating in Kashmir, and the attack struck a heavy blow to the region's recovering tourism industry. An obscure group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility. “Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent and credible investigation,” Sharif said, while warning Pakistan's forces stood ready to repel “any misadventure” by India. In tit-for-tat moves, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact, expelled Pakistani diplomats and cancelled Pakistani visas. Islamabad retaliated by expelling Indian diplomats, cancelling Indians' visas and closing its airspace. It also suspended the 1972 Shimla accord, a key framework for dialogue. Pakistan has warned any attempt to block water would be an “act of war”, with the Pakistan People's party chief, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, declaring: “Either our water will flow through it, or their blood.” Experts say disrupting the flow would require big investment and years of work.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Environmental groups are decrying an executive order signed by Donald Trump to expedite deep-sea mining for minerals, saying it could irreparably harm marine ecosystems and ignores an ongoing process to adopt international rules for the practice. Trump's Thursday order directed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to fast-track permits for companies to mine the ocean floor in both US and international waters. More than 30 countries, as well as fisheries trade groups, environmentalists and some auto and tech companies, have called for a moratorium on seabed mining. “Scientists agree that deep-sea mining is a deeply dangerous endeavor for our ocean and all of us who depend on it,” said Jeff Watters, vice-president for external affairs at the Ocean Conservancy. Such concerns prompted most countries in the 1990s to join a United Nations-affiliated International Seabed Authority to govern seabed mining in international waters. Watters warned that ignoring those efforts “is opening a door for other countries to do the same” before safeguards are adopted. The ramifications could resonate beyond deep-sea mining, affecting agreements on fishing, shipping, navigation and marine research, warned Duncan Currie, legal adviser for the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition. The world also must ask if it can afford to not mine deep-sea minerals that could help develop low-carbon technologies to fight climate change and whether the impacts can be managed, said Assheton Stewart Carter, chief executive of the global consulting firm TDi Sustainability. “We face tough choices and the prospect of uncomfortable trade-offs if we are to face and find solutions to serious climate change problems,” he said. But Katie Matthews, chief scientist at the advocacy group Oceana, said Trump's order to expedite the process now “is a clear case of putting mining companies' greed over common sense … Any attempt to accelerate deep-sea mining without proper safeguards will only speed up the destruction of our oceans.”</p>

Analysis: Pope Francis and his legacy: How he likened (inclusive) capitalism to good Catholicism Francis died at age 88 on the morning of Easter Monday after a stroke and subsequent heart failure. His final public appearance came the day before, when he celebrated Easter mass from the loggia of the basilica even though he was plainly weak and able to say only a few words. U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are among the world leaders in attendance at the funeral of Pope Francis.Fabrizio Troccoli/The Globe and Mail The heads of state or government at the funeral included Donald Trump of the United States, Emmanuel Macron of France, Javier Milei from Francis's native Argentina, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Britain's Keir Starmer, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and former U.S. President Joe Biden. Canada was represented by Governor-General Mary Simon and her contingent. Ms. Simon met Francis several times during his tour of Canada in 2022, when he apologized to the Indigenous peoples for the residential school tragedies. “Reconciliation is continuing and will continue and hopefully we will carry on Pope Francis's legacy of bringing people together and talking about the dark history of different countries – for us it's Canada –and the relationship with Indigenous peoples,” she said. The gathering of leaders was awkward in the sense that some of the leaders, including Ms. Meloni, Mr. Trump and Mr. Milei were at philosophical odds with Francis's empathy and support for migrants and asylum seekers. An ancient process shrouded in mystery and white smoke Ms. Meloni, who was elected prime minister in 2022 partly on an anti-migrant platform, once said Italy should “repatriate migrants back to their countries and then sink the boats that rescued them.” Francis was highly critical of Mr. Trump's anti-migrant stance. Francis, who was warm and open to divorced and gay Catholics – “Who am I to judge?” he said in one of his most famous remarks – believed the Church “is a home for all,” Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who led the funeral, said in his homily. Francis was guided by his conviction that the Church “is capable of bending down to every person, regardless of their beliefs or condition, and healing their wounds,” the Cardinal said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky greets fellow world leaders following the funeral mass.Fabrizio Troccoli/The Globe and Mail Mr. Zelensky, who was dressed in dark military clothes, received a round of applause as he left the basilica, where he paid his respects in front of Francis's coffin just ahead of the funeral ceremony. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out,” he wrote. One group of disabled pilgrims had travelled to Rome with the Kairos Forum, a British consultancy that helps the disabled, and were to meet Francis on Tuesday. “Under Francis, this was a church were everyone belonged,” said Zachariah Duke, the senior lecturer in theology of Australian Catholic University who was co-ordinating the Kairos visit. Jessica Dal Ri, 29, who works in tourism and marketing, travelled from Italy's far north to attend the funeral with her father. “For the young generation, he was our pope,” she said. “He knew how to connect to the young in a way Benedict did not.” She was referring the Francis's predecessor, the German-born Pope Benedict XVI, a religious scholar who often seemed aloof and distant. Invited to his funeral mass were delegations from Mediterranea Saving Humans, an Italian charity that protects refugees who cross the Mediterranean, and Refugees in Libya, a charity that campaigns on behalf of migrants and refugees held in detention camps. rest inside the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. rest inside the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. rest inside the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.

MOSCOW, April 26. /TASS/. Britain may resort to provocations against Russia on the territory of any state, Director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Sergey Naryshkin told TASS, responding to a question about London's potential subversive acts with the use of chemical weapons on Ukraine's soil.

"Britain may resort to provocations on the territory of any state, if Britain is interested in that. And we actually see that British special services pursue quite actively such a rude line, primarily in relation to the Russian Federation," the SVR chief said.

Russian Ambassador to the UK Andrey Kelin said earlier in an interview with TASS that the latest publications in Western newspapers indicated that Great Britain was conducting undeclared hostile actions against Russia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian space satellite that U.S. officials tie to its nuclear anti-satellite weapon program seems to be spinning uncontrollably and may no longer be functioning, Reuters reported on April 25, citing U.S. experts. The Cosmos 2553 satellite, which Russia denies is a part of its space weapon efforts, was launched by Russia weeks before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Last year, the satellite had prompted U.S. allegations that for years, Russia has been developing a space nuclear weapon that could destroy hundreds of satellites in low orbit with a blast, such as SpaceX's network of Starlink internet system used by Ukrainian troops. Over the past year, the Cosmos 2553 satellite had episodes of errant spinning, Reuters reported, citing Doppler radar data from space-tracking firm LeoLabs and optical data from Slingshot Aerospace. In December 2024, LeoLabs suggested with "high confidence" that the satellite was tumbling based on additional radar data and imagery of the satellite taken by another space company, the news agency says. "This observation strongly suggests the satellite is no longer operational," the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, said of LeoLabs' analysis in its annual Space Threat Assessment, published on April 25. U.S. Space Command, which tracks objects in space and has condemned Russian military satellites in the past, said it was aware of a change in Cosmos 2553's altitude, accordig to Reuters. However, according to the latest observations of Slingshot, whose global telescope network has been tracking the spacecraft since its launch in 2022, Cosmos 2553 appears to have stabilized, the article says. Russian officials have claimed that the Cosmos-2553 is "intended for scientific research," which the U.S. officials say is unlikely. The Kremlin has earlier denied any intention to put nuclear weapons in space.</p>

VATICAN CITY, April 26. /TASS/. A funeral Mass has begun in St. Peter's Square in the presence of dozens of world leaders, reigning monarchs and religious figures to pay last respects to late Pope Francis.

The funeral of the first Latin American pope is being attended by over 160 delegations, including more than 60 heads of state and governments and also leaders of the European Union, according to the data of the Holy See's press office.

Aside from the European leaders, the funeral ceremony is being attended by US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, President of Argentina Javier Milei and India's President Droupadi Murmu. Russia is represented by Culture Minister Olga Lyubimova.

Pope Francis died on April 21 at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke. He took the helm of the Catholic Church as the 266th pope in 2013, following the resignation of his predecessor Benedict XVI (1927-2022).

Francis will be buried at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.</p>

Steenhuisen, who is also a Minister of Agriculture, spoke to IOL on Thursday on the sidelines of the official working visit to South Africa by Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. On Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced imminent talks with Trump to address critical US-South Africa relations. ”We also spoke about the need to foster good relations between our two countries,” he said. Trump made a bold statement that terrible things were happening in South Africa. This was after AfriForum and the Solidarity movement lied to Trump's administration that white people in South Africa were targeted by the government. Trump has cut off aid to South Africa and recently introduced 30% tariffs for the country. He offered refugee status to Afrikaners over fears of land expropriation and discrimination. But AfriForum turned down Trump's offer, saying they can't afford to leave their country. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

He says he's on a path to cut several new trade deals in a few weeks — but has also suggested it's “physically impossible” to hold all the needed meetings. Trump has said he will simply set new tariff rates negotiated internally within the U.S. government over the next few weeks — although he already did that on his April 2 “Liberation Day,” which caused the world economy to shudder. And the consequences of all this tariffs turmoil are enormous. Trump placed tariffs totaling 145% on China, leading China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S. — essentially triggering a trade war between the world's two largest economies with the potential to bring on a recession. The president told Time magazine in an interview released Friday that 20%, 30% or 50% tariffs a year from now would be a “total victory,” even though a financial market panic led him to temporarily reduce his baseline import taxes to 10% for 90 days while talks take place. If that is confusing for the nation's trading partners, it's also sowing anxiety at home. The Federal Reserve's beige book, a compilation of anecdotes from U.S. businesses prepared eight times a year, on Wednesday reported a huge spike in uncertainty among American companies that has caused them to pull back on hiring and investment in new projects. Beyond the idea that Trump plans to keep some level of tariffs in place, the world finance ministers and corporate executives who gathered this past week in Washington for the International Monetary Fund conference said in private discussions that the Trump administration was providing no real clarity on its goals for substantive talks. “My conversations with the ministers and governors this week at the IMF meetings have been they don't understand completely what the White House wants, nor who they should be negotiating with.” Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, in an interview with broadcaster SRF released Friday, said after a meeting with Bessent that Switzerland would be one of 15 countries with which the United States plans to conduct “privileged” negotiations. The European Union has pushed for cutting tariffs to zero for both parties, though Trump objects to European countries charging a value-added tax, which is akin to a sales tax that he says hurts U.S. goods. Trump continues to radiate optimism that negotiated deals with other countries will occur despite his claims that he will set his own deals and a lack of clarity about how the process goes forward. “I'm getting along very well with Japan,” Trump told reporters on Friday. As part of a deal with Japan, the Trump administration has publicly called on the Japanese government to change its auto safety standards that put a greater focus on pedestrian safety. “I don't think left-hand drive cars sell in Japan,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told a parliamentary session this week. “We want to make sure we aren't seen as being unfair,” Ishiba said, suggesting a possibility of reviewing Japanese car safety standards. As Trump continues to make conflicting statements about tariffs, companies are actively looking at higher prices, lower sales and possibly bare shelves in stores due to fewer shipments from China. Consumers are getting notices via email and social media from retailers that lamps, furniture and other housewares will now include tariff-related charges. The showerhead company Afina on Wednesday reported on a test to see if people would buy an American-made product that cost more than an import. He concluded in his written analysis: “If policymakers and pundits want to rebuild American industry, they need to grapple with this truth: idealism doesn't always survive contact with a price tag.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>
