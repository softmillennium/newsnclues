Canada's Election:

Mark Carney

Mark Carney said he expects US President Donald Trump will try to extract “major concessions” from Canada in negotiations, and that he takes seriously the president's stated desire to turn the country into a US state. 

“Take what the president says literally. I take it literally. I always have,” the Canadian prime minister told reporters on the final weekend before national elections. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday floated the possibility of stronger sanctions on Moscow and questioned whether Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to "stop the war" against Ukraine. Trump's social media post about Putin came just after he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met in Rome for their first in-person session since an Oval Office sitdown that devolved into a shouting match. They met just before the funeral of Pope Francis. "There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days," Trump wrote on Truth Social. Vice President JD Vance posted Trump's statement on his X account. "It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through "Banking" or "Secondary Sanctions?" The White House said that Trump and Zelenskyy "had a very productive discussion," but did not include additional details on what was discussed. Zelensky said that it was a "good meeting," adding: "Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results." Trump's remarks come as he's increasing pressure for the two countries to strike a peace deal. The deal reportedly included, in part, recognition of Crimea under Russian control, which Zelenskyy has repeatedly said is a red line. In his Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump said Russia stole Crimea from Ukraine, a rare acknowledgement from the U.S. president that Russia illegally annexed the region. Trump took aim at former U.S. President Barack Obama and suggested that he "made it possible for Russia to steal Crimea from Ukraine without even a shot being fired." It's been with them long before Trump came along." After his comments, Zelenskyy reiterated that Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Trump said Friday that Russia and Ukraine are "very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to 'finish it off.' He wrote on Truth Social that "most of the major points are agreed to." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OKLAHOMA CITY — Amazon and Nvidia told a room of oil and gas executives this week that all options are on the table to power artificial intelligence including fossil fuels such as natural gas. The Big Tech companies have invested mostly in renewable power in an effort to slash their carbon dioxide emissions, but they are now navigating a changed political environment. President Donald Trump has ditched U.S. commitments to fight climate change as he seeks to increase fossil fuel production, particularly natural gas. There is now growing public acknowledgment from the tech industry that gas will be needed, at least in the near term, to help fuel AI. "To have the energy we need for the grid, it's going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time," Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, said during a panel discussion Thursday. Amazon remains focused on slashing its carbon emissions, Miller said. But those advanced technologies will not come online until the 2030s and Amazon needs steady and secure power now, Miller said. "We're very explicit that meeting customers' demands for capacity is first and foremost in our priority list, and so having access to power is first and foremost what we focus on," Miller said. Nvidia is also focused on environmental impact but wants "all options on the table" as AI faces an energy crunch, said Josh Parker, the chipmaker's senior director of corporate sustainability. We just need power," Parker said at the panel. "We have some customers who really prioritize the clean energy, and some customers who don't care as much," the executive said. Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark called for data center developers to be realistic about the energy sources that are currently available. Anthropic estimates that 50 gigawatts of new power is needed by 2027, equivalent to about 50 nuclear reactors. AI demand can help drive the development of "new and novel sources" of power over the longer term, he said. The idea of using coal, however, was met with unease. Trump recently signed an order that aims to boost coal production, citing demand from AI. The Amazon and Nvidia executives did not answer directly when asked during the panel whether they thought coal had a role play in powering AI. "You have a broader set of options than just coal," Clark said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Airline CEOs this month warned Wall Street that passengers' appetite for domestic trips is coming in lighter than they had hoped when they set forecasts high at the start of 2025. On a series of earnings calls, they said the reasons range from President Donald Trump's whipsawing tariff policies to volatile markets and, most notably, economic uncertainty. That means airlines have too many seats on their hands — again. Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines said they will cut back their capacity growth plans after what they still hope to be a strong summer travel season. Delta, Southwest, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines pulled their 2025 financial outlooks this month, saying the U.S. economy is too tough to predict right now. United Airlines provided two outlooks, one if if the U.S. falls into a recession and said it expects to be profitable in either scenario. Airfare fell 5.3% in March from last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest data. Easter, a peak travel period that coincides with many school vacations, fell in March of last year, though fares also dropped 4% in February this year. Government travel plunged, too, amid the Trump administration's cost cuts and mass layoffs this year. "If uncertainty pops up, the first thing that goes away is corporate travel," said Conor Cunningham a travel and transportation analyst at Melius Research . Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on April 9 that corporate travel was trending up 10% year on year at the start of 2025, but that growth has since flattened. Business travel is key to major carriers because those customers are less price-sensitive and often book last minute when tickets are likely to be more expensive. Alaska Airlines warned Wednesday that weaker-than-expected demand will likely eat into second-quarter earnings. Chief Financial Officer Shane Tackett told CNBC that demand has not plunged, but the carrier has lowered some fares to fill seats. "The fares aren't as strong as they were in the fourth quarter of last year and coming into January and first part of February," Tackett said in an interview Wednesday. "Demand is still quite high for the industry, but it's just not at the peak that we all anticipated might continue coming out of last year." At the front of the plane, executives say demand is holding up far better, while U.S.-based customers are still flying overseas in droves. But lingering concerns are still weighing on the industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His net worth is $16.8 billion per Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. But he says that, "mine is a life of failure." In a video interview with The Wall Street Journal published Saturday. Dyson — who said he created 5,127 prototypes over five years before launching his bagless vacuum cleaner in 1993 — said that embracing failure was essential to life. It takes a long time before you find the one that works," he said. Dyson, 77, said he enjoyed the misfires and struggles he's had across his career, saying that real wisdom comes from experience. While a clever student may get to the answer quickly, he said, they are at a disadvantage to those who take their time getting to an answer, as they haven't "viscerally experienced failure and overcoming failure." For Dyson, resilience and adaptability are some of the most important skills someone can learn. "Life is about making things work," he said. He continued: "That's what you have to do. Aside from the many prototypes it took him to invent the first vacuum with his namesake brand, Dyson famously abandoned plans to enter the electric car market in 2019 after spending more than $600 million on developing a vehicle that he came to realize was not commercially viable. "The route to success is never linear. He said of his scrapped EV vehicle, "I could see that it was just too risky."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A growing number of Americans are using buy now, pay later loans to buy groceries, and more people are paying those bills late, according to new Lending Tree data released Friday. The figures are the latest indicator that some consumers are cracking under the pressure of an uncertain economy and are having trouble affording essentials such as groceries as they contend with persistent inflation, high interest rates and concerns around tariffs. In a survey conducted April 2-3 of 2,000 U.S. consumers ages 18 to 79, around half reported having used buy now, pay later services. Of those consumers, 25% of respondents said they were using BNPL loans to buy groceries, up from 14% in 2024 and 21% in 2023, the firm said. Meanwhile, 41% of respondents said they made a late payment on a BNPL loan in the past year, up from 34% in the year prior, the survey found. Lending Tree's chief consumer finance analyst, Matt Schulz, said that of those respondents who said they paid a BNPL bill late, most said it was by no more than a week or so. "A lot of people are struggling and looking for ways to extend their budget," Schulz said. There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs and other economic issues, and it's all going to add up to a lot of people looking for ways to extend their budget however they can." He stopped short of calling the results a recession indicator but said conditions are expected to decline further before they get better. "I do think it's going to get worse, at least in the short term," said Schulz. "I don't know that there's a whole lot of reason to expect these numbers to get better in the near term." The loans, which allow consumers to split up purchases into several smaller payments, are a popular alternative to credit cards because they often don't charge interest. In Lending Tree's survey, 60% of BNPL users said they've had multiple loans at once, with nearly a fourth saying they have held three or more at once. "It's just really important for people to be cautious when they use these things, because even though they can be a really good interest-free tool to help you kind of make it from one paycheck to the next, there's also a lot of risk in mismanaging it," said Schulz. Lending Tree's findings come after Billboard revealed that about 60% of general admission Coachella attendees funded their concert tickets with buy now, pay later loans, sparking a debate on the state of the economy and how consumers are using debt to keep up their lifestyles. A recent announcement from DoorDash that it would begin accepting BNPL financing from Klarna for food deliveries led to widespread mockery and jokes that Americans were struggling so much that they were now being forced to finance cheeseburgers and burritos. Over the last few years, consumers have held up relatively well, even in the face of persistent inflation and high interest rates, because the job market was strong and wage growth had kept up with inflation — at least for some workers. Earlier this year, however, large companies including Walmart and Delta Airlines began warning that the dynamic had begun to shift and they were seeing cracks in demand, which was leading to worse-than-expected sales forecasts.

Gold is going up because all the bad things that could happen seem to be happening at once. 

 Maybe you need more gold?

 If you haven't got a basement full of bullion, you'll be feeling a bit left out by now. The price of gold is up 43% in the last year, 26% year-to-date and 10% in the last month. That's a lot in a very short time, but it makes perfect sense (to us at least). </p>
