            Five people have been killed and more than 700 injured in a huge explosion at the port of Bandar Abbas in southwestern Iran, according to official Iranian media.
    


            The explosion sent a huge plume of thick, gray smoke from the Shahid Rajaee part of the port complex, according to videos geolocated by CNN, with the government saying the blast was likely linked to chemicals being stored.
    


            The head of the Iranian emergency services said four people had died in the blast. A spokesperson for the emergency services earlier said 516 had been injured.
    


            A video distributed by the Mehr news agency showed surveillance footage of the moment of the explosion, which appears to have occurred in a warehouse at the port. Other footage showed helicopters dropping water at the site of the fire ignited by the explosion.
    


            Debris was spread over a wide area and many buildings at the port complex were badly damaged, according to state media. Windows within a radius of several kilometers were shattered, they said.
    


            Some reports said people were trapped in the wreckage of a building that was reduced to rubble.
    


            The region's governor, Mohammad Ashouri Taziani, said injured people were being transferred to Bandar Abbas medical centers and the fire had been contained. The port has been closed and maritime operations suspended, according to state media.
    


            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered an investigation into the causes of the incident. He wrote on X that the interior minister had been sent to the region to “examine the dimensions of the accident.”
    


            State broadcaster IRIB said the explosion took place in the chemical and sulfur area of the port.
    


            A government spokeswoman, Fatemeh Mohajerani, said it would take some time to establish the cause of the explosion – “but so far what has been determined is that containers were stored in a corner of the port that likely contained chemicals which exploded. But until the fire is extinguished, it's hard to ascertain the cause.”
    


            Shahid Rajaee is a large facility for container shipments, covering 2,400 hectares (around 5,900 acres). It handles 70 million tons of cargo annually, including oil and general shipping. It has nearly 500,000 square meters (5.4 million square feet) of warehouses and 35 shipping berths.

The US state of California's economy has overtaken Japan's to become the fourth-largest in the world, the office of the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, has announced.

California's nominal GDP reached $4.1 trillion in 2024, edging out Japan's $4.02 trillion, according to data from the International Monetary Fund and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released earlier this week. The state now trails only the US itself at $29.18 trillion, China at $18.74 trillion, and Germany at $4.65 trillion.

“California isn't just keeping pace with the world – we're setting the pace,” Newsom declared in a statement on Wednesday. “Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritize sustainability, and believe in the power of innovation.”

The Golden State also outpaced the top three economies in growth, expanding by 6% last year compared to the US average of 5.3%, China's 2.6%, and Germany's 2.9%. Over the past four years, California's economy grew at an average nominal rate of 7.5%.

Analysts attribute the state's rapid gains to its booming technology, entertainment, and clean energy sectors. California, the most populous US state with nearly 40 million residents, is also a leader in manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism.

Meanwhile, Japan's economy has struggled. Despite a slight uptick in GDP last quarter, the IMF this week cut its growth forecast for Japan to 0.6% for 2025, down from the 1.1% projected earlier this year, following just a 0.1% increase in 2024. Economists cite Japan's shrinking workforce, stagnant labor productivity and rapidly rising commodity prices as the major obstacles to sustained growth.

“Japan's economic fundamentals remain weak,” analysts at Deloitte said this week, warning that without significant reforms to boost innovation and efficiency, the country's long-term prospects will continue to decline.

They warned that external pressures may also add to Japan's economic troubles. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump imposed a 24% tariff on Japanese exports, although most tariffs have been paused until July. The 10% baseline tariff remains in place, along with a 25% duty on cars. The tariffs are expected to further weigh down Japan's export-reliant economy, given that the US was the country's largest export market in 2024.

Meanwhile, California has formally pushed back against Trump's tariffs. The state became the first to sue the Trump administration over the new duties, arguing the measures would harm key California industries, including agriculture and technology.

“We're not going to sit back while reckless trade wars endanger the livelihoods of millions of Californians,” Newsom stated.

DA leader John Steenhuisen said President Cyril Ramaphosa's meet-up with US President Donald Trump would be a chance to clarify that “terrible things” are not happening in South Africa.

Steenhuisen stressed that this would be a moment to show that the country was not a picture that was painted to him by “some”.

”There's no mass expropriation of land. There's no genocide taking place at all. I am very glad that the two presidents have spoken,” he said.

Steenhuisen, who is also a Minister of Agriculture, spoke to IOL on Thursday on the sidelines of the official working visit to South Africa by Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.

On Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced imminent talks with Trump to address critical US-South Africa relations.

”We both agreed to meet soon to address various matters regarding US-South Africa relations.

”We also spoke about the need to foster good relations between our two countries,” he said.

Trump made a bold statement that terrible things were happening in South Africa.

This was after AfriForum and the Solidarity movement lied to Trump's administration that white people in South Africa were targeted by the government.

The government has dismissed the claims, labelling them as false and misleading information.

Trump has cut off aid to South Africa and recently introduced 30% tariffs for the country.

He offered refugee status to Afrikaners over fears of land expropriation and discrimination. But AfriForum turned down Trump's offer, saying they can't afford to leave their country.

Steenhuisen urged citizens to tread carefully and use the next 90-day period “very wisely and very cleverly” to be able to avoid the tariff increase.

European officials are pressing Ukraine to accept the likelihood that it will be forced to agree to certain territorial concessions to Russia as part of a peace agreement, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing sources.

The issue was reportedly discussed during talks in London involving European and Ukrainian officials, which were, however, downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would not attend. Despite this, one official told the WaPo that the talks “made progress” in terms of convincing Kiev that concessions may be unavoidable.

Western negotiators are said to have a sense that Ukraine “may be willing to endure effective Russian control of Crimea,” provided Kiev is not required to legally recognize this reality. The peninsula overwhelmingly voted to join Russia in 2014 following a Western-backed coup in Kiev.

Many Ukrainians, however, are reluctant to renounce future claims to Crimea, viewing any territorial compromise as setting a “dangerous precedent” for potential formal recognition of Moscow's control over four other former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia in 2022.

This comes as the US has clashed with European nations and Kiev over their vision for a Ukraine peace arrangement, with the sides presenting different proposals on the terms for ending the conflict, according to a Reuters report, which was confirmed by the WaPo.

In particular, US envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly proposed that Washington recognize Crimea as Russian and accept Moscow's de facto control over large parts of the other four regions. Meanwhile, Ukraine and its European supporters, however, reportedly continue to resist any mention of territorial recognition in the proposed agreements. Their version of a peace framework postpones territorial issues until after a ceasefire and emphasizes the necessity of strong security guarantees for Kiev.

For Europe and Ukraine, “it is not only reasonable but necessary to push back on some elements of the US proposal, as it gives Ukraine practically very, very little. And Russia a lot,” a Western official told the WaPo. The report also noted that Europe is trying to “edge Washington toward a more reasonable agreement,” including the recognition that a ceasefire must be an essential first step.

The WaPo report comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin held lengthy talks on Friday with Witkoff at the Kremlin on Friday. Presidential adviser Yury Ushakov described the meeting as “constructive and very useful” in nature,” adding that the talks included the idea of possibly resuming direct negotiations between Moscow and Kiev.

Trump, commenting on the state of the negotiations, said Ukraine and Russia “should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off.' Most of the major points are agreed to.”

VATICAN CITY, April 26. /TASS/. A funeral Mass has begun in St. Peter's Square in the presence of dozens of world leaders, reigning monarchs and religious figures to pay last respects to late Pope Francis.

The funeral of the first Latin American pope is being attended by over 160 delegations, including more than 60 heads of state and governments and also leaders of the European Union, according to the data of the Holy See's press office.

Aside from the European leaders, the funeral ceremony is being attended by US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, President of Argentina Javier Milei and India's President Droupadi Murmu. Russia is represented by Culture Minister Olga Lyubimova.

Pope Francis died on April 21 at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke. He took the helm of the Catholic Church as the 266th pope in 2013, following the resignation of his predecessor Benedict XVI (1927-2022).

Tensions between nuclear-armed countries escalate after attack killed 26 people in disputed territory

Indian and Pakistani troops have exchanged gunfire across the volatile frontier in Kashmir for a second day, amid growing tensions after a brazen attack that killed 26 people at a popular tourist resort.

The massacre has sent relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours into a dangerous downward spin. India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which is divided between them but claimed fully by both.

India's military said Pakistani soldiers opened fire from “multiple posts” along the heavily militarised ceasefire line, and Indian forces “responded appropriately” to what it called “unprovoked” firing. No casualties were reported. Pakistan did not immediately comment.

The clashes followed the attack last Tuesday, when gunmen opened fire in a meadow near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attackers reportedly asked the victims, all male, whether they were Hindu or Muslim and shot the Hindus. Violence had been steadily abating in Kashmir, and the attack struck a heavy blow to the region's recovering tourism industry.

An obscure group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility. India links the group to the outlawed Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, but Pakistan denies involvement.

In an apparent attempt to ease tensions, Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, offered to cooperate with a “neutral investigation”. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has vowed to “track and punish every terrorist and their backers” and pursue the killers “to the ends of the earth”.

“Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent and credible investigation,” Sharif said, while warning Pakistan's forces stood ready to repel “any misadventure” by India.

In tit-for-tat moves, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact, expelled Pakistani diplomats and cancelled Pakistani visas. Islamabad retaliated by expelling Indian diplomats, cancelling Indians' visas and closing its airspace. It also suspended the 1972 Shimla accord, a key framework for dialogue.

India's resources minister, C R Patil, said the country would move to ensure “not a single drop” of river water flowed into Pakistan after the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. Pakistan has warned any attempt to block water would be an “act of war”, with the Pakistan People's party chief, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, declaring: “Either our water will flow through it, or their blood.”

Experts say disrupting the flow would require big investment and years of work. “India lacks the hydro infrastructure needed to actually impede the flow of water to Pakistan in the short term,” Brahma Chellaney, an analyst, said. “So the action is largely symbolic.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

More than 25 percent of China-based Taiwanese businesses are considering terminating their operations in China, with 50 percent looking to increase investments into non-Chinese supply chains, given the US' tariffs, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Secretary-General Luo Wen-jia (羅文嘉) said on Friday.

US President Donald Trump on April 2 imposed a 32 percent tariff on imports from Taiwan, but one week later announced a 90-day pause on its implementation. However, a universal 10 percent tariff was immediately applied to most imports from around the world.

On April 12, the Trump administration exempted computers, smartphones and semiconductors from the new tariffs.

Taiwanese businesses most affected by the situation are those with operations in China that primarily export their products to the US and have low gross profit margins, Luo said.

Companies that cater to China's domestic market are the second-most affected, Luo added.

US tariffs have significantly affected the imports of materials and components for China's domestic markets. As a result, products that were previously stored are now being sold domestically, increasing competition, he said.

Although electronics, information technology (IT) products and semiconductors are less affected, the Mainland Affairs Council urged business owners to wait and see how the Chinese market reacts, Luo said.

The consensus among Taiwanese businesses in response to the short-term uncertainty brought about by US tariff policies is to increase investment in non-Chinese supply chains, and bolster the resilience of regional supply chains to weather the effects of the changes in the international economic order and geopolitical shifts, Luo said.

The SEF also reminded Taiwanese businesses to be careful of investment risks, he said.

Meanwhile, in view of the coming summer break for students, Luo said that travelers to China should be wary of youth start-up assistance groups and youth culture interaction groups.

They could be a cover for scam groups, he said, citing as an example an incident in which the Chinese Youth Entrepreneurs Association used identification documents from tour group members to apply for loans for Sichuan's youth start-up zone, he said.

Culture interactive groups could be a front for cheap tour groups or groups that focus on political propaganda and “united front” rhetoric, Luo said.

The number of people who are missing due to those reasons varies, but even one missing person shows that there is a risk of “disappearing” when traveling to China, he said.

The SEF would publicize those cases while maintaining the anonymity of the people affected to promote greater awareness of the risks associated with traveling to China, he added.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare on Thursday defended its medical tourism program after the owner of a dental clinic was questioned on suspicion of helping 600 Chinese nationals enter Taiwan illegally.

Kuo Wei-chung (郭威中), an official at the ministry's Department of Medical Affairs, said that irregularities have only been found at three institutions, including the dental clinic, among the 129 that have applied for medical tourism visas and entry permits.

Kuo added that only 28 disease categories — such as end-stage kidney disease and lymphatic system disorders — qualify for medical tourism applications.

The ministry and the National Immigration Agency subsequently revised the program's criteria so that only those with acute and severe issues could visit Taiwan for dental treatment, Kuo said.

The program, introduced in 2007, is designed to attract international tourists to receive healthcare services in Taiwan.

On Wednesday, the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office summoned 10 people for questioning in connection with the alleged illegal entry of Chinese nationals into Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of those questioned, a Taipei dental clinic owner surnamed Pan (潘), is accused of submitting falsified treatment plans to help 600 Chinese nationals register as medical visitors between December 2022 and May 2023.

Prosecutors said that many of the Chinese nationals subsequently engaged in illegal tourism and sex work in Taiwan.

The ministry said it had barred Pan's clinic from participating in its medical tourism program on May 17, 2023, a suspension that remains in place.

Asked why it had taken nearly two years since authorities placed administrative penalties on Pan's clinic for suspects to be brought in for questioning, prosecutors said they had only recently collected enough evidence.

Pope Francis was laid to rest in Rome yesterday after a Vatican funeral for the “pope among the people” attended by hundreds of thousands of mourners as well as world leaders, including US President Donald Trump.

About 400,000 people packed St Peter's Square and lined the streets of Rome to say goodbye to the Argentine pontiff, a champion of the poor who had led the world's 1.4 billion Catholics since 2013.

After a solemn funeral in front of hushed crowds, Francis' plain wooden coffin — a testament to a life of humility — was driven slowly to Rome's Santa Maria Maggiore church, where he would be interred in a private ceremony.

Fourteen white-gloved pallbearers carried the coffin into the church, as children placed baskets of flowers at the altar and a choir sang prayers.

The marble tomb of the Catholic Church's first Latin American leader is inscribed with just one word: “Franciscus,” his papal name in Latin. 

Francis, who died on Monday aged 88, was “a pope among the people, with an open heart,” who strove for a more compassionate, open-minded Catholic Church, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re said in his homily.

There was applause from the masses gathered under bright blue skies as he hailed the pope's “conviction that the Church is a home for all, a home with its doors always open.”

Francis sought to steer the centuries-old Church into a more inclusive direction during his 12-year papacy, and his death prompted a global outpouring of emotion.

Maria Mrula, 28, a student from Germany, said she drove 16 hours to be at the funeral.

“Giving to the poor and being with the poor,” Francis had inspired many, she said.

“The Church is alive,” she said. “It was great being here.”

Italian and Vatican authorities mounted a major security operation for the ceremony, with fighter jets on standby and snipers positioned on the roofs surrounding the tiny city-state.

Red-robed cardinals and purple-hatted bishops sat on one side of the altar in St Peter's Square during the funeral, with world dignitaries sitting opposite.

In front of the altar lay the pope's simple cypress coffin, inlaid with a pale cross.


SECURITY: 
                                        As China is ‘reshaping' Hong Kong's population, Taiwan must raise the eligibility threshold for applications from Hong Kongers, Chiu Chui-cheng said                                         When Hong Kong and Macau citizens apply for residency in Taiwan, it would be under a new category that includes a “national security observation period,” Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Chiu Chui-cheng (邱垂正) said yesterday. 
President William Lai (賴清德) on March 13 announced 17 strategies to counter China's aggression toward Taiwan, including incorporating national security considerations into the review process for residency applications from Hong Kong and Macau citizens. 
The situation in Hong Kong is constantly changing, Chiu said to media yesterday on the sidelines of the Taipei Technology Run hosted by the Taipei Neihu Technology Park Development Association.

CARROT AND STICK: 
                                        While unrelenting in its military threats, China attracted nearly 40,000 Taiwanese to over 400 business events last year                                         Nearly 40,000 Taiwanese last year joined industry events in China, such as conferences and trade fairs, supported by the Chinese government, a study showed yesterday, as Beijing ramps up a charm offensive toward Taipei alongside military pressure.
China has long taken a carrot-and-stick approach to Taiwan, threatening it with the prospect of military action while reaching out to those it believes are amenable to Beijing's point of view.

The cardinals met yesterday in the Vatican's synod hall to chart the next steps before a conclave begins to choose Francis' successor, as condolences poured in from around the world. According to current norms, the conclave must begin between May 5 and 10.
The cardinals set the funeral for Saturday at 10am in St Peter's Square, to be celebrated by the dean of the College

US President Donald Trump on April 2 imposed a 32 percent tariff on imports from Taiwan, but one week later announced a 90-day pause on its implementation. However, a universal 10 percent tariff was immediately applied to most imports from around the world.

The Associated Press

11:45 JST, April 26, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump can't stop contradicting himself on his own tariff plans.

He says he's on a path to cut several new trade deals in a few weeks — but has also suggested it's “physically impossible” to hold all the needed meetings.

Trump has said he will simply set new tariff rates negotiated internally within the U.S. government over the next few weeks — although he already did that on his April 2 “Liberation Day,” which caused the world economy to shudder.

The Republican president says he's actively negotiating with the Chinese government on tariffs — while the Chinese and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said talks have yet to start.

What should one believe? The sure bet is that uncertainty will persist in ways that employers and consumers alike expect to damage the economy and that leave foreign leaders scratching their heads in bewilderment.

And the consequences of all this tariffs turmoil are enormous.

Trump placed tariffs totaling 145% on China, leading China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S. — essentially triggering a trade war between the world's two largest economies with the potential to bring on a recession.

The president told Time magazine in an interview released Friday that 20%, 30% or 50% tariffs a year from now would be a “total victory,” even though a financial market panic led him to temporarily reduce his baseline import taxes to 10% for 90 days while talks take place.

“The deal is a deal that I choose,” Trump said in the interview. “What I'm doing is I will, at a certain point in the not too distant future, I will set a fair price of tariffs for different countries.”

If that is confusing for the nation's trading partners, it's also sowing anxiety at home.

The Federal Reserve's beige book, a compilation of anecdotes from U.S. businesses prepared eight times a year, on Wednesday reported a huge spike in uncertainty among American companies that has caused them to pull back on hiring and investment in new projects. The word “uncertainty” cropped up 80 times, compared with 45 in early March and just 14 in January.

Beyond the idea that Trump plans to keep some level of tariffs in place, the world finance ministers and corporate executives who gathered this past week in Washington for the International Monetary Fund conference said in private discussions that the Trump administration was providing no real clarity on its goals for substantive talks.

“There's not a coherent strategy at the moment on what the tariffs are supposed to achieve,” said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the GeoEconomics Center at The Atlantic Council. “My conversations with the ministers and governors this week at the IMF meetings have been they don't understand completely what the White House wants, nor who they should be negotiating with.”

Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, in an interview with broadcaster SRF released Friday, said after a meeting with Bessent that Switzerland would be one of 15 countries with which the United States plans to conduct “privileged” negotiations. But she said a memorandum of understanding would have to be reached for talks to formally begin.

She was happy to at least know whom to talk to, saying that “we have also been assigned a specific contact person. This is not easy in the U.S. administration.”

Nations are deploying various negotiating tactics.

The South Korean officials who met with their U.S. counterparts this week say they specifically asked for the tariffs to be lifted with the goal of working toward an agreement by July. The European Union has pushed for cutting tariffs to zero for both parties, though Trump objects to European countries charging a value-added tax, which is akin to a sales tax that he says hurts U.S. goods.

Trump continues to radiate optimism that negotiated deals with other countries will occur despite his claims that he will set his own deals and a lack of clarity about how the process goes forward.

“I'm getting along very well with Japan,” Trump told reporters on Friday. “We're very close to a deal.”

As part of a deal with Japan, the Trump administration has publicly called on the Japanese government to change its auto safety standards that put a greater focus on pedestrian safety. But the steering wheels on autos sold in Japan are on the right-hand side, while U.S. automakers put their steering wheels on the left.

“I don't think left-hand drive cars sell in Japan,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told a parliamentary session this week.

“We want to make sure we aren't seen as being unfair,” Ishiba said, suggesting a possibility of reviewing Japanese car safety standards.

As Trump continues to make conflicting statements about tariffs, companies are actively looking at higher prices, lower sales and possibly bare shelves in stores due to fewer shipments from China.

Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a supply chain company, said on the social media site X: “In the 3 weeks since the tariffs took effect, ocean container bookings from China to the United States are down over 60% industry wide.”

Consumers are getting notices via email and social media from retailers that lamps, furniture and other housewares will now include tariff-related charges.

The showerhead company Afina on Wednesday reported on a test to see if people would buy an American-made product that cost more than an import. Their Chinese-made filtered showerhead retails for $129, but to manufacture the same product domestically would take the price up to $239.

When customers on the company's website were given a choice between a showerhead made in the USA or a cheaper one made in Asia, there were 584 purchases of the $129 model made abroad and not one sale of the domestically produced showerhead.

Ramon van Meer, Afina's founder, said in an interview that the “scale and the speed” of the tariffs were part of the challenge for smaller businesses looking to adapt, adding that part of the challenge is that Trump imposed the import taxes “without proper planning or announcements.”

He concluded in his written analysis: “If policymakers and pundits want to rebuild American industry, they need to grapple with this truth: idealism doesn't always survive contact with a price tag.”

Russian forces have fully recaptured the territory of Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region partially held by Ukraine since last August, the Kremlin claimed on April 26 in a statement later disputed by Kyiv.

""Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov reported to Supreme Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Putin on the completion of the operation to liberate Kursk Oblast,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency.

Ukraine has denied the claim, saying that Russia's statements ""do not correspond to reality.""

""Ukrainian defensive operations in certain areas of Kursk Oblast continue,"" Ukraine's General Staff said, adding that Kyiv's forces repelled five Russian ground assaults in the area on April 26, with another clash currently ongoing.

""The situation is difficult, but our units continue to hold certain positions and carry out tasks as assigned,"" the statement read, noting that there is no threat of encirclement. A military source also told the Kyiv Independent that Kyiv continues to hold territories in Kursk Oblast.

For the first time, Gerasimov also acknowledged the participation of North Korean troops in the campaign, praising their ""fortitude and heroism."" Kyiv and Seoul have previously said that North Korea has dispatched around 11,000 troops to Kursk Oblast, though Moscow has not openly confirmed this until now.

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. The operation aimed to disrupt a planned Russian offensive on the neighboring Sumy Oblast and draw Russian forces away from the embattled Donbas region.

Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha.

As of April 25, Ukrainian battlefield monitoring service DeepState showed Ukrainian forces holding onto limited positions in Kursk Oblast near the border, namely the villages of Oleshnya and Gomal.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

A Russian space satellite that U.S. officials tie to its nuclear anti-satellite weapon program seems to be spinning uncontrollably and may no longer be functioning, Reuters reported on April 25, citing U.S. experts.

The Cosmos 2553 satellite, which Russia denies is a part of its space weapon efforts, was launched by Russia weeks before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 

Last year, the satellite had prompted U.S. allegations that for years, Russia has been developing a space nuclear weapon that could destroy hundreds of satellites in low orbit with a blast, such as SpaceX's network of Starlink internet system used by Ukrainian troops.

Over the past year, the Cosmos 2553 satellite had episodes of errant spinning, Reuters reported, citing Doppler radar data from space-tracking firm LeoLabs and optical data from Slingshot Aerospace.

In December 2024, LeoLabs suggested with ""high confidence"" that the satellite was tumbling based on additional radar data and imagery of the satellite taken by another space company, the news agency says.

""This observation strongly suggests the satellite is no longer operational,"" the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, said of LeoLabs' analysis in its annual Space Threat Assessment, published on April 25.

U.S. Space Command, which tracks objects in space and has condemned Russian military satellites in the past, said it was aware of a change in Cosmos 2553's altitude, accordig to Reuters.

However, according to the latest observations of Slingshot, whose global telescope network has been tracking the spacecraft since its launch in 2022, Cosmos 2553 appears to have stabilized, the article says.

Russian officials have claimed that the Cosmos-2553 is ""intended for scientific research,"" which the U.S. officials say is unlikely. The Kremlin has earlier denied any intention to put nuclear weapons in space.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Pope Francis's funeral took the shape of a mass pilgrimage and unofficial global summit as the Vatican's St. Peter's Square filled to bursting with pilgrims, presidents, and refugees. 

The Vatican estimated that more than 200,000 pilgrims from all over the world had arrived before the funeral started at 10 a.m., making it one of the largest funerals in Vatican – and European – history. They began filling the square well before dawn, a testament to the popularity of Francis among Catholics and non-Catholics alike.

The crowds spilled into the streets around the basilica and onto two bridges over the nearby Tiber River, where they had no view of the event but could hear the hymns. Some of the faithful, unable to get near St. Peter's Basilica, entered nearby churches to pray in silence. 

Analysis: Pope Francis and his legacy: How he likened (inclusive) capitalism to good Catholicism

Francis died at age 88 on the morning of Easter Monday after a stroke and subsequent heart failure. His final public appearance came the day before, when he celebrated Easter mass from the loggia of the basilica even though he was plainly weak and able to say only a few words. It would be his farewell to the world, and his last blessing of Catholics.

U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are among the world leaders in attendance at the funeral of Pope Francis.Fabrizio Troccoli/The Globe and Mail

The heads of state or government at the funeral included Donald Trump of the United States, Emmanuel Macron of France, Javier Milei from Francis's native Argentina, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Britain's Keir Starmer, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and former U.S. President Joe Biden. At least 50 heads of state and 10 reigning monarchs attended the funeral, the Vatican said, plus dozens of other delegations. 

Canada was represented by Governor-General Mary Simon and her contingent. Prime Minister Mark Carney was unable to attend so close to Monday's election. 

Ms. Simon met Francis several times during his tour of Canada in 2022, when he apologized to the Indigenous peoples for the residential school tragedies.

“The apology that Pope Francis made to most of the residential school survivors was very meaningful and very powerful and helped to address the grief and pain that they endured for so long,” she told The Globe and Mail after the funeral. 

“Reconciliation is continuing and will continue and hopefully we will carry on Pope Francis's legacy of bringing people together and talking about the dark history of different countries – for us it's Canada –and the relationship with Indigenous peoples,” she said.

The gathering of leaders was awkward in the sense that some of the leaders, including Ms. Meloni, Mr. Trump and Mr. Milei were at philosophical odds with Francis's empathy and support for migrants and asylum seekers. 

What happens after Pope Francis's death? An ancient process shrouded in mystery and white smoke

Ms. Meloni, who was elected prime minister in 2022 partly on an anti-migrant platform, once said Italy should “repatriate migrants back to their countries and then sink the boats that rescued them.” Francis was highly critical of Mr. Trump's anti-migrant stance. “Anyone who wants to build walls and not bridges is not a Christian,” he once said. 

Francis, who was warm and open to divorced and gay Catholics – “Who am I to judge?” he said in one of his most famous remarks – believed the Church “is a home for all,” Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who led the funeral, said in his homily.

Francis was guided by his conviction that the Church “is capable of bending down to every person, regardless of their beliefs or condition, and healing their wounds,” the Cardinal said.

Mr. Zelensky, who was dressed in dark military clothes, received a round of applause as he left the basilica, where he paid his respects in front of Francis's coffin just ahead of the funeral ceremony. He and Mr. Trump met before the funeral and reportedly were to meet again later in the day. White House communications director Steven Cheung said the pair “had a very productive discussion” before the funeral. 

After the funeral, Mr. Zelensky used X to thank Mr. Trump for the meeting. “We discussed a lot one on one. Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out,” he wrote.

Some of the Catholic faithful travelled for days to attend the funeral, which was held on a sunny, breezy day in Rome, though thousands shivered in the pre-dawn chill.

One group of disabled pilgrims had travelled to Rome with the Kairos Forum, a British consultancy that helps the disabled, and were to meet Francis on Tuesday. They were deeply saddened by the Pope's death only a day before the meeting was to take place.

But many of the 150 in the group were thrilled to have seen Francis celebrate Easter mass on Sunday. “Under Francis, this was a church were everyone belonged,” said Zachariah Duke, the senior lecturer in theology of Australian Catholic University who was co-ordinating the Kairos visit. “I would like to see the next pope be able to connect with all humanity like Francis did.”

Jessica Dal Ri, 29, who works in tourism and marketing, travelled from Italy's far north to attend the funeral with her father. “For the young generation, he was our pope,” she said. “He knew how to connect to the young in a way Benedict did not.” She was referring the Francis's predecessor, the German-born Pope Benedict XVI, a religious scholar who often seemed aloof and distant. 

Invited to his funeral mass were delegations from Mediterranea Saving Humans, an Italian charity that protects refugees who cross the Mediterranean, and Refugees in Libya, a charity that campaigns on behalf of migrants and refugees held in detention camps. Francis was close to both groups.

Francis's coffin was sealed on Friday evening in St. Peter's Basilica, where he lay in state for three days. The Vatican said that day that 250,000 visitors have filed past his then-open coffin to pay their respects. Some of the faithful were annoyed by visitors posing for selfies near the open coffin.

The funeral started at 10 a.m. local time and ended at noon, after which the funeral procession took the coffin through the streets of Rome to Santa Maria Maggiore, Francis's favourite basilica in Rome. He broke with tradition by asking to be buried there, not in the crypts beneath St. Peter's, which hold the tombs of some 140 popes. 

In keeping with his desire for simplicity, Francis chose to be buried in a simple wooden coffin. 

Presidents, royalty and a multitude of mourners bade farewell to Pope Francis on Saturday at his funeral, where a cardinal said the pontiff's legacy of caring for migrants, the downtrodden and the environment must not die with him. Fiona Jones reports.

The United States has reportedly called on Ukraine to accept Russian control of Crimea as part of a peace agreement. However, Ukraine says doing so would violate the constitution.

The United States has reportedly sent its European allies a confidential paper with proposals for a ceasefire to end Russia's war against Ukraine. One of the key demands is apparently the recognition of the Kremlin's control over the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014. This was first reported by the news agency Bloomberg, the US news channel CNN, the influential US daily The Washington Post, and the business and financial newspaper The Wall Street Journal.

The US was reportedly expecting a response from Ukraine by April 23. But before this date, a meeting of top diplomats in London was postponed and downgraded after foreign ministers from Germany, the UK, France and Ukraine canceled their participation. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also withdrew. Until then, US President Donald Trump did not confirm or deny reports of one key demand being the recognition of Crimea as Russian territory. 

The matter of Crimea has been a recurring topic in the media since Russia's illegal annexation of the peninsula. But Kyiv did not initially seem in a hurry to make any comments on the reports. One of the first to react was Refat Chubarov, the leader of the Crimean Tatar national movement in Ukraine and worldwide. He told US overseas broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the Trump administration was testing the Ukrainian leadership with its messages regarding territorial concessions, without which the war could reportedly not end, and no lasting peace could be achieved.

A little later, the office of the Ukrainian president also reacted. Presidential advisor Serhiy Leshchenko told Ukrainian television that Kyiv had not discussed the recognition of Crimea as part of Russia with the US, and did not agree to this.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy apparently wanted to put an end to this discussion. In response to questions from journalists in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on the evening of April 22, he reiterated that Ukraine would ""not legally recognize the Russian occupation"" of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, as this would be a violation of the Ukrainian constitution. ""There's nothing to talk about here,"" he said, repeating that the peninsula was Ukrainian territory. US President Donald Trump said on the social platform Truth Social that the Ukrainian president's statement was damaging for peace negotiations with Russia. He said that if Ukraine wanted Crimea, ""why didn't they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?""

In a paper analyzing the implications of the US proposal, the US non-profit Robert Lansing Institute for Global Threats and Democracies Studies (RLI) outlines several risks and consequences of recognizing the annexation of Crimea from the perspective of international law. According to its analysis, it would mean a ""seismic shift in US foreign policy, marking a break from decades of legal principles defending territorial integrity.""

First, it says, recognizing the annexation of Crimea would be ""a strategic blow to international norms"" that would ""undermine the principle of territorial integrity enshrined in international law and weaken the post-WWII legal order."" This would ""encourage other authoritarian states, like China or Turkey, to pursue territorial revisionism.""

Secondly, it would lead to the ""alienation of allies."" Ukraine would ""see such a move as a betrayal by its most important partner [and]NATO and EU allies — especially Eastern Europeans — would likely view the shift as capitulation to Russian aggression.""

Thirdly, such a move would lead to ""internal political fallout"" and would ""provoke bipartisan backlash and raise questions about Trump's motivations, especially given ongoing concerns about his ties to Moscow.""

The RLI concluded that officially recognizing the annexation of Crimea would ""severely damage the credibility of US support for democracy and rule of law globally, especially among countries vulnerable to authoritarian pressure.""

Ukrainian political scientist Volodymyr Fesenko shared this assessment. The chair of the Penta Center for Political Studies in Kyiv told DW that Crimea was ""a red line"" and that its loss would be ""absolutely unacceptable for Ukraine."" He said that the legal recognition of its annexation would set ""an extremely dangerous precedent,"" not only for Ukraine but the whole world, given China's claims over Taiwan, for example. Fesenko speculated that the downgrading of the meeting of top diplomats in London meant that the US' proposals had been rejected.

Andras Racz from the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) did not expect a quick diplomatic breakthrough. ""It is not surprising that the Ukrainian side rejected the US proposals,"" he said, considering that Kyiv would have had to recognize the annexation of Crimea officially, and in effect, relinquish the Ukrainian territory that is currently occupied by Russia.

The question now is what course Washington will take. On April 23, US Vice President JD Vance declared that both Ukraine and Russia would have to give up territories. He said that the US had made them ""a very explicit proposal"" for a possible peace solution and it was ""time for them to either say 'yes' or for the United States to walk away from this process.""

President Donald Trump's envoy met the Russian leader in Moscow for three hours to discuss a potential settlement for the war in Ukraine. 

President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff met President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow to discuss US proposals for ending the war in Ukraine. 

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, who took part in the meeting, described it as constructive and very useful.

Meanwhile, the mayor of Kyiv has suggested that Ukraine might need to give up land to achieve a temporary peace with Russia.

Vitali Klitschko's comments came after a deadly attack on the Ukrainian capital.

These updates have been closed. Thank you for reading. 

Below, you can read a summary of developments from Russia's war in Ukraine on Friday, April 25.

US President Donald Trump has once again promised that Moscow and Kyiv were ""very close"" to a US-sponsored deal, a goal that has thus far eluded his administration since his inauguration in January.

""A good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. ""They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to 'finish it off.'""

The US president added that most of the major points had been agreed on.

Following talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff earlier in Moscow, the Kremlin said the pair discussed the possibility of ""direct"" talks between Russia and Ukraine.

Vowing to help facilitate an end to the war, Trump also wrote: ""Stop the bloodshed, NOW.""

On Thursday, Trump issued a rare rebuke for Putin, calling on him to ""STOP!"" after Russian overnight strikes on Kyiv that killed 12 people and injured 87 others.

US President Donald Trump on Friday posted a statement to his social media platform Truth Social hammering Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not yet signing a controversial mineral deal with the US, claiming, ""it is at least three weeks late.""

Trump, who has been pressuring Ukraine to grant the US access to critical rare earths for having helped Kyiv defend itself against an ongoing Russian invasion, wrote, ""Ukraine, headed by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has not signed the final papers on the very important rare earths deal with the United States.""

The statement was posted as Trump traveled to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, which will take place on Saturday.

Although both Washington and Kyiv signed a memorandum of understanding last week for a final agreement to be signed on April 26, the deal has yet to be inked.

Trump has been trying to strong arm Zelenskyy into signing the deal as repayment for past assistance as well as claiming that Ukraine's best bet for future US security assistance would be to give the US access to the highly valuable raw materials, which are absolutely key to high-tech industries.

The White House has repeatedly claimed that a deal was imminent, despite Ukraine's reservations. 

The most vivid illustration of just how touchy negotiations on the deal are came in late February when Zelenskyy was very publicly dressed down by Trump and US Vice President JD Vance during an Oval Office press conference that ended with Zelenskyy being ordered to leave for not acquiescing to US demands.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyon Friday reiterated that Crimea ""belongs"" to Ukraine, saying his ""position [remains] unchanged.""

In an interview published by Time Magazine on Friday, US President Donald Trump said, ""Crimea will stay with Russia.""

""Everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time,"" the president said. ""It's been with them long before Trump came along.""

Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met President Vladimir Putin for three hours in Moscow, trying to secure a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.

According to texts seen by the Reuters news agency, a peace proposal Witkoff presented calls for formal US recognition of Russia's control over Crimea.

But Zelenskyy said he can not decide on the future status of the peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014.

""Our position is unchanged: only the Ukrainian people have the right to decide which territories are Ukrainian. The constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories... belong to Ukraine, to the Ukrainian people,"" Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday said that important ""military meetings"" may keep him from being able to attend the funeral of Pope Francis.

""If I am not (there) in time, Ukraine will be represented at a proper level. The foreign minister and the first lady will be there. As for me, it was important for me to be here. There are several military meetings in Ukraine today.""

Earlier this week, Zelenskyy cut short a visit to South Africa as Russia launched massive attacks on his country despite US efforts to force both sides to enter a ceasefire. 

Numerous world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres are expected to attend Francis' funeral at the Vatican on Saturday. 

Two civilians have been killed and another was critically injured after a Ukrainian drone attack on a car in Russia's Belgorod region, district Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

Gladkov said the passenger car was attacked by ""an enemy drone"" on Friday and two men died on the spot before the ambulance crew arrived.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff met on Friday for a three-hour meeting where the pair discussed the possibility of ""direct"" talks between Russia and Ukraine.

""There was a three-hour conversation that was constructive and very useful,"" Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters. The ""possibility of resuming direct negotiations between representatives of the Russian Federation and Ukraine"" was discussed.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a missile fired by Russia on Kyiv on Thursday was supplied by North Korea and contained dozens of components from US firms.

""The missile that killed civilians in Kyiv contained at least 116 components sourced from other countries -- and most of them, unfortunately, were manufactured by American companies,"" Zelensky said Friday on X.

The Ukrainian leader called for more ""pressure"" and sanctions on both Moscow and Pyongyang.

""The lack of sufficient pressure on Russia allows them to import such missiles and other weapons – and to use them here, in Europe,"" he said.

""The lack of sufficient pressure on North Korea and its accomplices enables, in particular, the production of such ballistic missiles."" 

US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow, where he is meeting Vladimir Putin two weeks after his last talks with the Russian president. 

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agency Interfax that Putin was receiving Witkoff.

""Good to see you,"" Witkoff said to Putin as they met.

Ahead of the meeting with the Russian president, Witkoff met with Putin's economic cooperation envoy, Kirill Dmitriev.

Dmitriev was present for the talks between Putin and Witkoff, as was Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov.

Putin and Witkoff are expected to continue talks on a possible peace arrangement, more than three years after Russia invaded Ukraine.

It comes after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said parts of a possible deal to end the war still need to be ""fine-tuned.""

""There are still some specific points — elements — of this deal which need to be fine-tuned and we are busy with this exact process,"" Lavrov told US broadcaster CBS on Thursday evening.

""There are several signs that we are moving in the right direction,"" Lavrov said, adding that Russia is ""ready to reach a deal.""

Friday's meeting in Moscow came after a combined Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv killed at least 12 people and wounded dozens more, according to Ukrainian authorities.

Russian authorities have confirmed the death of a senior Russian officer when a parked car exploded near Moscow.

Russia's Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes said, said it had launched a murder probe.

Authorities named the victim as General-lieutenant Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy head of the main operational directorate of the military's General Staff.

The news had been reported earlier by several news outlets.

Investigators have launched a probe into murder and smuggling explosives after the Volkswagen Golf exploded outside a block of flats in the town of Balashikha in the eastern Moscow region.

Images on social media showed a fire that gutted a car.

The Agentstvo investigative news site said Moskalik lived in Balashikha, but the Volkswagen was not registered to him.

The ""blast was caused by the triggering of an improvised explosive device"" packed with fragments of metal aimed at causing maximum harm,"" investigators said.

The Kremlin's website says Moskalik was a Russian military representative at the ""Normandy format"" talks on Ukraine in 2015 as the conflict was raging between Kyiv and Russian-backed separatists.

He was made a general lieutenant by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2021.
 

Two people were killed in an attack on Friday morning on the village of Yarova in eastern Ukriane, after an overnight Russian drone strike, said prosecutors in Ukraine's Donetsk region. 

""At 05:10, enemy forces conducted two airstrikes on the village of Yarova in the Lyman [county]. As a result of a direct strike on a residential building at their place of residence, a 61-year-old man and his 88-year-old father sustained fatal injuries,"" wrote Donetsk Regional Prosecutor's Office. 

About 10 residential buildings, an outbuilding and a shop were damaged in the village, it added.

A large portion of the Donetsk region is under occupation by Russian forces.

Latvia's planned building of a defensive line along its border with Russia and Belarusis on course for completion by 2028, the country's Defense Minister Andris Spruds has said.

""The work is proceeding according to plan,"" Spruds said on Friday while visiting a storage site near the town of Zilupe, close to the frontier with Russia.

The site holds concrete blocks and tank barriers to be erected for the fortification and securing of Latvia's eastern border. 

Latvia's efforts are part of a wide one to create the Baltic defense line also protecting fellow Baltic states, Estonia and Lithuania from potential attacks from Russia and Belarus. Belarus is a major Russian ally and was used as a staging post by some of the Russian military to launch Moscow's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

""The main goal is to stop, distract and destroy a potential intruder,"" Spruds stressed. 

Additional tank trenches, ammunition depots and mine storage facilities are also to be built. 

In some sections of the roughly 440-kilometer-long (about 170-mile) border with Russia and Belarus, the construction is already complete.

Latvia's government last year decided to invest some €300 million ($340 million) in strengthening the border and building the line in line with NATO defense plans.

Latvian army chief Kaspars Pudans said the Baltic States have been guided by the lessons of the war in Ukraine in building the defensive barrier. 

Russian media sites have reported that a high-ranking Russian military officer has been killed after a car explosion in the town of Balashikha in the Moscow region.

Media outlets Mash and Baza named the officer as Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces.

Authorities gave no initial confirmation about what happened or the identity of the individual targeted.

Baza, which has sources inside Russian law enforcement, said a bomb in a parked car was detonated remotely when the officer, who lived nearby, walked past it.

Russian military launched 103 drones overnight targeting five regions, Ukraine's air force said on Friday.

The attacks caused damage in the Kharkiv and Sumy regions in the northeast, in the Dnipropetrovsk and Cherkasy regions in the center, as well as in the Donetsk region, the air force wrote on Telegram. 

Ukrainian air defense units shot down 41 drones, and 40 additional drones were redirected through electronic warfare, it added. 

Three people were killed and eight more were wounded on Friday in a Russian attack on the central-eastern city of Pavlohrad in Ukraine, said Dnipropetrovsk regional Governor Serhiy Lysak. 

""Unfortunately, there are already three dead in Pavlohrad. Among them is a child,"" Lysak said on the Telegram messaging service. 

""The aggressor again conducted a mass attack on the region with drones,"" he added. 

Several fires broke out in the city, including a multi-story building, sites of enterprises in the Synelnykivskyi and Samarivskyi districts, he said, adding that 11 drones were destroyed over the region. 

Six injured were hospitalized, and two others, including a 15-year-old girl, were treated on-site. Search and rescue operations were ongoing, Lysak added.

The industrial city of Pavlohrad had a pre-war population of approximately 100,000 people. It serves as an important railway hub for the Dnipropetrovsk region, connecting it to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said parts of a possible deal between his country and the United States to end the war in Ukraine must still be ""fine-tuned.""

However, Lavrov said the process, which has not involved Ukraine, is moving in the right direction.

""There are still some specific points — elements — of this deal which need to be fine-tuned and we are busy with this exact process,"" Lavrov told US broadcaster CBS.

""There are several signs that we are moving in the right direction,"" Lavrov said, adding that Russia is ""ready to reach a deal.""

The remarks came after a combined Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv killed at least 12 people and wounded more than 80. 

The onslaught drew rare direct criticism from US President Donald Trump, urging Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the violence.

Brendan Hanrahan — who comes with private sector experience — has replaced senior foreign service member Louis Bono as the head of the US State Department's Europe bureau.  

A business consultant and former member United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio's Senate staff has been appointed as the US State Department's top executive for Europe, the department's website showed on Friday.

Brendan Hanrahan has taken on the role of the senior bureau official for the State Department's Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs (EUR).

According to the website, Hanrahan was an investor at a private American firm and previously worked as a policy adviser for the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship under Rubio.

Hanrahan replaces Louis Bono, a senior foreign service officer who was appointed to the role when US President Donald Trump was elected in January.

Hanrahan's biography on the department website does not mention whether he has any experience working on foreign policy issues.

""Brendan brings valuable experience from the private sector and the Senate, where he served on the secretary's staff, making him well poised to lead the bureau through the reorganization and to successfully advance the Secretary's agenda throughout Europe and beyond,"" news agency Reuters — which first reported the new appointment — cited an internal email from Bono as saying.

The State Department's move comes amid Washington's shifting ties with Europe as Trump steps up pressure on allies over NATO spending, floats plans to acquire Greenland and pushes for an end to Russia's war in Ukraine.

The Trump administration is seeking a massive overhaul of the State Department in a bid to execute the president's ""America First"" policy.

Earlier in the week,Rubio announced that the department would slash its staff by 15% and eliminate over 100 bureaus and offices globally.

Donald Trump departed Rome shortly after the Pope's funeral to treat the first lady Melania to a romantic dinner on Air Force One for her 55th birthday.

The US president said he had been too busy to buy his wife a present and would instead treat her to a meal onboard the presidential plane when they return from Rome on Saturday.

The two were pictured together in St Peter's Square attending the funeral with world leaders. Mr Trump was wearing a blue suit and his wife all black with a lace veil.

Mr Trump left his wife as he attended to high-stakes Ukraine diplomacy, meeting with European allies and Volodymyr Zelensky in an extraordinary day of peace talks.

He was seen boarding his plane one hour after the Pope was buried. European leaders, meanwhile, were engaged in further peace talks in Rome.

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Mr Trump admitted that a trip to Rome for a major funeral may not be everyone's idea of the perfect way to celebrate a birthday.

“She's got a working birthday,” he told the press on the presidential jet as the couple headed off for the first foreign trip since his return to power.

The president added that as he prepares to mark the 100th day of a frenetic opening to his second term, seeking deals on tariffs, Ukraine, Iran and Gaza, there hadn't been time to shop for his wife.

“I haven't had time to buy presents, it's been pretty busy,” he said.

When asked if he would be taking Melania to dinner to mark her birthday, he replied: “I'm taking her for dinner on the Boeing; I'm taking her for dinner on Air Force One.”

Mr Trump then joked that he would send his wife back into the “lions' den” to talk to reporters herself.

The Trumps have led largely separate lives since he took office, with Melania spending most of her time in New York, where their son Barron, 19, is attending university.

But they have made a few joint appearances, including on Monday when they hosted the traditional Easter Egg Roll at the White House.

Last year the couple spent her birthday apart, with Melania in Florida while Mr Trump was in New York for a trial over payments of hush money to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.

Mr Trump said at the time: “It'd be nice to be with her, but I'm at a courthouse for a rigged trial.”

The right-wing movement wants the Supreme Court's help to alienate students from LGBTQ-inclusive books.

The right-wing movement wants the Supreme Court's help to alienate students from LGBTQ-inclusive books.

A prince vanquishes a dragon and falls in love. A young girl named Violet works up the courage to give her classmate crush a valentine. Another girl fears she won't get to see her Uncle Bobby as much after he gets married, but after spending a day with him and his fiancé, she realizes she's just gaining a new member of her family.

All of these stories are found in children's picture books, and none are particularly unusual. They touch on universal topics like bravery, friendship and family. But since the books feature LGBTQ protagonists — the prince falls in love with his knight, Violet's classmate is a girl, Uncle Bobby is gay — they're now at the center of Mahmoud v. Taylor, a Supreme Court case brought by parents who say that the books' inclusion in public schools violates their parental rights and religious freedom. If, as seems likely, the Court's conservative supermajority rules in favor of the parents, the case would notch a major win for the so-called “parental rights” movement — a pernicious right-wing crusade to undermine public education, church-state separation and children's autonomy under the guise of fighting for individual civil liberties.

Though accounts differ on its exact origins, the parental rights movement can be traced back at least to 1925, when a biology teacher came under fire for teaching evolution in violation of Tennessee law. Other experts point to when parents used their own rights as a pretext to fight against the prohibition of child labor in the 1920s. (This same argument is cropping up again in 2025 as Florida Republicans push to weaken child labor laws.) And as the Red Scare swept the U.S. and public schools began racial integration in the 1950s, the parental rights argument flared again, with conservative parents monitoring schools for “communist infiltration” or pulling their children out of the desegregated public system.

What you will notice is that none of these instances has to do with actual civil rights — they're all about enacting a particular right-wing vision for the country. The present-day parental rights movement builds upon this legacy. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced learning online in 2020, a new wave of parents began rallying under the banner of parental rights, fighting against school closures and vaccine mandates. Moms for Liberty, formed in 2021, is one of the leading instigators, muscling its far right members onto school boards and ballots.

While these groups decry government intervention on the level of public health, they simultaneously advocate for increased state control over education — banning books, cracking down on inclusive teachers and lesson plans, and pushing to undo diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Because, of course, Moms for Liberty and its allies are not fighting for the rights of parents who wish to support their children's access to gender-affirming care. Nor are they supporting parents who help their children obtain abortions. And the parental rights movement makes no mention of the rights of parents whose children are forcibly taken away from them by the state, in a family policing system that disproportionately targets low-income families and Black mothers.

Instead, the parental rights movement is focused on expanding conservative parents' control in the public sphere and suppressing the representation of any ideologies or identities with which they personally disagree. A prime example of the movement's impact is Florida's 2022 “Don't Say Gay” law, which was officially titled the Parental Rights in Education Act. The law restricted teachers from referencing sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools, but its parameters were so sweeping and vague they were partially rolled back through a 2024 settlement.

As a Vox headline noted last week, Mahmoud v. Taylor now “threatens to bring ‘Don't Say Gay' to every classroom in America.” The case stems from a lawsuit filed in 2023 against the Montgomery County Public Schools district in Maryland. The Board of Education made LGBTQ books available in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms in 2022, citing the diversity of the county's student body and the goal of promoting “equity, respect, and civility.”

Whether teachers actually incorporated the books in their lessons was left up to them; in fact, the district said in a court brief that the books were not used to teach about gender or sexuality. Rather, the texts were made available for students' own reading, classroom read-alouds and other educational activities. While Montgomery County initially offered an opt-out option for parents who wanted to exempt their children from exposure to LGBTQ books, the district removed the policy in March 2023, citing “high student absenteeism, the infeasibility of administering opt-outs across classrooms and schools, and the risk of exposing students who believe the storybooks represent them and their families to social stigma and isolation.” A group of six Christian and Muslim parents then sued to block the rule before it took effect.

The Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision by early July, but the conservative justices appeared sympathetic to the plaintiffs during oral arguments on Tuesday. Montgomery County is the most religiously diverse county in the U.S., and the parents behind the lawsuit come from several different faith backgrounds. Why, conservative justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh asked, could the school district not just reinstate its opt-out policy?

But that framing downplays what's actually at stake in Mahmoud v. Taylor. While the right may choose to amplify the issue as one of religious diversity, the allegations of indoctrination simply don't hold water. As Nelson Tebbe, a law professor at Cornell Law School, told TIME, “The long standing settlement is that religious parents don't have a right to opt out of elements of the public school curriculum that they disagree with.” If that were the case, parents could opt their children out of learning about evolution, which courts typically haven't supported. The books at issue aren't even being used to teach specific lessons; they're just representing the fact that LGBTQ students exist in the school district — which they do. “Mere exposure to ideas is not itself considered a burden on religion under these precedents,” said Tebbe. As such, sex education is currently the only area of instruction that students can be entirely exempted from in Montgomery schools.

Of course, if parents do not want their children exposed to scientific facts and fundamental realities, they do have another option: private school. There is no shortage of religious institutions to choose from. But imposing the will of a few parents on the education of thousands of schoolchildren is antithetical to the goal of public education, which, by definition, exists to serve the public — not cater to the demands of a select few.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Buffalo hotel workers are facing off with a Trump-aligned developer in their battle to unionize.

“They just look at you like you're nothing,” said a housekeeper from the Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Buffalo, New York.

Sitting with me for a conversation in her East Side apartment, the housekeeper, who requested not to be named due to fear of retaliation, spoke of slashed hours and stagnant pay, arduous and unfair workloads, and racist treatment and verbal abuse from managers so severe that it has sent her running to the bathroom in tears.

But when she spoke about the belittling gaze of her employers — the feeling that immigrant workers like herself are seen as “nothing” by the hotel's management – her words seemed to capture the deep nature of her grievances.

“They're mistreating the workers, especially the immigrants,” she told me. “They should respect the workers that are making the hotel look clean.”

These sentiments also explain why she and other Hyatt workers are taking great risk by supporting a union drive at their hotel.

“All that I'm looking for is for the union to support us,” she said, “so us working at the hotel will be respected, and they can look at us like humans.”

Over the past several months, a battle has been unfolding at the Hyatt Regency in Buffalo that pits two sides of the city against each other: its love affair with developers, who city leaders have turned to as post-industrial saviors, and its identity as a union town, filling up with non-union jobs in low-wage sectors like leisure and hospitality.

On one side of this battle is Douglas Jemal, a real estate mogul who swooped into Buffalo from Washington, D.C. a decade ago to gobble up dozens of storied commercial and residential properties across the city, including Buffalo's only skyscraper. A darling of local media and civic elites, and a big donor to city and state officials, Jemal has been awarded millions in public subsidies. He is a close friend of the Kushners, and he had a wire fraud felony conviction pardoned by Donald Trump in 2021. Jemal's imprint across Buffalo is inescapable.

On the other side are the workers at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Buffalo, a full-service convention hotel surrounded by sports stadiums and trendy restaurants. Jemal acquired the Hyatt in 2021. Last August, these workers announced a union drive to improve their working conditions and win more voice and dignity on the job, but they say they were met with a ferocious union-busting campaign that included numerous firings of pro-union workers.

Behind its “revival” narrative, Buffalo remains one of the nation's poorest cities. It's a labor stronghold, but its hotels are almost entirely non-union, even as their workers help undergird the city's so-called revitalization. While developers like Jemal enjoy big subsidies and tax payment schemes that benefit their own properties, Buffalo's city budget faces a massive $60 million deficit.

In many ways, the battle at the Hyatt is a proxy over whose interests will prevail in the new Buffalo: wealthy developers who receive lush subsidies, or workers fighting for good union jobs in industries like leisure and hospitality that prop up the city's purported renaissance.

Rumblings of a union stirred among some Hyatt workers in 2023, but the idea gained momentum during the busy summer of 2024, especially among a core of front desk workers. One of them was Luke Sills, who has worked at the hotel for nearly two years. In 2023, the Hyatt Regency Buffalo named Sills its “Employee of the Year.”

Sills is one of the rank-and-file leaders of the union drive at the Hyatt. “Every worker in the building knows how we should be doing things differently,” he told Truthout. “Having a voice to make this hotel a place that we can be proud of was a big motivator for us deciding to unionize.”

Truthout spoke with current and former Hyatt workers — front desk agents, restaurant servers, housekeepers, baristas — who described a range of grievances and a workplace marked by dysfunction and disrespect toward employees.

Workers expressed concerns around wages, understaffing, inconsistent scheduling and reduced hours. But their issues went much further.

They spoke of a rundown hotel that is not adequately maintained, leaving guests to lash out at employees. Broken ovens and espresso machines go unfixed. The carpets are old and grimy, they say. The heating and air conditioning systems run poorly.

“The rooms are just falling apart,” said Sills. “These problems with the hotel ruin the guest experience.”

Workers say the hotel is chaotic and mismanaged. Employees do work beyond their job descriptions for no extra pay to compensate for inept managers. Understaffing leaves hotel departments scrambling to get through the day.

Tiba Salvatore told Truthout that for weeks after she started working at the front desk last July, she didn't even have a manager. “Right away, I noticed the dysfunction at the Hyatt,” she said.

For many, the worst part is the disrespect and humiliation workers face, with some recounting racist slurs by managers and verbal abuse toward immigrant housekeepers who make up the hotel's largest department.

The housekeeper I spoke with in her East Side apartment described heavier workloads for non-English speakers and reductions in her hours without explanation. She says she has not seen a wage increase in years.

She also said she's often ordered to do tasks beyond her role at the Hyatt, and described one incident where she was yelled at by her supervisor after she refused.

“He was loud and aggressive toward me in front of people,” she said. “The managers are racist, and I don't have any right to express myself. All this happens to us because we're immigrants and our English is not enough.”

Left in tears after the incident, she says she can't leave the job. Like other housekeepers, she depends on the income.

“That's why, after all the humiliation, I still go.”

Multiple workers told Truthout that this kind of treatment was a key motivation for unionizing.

“There's this culture of disrespect and abuse where management treats immigrants like they're stupid,” said Sills. “I became friends with some of these people and realized how cruel it is.”

Sills was among the half-dozen workers who formed a union organizing committee affiliated with Workers United, the same union that organized the ground-breaking Starbucks union drive that originated in Buffalo.

On July 31, 2024, the organizing committee announced the union in a letter to Jemal; the hotel's general manager, Steve Jarmuz; and Craig Smith, the CEO of Aimbridge Hospitality, who operates the hotel. The letter asked Jemal and the Hyatt management to agree to Fair Election Principles safeguarding workers' rights to unionize without company interference.

“I was hoping they might listen to me as someone who clearly cares about the hotel, but who wants to have a voice to make this place better and believes that workers need to be respected,” said Sills.

The workers never received a response.

The union drive kicked into high gear. Organizing committee members knocked on doors and spoke with coworkers. Workers started wearing union buttons on the job. Signed union cards began to pile up. The union quickly gained strongholds at the front desk and lobby area and in the restaurants and the hotel's Starbucks.

Edgar O'Connell, a restaurant server, was one worker who joined up. He was upset with things like understaffing and disrespectful treatment from management. He told Truthout he hoped the union “could make a difference in the way that the hotel was run” and wanted “respect for us workers as the people who are making the hotel run.”

The union estimates they had around 70 percent support among customer-facing “front of house” workers across the hotel when they filed for a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election in early September 2024. They hoped that winning a union for “front of house” workers would provide the foundation for organizing the hotel wall-to-wall, especially the several dozen housekeepers.

However, right after workers announced the union, they say, the union busting began.

Multiple workers say the Hyatt management launched a multi-pronged offensive to smash the union drive, firing pro-union workers and creating a climate of fear around the union.

Two days after the organizing committee sent its letter, Sills was pulled into a meeting with the hotel's top management and grilled with questions about the union.

“They were trying to talk me out of it,” said Sills. “The tone was very much intimidation and veiled threats.”

Other workers told Truthout of similar meetings. They say out-of-state consultants held captive audience meetings with workers where they stoked fear and misinformation about the union. Workers say management was monitoring them with security cameras and scouring their social media accounts.

Pro-union workers started getting fired or pushed out. The hotel's Starbucks, one of the strongest pro-union departments, was a main target.

Garion Lopez, a barista who was part of the organizing committee, told Truthout that Starbucks workers were interrogated and accused of theft. The common practice of occasionally giving friends free drinks was suddenly being treated as a fireable offense. Several baristas were suspended and fired, while others left under the pressure.

“It felt like a witch hunt,” said Lopez.

Sills said that “every single person they fired had signed a union card.”

One Hyatt worker shared a company flyer with Truthout that was posted in the breakroom implying that the union was a threat to workers' legal rights and privacy.

According to labor expert John Logan, this is “a really standard anti-union flyer” whose variations have been used in anti-union campaigns for decades.

“The intention is to give the impression that unions are invading the privacy of workers, even though the reason that unions conduct home visits is that employers deny them access to the workplace and make it as difficult as possible for them to communicate with workers,” Logan told Truthout.

“Generally speaking,” Logan added, “employers are the ones who bombard workers with anti-union texts and emails with messages like this one and force them to attend anti-union meetings.”

Workers say the most chilling effect of the Hyatt's anti-union campaign was on housekeepers. Many are immigrants who face language barriers and whose families depend on their jobs at the Hyatt. They cannot easily find new work.

“They were telling them the union would cut wages” and that it's “there because it wants your money,” said one housekeeper. “They traumatized us.”

Housekeepers saw pro-union workers being fired and pushed out. “All those people were very scared to lose their jobs,” said Salvatore.

On October 9, the union held a press conference in front of the Hyatt where Sills referred to management's anti-union offensive as a “terror campaign.”

“It's been really shocking and a bit horrifying to see the ways that they responded to our campaign so far,” he told reporters.

The Hyatt's anti-union blitz took a heavy toll on the union drive. Workers estimate that, after several weeks, front-of-house support for the union fell from 70 percent to around 50 percent.

Sills says the hotel's brazen firings “showed everybody that they were willing to break the law to bust the union.” Under these circumstances, Workers United made the tough call to temporarily pull the NLRB election in early November.

Meanwhile, the union filed nearly three dozen Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges with the NLRB during October alleging a slew of illegal acts of intimidation and retaliation against workers. These charges range from “unlawfully interrogating an employee by asking them if they signed a union authorization card” to “telling employees that their pay and benefits were ‘frozen' because of the union campaign.”

One ULP charge stated that the employer engaged in “threatening employees that the hotel may have to close if the employees unionize,” an allegation that multiple workers mentioned to Truthout.

Truthout reached out to Jemal to ask about this allegation around closing the hotel but received no response. Truthout also reached out to Jemal, Hyatt Regency Buffalo General Manager Steve Jarmuz, and Aimbridge Hospitality for comment on worker grievances and anti-union allegations discussed in this article, but received no responses.

The union also requested a remedial bargaining order that would compel the Hyatt to recognize and bargain with the union, alleging that a fair and free election is no longer possible because of the company's anti-union behavior.

Not the industrial powerhouse it once was, Buffalo remains a labor stronghold. Union halls dot the city landscape. Any local political candidate covets the labor vote. Nearly a quarter of workers in the area have union jobs.

But not Buffalo's hotel workers.

“Buffalo is a union town, except for hotels,” Gary Bonadonna Jr., the regional head of Workers United, told Truthout.

At workplaces like the Hyatt, Buffalo's identity as a union town is clashing head-on with its commitment to developers like Douglas Jemal, who receives millions in public subsidies while, workers say, his managers at the hotel feverishly fight a union drive.

Bonadonna Jr. sent a letter to Jemal, shared with Truthout, demanding a fair union election at the Hyatt and the reinstatement of fired workers. He never received a response.

“We support developers who take an interest in Buffalo and want to invest in the city,” said Bonadonna Jr. “But it can't be at the expense of the workers.”

The union is hoping that pressure from the labor movement and the wider Buffalo community will convince the Hyatt, which hosts many large gatherings, to respect their workers' right to unionize.

Recently, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which has held events at the hotel, sent the Buffalo Hyatt a letter, viewed by Truthout, supporting the workers' right to unionize. Ed Braukus, international representative for IBEW 3rd District, told Truthout that the Hyatt is “pretty much off the list” for future IBEW meetings in Buffalo right now. “We're not going to patronize a place that's actively violating workers' rights to organize,” he said.

“We're not calling for a boycott now,” Bonadonna Jr. told Truthout, “but I think eventually customers can decide to support this business or not after learning what happened to the workers who tried to organize.”

Jemal and Douglas Development are not done with hotels in Buffalo. He was recently awarded $12.5 million in state subsidies to redevelop the historic downtown Statler building, which will include 200 hotel rooms.

Jemal has also negotiated a scheme that directs his tax payments toward his own properties rather than the city's general fund. All this comes as Buffalo faces a huge $60 million budget deficit.

“Jemal is using the developer toolkit of making agreements that keep his money out of the general fund and focus his tax contributions around his own developments,” Andrea Ó Súilleabháin, executive director of the Partnership for the Public Good, a community-based think tank in the Buffalo-Niagara region, told Truthout.

“That's problematic in a city like Buffalo, where we have a revenue crisis, which means many of our neighborhoods get neglected,” she added.

Ó Súilleabháin wants to see stronger criteria around union rights from state and county agencies that issue subsidies to developers. “If you're taking public money, you have to be recognizing unions across all of your projects,” she said.

She adds that tackling Buffalo's chronic poverty depends on creating good union jobs at workplaces like hotels. “The only way to counter Buffalo's long-term high poverty rate is to improve jobs in sectors like leisure and hospitality and drive their wages and benefits up,” she said.

“And of course,” she adds, “the right to unionize is central to that.”

Truthout reached out to local elected officials for comment about the allegations surrounding the Hyatt and asking if they felt subsidies to Jemal should be contingent on workers' rights to organize being respected across his properties.

None of Buffalo's Common Council members responded, nor did Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz. Over the past several years, Buffalo's city government and the Erie County Industrial Development Agency — where the Mayor of Buffalo, President of the Buffalo Common Council and Erie County Executive all have seats on the board of directors — have supported PILOT deals and subsidies for Jemal.

According to campaign finance records, Poloncarz has reported receiving $28,000 from Jemal since 2019, while Common Council Majority Leader Leah Halton-Pope received $2,500 in 2023 and Council Member Joel Feroleto received $1,000 since 2022.

Truthout additionally reached out to Buffalo Mayor Christopher Scanlon for comment but received no response. Scanlon is also a candidate in Buffalo's mayoral Democratic primary race this year, and Truthout reached out to three other candidates, State Senator Sean Ryan, Common Council member Rasheed Wyatt and former Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield, for comment.

Only Ryan responded, calling the allegations against the Hyatt “serious and concerning,” and said he's “long supported attaching basic labor standards as a condition of receiving public subsidies, a commonsense safeguard against anti-union tactics like those being alleged.” 

“The ability to organize is a fundamental right and taxpayer dollars should not be used to support anyone attempting to deprive their workers of that right,” Ryan added.

Jemal, a big donor to former Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, has not contributed to mayoral candidates so far this election, according to the most recent campaign disclosures. Other major Buffalo developers have donated heavily to Scanlon, who also held a December 2024 fundraiser at Jemal's Seneca One building. In May 2023, Ryan's State Senate campaign reported a $950 in-kind contribution from Jemal's Richardson, a rental fee waiver for a fundraiser.

A Buffalo with a unionized hotel sector would be no outlier among pro-labor Democratic cities. According to government statistics, the median full-time pay of hospitality workers who are union members is nearly 27 percent higher than non-union workers.

“Buffalo should be a place where there are many unionized hotel workers,” Bonadonna Jr. says.

Meanwhile, Hyatt workers are keeping the fight going. The union is planning actions in Buffalo for the spring, and it has been meeting with community and political leaders. They're asking the community to not give money to corporations and developers who retaliate against their workers for organizing.

The union is also waiting on the NLRB decisions around the ULPs and remedial bargaining order, though expectations are hedged given Trump's anti-union changes to the NLRB.

“We're hoping for a good outcome, but we can't place too much faith in the NLRB this day and age,” said Richard Bensinger, the former organizing director of the AFL-CIO who is helping with the Hyatt campaign. “Labor law under Biden was weak at best, but certainly under Trump we can't treat NLRB decisions as the yardstick by which to measure antiunion behavior.”

Sills is grateful that the Hyatt named him employee of the year. But he'd be even happier, he says, if the hotel respected his and his fellow workers' right to unionize.

“Having a voice sounds like this really abstract thing,” he says. “But workers have so many good ideas about how to make things better. If we just had a chance to sit across the table from Jemal and put these ideas into a contract, it would make the hotel a better place for everyone.”

The housekeeper Truthout spoke with in her East Side apartment says, more than anything, she wants workers to have more respect at work.

“A person should recognize that you're human,” she said. “He shouldn't look at you like you're disposable, like you're an animal because you're an immigrant.”

She says other housekeepers who were scared to support the union, but who continue to feel mistreated, are now asking about it.

“They're starting to see the importance of the union,” she said.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

The Trump administration filed a lawsuit on April 24 alleging that the city of Rochester, New York, had violated the Constitution and federal law through multiple policies barring cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

In a statement posted to the city's website, they said that “the City fully intends to defend the legality of its policies, and to use this opportunity to hold the federal government to task and ensure that it does not commandeer local resources in violation of the Constitution's Tenth Amendment.”

The Tenth Amendment generally reserves certain powers for states and says the “powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

The Trump administration has accused the city of violating the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says states are bound by federal law. It pointed to a city council resolution and two policies from the Rochester police department restricting cooperation, including information sharing, with federal authorities.

Those policies, the lawsuit said, “violate the Supremacy Clause, interfere with federal law, and create obstacles to the enforcement of federal immigration law.” It pointed to federal law prohibiting restrictions on information sharing about an individual's immigration status.

The Justice Department is asking for a federal judge to declare Rochester's policies unconstitutional, as well as contrary to federal law and therefore invalid.

Like Evans, Orrick cited the Tenth Amendment and stated that freezing federal funding imposed “coercive condition intended to commandeer local officials into enforcing federal immigration practices and law.”

The Rochester lawsuit is the latest move by the Trump administration, which seeks to increase immigration enforcement.

The Justice Department's lawsuit said that the country's efforts to face a “crisis of illegal immigration” were “hindered by Sanctuary Cities such as the City of Rochester, who refuse to cooperate or share information, even when requested, with federal immigration authorities.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a brief one-on-one discussion inside St. Peter's Basilica on April 26 before convening with other leaders to attend Pope Francis's funeral.

The conversation took place before the funeral Mass began, at a point in the morning when the Vatican's vast basilica was shut to allow world leaders and diplomats to visit the pontiff's closed coffin and pay their respects.

Pictures showing Trump and Zelenskyy seated in a corner as if they just pulled up a couple of chairs, hunched over deep in discussion, were shared across social media.

This was the first face-to-face encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy since their heated meeting in the Oval Office in February that ended with Zelenskyy being asked to leave.

Many of those who shared it commented on the significance of their meeting place, including Trump's National Security Advisor, Michael Waltz, who said, “Nothing like some tough diplomacy in one of the most beautiful places in the world.”

The White House later confirmed that the sitdown took place.

“President Trump and President Zelenskyy met privately today and had a very productive discussion,” Steven Cheung, White House communications director, told reporters. “More details about the meeting will follow.”

No further discussion was had after the funeral. Trump and first lady Melania Trump quickly returned to Air Force One afterward to fly back to the United States.

Zelenskyy thanked Trump and said it was a good meeting.

This meeting came less than 24 hours after Trump announced he had “a good day in talks and meetings” with Ukraine and Russia.

“They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off.' Most of the major points are agreed to,” the president wrote on Truth Social. ”Stop the bloodshed, now. We will be wherever is necessary to help facilitate the end to this cruel and senseless war!”

In a follow-up post to his social media platform, Trump reiterated his stance that President Barack Obama was responsible for allowing Crimea to fall into Russian hands, and that the ongoing conflict belongs to President Joe Biden.

However, he expressed doubt that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not want peace after all and could face more U.S. sanctions for the war to end.

Putin expressed his condolences and praised Pope Francis for his “dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches as well as constructive cooperation between Russia and the Holy See.” However, the Kremlin announced on April 22 that he would not attend the funeral.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Editor's note: This story contains quotes of abusive language toward Katherine Legge that were released to CNN by her team.



            British racing driver Katherine Legge told CNN Sports that she has been inundated with thousands of hateful messages, death threats, vulgar and inappropriate comments across multiple social media platforms since she entered NASCAR in March.



            One direct message on X said that she should hang herself, the same account adding in a separate, public, post, “You need to be assassinated.” Another advised her to “swallow a shotgun.”
    


            Initially, she wanted to ignore her trolls and deny them the oxygen of publicity, but after a difficult weekend on the track at Rockingham she decided to speak out.
    


            Speaking exclusively to CNN about the abuse, Legge says that while she welcomes fan engagement online, the amount of vitriol is only getting worse.
    


            “Online bullying is getting more toxic, and I think that somebody needs to call it out,” she said. “It's shocking to read some of the vile things that people write, there just seems to be this whole online movement where people think that it's OK to say these things that they would never have the courage to say to people in real life; or absolutely shouldn't.”
    


            Female athletes have recently spoken out about the threats they have received online. At the conclusion of her college career, the basketball star Angel Reese said tearfully, “I've been through so much, I've seen so much. I've been attacked so many times. Death threats, I've been sexualized, I've been threatened.” WNBA star Breanna Stewart said that police were investigating homophobic death threats that had been sent to her wife and the French tennis player Caroline Garcia reported comments on X that told her to consider suicide and, “I hope your mom dies soon.”
    


            Legge has observed the abuse that athletes endure in other sports, and even some of the invective that is aimed at male drivers in NASCAR. However, she is currently the only female driver on the circuit, and she suspects that as a result, her treatment is worse.
    


            “I think it's more prevalent with women in sports, especially with women in male dominated sports, because we stick out more, you know? There is the opinion that we are a gimmick, or we shouldn't be there because we're DEI hires and we haven't earned our spot,” she told CNN.
    


            CNN has seen many of the X posts in which Legge has been targeted for abuse online, ranging from “Please get the f**k out of NASCAR” and “I hope you wreck every car you drive in” to sickening vulgarities that are too offensive to print. Her team say that many more toxic messages have been posted on YouTube and Facebook. It's a sad fact of modern-day life that Legge has become numb to it.
    


            “It's just noise,” she explained. “I have a thick skin. It's not worth my time or energy. I can honestly say it doesn't phase me one way or the other, because they are people who I would not ask an opinion of. The people I respect, team members, my bosses, my partners, my family, my friends, and those who have been there and done it, are the voices that I listen to.”
    


            She added, “It's just mind-blowing to me because I would never do it. I would ever go online and try and bring somebody else down to raise myself up and so I feel sorry for them, I guess, is the best way of putting it.”
    


            Legge says she doesn't think that any of the death threats would seriously be carried out, but NASCAR is providing a security detail for her upcoming races and the sport's head of security has alerted law enforcement in her hometown of the situation.
    


            Speaking to CNN, NASCAR Commissioner Steve Phelps described the posts as incredibly upsetting.
    


            “I want to be crystal clear about this, we condemn this behavior. It is unacceptable, this is not appropriate for NASCAR, sports, or the world,” he said.
    


            Phelps also defended Legge against any of her critics who thinks she is somehow undeserving of her place on the track.
    


            “This is a woman who has competed very successfully in all forms of motorsports and we want her here at NASCAR. They can take their opinions and their hate right out of NASCAR, because there's just no place for it,” he said.
    


            Legge's two races so far this season have resulted in DNFs (did not finish,) one of which she takes personal responsibility for. At the age of 44, she's a highly experienced driver, competing in IndyCar, Open Wheel, electric cars and sports cars.
    


            “You name it, I've driven it,” she told CNN earlier this year – but she admits she is relatively inexperienced in NASCAR.
    


            She's been contracted for 11 more races in the Xfinity and Cup series, driving for the Chevrolet-backed teams Jordan Anderson and Live Fast.
    


            “I'm having a great time on these awesome tracks, driving these beasts,” she said with a smile. “I'm hoping to get some results towards the end of the year. All I can do is keep improving and, if they have the capacity, they will change their opinions, and it will die down a little bit. But time will tell.”
    


            Beyond hoping that being a more successful competitor will dampen the online abuse, Legge said the only way to truly extinguish it in society is to make it socially unacceptable.
    


            “The reasonable people in the population think that it's unacceptable, right? It's bullying. It's something that you're taught as a child isn't cool,” she said.
    


            “I didn't set out to be a role model,” she added. “I just set out be a racing driver and with that comes a responsibility.”
    


Events beyond her control have now forced her to further embrace that responsibility, and she hopes her example will inspire others to speak up or, at the very least, learn how to cope with being bullied.
    


            “I tried to be the best role model that I could be for like, a nine-year-old Katherine, act as a beacon of light and maybe somebody being bullied somewhere, even if it's just one person, if they see this and they think, ‘OK, I'm gonna ignore it,' then it's been worth it,” she said.

            Russia's war on Ukraine may be entering a pivotal moment.
    


            President Donald Trump, who CNN reported Friday has been surprised and frustrated at the difficulty of achieving his promise of ending the war, wants Ukraine to give up territory in exchange for peace and essentially cede control of Crimea, the peninsula Russia first invaded in 2014.
    


            Russia controls nearly 20% of Ukraine, much of which could be lost under the current US proposal.
    


            The US is considering recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, even though its seizure was against international law.
    


            All Russian President Vladimir Putin has to do, in Trump's thinking, is stop fighting, leaving Putin richly rewarded for invading Ukraine if he is able to officially keep so much territory. If Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky won't budge, the US has threatened to withdraw support for Ukraine.
    


            Trump's top emissary, Steve Witkoff, met in person with Putin Friday in Moscow.
    


            Ukrainians have been in talks with Americans and Europeans in London, pursuing their version of a plan, in which a ceasefire would come before any discussion of ceding territory.
    


            Trump and Zelensky will both be at the Pope's funeral in Rome over the weekend.
    


            Whether there will be a breakthrough for peace, the entire two-tracked process blows up, or inertia sets in and the war continues could become clear in the coming days.
    


            Meanwhile, hostilities continue. A Russian general was killed in a car bomb near Moscow Friday. Russian strikes are still targeting Ukraine's cities, despite Trump's admonition to Putin on social media, “Vladimir STOP.”
    


            Trump thinks so.
    


            “Crimea will stay with Russia,” he told Time on April 22. “And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time,” Trump said.
    


            Russia first invaded Crimea in 2014 but despite moral outrage and sanctions, it did not face other consequences like it did later when it tried to invade the rest of Ukraine in 2022. Trump's proposal for a cease fire seems to start with the idea that Crimea will be controlled by Russia.
    


            Zelensky has publicly rejected the idea of ceding Crimea.
    


            But other key Ukrainians seem to be open to the idea. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former champion boxer, told the BBC he is not involved in negotiations but that giving up Crimea might be necessary.
    


            “It's not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary,” Klitschko said.
    


Washington Post columnist David Ignatius argues that if the two sides can get past the Crimea issue, other details could be worked out, including whether European troops will backstop Ukraine's security, and whether the US will have a presence, perhaps securing and running a nuclear power plant.
    


            CNN's Nick Paton Walsh isn't so sure, in large part because it's not at all clear what Trump wants from Putin and whether Putin will give anything up. He writes:
    


The overriding problem is Putin thinks time is on his side and Trump has repeatedly said the clock is ticking. These two contrasting positions will not yield a lasting deal. The Kremlin has perhaps wisely ascertained it can, over months, hive off tiny concessions from the White House, and slowly build a geopolitical picture that is more in its favour. Consider the first 90 days of Trump's presidency and how far the world has already changed in Moscow's favour.



            Russia violated international law by invading Crimea, as CNN's Ivana Kottosová writes. Zelensky has so far rejected the idea of ceding Crimea, noting that to do so would violate Ukraine's Constitution.
    


            If the US were to recognize Crimea as Russian, it would break America's word multiple times over.
    


            From Kottosová's report:
    


Recognizing Crimea as part of Russia would put the Trump administration in breach of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which the US made a commitment to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and borders, in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear weapons.



In 2018, during the first Trump administration, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement reaffirming the US' refusal to recognize the Kremlin's claims of sovereignty over Crimea.



            “That means that he has basically upended the international order,” retired Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst, said on CNN Friday. “In essence, what he's done is created a situation where we go back to the 19th century, where might makes right, and that is what he wants,” Leighton said, comparing Putin's actions to the invasion by Nazi Germany of Czechoslovakia in the 1930s.
    


            Ukrainians feel Crimea has been part of their country since the fall of the Soviet Union. In the decade-plus since Russia seized it Putin has worked to “Russify” Crimea. There are also resource considerations since Crimea and other contested portions of Ukraine are rich in oil, natural gas and other resources. Finally, Crimea sits on the Black Sea and offers important strategic advantages to Russia.
    


            “What ‘walk away' means is still a question that no one has really clear insight to,” according to Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and former US Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia.
    


            “Does it just mean that the United States will no longer be engaged in the diplomatic process in trying to end the war? Or does it mean that the United States will actually pack up and go home entirely, including ending any remaining military aid?” she told CNN's Bianna Golodryga on CNN Max.
    


            Ukraine does rely on US support, particularly for air defenses and for intelligence. But it has also built up its own resources and leans on Europe.
    


            “Ukrainians will not stop fighting if the United States packs up its bags and walks away,” Kendall-Taylor said.
    


            It's Ukrainian drones that are causing most of the casualties on Russian soldiers at this point, she said. Ukrainians are also producing longer-range drones that can strike within Russia, which means Ukraine may prefer to play for time to “convince Putin that he can't stay in this conflict indefinitely.”
    


            “Not a lot,” according to Kendall-Taylor. “And that's exactly why we've seen such intransigence on his part in making any progress towards the war.”
    


            “It's really in his interest to continue with the foot dragging, to try to demonstrate that they (Russia) are playing along so that they can preserve the US-Russia relationship,” she said.
    


            “(Putin's) preferred outcome would be to preserve that relationship and get the United States to abandon Ukraine,” she said.
    


            Michael Kimmage, a former State Department specialist on Russia and Ukraine who now directs the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center told me that it already seems unlikely the US Congress will approve more spending to help Ukraine and that Europe, particularly Germany, is moving to step into that void.
    


            “This is profound,” he said of Germany's pivot to prioritize security in its spending.
    


            “In a way, Trump is radicalizing German foreign policy, and there's a need to go as fast as possible in the direction of independence (from the US), he said.
    


            “If Germany is going to spend a trillion dollars on defense in the next couple of years, a lot of that is going to go to go to Ukraine, or it's going to be a backstop to supporting Ukraine.”
    


            But that's a pivot that will take time.
    


            “It's not as if the Germany can fill in on the in the short term for the United States, but it can balance out the erratic and basically anti-Ukraine nature of the Trump presidency,” he said.

    Editor's Note: “My Happy Place,” a CNN Original Series following celebrities on deeply personal journeys, airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT. CNN also tapped anchors and correspondents to share their happy places. CNN's Boris Sanchez finds happiness scuba diving in Key Largo, Florida.



            People wandering down to spend a little time in the Florida Keys often end up staying much, much longer.
    


            “Thirty-one years ago, I came here on vacation,” said Eric Johnson, a tour guide on tiny Pigeon Key.
    


            Johnson met a guy in Miami on a Thursday who said he could come sleep on his couch in Marathon. “On Saturday morning, I was here.” He left for the winter, came back in the spring and has lived in the Keys ever since.
    


            He's far from the only local who's dropped in for a visit and ended up staying for decades.
    


            With views of Florida Bay on one side and the Atlantic on the other, the allure of this island chain is easy to see as you drive south into the Keys. But it's the Overseas Highway itself — the 113-mile-long engineering marvel under your tires with the ghost of a railway whispering below — that's allowed motorists to answer the call of the Keys for nearly a century.
    


            This is no blank-slate stretch of asphalt — the route, leapfrogging from one key to the next over 42 bridges, has seen tragedy and more than its share of colorful characters. Along this part of US 1 from mainland Florida to Key West, you'll find relics of a historic railroad and plenty of ways to make the most of the aquamarine water all around you.
    


            Driving straight from Miami to Key West can take about four hours if things go smoothly. But if you're beelining down to Mile Marker 0, you'll be missing out.
    


            “I think people are learning more about the joy of the other Keys,” said Will Keizer, a captain at Captain Hook's Marina and Dive Center, which has three locations in the Keys. “If you want bar-to-bar-to-bar busy, Key West is your jam — no doubt about it,” said Keizer, who's originally from Michigan and has lived in the Florida Keys for about eight years.
    


            But “if you want to slow down, take in the sights,” he says, it's time to explore beyond Key West. Here are some stops along the way.
    


            Key Largo — the largest of the Keys and the first destination along the route — immediately delivers the underwater riches that bring divers here in droves.
    


            For wreck divers, the 510-foot Navy dock landing ship USS Spiegel Grove now serves as an artificial reef six miles offshore. Local dive shops run trips to the wreck, where sea turtles mingle with coral, sponges and cascades of colorful fish. (And for seafood lovers, the pink-orange hogfish fries up nicely at The Fish House).
    


            Also on Key Largo at Mile Marker 103, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park — the first undersea park in the US — offers snorkeling and scuba trips and glass-bottom boat tours.
    


            Down the road another 11 miles in Tavernier, the Blond Giraffe bakes up several delicious variations of the famous key lime pie, made from the zesty little limes that were once grown here commercially.



            Drive on and you'll soon find yourself in Islamorada, a community stretching across five inhabited islands.
    


            Just east of US 1, near Mile Marker 82, a monument to the victims of the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane serves as a reminder of the tragedy that cost hundreds of lives and spurred the creation of the new highway.
    


            Among the more than 400 dead were hundreds of World War I veterans who were working on a section of the Overseas Highway. Extensive damage from the hurricane put an end to a railroad dating back to 1912, the first direct, over-island route to Key West.
    


            “The state wound up taking over the railroad right of way and essentially made that rail line … a new version of the highway,” said Corey Malcom, lead historian at the Florida Keys History Center in Key West. “And that opened in 1938 and was connected by bridges. And people could then, from 1938 on, drive straight through from the mainland all the way to Key West.”
    


            While the Keys' railroad chapter has long-since closed, reminders of the ambitious project are visible along the route, and its stories are told in exhibits throughout the islands.
    


            The Over-Sea Railroad was part of the Florida East Coast Railway, owned by Standard Oil partner Henry Flagler. The extension to Key West — inspired by plans for the Panama Canal and its trade possibilities — was dubbed “Flagler's folly” by skeptics, but the first train reached Key West on January 22, 1912.
    


            After the 1935 hurricane hastened the railway's demise, the railroad bed was used for the new road and some of the railroad bridges were converted for cars — narrow, white-knuckle affairs that live on in memories, in ruins and in a span that's recently been revived as a pedestrian and biking path.
    


            Continuing south along US 1 in Islamorada, you can't miss Robbie's on Lower Matecumbe Key  —  a one-stop compound  for kitschy souvenirs, sport-fishing charters, cold drinks, hot meals and a tarpon feeding frenzy. For $2.50 you can access the dock and another $5 buys a bucket of fish to feed the tarpon. (For a quieter feeding atmosphere, Bud N' Mary's, a couple miles before you hit Robbie's, doesn't charge admission to its dock.)
    


            Some daredevils will let tarpon, which can grow up to 8 feet long, gulp their hands to the wrist for a great video moment, but Robbie's visitors on a relatively quiet day in March were dangling fish through holes in a net, seemingly reluctant to participate in any unnerving limb gulping.
    


            Also in the menagerie was a manatee named Samantha and an aggressive flock of pelicans poised to snatch fish not promptly gobbled up by the tarpon. And policing the dock with a padded stick to maintain order was Ron Hauter, a Robbie's employee whose right hand showed signs of tangling with the critters.
    


            At the time, Hauter, who had just moved down from Crystal River, Florida, was two weeks into his dream of living in the Keys.
    


            Florida native Carl Hiaasen, a novelist and former Miami Herald reporter and columnist, had the same dream growing up in Broward County and lived it for about nine years before he sold his house on Lower Matecumbe Key. But the island chain has served as the backdrop for some of his satirical crime novels, including “Bad Monkey,” which recently became an Apple TV+ series starring Vince Vaughn.
    


            “I've set several novels in the Keys because I still find it an intriguing place, not just for the natural beauty, but for the people — the characters — it's attracting … You have an outlaw component, who's drawn to the Keys, and you have dreamers, and you have families, and you have retirees and … just retired scoundrels,” Hiaasen said.
    


            Traffic snarls are one reason why Hiaasen ultimately returned to eastern Florida. The Upper Keys can be “a parking lot on the weekends,” he said.
    


            But for each resident who gets fed up with some of the hassles of Keys life, there's someone like Ron Hauter ready to give it a shot.
    


            “Everything here is beautiful,” Hauter, 20, said enthusiastically. “The wildlife is so active — and aggressive. Everything is so aggressive in the Keys — I love it.”
    


            Regular traffic can be fierce along Route 1 — and when there's a wreck? Well, with essentially one road in and one road out, it's good to have some flexibility.
    


            Case in point: A Monday afternoon accident on the Seven Mile Bridge — the longest and most impressive modern span in the Florida Keys — snarled traffic for hours in early March.
    


            Fortunately, the Turtle Hospital, at Mile Marker 48.5, required less than a mile of backtracking, and a planned overnight in Marathon allowed for leisurely waterfront dining instead of hauling down to Key West, feeling hours behind schedule.
    


            The Turtle Hospital rescues, rehabilitates and, in many cases, releases sea turtles brought in because of boat strikes, disease and other hurdles encountered by the five species found in local waters.
    


            The 90-minute guided visit involves turtle education, a look at the medical facility and an outdoor tour to see (but not touch) turtles awaiting release as well as others deemed too vulnerable to live in the wild.
    


            Marathon, a community of 13 islands, also offers casual waterside dining where marine wildlife adds to the ambiance.
    


Castaway features a sushi roll with lionfish — the restaurant's effort to help rid the Keys of the invasive species. And the manatees jostling in the canal for a sip of cool water dripping from an air-conditioning system keep diners very much in touch with the aquatic environment.
    


            Over on the Gulf side of Marathon, Keys Fisheries offers order-at-the-window seafood, a full bar and waterfront seating with sunset views and glimpses of the sharks, tarpon and pelicans that patrol the marina.
    


            Down the highway, near Mile Marker 47, the old Seven Mile Bridge — nicknamed “Old Seven” — is a prime place to get out and explore on foot.
    


            A 2.2-mile section of the old railway bridge, which was converted for highway traffic in the ‘30s and used until a new bridge was completed in 1982, reopened in 2022 to pedestrians and cyclists.
    


            At the end of the repurposed section, you can access Pigeon Key, a tiny island where hundreds of railway construction workers lived from 1908 to 1912. Admission is $15 for adults arriving on their own via Old Seven or $28 for those who opt to ride a tourist train from a parking lot a few miles back.
    


            Admission includes a guided tour, and you can picnic, snorkel and fish while you're on the island.
    


            The railway construction workers toiled six days a week, 70 to 80 hours per week for $1.50 per day, according to guide Eric Johnson. There's a small museum dedicated to their work on the island and several original buildings.
    


            Walking back on the paved pedestrian stretch, with traffic zipping along the wider Seven Mile Bridge nearby, you can see the eras of this route's history. When the railway was first converted into a highway, the tracks were removed and a 22-foot sheet of steel was laid down and paved. The old train tracks became railings on either side.
    


            The narrow highway eventually earned the nickname “Highway of Mirrors,” according to Pigeon Key history, because cars passed so close to one another that their side mirrors were knocked off, littering the road.
    


            Back in the car, after crossing over the newer — technically 6.79-mile — Seven Mile Bridge, history buffs will find another impressive railroad ruin: the old steel truss Bahia Honda Bridge.
    


            Today, the area around the bridge at Mile Marker 37 is part of Bahia Honda State Park, where a trail follows the route that was once US 1 up onto the old bridge, where you can walk on one section.
    


Snorkeling trips run from the park out to Looe Key, a protected reef about 9 miles southwest of the park. Captain Hook's also runs expeditions to Looe Key.
    


            At Looe, an hour spent floating above colorful parrotfish, angelfish and barracuda brings time to a near-standstill. Bobbing on the ocean's surface, the value becomes clear of slowing down, breathing deeply and soaking up the pleasures of the other Keys.
    


            Some 30 miles down the highway, Key West awaits — with its rollicking bars, rooster soundtrack, Jimmy Buffett lore and historic sites tied to Harry S. Truman and Ernest Hemingway. But you should resist the urge to race to Key West straight from the airport in Miami or Fort Lauderdale, says Cori Convertito, a curator and historian at the Key West Art & Historical Society.
    


            “You're going to get to Key West,” she said. “Hopefully Key West isn't going anywhere anytime soon — so take your time.”
    


            Delight in the journey.

Follow:


            Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week's worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer's World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., amid a shift in priorities and the ousting of leadership at one of the nation's premier cultural institutions.
    


            Multiple artists and producers involved in the center's Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. And in the wake of the cancellations, Washington's Capital Pride Alliance has disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center.
    


            “We are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,” said June Crenshaw, deputy director of the alliance. “We are finding another path to the celebration … but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.”
    


            The Kennedy Center's website still lists Tapestry of Pride on its website with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. There are no other details.
    


            The Kennedy Center did not respond to a request from the AP for comment.
    


            The move comes on the heels of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, with President Donald Trump firing both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who then elected him the new Kennedy Center chairman.

            The World Pride event, held every two years, starts in just under a month — running from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the capital city. But Trump administration policies on transgender rights and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances have sparked concern about what kind of reception attendees will receive.
    


            “I know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,” said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center abruptly canceled within days of Trump's takeover.
    


            Roest told the AP he was in the final stages of planning the Kennedy Center performance after months of emails and Zoom calls. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump posted on social media Feb. 7 of the leadership changes and his intention to transform the Kennedy Center's programming.
    


            Immediately the Kennedy Center became nonresponsive, Roest said. On Feb. 12, he said, he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer stating, “We are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.”
    


            “They went from very eager to host to nothing,” he said. “We have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that's not going to stop us.”
    


            In the wake of the cancellation, Roest said he managed to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland.
    


            Crenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be moved to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.
    


            Monica Alford, a veteran arts and culture journalist and event planner, was scheduled to organize an event June 8 as part of Tapestry of Pride, but said she also saw communication abruptly end within days of Trump's takeover.
    


            Alford has a long history with the Kennedy Center and organized the first-ever drag brunch on the Kennedy Center rooftop in 2024, and said she regarded the institution — and its recent expansion known as The Reach — as “my home base” and “a safe space for the queer community”
    


            She said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she described as “meant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.”
    


            She said she mourns the loss of the partnership she nurtured with the Kennedy Center.
    


            “We're doing our community a disservice — not just the queer community but the entire community,” she said.
    


            Roest said he never received an explanation as to why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center, and he believes most queer artists would make the same choice.
    


            “There would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,” he said. “Otherwise it is a hostile performance space.”

            One victim had recently returned home after decades working abroad to enjoy a retirement filled with travel and family time; another hoped the trip into the beauty of Indian-administered Kashmir would cheer the spirits of his semi-paralyzed wife.
    


            Both men were among 26 tourists shot dead by militants this week in a massacre that has ripped open old wounds between India and its neighbor Pakistan, tipping them a step closer to military escalation.
    


            Both countries claim Kashmir in its entirety, but each control only part. They have fought three wars over the territory – which is famous for its dramatic mountains and lush meadows – since their independence from Britain in 1947.
    


            A bloody, decades-long insurgency in India's part of the region has killed tens of thousands, waged by militant groups demanding either independence or a merger with Pakistan.
    


            India says those groups are supported by Pakistan, which Islamabad denies.
    


            Tuesday's attack – during which men were singled out and gunned down from close range, according to survivors' testimony – was the latest in a list of bloody incidents to stain the region.
    


            Balachandran Menonparambil feels as though he's lost his “right hand,” after his friend of six decades Ramachandran Narayanamenon was killed in the attack.
    


            Having spent decades working in Qatar, Narayanamenon “looked forward to a life of retirement,” according to his friend, who described him as “a happy man,” caring and reliable.
    


            “He was on a trip with his wife Shiela, daughter Aarti, and two grandchildren and was looking forward to enjoying himself with his grandchildren,” said the 70-year-old.
    


            He recalled how “excited” Narayanamenon, 69, sounded in their last call before he boarded the flight to Kashmir on Monday.
    


            A day later, Menonparambil was told that his friend was dead.
    


            “I was watching TV and they began to show what was happening in Kashmir… so I called him, but he did not pick up,” he said.
    


            He then reached out to Narayanamenon's son Arvind, who told him that “Dad is gone.”
    


            He said people came up to offer condolences to him at the cremation. “Everybody was asking me what I will do, only half of me is working now. I told them he is there with me in my heart,” he said.
    


            Other survivors speaking to local media said the gunmen accused some of the victims of supporting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
    


            In 2019, Modi's Hindu-nationalist government stripped Muslim-majority Kashmir of its previous autonomy, sparking protests.
    


            After Tuesday's massacre, New Delhi swiftly pointed the finger at Pakistan, downgrading ties and suspending its participation in a crucial water-sharing treaty. Pakistan has denied involvement and said any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to it would be considered an act of war.
    


            Kavita Lele lost her husband Sanjay, 50, and two cousins – Hemant Joshi, 45, and Atul Mone, 43 – in the attack, her brother-in-law Rajesh Kadam told CNN.
    


            All three men, described as “loving fathers” and family breadwinners, came from just outside the megacity of Mumbai. They had taken the trip to Pahalgam together, according to Kadam.
    


            Sanjay and Hemant were both accountants working for small private firms, while Atul worked for the Indian Railways, he said.
    


            For the Leles, Kadam said, the trip was long planned. His sister-in-law suffers from a form of paralysis on the left side of her body that means she walks with difficulty.

            “They had been planning this trip for a while but because of her health issues… it had gotten postponed. Once her health was doing better, they finally all lined up their schedules and managed to go,” he said.
    


            “Lele told his wife that if you won't go, none of us will go. So she agreed and finally they all went,” said Kadam.
    


            Kadam himself did not go on the trip, but later traveled to Kashmir to help bring the shell-shocked survivors from his family back home.
    


            The holidaying family bought food from a stall not long before the attack. Unaccustomed to the realities of the restive region, they initially mistook the sound of gunfire for fireworks, Kadam said, but were warned to take shelter by locals who sensed danger.

Emily Kramer-Golinkoff can't get enough oxygen with each breath. Advanced cystic fibrosis makes even simple things like walking or showering arduous and exhausting.

She has the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S., which afflicts 40,000 Americans. But her case is caused by a rare genetic mutation, so medications that work for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis won't help her. 

The same dynamic plays out in other genetic conditions. Stunning advances in genetic science have revealed the subtle, insidious culprits behind these brutal diseases and have started paving the way for treatments. But patients with these exceedingly rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than those with more typical forms of these diseases — and many are now pinning hopes on experimental gene therapies.

“We feel such pure joy for our friends who have been lifted from this sinking ship,” said Kramer-Golinkoff, 40. “But we just feel so eager and desperate to join them. It's really hard to be in this minority of people left behind.”

It's not just science that is working against these patients, it's market forces. Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations. 

“You need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,” said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is “mutational discrimination.”




Charities – including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily's Entourage – are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.

While it likely won't be available for years, “just to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,” Kramer-Golinkoff said.

Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body. 

It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.

“As I've gotten older … my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,” Kramer-Golinkoff said.

Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master's degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She's prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.

“CF is a real monster of a disease,” she said.

Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with “CFTR modulator” therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients' overall quality of life.

Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.

Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.

For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations – affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don't benefit from modulator therapies.

While there's little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop “mutation agnostic” gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.

“There's a huge push to develop these therapies,” said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center. 

Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.

One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily's Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.

Kramer-Golinkoff said she's more optimistic about her future these days, even as her own illness worsens. At this point, she's living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily.

“You have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that's really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,” she said.

“We're incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies. They can't come soon enough.”

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Iran and the United States held in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, ending the discussions with a promise for more talks and perhaps another high-level meeting next weekend.

The talks ran for several hours in Muscat, the mountain-wrapped capital of this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula. 

A person close to Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, acknowledged that the meeting had started and later ended. The source spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. Iranian state television also reported their conclusion.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state television after the talks that the parties exchanged written points throughout the day in discussions that he described as “very serious and work-focused.”

“This time, the negotiations were much more serious than in the past, and we gradually entered into deeper and more detailed discussions,” he said. “We have moved somewhat away from broader, general discussions — though it is not the case that all disagreements have been resolved. Differences still exist both on major issues and on the details.”

A senior U.S. administration official said that the talks were “positive and productive.” 

“This latest round of direct and indirect discussions lasted over four hours,” the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. “There is still much to do, but further progress was made on getting to a deal. We agreed to meet again soon, in Europe, and we thank our Omani partners for facilitating these talks.”




Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has mediated the two previous round of talks in Muscat and Rome, offered a positive note at the end of Saturday's negotiations. 

Iran and the U.S. “identified a shared aspiration to reach agreement based on mutual respect and enduring commitments,” al-Busaidi posted on X. “Core principles, objectives and technical concerns were all addressed. Talks will continue next week with a further high level meeting provisionally scheduled for May 3.”

Araghchi arrived Friday in Oman on the eve of the talks and visited the Muscat International Book Fair, surrounded by television cameras and photojournalists. Witkoff was in Moscow on Friday to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and arrived on Saturday to Oman.

Meanwhile on Saturday, a major explosion rocked a port in southern Iran just after the talks began, killing four people and injuring more than 500 others. Authorities offered no immediate cause for the blast, which appeared to have been caused by a highly combustible material — though officials ruled out its oil and gas industry. The private security firm also linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant to the port as well.

The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on a half-century of enmity. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.

Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. 

Trump, traveling to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, again said that he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't.

“The Iran situation is coming out very well,” Trump said on Air Force One. “We've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.”

He added: “There are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal — a much nastier deal — and I don't want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.”

From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi headed up Tehran's expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.

The U.S. technical team was led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Anton doesn't have the nuclear policy experience of those who led Washington's efforts in the 2015 talks. 

Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. The demand that all enrichment stop also has been repeated by Rubio. 

However, Iranians remain hopeful that the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows during which it took more than 1 million rials to buy $1.

“It's OK to negotiate, to make the nuclear program smaller or bigger, and reach a deal,” Tehran resident Farzin Keivan said. “Of course we shouldn't give them everything. After all, we've suffered a lot for this program.”

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will return on Saturday to the secluded sultanate of Oman, where experts on both sides will start hammering out the technical details of a possible deal. 

The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on half a century of enmity. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.

Neither Iran nor the U.S. has offered any explanation on why the talks will return to Muscat, the Omani capital nestled in the Hajar Mountains. Oman has been a mediator between Tehran and Washington. Last weekend's talks in Rome offered a more-equal flight distance between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who are leading the negotiations. 

But Rome remains in mourning after the death of Pope Francis, whose funeral will be held on Saturday. And Iranian state television, in covering last weekend's talks, complained at length on air about the “paparazzi” gathered across the street from the Omani Embassy in Rome's Camilluccia neighborhood.

Araghchi himself took time out Friday night to sign copies of his latest memoir, “The Power of Negotiation,” at the Muscat International Book Fair. But he found himself swarmed by cameras even in the Omani capital, showing the intense international interest in the talks. 

Asked by The Associated Press about the negotiations on Saturday, Aragchi simply replied: “I'm here for the book.”

The Muscat talks come as Iran appears to have lined up Chinese and Russian support. Araghchi traveled to Moscow last week and this week visited Beijing. 

On Thursday, Chinese, Iranian and Russian representatives met the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that likely will verify compliance with any accord like it did with Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. That deal included China and Russia, as well as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in addition to Iran and the U.S. 

However, Iran has greatly restricted the IAEA's inspections — leading to fears internationally that centrifuges and other nuclear material could be diverted for non-peaceful purposes. 

The IAEA offered no readout from the talks, but China's state-run Xinhua news agency on Friday described the three nations as saying the agency has “the necessary potential and expertise to contribute constructively to this process.” 

“China, Russia and Iran emphasized that political and diplomatic engagement based on mutual respect remains the only viable and practical path for resolving the Iran nuclear issue,” the report said. It added that China respects Iran's “right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”

The Trump administration has kept France, Germany and the U.K. out of its direct negotiations with Iran, something similarly reflected in Witkoff's negotiations with Russia over ending its war on Ukraine. Witkoff traveled Friday to Moscow ahead of Saturday's meeting in Muscat. 

Araghchi meanwhile has said he's open to visiting Berlin, London and Paris to discuss the negotiations. 

“The ball is now in the E3's court,” Araghchi wrote on the social platform X on Thursday, using an acronym for the countries. “They have an opportunity to do away with the grip of Special Interest groups and forge a different path.”

From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi will lead Tehran's expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.

The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America's efforts in the 2015 talks. 

He was an early supporter of Trump, describing the 2016 election as a “charge the cockpit or you die” vote. “A Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto,” Anton wrote. “With Trump, at least you can spin the cylinder and take your chances.” He also criticized “Iran sycophancy” in the same essay.

Rubio, speaking on a podcast released this week, also kept up a Trump line that Iran needed to stop its enrichment of uranium entirely.

“If Iran wants a civil nuclear program, they can have one just like many other countries can have one, and that is they import enriched material,” Rubio said.

However, former CIA director Bill Burns, who took part in the secret negotiations that led to the 2015 nuclear deal, expressed skepticism Iran would give up its program like Libya did in 2003. 

“I don't personally think that this Iranian regime is going to agree to ... zero domestic enrichment,” Burns said in a talk Monday at the University of Chicago. “To hold out for the Libya model is virtually to ensure that you're not going to be able to reach an agreement.” 

But Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. Witkoff also has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. 

Meanwhile, one more wildcard is Israel, whose devastating war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip grinds on. Trump initially announced the Iran talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his side. But Israel, which for years has targeted Iran's nuclear program with attacks on its facilities and scientists, has kept open the possibility of airstrikes to destroy Tehran's enrichment sites. 

On Monday, Israel's military conducted drills preparing for possible new Iranian missile attacks, the country's public broadcaster KAN reported. Araghchi has described Iranian security services as being “on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.”

However, Iranians on Friday in Tehran remained hopeful the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows.

“It's OK to negotiate, to make the nuclear program smaller or bigger, and reach a deal,” Tehran resident Farzin Keivan said. “Of course we shouldn't give them everything. After all, we've suffered a lot for this program.”

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will move Saturday in Oman to what's known as the “expert level” — a sign analysts say shows that the talks are moving forward rapidly. 

However, experts not involved in the talks who spoke with The Associated Press warn that this doesn't necessarily signal a deal is imminent. Instead, it means that the talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff haven't broken down at what likely is the top-level trade — Tehran limiting its atomic program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. 

“Agreeing to technical talks suggests both sides are expressing pragmatic, realistic objectives for the negotiations and want to explore the details,” said Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association who long has studied Iran's nuclear program. 

“If Witkoff was making maximalist demands during his talks with Araghchi, such as dismantlement of the enrichment program, Iran would have no incentive to meet at the technical level.”

That technical level, however, remains filled with possible landmines. Just how much enrichment by Iran would be comfortable for the United States? What about Tehran's ballistic missile program, which U.S. President Donald Trump first cited in pulling America unilaterally out of the accord in 2018? Which sanctions could be lifted and which would be remain in place on the Islamic Republic? 




“The most important determinant of expert talks' value lies in whether there is a political commitment to do something and experts just need to figure out what,” said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who worked on Iran sanctions while at the U.S. State Department during negotiations over what became the 2015 nuclear deal.

“If the experts also have to discuss big concepts, without political agreement, it can just result in spun wheels.”

The 2015 nuclear deal saw senior experts involved in both sides of the deal. For the U.S. under President Barack Obama, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz reached an understanding working with Ali Akbar Salehi, then the leader of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Both men's technical background proved key to nailing down the specifics of the deal. 

Under the 2015 agreement, Iran agreed to enrich uranium only to 3.67% purity and keep a stockpile of only 300 kilograms (661 pounds). Today, Iran enriches some uranium up to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency put Iran's overall uranium stockpile in February at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds). 

The deal also limited the types of centrifuges Iran could spin, further slowing Tehran's ability to rush for a bomb, if it chose to do so. It also set out the provisions of how and when sanctions would be lifted, as well as time limits for the accord itself. 

Reaching limits, relief and timelines require the knowledge of experts, analysts say.

“A nonproliferation agreement is meaningless if it cannot be effectively implemented and verified,” Davenport said. “The United States needs a strong technical team to negotiate the detailed restrictions and intrusive monitoring that will be necessary to ensure any move by Iran toward nuclear weapons is quickly detected and there is sufficient time to respond.” 

The U.S. expert team will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi will lead Tehran's expert team. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.

Both the Americans and the Iranians have been tightlipped over exactly what's been discussed so far, though both sides have expressed optimism about the pace. However, there has been one noticeable dispute stemming from comments Witkoff made in a television interview, suggesting Tehran could be able to enrich up to 3.67% purity. However, analysts noted that was the level set by the 2015 deal under Obama.

Witkoff hours later issued a statement suggesting that comparison struck a nerve: “A deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.”

“Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,” Witkoff added. 

Araghchi responded by warning that Iran must be able to enrich.

“The core issue of enrichment itself is not negotiable,” he said.

Despite that, experts who spoke to the AP said they remained positive about the talks' trajectory so far. 

“Although still early stages, I'm encouraged so far,” said Alan Eyre, a former U.S. diplomat once involved in past nuclear negotiations with Tehran. “The pace of negotiations ... is good.” 

He added that so far, there didn't appear to be any “mutually exclusive red lines” for the talks as well — signaling there likely wasn't immediately any roadblocks to reaching a deal. 

Nephew similarly described reaching the expert level as a “positive sign.” However, he cautioned that the hard work potentially was just beginning for the negotiations. 

“They imply the need to get into real details, to discuss concepts that senior (officials) might not understand and to answer questions. I also think too much can be read into them starting,” Nephew said. “Expert talks can sometimes be a fudge for seniors to avoid working on tough issues — ‘let's have experts discuss it while we move on to other things' — or to sidestep big political decisions.”

Corey Hinderstein, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former U.S. government nuclear expert, described herself as feeling “cautious optimism” over the expert talks beginning. 

“Heads of delegation are responsible for setting strategic goals and defining success,” she said. “But if there is a deal to be made, the technical experts are the ones who will get it done.”

WHY SHORT WOMEN LIKE DATING TALL MEN AND VICE VERSA, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS

In 2023, Kelleher-Andrews previously spoke with Fox News Digital to share her insight on a relationship trend at the time – why short women like dating tall men and vice versa. 

Kelleher-Andrews, who's from Montecito, California, told Fox News Digital that while women tend to be paired with tall men, confident men don't seem to care as much.

""My most confident male clientele don't have a height preference at all,"" said Kelleher-Andrews. ""They are completely comfortable with the female partner being any height, including much taller.""

She added, ""I have noticed that these extremely confident men are so secure in who they are and what they bring to the table that they don't find those extra inches as a must-have or a prerequisite for love.""

However, the majority of her male clients have voiced a height preference, and eight times out of 10 they've requested to be partnered with a woman who's shorter than them, said Kelleher-Andrews.

With more than 30 years of experience in the match-making field, Kelleher-Andrews said she believed men generally ""feel more masculine, confident or protective when they are significantly taller than their female partner.""

Urban Meyer joins Colin Cowherd to share his thoughts on Shedeur Sanders falling out of Round 1 of the NFL Draft.

When quarterback prospect Shedeur Sanders fell out of the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft, there were some who couldn't believe he hadn't been picked by an organization, although it wasn't considered a total shock. 

But with Friday night seeing three more quarterbacks not named Sanders come off the draft board, the reaction was pure shock. 

Sanders, the Colorado Buffaloes quarterback who was a Heisman Trophy finalist this past college season, remains available heading into the third and final day of the NFL Draft. There have been 102 prospects taken off the board, and with Round 4 beginning at noon in Green Bay, everyone is wondering which NFL team will finally pull the trigger on Sanders.

Surprise and shock might not even be the words to describe this fall down the draft board, arguably being the biggest we've seen in recent memory for someone whom many considered to be, at the very least, a Day 2 selection.  

Why is this happening for Sanders? It's the question on everyone's mind, including ESPN's Booger McFarland, who thinks the answer lies beyond the tape.

""It's gotta be about more than football,"" he said during the NFL Draft broadcast on the network. ""He's the best pure passer you can draft. When you start to see developmental projects like Jalen Milroe and Dillon Gabriel – and nothing against those guys, but they're not nearly the player that Shedeur Sanders is. When they go before him, the only thing you can say is that it's more than football.""

Tyler Shough (New Orleans Saints), Milroe (Seattle Seahawks), and Gabriel (Cleveland Browns) were all selected on Friday night in respective order. Gabriel, especially, was the icing on the cake for those who were baffled that Sanders hadn't gone off the board, as some experts didn't have him on their top five quarterback rankings heading into the draft. 

Mel Kiper Jr., the longtime NFL Draft analyst with ESPN, has been adamant about Sanders' talent, ranking him the highest-graded prospect on his big board. He was vocal about Sanders making it out of the first round on Thursday night, but he was appalled to see what happened the next day. 

""I think it's disgusting,"" he said during a lengthy rant after Day 2 came and went. ""I don't understand what the heck's going on with this. . . . Somebody's gonna have to explain that one to me.""

Joel Klatt, who called several Buffaloes games this past college season for Fox Sports, has seen what Sanders can do for a football program in person.

During NFL Network's broadcast, Klatt pointed the finger at the narratives that were built about Sanders during the pre-draft process as to a reason why he's slipping. 

""Shedeur represents everything I dislike about the NFL Draft, and it's only one thing: it's narratives. It's narratives that are built up, lazy, and quite frankly, trash. When you come out as an anonymous source about some meeting that you had, and you don't think that some kid measured up to what you wanted him to be when he walked in your room, I think that's trash.

""Shedeur Sanders is going to be a good quarterback in the National Football League, and I think he's going to go make some head coach and some fan base very happy, because he's already done that in his career in what I think is a very difficult spotlight for his dad at the University of Colorado and a program that was nothing before he got there for two decades.""

SHEDEUR SANDERS STAYING CONFIDENT AS STUNNING NFL DRAFT FALL HITS FINAL DAY: ‘THANK YOU GOD FOR EVERYTHING'

At the same time, Klatt also believes this is time for Sanders to reflect, because the analyst feels it isn't the tape that's causing this freefall. 

""His play on the field would suggest he should already have been selected,"" Klatt explained. ""There were some quarterbacks, their play on the field probably doesn't warrant a selection over his play on the field. 

""The reason he's undrafted at this point is because of the person that sat with those teams and did not, for whatever reason, jell with them.""

It's not just the analysts opining about Sanders' draft situation – even President Donald Trump jumped into the mix to say how crazy it was. 

""What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID? Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He's also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. 

ESPN host Stephen A. Smith called it ""a damn disgrace."" Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton, who already has a young quarterback after taking Bo Nix in the first round last years, admitted his surprise and even the Buffaloes football account on X posted 10 minutes worth of Sanders highlights, just to remind everyone of how good he can be on the gridiron. 

These reactions are just the tip of the iceberg, as the football world continues to be bewildered at Sanders being available heading into the fourth round on Saturday.

After the final pick was made in Round 3, Sanders, who has been surrounded by friends and family at home, including his father and Colorado coach Deion Sanders, posted on X. 

""Thank you GOD for EVERYTHING,"" he wrote.  

Of the teams still in search for a potential new quarterback on the depth chart, the Pittsburgh Steelers, believed to be an option in Rounds 1 and 3, remain a frontrunner, as do the Las Vegas Raiders.

Fox News Digital was on hand for the White House Egg Roll on Monday, April 21, 2025. Here are some of the festivities enjoyed by Americans who gathered as President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump mingled with visitors.

Melania Trump is celebrating her birthday on April 26 as she's been resuming her White House duties for the second time. 

To commemorate the first lady's 55th year, Fox News Digital takes a look back at her path from growing up in Slovenia to stepping into her role in the White House.

Trump was born on April 26, 1970, in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, at Splošna bolnišnica Novo mesto General Hospital, to parents Viktor and Amalija Knavs, according to public records.

The first lady was christened at the Church of St. Lawrence in Novo Mesto, where she was given her name, Melania.

Srečko Ocvrik, the mayor of Sevnica, told Fox News Digital that the Knavs family were pleasant and actively involved in the community.

""While I did not know the family personally, local narratives consistently portray the Knavs family warmly, highlighting their positive influence and presence in the community,"" said Ocvrik.

""We must consider that Slovenia and Sevnica are part of Central Europe, characterized by a quality of life that is inclusive and hardworking,"" he went on.

At the time that Melania Trump was growing up, the area was part of the former country of Yugoslavia, which dissolved in the 1990s, according to the mayor. 

""Slovenia, as the westernmost republic of Yugoslavia, was significantly more aligned with Western culture and standards compared to the southern republics,"" he added.

The former MTV star's new life in Canada is the subject of a reality TV series on Prime Video, ‘Tom Green Country.' He also has a stand-up special, ‘Tom Green: I Got a Mule!' and a documentary, ‘This Is the Tom Green Documentary.'

After living in Hollywood for 20 years, Tom Green was ready to go home.

It was 2021 when the comedian and actor moved back to his native country of Canada. Today, he resides on a 150-acre farm in a remote area of Ontario alongside chickens, a donkey and a 1,500-pound mule, among other animals.

""I'm often in the wilderness,"" the 53-year-old told Fox News Digital. ""There's not a lot outside the farm as far as restaurants and conveniences. In California, it was nice to be able to do stand-up comedy every night. It was nice to be able to have 200 different sushi restaurants you could go to. But… there's nothing really I miss about living there, to be honest with you. It's nice to be living in the country at the farm.""

TOM GREEN NEVER FELT HIS 'AUTHENTIC SELF' IN HOLLYWOOD, SHARES WHY HE PREFERS A MUCH SIMPLER LIFE IN CANADA

The MTV star who famously pranked everyone during the Y2K era — including his parents — is chronicling his new life in a series on Prime Video, ""Tom Green Country."" 

The streaming giant is also offering ""This Is the Tom Green Documentary"" about his rise to fame, as well as his stand-up special, ""Tom Green: I Got a Mule!"". He also has a new country album, ""Home to the Country,"" a love letter to his new life.

""I've kept all of this footage for years of my old public access show and videos that I used to make and my MTV show,"" Green explained about why he decided to be the subject of a tell-all now.

""The show was pretty outrageous and kind of a crazy show,"" he reflected. ""It was done in those early days of home video before social media. I think it sometimes shocked people, confused people. I was playing a little bit of a character or an amplified wild and crazy version of myself. I think I wanted to put this documentary together to… set the record straight and let people… get to know what I'm all about.""

Green said his desire to leave California started during the pandemic. His stand-up comedy tour was postponed for the year. So, he decided to go out into the desert in a camper van.

""I was traveling all around the southwestern United States in a camper van doing videos for my YouTube channel and just recording podcasts,"" he explained. ""Then I just realized I love being out in nature so much. I grew up in Canada, and I always spent a lot of time fishing and being out in the wilderness there. I just decided I wanted to live like that.""

""So, I moved back home,"" he noted.

Green's farm is located ""not far from where I grew up,"" he shared. It's also close to his parents, who've forgiven him since he famously put a cow's head on their bed, ""Godfather""-style.

""They still talk to me,"" he said. ""Getting a farm close to my family, it's been the best decision I've made, I think ever, really… It's a lot different from Los Angeles, and I'm happy to be on the farm.""

""I've never really felt completely at home in Los Angeles… it always felt foreign to me,"" Green reflected. ""It always felt strange to me to be in Los Angeles and in that world. I had a lot of fun there. I started doing stand-up comedy again in Los Angeles 20 years ago… I performed at the great comedy clubs of LA… But I always felt like I was missing home, and I wanted to be living closer to my family.""

Green has picked up some unexpected skills along the way.

""Riding my mule,"" he boasted. ""I didn't know anything about riding horses or mules. Certainly didn't know how to get up in the morning and go out and take care of a giant 1,500-pound animal.""

His new lady has been an inspiration, he said.

""Fanny is a massive rideable mule, maybe the biggest rideable mule in Canada… I saddle her up every morning. I ride her out into the wilderness. I've really gotten to become very comfortable riding Fanny and using her just to get around the property. And it's also been an extremely beautiful experience to be able to bond with an animal like that,"" he said.

Tom Green's three projects — ""This Is the Tom Green Documentary,"" ""Tom Green Country"" and ""Tom Green: I Got a Mule!"" — are all available on Prime Video now. (Tom Green Productions Canada Inc.)

""I never really lived on a farm when I grew up,"" Green shared. ""I lived in the city of Ottawa… [But] I would go out into nature. I'd go fishing, and I'd go out in the country. We had a cabin as a kid that we would go out and fish at, but I never actually had farm animals and all of that.""

Escaping the glitz and glam of Hollywood has brought Green newfound peace. He spends his morning riding Fanny and feeding his chickens. He also works around his 1857 farmhouse with his dog Charley always nearby. You may even spot him on an ATV with his fiancée, Amanda Nelson. He was previously married to Drew Barrymore from 2001 to 2002.

""When I was living in Los Angeles, and I was working in show business, it was always go-go-go,"" he said. ""You're always trying to figure out what you're doing next, and you can get stressed out. It's nice to live in a simpler, calmer environment and just be in the presence of these animals. It's a very calming and peaceful thing. I think it makes me a much happier person for sure.""

Anyone can do it too, he insisted. Just know what you're signing up for.

""If you do want to move to the country and leave the city, you have to genuinely like that rural lifestyle,"" Green said. ""You have to want not just peace and quiet, but you have to enjoy all aspects of it. I love getting up in the morning and walking in the wilderness.

Criminal defense attorney Brian Claypool discusses how Democratic leadership in California has impacted the rise of violent crime in San Francisco.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., offered a dire warning to fellow Democrats recalling an exchange he had with a Target cashier in San Francisco, insisting his party has a ""major problem.""

During a panel discussion on Friday's ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" Schiff was asked to weigh in on the current state of the Democratic Party and how it governs, particularly in a state like California. 

""So we're gonna to have to change how we do business in California,"" Schiff told Bill Maher. ""We're gonna to have to address people's legitimate concerns about crime.""

Schiff then recalled an experience he had two years ago in San Francisco when his luggage was stolen out of his car, admitting it was the one time he did not heed warnings from others about not leaving valuables in vehicles while in the city. 

""And what was most memorable about the experience for me as I went to this Target in South San Francisco, 10 o'clock at night, and I'm getting the toiletries I'm gonna need for my next two days in the city,"" Schiff said. ""First of all, I had to get the clerk, which is hard to find, to unlock the shampoo or the whatever. So that's one thing.""

""And then I get to the cashier. The cashier asked me if I want one of those Target bags with a little bullseye on it. And I said, ‘Yes, that Target bag is gonna be my luggage for the next two days,"" Schiff continued. ""And she asked me what happened, and I told her, and she basically said in not so many words, 'Yeah, Democrats are a---h---s.' And I thought, you know, if the cashier in South San Francisco at 10 o'clock at night believes that Democrats are a---h---s because the shampoo was locked up and my stuff got stolen out of the trunk, we've got a major problem that we have to address.""

""That's an awesome story,"" Maher reacted. ""That says a lot. I hope all the Democrats listen to that story.""

Schiff expressed hope in San Francisco's new Democratic mayor Daniel Lurie, who he says is ""helping lead the way in how we kind of reinvent how Democrats are doing governance.""

Agents arrested former Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, at their home Thursday.

A former New Mexico judge and his wife allegedly tried to hide incriminating images and videos of an illegal immigrant believed to be a member of Venezuela's notorious Tren de Aragua gang and harbored other migrants, the Justice Department said Friday.

Former Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano, 68, and his wife, Nancy Cano, 67, were arrested Thursday after federal agents raided their Las Cruces home. The pair face charges of evidence tampering amid allegations they harbored Cristhian Ortega-Lopez.

""Judges are responsible for upholding our country's laws. It is beyond egregious for a former judge and his wife to engage in evidence tampering on behalf of a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member accused of illegally possessing firearms,"" said U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison. 

""The U.S. Attorney's Office is committed to dismantling this foreign terrorist organization by disrupting its criminal operations in New Mexico. That starts by prosecuting those who support gang members — including judges.""

Ortega-Lopez was put on the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) radar after a tipster said he was in the U.S. illegally and had guns. He initially entered the country Dec. 15, 2023, near Eagle Pass, Texas. He was taken into custody and released due to overcrowding at the U.S. Border Patrol facility.

Ortega-Lopez apparently posted multiple images and videos on social media showing him with other illegal immigrants handling guns at a shooting range in Las Cruces, federal prosecutors said. Among the weapons were a SIG Sauer P365 pistol, an AR-15 rifle equipped with a suppressor and other high-powered guns and ammunition.

His social media activity revealed content suggesting ties with the Venezuelan gang, including gang-related tattoos, hand gestures and clothing, prosecutors said. He also mocked a $5,000 reward to catch TdA members, Attorney General Pam Bondi said. 

Among the images were also two people who were decapitated, she said. 

In January, federal agents received a tip that Ortega-Lopez was living with other illegal immigrants on a property belonging to Cano, who was still a judge at the time, and his wife. 

Authorities seized four guns during a Feb. 28 search of the property.

(U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement )

The four guns, along with three cellphones belonging to Ortega-Lopez, were seized, and he was arrested. During the search, Ortega-Lopez was allowed to make a phone call before being taken to the Doña Ana County Detention Center (DACDC). 

He told the agents that the phone he wanted to use was not among the devices recovered. Video calls from DACDC later showed Nancy Cano holding a black iPhone believed to be Ortega's fourth phone, prosecutors said.

During a March 7 call with Ortega-Lopez, Nancy Cano allegedly used the device to contact someone named ""Michelle"" via WhatsApp, before facilitating a FaceTime call between Michelle and Ortega-Lopez using her personal phone.

In an April 20 call, Nancy Cano and Ortega-Lopez discussed deleting his Facebook account, which he allegedly used to share incriminating content, including gang affiliations and images with guns.

On April 24, federal agents searched the Cano home to locate Ortega-Lopez's missing phone. During questioning, Joel Cano admitted smashing the device with a hammer five weeks earlier because he believed it contained incriminating photos and videos of Ortega-Lopez with guns, and throwing it into a dumpster, said Bondi. 

A forensic analysis of the recovered phones revealed messages linked to Ortega's alleged criminal activities, including links with the TdA gang and images of him with guns, authorities said. 

Joel and Nancy Cano face up to 15 years in prison. 

FBI ARRESTS WISCONSIN JUDGE, ALLEGING SHE OBSTRUCTED ARREST OF ILLEGAL ALIEN

""The rule of law is very simple: It doesn't matter what line of work you're in. If you break the law, we will follow the facts, and we will prosecute you,"" Bondi said in a video message Friday.

Another judge arrested for allegedly interfering in the arrest of an illegal immigrant in Wisconsin also faces federal charges. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, 65, allegedly confronted federal agents inside a courthouse April 18 and ordered them to leave as they were trying to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican citizen who was previously deported and recently charged with multiple counts of domestic abuse-related battery.

Flores-Ruiz allegedly punched a man 30 times and struck a woman, Bondi said. Both victims were in court when Dugan learned that ICE was outside to arrest him.

""After being made aware of a valid immigration arrest warrant, Judge Dugan told agents that they needed a judicial warrant and demanded that they go to the Chief Judge's office, the Justice Department said in a news release Friday. ""Once the agents were no longer in the vicinity of her courtroom, Judge Dugan allegedly elected not to conduct a hearing on Flores-Ruiz's criminal case despite the fact that victims of his offense were present and instead personally escorted Flores-Ruiz and his attorney through a restricted ‘jury door' exit not typically used by defendants or attorneys.""

The doorway led to a nonpublic hallway, which Flores-Ruiz and his attorney used to leave Dugan's courtroom, prosecutors said. He was eventually arrested outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase. 

Dugan is charged with obstruction of proceedings before a department or agency of the United States and concealing a person to prevent arrest. She faces up to six years in prison.

Flores-Ruiz was previously deported in 2013 and reentered the U.S. illegally, authorities said. 

""Sanctuary jurisdictions that shield criminal aliens endanger American communities,"" said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. ""This Justice Department will not stand by as local officials put politics over public safety. Reckless sanctuary city policies create a sanctuary for one class — criminals. Those days are over.""

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified a bombshell Biden administration document this week, a blueprint for combating “domestic terrorism,” an umbrella term encompassing parents who attended school board meetings or Catholics who favored the traditional liturgy. This 2021 document, called the Strategic Implementation Plan for Countering Domestic Terrorism, reveals a coordinated effort to target political opponents under the guise of national security. Its policy framework appears designed to silence and marginalize conservative viewpoints through a combination of speech monitoring, censorship, financial punishment, and gun control measures that threaten constitutional protections.

It totally and disturbingly disregards the difference between lawful expression and criminal intent. It explicitly directed the Justice Department, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security to monitor “incidents of concerning non-criminal behavior.” Whereas law enforcement normally monitors criminal acts or behaviors that demonstrate a clear intent to commit a crime, this directive ordered authorities to target lawful behavior. By equating lawful speech with extremism, the plan set a dangerous precedent for suppressing speech.

The document is both a necessary reminder of the Biden administration's eagerness to suppress political dissent, and it is no surprise. In 2022, the FBI's Domestic Terrorism Symbols Guide flagged symbols such as the Gadsden Flag, the Betsy Ross Flag, and “2A” references as possible indicators of “Militia Violent Extremists.” This enabled the FBI to target and spy on vast swaths of the population for engaging in legal and mainstream political speech.

Who would the Founding Fathers consider “enemies” of America and its values: those waving revolutionary-era patriotic flags and defending the right to bear arms, or central government officials abusing their authority to stifle dissent?

In 2023, whistleblowers revealed that authorities had targeted two specific groups of people as possible domestic terrorists: parents who attended school board meetings to protest leftist ideological content in the classroom and “Radical-Traditionalist Catholics.”

In May of that year, FBI whistleblower Stephen Friend testified to Congress that he'd been directed to conduct physical surveillance at school board meetings in Florida, where parents protested the use of highly sexualized learning material and the promulgation of critical race theory in schools. It is not illegal to speak at school board meetings, especially when the content of the speech is mainstream in American culture. Indeed, 2024 election exit polls revealed that voters overwhelmingly agreed that schools had become breeding grounds for ideological indoctrination. But the Strategic Implementation Plan for Countering Domestic Terrorism led authorities to treat these mainstream and nonviolent parents no different than radicalized jihadis or neo-Nazis.

The so-called “Radical Traditionalist Catholics,” as they were called in a leaked 2023 FBI document by the FBI's Richmond, Virginia, field office, received much the same treatment. The memorandum, titled Interest of Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists in Radical-Traditionalist Catholic Ideology, suggested that Catholics who adhere to traditional Latin Mass and hold traditional views related to sexuality and the sanctity of life could be prone to extremist violence. Following the leak, the FBI disavowed the document, claiming that it came from a single field office and didn't meet agency standards. Former Director Christopher Wray testified that the report was withdrawn and that the FBI does not target people based on religion. But Gabbard's declassification of the Strategic Implementation Plan for Countering Domestic Terrorism reveals that the Biden administration deliberately expanded surveillance to include religious belief under the guise of counterterrorism.

GABBARD REFERS ALLEGED INTELLIGENCE LEAKERS TO DOJ FOR PROSECUTION

This pattern of targeting lawful behavior reveals a broader assault on constitutional freedoms. Congress should investigate this overreach and hold those responsible for eroding constitutional protections to account.

The targeting of political opponents during the Biden administration, including law-abiding patriots, betrays core principles of our republic. Free speech in the form of legitimate political dissent must not be stifled, lest America lose the spirit of its founding and its enduring character.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

WILL JUDGE DUGAN BECOME THE NEXT HERO OF THE RESISTANCE? The Trump administration's campaign against sanctuary jurisdictions took a big step forward on Friday when federal agents arrested a county judge in Milwaukee after the judge allegedly helped an illegal immigrant accused of multiple crimes hide from federal immigration officials who had come to detain him.

The judge is Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan. The illegal immigrant is Eduardo Flores-Ruiz. According to court documents, Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican, came illegally to the United States more than a dozen years ago. Immigration authorities issued a final removal order for him in January 2013. He was deported but at some point reentered the U.S. illegally. Now, he is still in the U.S. illegally, and he is also charged with domestic violence — three counts known as battery-domestic abuse-infliction of physical pain or injury. 

By the way, apart from the current crimes he is accused of, crossing into the U.S. illegally is punishable by up to six months in prison. Doing it again after being deported is punishable by up to two years behind bars.

Here is what happened on April 18 in the Milwaukee County Courthouse, according to an affidavit from an FBI agent in the case. Flores-Ruiz was scheduled to have a pretrial hearing in the domestic violence case. When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials heard about it, they decided to go there with an arrest warrant for Flores-Ruiz that would surely result in his deportation. 

Six agents, all dressed in plain clothes, went to the courthouse. They hit their first snag when they identified themselves as federal agents to the security guard at the entrance. They got in after a delay, and then a sheriff's office sergeant asked them to wait until Flores-Ruiz's hearing before Dugan was over before arresting him. The ICE team agreed and went to the hallway outside the courtroom. Hallways in the courthouse are considered public areas.

The agents then told the courtroom workers inside what they intended to do after the hearing. The courtroom deputy told the agents that he had to notify a shift sergeant. The agents went to wait outside in the hall. While they were there, a lawyer with the Wisconsin Public Defenders Office walked up and took pictures of them. 

When Flores-Ruiz arrived, the ICE team watched him enter the courtroom. It was about that time that Dugan learned of the ICE agents' presence — she was apparently told by the public defender who took the photos moments earlier. “Judge Dugan became visibly angry, commented that the situation was ‘absurd,' left the bench, and entered chambers,” the affidavit said. Then Dugan and another judge, both wearing their judicial robes, “approached members of the arrest team in the public hallway.” Dugan, “visibly upset” and displaying “a confrontational, angry demeanor,” ordered the ICE team to report to the chief judge's office. The other judge escorted them down the hall to the office. 

While the ICE team was stuck showing their credentials to the chief judge's clerk, Dugan stormed down the hall and went into a nonpublic entrance to her chambers. When Dugan returned to the courtroom, Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer, who had been talking to a clerk, “walked toward each other and toward the public courtroom exit. That is when Dugan said, “Wait, come with me” and escorted Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer “out of the courtroom through the ‘jury door,' which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse,” according to the affidavit. What Dugan did was “unusual,” the affidavit said, in part because “according to the courtroom deputy, only deputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies used the back jury door. Defense attorneys and defendants who were not in custody never used the jury door.” 

After escorting Flores-Ruiz out the door, Dugan returned to the courtroom and conducted other hearings. As time went by, the prosecuting attorney wondered why Flores-Ruiz's case had not been called. The attorney then learned that the Flores-Ruiz case had been adjourned, even though prosecutors were there and ready to go and the “victims were present in the courtroom.”

After Dugan helped Flores-Ruiz give ICE the slip, he headed toward the elevators. But one of the agents saw him leaving and alerted the rest of the arrest team. Flores-Ruiz and his attorney reached the ground floor and left the building. By then, the ICE team was scrambling after him. “After DEA Agent A notified the team that Flores-Ruiz was in the front of the courthouse near the flagpole, the agents ran towards the front of the courthouse,” the affidavit said. “FBI Agent B and DEA Agent A approached Flores-Ruiz and identified themselves as law enforcement. Flores-Ruiz turned around and sprinted down the street. A foot chase ensued. The agents pursued Flores-Ruiz for the entire length of the courthouse and ultimately apprehended him near the intersection of W. State Street and 10th Street. Flores-Ruiz was handcuffed and detained.”

So what about the judge? Based on the facts laid out in the affidavit, prosecutors charged Dugan with “obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a department or agency of the United States” and “concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest,” both felonies. Meanwhile, Flores-Ruiz is in ICE custody. 

And now the politics begins. According to a Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel account, “As word of Dugan's arrest spread, about two dozen protesters linked arms in front of the courthouse, chanting ‘No justice, no peace. Let the judge be released.' Some waved American flags. One protester held a sign that read ‘Only Fascists Arrest Judges.'” It seems likely the crowds will grow into Friday night and the weekend. 

Meanwhile, anger is building among national Democratic figures. “Let's be clear,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said. “Trump's arrest of Judge Dugan in Milwaukee has nothing to do with immigration. It has everything to do with his moving this country toward authoritarianism.” From Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD): “It's a whole new descent into government chaos.” From Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI): President Donald Trump's “relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge … fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this president's lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress's checks on his power.”

Here's the thing. We know who the villain is, but who are Democrats going to make the hero in this story? The answer, of course, seems to be Dugan — but remember, all this was done on behalf of Eduardo Flores-Ruiz. Will Dugan be called a hero for protecting an already-deported-and-illegally-returned accused domestic abuser from federal authorities? That might be a hard sell.

It's similar to the problem Democrats face in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case. With that, Democrats have argued that even if Abrego Garcia is a gang member, which they still deny, the case is really about due process and everyone's rights in America. In the Milwaukee case, they'll certainly try to make it about due process again. But people might still ask: Why should a judge of all people obstruct federal agents and the enforcement of immigration law when the facts in the case seem so clear-cut?","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, has died by suicide.

Her death was reported by NBC News and announced by her family. She was 41 years old and died in Neergabby, Australia, where she had lived for several years.

“It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,” Giuffre's family said in a statement to NBC News. “She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.”

“Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors,” they added. “In the end, the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.”

Giuffre met Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell as a teenager in 1999. She groomed Giuffre, who was then underage, to service Epstein and his other associates sexually from that time until 2002. She alleged that Epstein forced her to have sex with him and other high-profile men, including Prince Andrew.

Giuffre met her husband, Robert Giuffre, while on an assignment to bring a girl back from Thailand in 2002. The two quickly married and she ended her association with Epstein.

She first came forward publicly with her accusations in 2011. She founded the nonprofit group Victims Refuse Silence, relaunched as Speak Out, Act, Reclaim, or SOAR, in 2021. She settled a lawsuit against Andrew in February 2022, which involved an apology for his association with Epstein and the treatment of Giuffre. He also sent a “substantial donation” of unknown value to Giuffre's charity.

Giuffre is survived by three children. She separated from her husband in 2023 and told People earlier this month that he had abused her for years. Her brother, Sky Roberts, alleged she almost died as a result of a physical assault in January.

On March 30, Giuffre posted a picture of herself badly bruised on Instagram, the result of a car crash involving a school bus. She said doctors gave her four days to live.

“I've gone into kidney renal failure, they've given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology. I'm ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time, but you know what they say about wishes. S*** in one hand and wish in the other & I guarantee it's still going to be s*** at the end of the day. Thank you all for being the wonderful people of the world and for being a great part of my life. Godbless you all xx Virginia,” she said.

PRINCE ANDREW REACHES SETTLEMENT IN VIRGINIA GIUFFRE LAWSUIT

Her brother, Danny Wilson, told NBC News that her suicide was likely motivated by a combination of physical pain from the crash and psychological pain from past abuse.

“Her biggest push was, ‘If I don't do this, nobody's going to do it,'” he said, referring to her advocacy. “She was in real physical pain — suffered from renal failure. But I think that the mental pain was worse.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) backed a bill Friday that would print the number for a suicide hotline and LGBT crisis center on the back of all public middle and high school student ID cards. 

The move is in direct opposition to President Donald Trump‘s administration plan to cut funding for a nonprofit network that provides LGBT-specific youth counseling at the suicide hotline. The California governor criticized the plan, claiming the government is “walk[ing] away from its responsibility” to provide such resources.

“Suicide is the second leading cause of death among LGBT youth. Cutting off kids' access to help is indefensible,” Newsom told Politico. “While the Trump administration walks away from its responsibility, California will continue to expand access to life-saving resources, because the life of every child — straight, gay, trans — is worth fighting for.”

California has largely led the charge against the Trump administration's policies. It was the first to sue Trump over tariffs and is also challenging the Department of Government Efficiency‘s cuts to AmeriCorps. 

The California bill was introduced by Assembly member Mark González, a Democrat from Los Angeles, and would put the number for the Trevor Project on student ID cards.

The Trevor Project is one of the nonprofit groups that would lose funding under Trump's budget. Social conservatives have criticized the organization, with the California Family Council claiming it “undermines families” and creates a “playground for predators.”

The nonprofit organization is the leading suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBT youth. They provide around-the-clock support, including a toll-free hotline, online chats, and text message support that connects people in crisis with trained counselors. 

PROMINENT JEFFREY EPSTEIN VICTIM VIRGINIA GIUFFRE DIES BY SUICIDE 

During the bill's first hearing in April, Republican assembly member Josh Hoover pushed back on why it was necessary to add a LGBT-specific hotline number when there is already a general hotline number on student IDs.

“My concern has nothing to do with the ability to call a hotline, obviously, that is something that I support,” Hoover told Politico. “But if you go right now to the Trevor Project website, there are a number of resources provided that are very political in nature. There is access to a number of things that I would argue a lot of parents would be uncomfortable with.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The president's appointees often appear to be acting out a made-for-television version of their jobs rather than actually doing them.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posts photos of himself doing snowy push-ups with U.S. troops in Poland and deadlifting with them in predawn Germany. And FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino spars with agents on the wrestling mats of Quantico.



In Bongino's case, his run-in with a skilled jiujitsu instructor left him with a swollen right elbow. But such are the risks of Trump's Cosplay Cabinet, in which his underlings perform near-daily tone poems to a certain type of MAGA masculinity, publicly pantomiming their professional responsibilities.



Jonathan Chait: What does Dan Bongino believe?



Noem, who has earned herself several dismissive, Mattel-inspired nicknames—“Border Control Barbie,” “ICE Barbie”—is perhaps the most conspicuous offender. She has been photographed behind the controls of both a Coast Guard boat and a Coast Guard plane, donned a helmet and Border Patrol fatigues for an ATV tour along the southern border, and posed in cargo pants and an ICE vest. In a social-media video, she wielded a tricked-out automatic rifle, the M4 muzzle disconcertingly pointed at the head of the agent directly to her left.



“I'm old school, but I don't think our Cabinet Secretaries should cosplay as armed agents,” the conservative radio host Erick Erickson wrote on X above Noem's video of herself with the poorly placed gun. “You're a politician, not one of our heroes.”



When I called Erickson this week, he told me Trump's subordinates understand that the president is “an image guy” who looks to surround himself with people who appear to be out of “central casting.” But, he said, looking the part on TV also serves a useful purpose for Trump—it “distracts the voters from: Is stuff actually going well behind the scenes?”



“It's like hiring the guy who plays a doctor on Grey's Anatomy,” Erickson told me. “You don't actually want that guy to do your heart surgery. He's an actor. You hire the people who sound competent because they use the polysyllabic words. But can they actually do the job?”



Trump, of course, may be the ultimate cosplayer. His quixotic political rise was fueled, in part, by Americans who knew him as a successful businessman, not through any of his actual business exploits (or bankruptcies), but through the high-flying mogul he played in their living room every Thursday night on The Apprentice.



During his most recent campaign, he sported various working-class costumes to troll his political rivals. In October, mocking then–Vice President Kamala Harris's claim that, as a college student, she had spent a summer working at a McDonald's, Trump tied on a navy-and-gold apron and served fries through a Philadelphia-area McDonald's drive-through window. Later that month, in response to mumbled comments then-President Joe Biden made seeming to liken Trump supporters to “garbage,” Trump wore a neon-orange reflective vest and hopped into a white Trump-branded trash hauler in Green Bay, Wisconsin.



“How do you like my garbage truck?” Trump crowed, as reporters looked on.



The ethos seems to have trickled down to his Cabinet secretaries and other top officials, whose public pronouncements and social-media posts sometimes give the impression that they view government work more as a game than as true public service. In 2022, Kash Patel, now the FBI director, shared a post featuring himself—chain saw in hand and “Bad to the Bone” thrumming in the background—lopping off chunks of a log emblazoned with images of alleged enemies, a group that included Biden, CNN, “Fake News,” and Representative Nancy Pelosi. Patel can often appear as interested in the public perks of his job as in the actual job itself. This month, he flew with Trump on Air Force One to Miami to attend a Saturday-night Ultimate Fighting Championship event, and he has also appeared in the owner's suite at Capitals games, photographed alongside Hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky.



From the October 2024 Issue: The man who will do anything for Trump



Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man, is the administration's designated disassembler of the federal bureaucracy. For the assignment, Musk has consciously cast himself into the role of a plucky IT guy, regularly wearing a Tech Support T-shirt under his blazer. No matter that his self-styled “tech support” has failed to deliver on the $1 trillion in government-spending cuts that he and his DOGE bros overpromised. He was still able to boast on X that he had spent an early-February weekend feeding USAID “into the wood chipper.”



“It looks like a lot of them are sort of showing up at a government costume party in which they get to wear the costume of being the secretary of defense or the costume of being the director of national intelligence, but they don't have the qualification for those roles,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a Democrat, told me. “Part of it is they know the point of entry to the costume party is you have to suck up ferociously to Trump every minute, and to get on his radar, images help. He likes the fake macho imagery, and so that's just part of the deal.”



Hegseth, who served as a U.S. Army National Guard infantry officer, has posted more than a dozen photos and videos in the past month alone of him working out with troops. “It's not that long ago that I was right there with them,” Hegseth explained when asked in Germany about his early-morning workout. “I'll probably connect more with those guys than I do with four-star generals.” Hegseth seems to naturally intuit that the rank-and-file troops generally respect a Pentagon chief willing—and able—to train with them.



But Hegseth's constant posting of his athletic feats has given them an overly eager, thirsty quality. In some ways, he reminds me of my spy-obsessed 6-year-old, who, desperate to be a covert operative, is constantly whispering into her oversize spy-gadget watch and shouting staticky instructions into her walkie-talkies. But unlike my daughter, who is in kindergarten and is decidedly not a real-life spy, Hegseth is actually the defense secretary, making his constant performance of the role feel gratuitous.



“Every rep, every drop of sweat, reminds us of the toughness and tenacity that defend our nation,” he wrote last week, above photos and video of him and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard working out with troops at a Virginia military installation. (Not to be outdone, Gabbard, a former lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, found time to fit in a Muay Thai training session during a recent stop in Bangkok.)



Elaine Godfrey: What everyone gets wrong about Tulsi Gabbard



In an attack-planning Signal group chat, to which Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally added, Hegseth again appeared like an excited boy—eager to show off his cool new tools of war to his important friends—as he prepared for an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen. He wrote, “TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,” before continuing with a series of jargony specifics:



•“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)”

•“1345: ‘Trigger Based' F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME—also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)”

•“1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)”

•“1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based' targets)”

•“1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts—also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”



“We are currently clean on OPSEC,” Hegseth boasted—incorrectly, it turned out—in reference to operational security, before concluding: “Godspeed to our Warriors.”



This week, The New York Times reported that, in addition to last month's Signalgate, Hegseth had also shared detailed attack plans on a second Signal group chat that included his wife, his brother, and his personal lawyer—again giving the impression of someone eager to brag about his important new job.



Here, Whitehouse warned, is where the real risk comes in. “If you're not a serious person, and you're in a serious job, there's this enormous gap of competence through which terrible things can happen,” he told me.



Other cosplaying occurs on a lesser scale. In the first Trump term, the Santa Monica–raised, Duke-educated Stephen Miller—Trump's point person on immigration—was photographed in aviator Ray-Bans and an Army-green U.S. Border Patrol hat during a visit to the border wall in Texas. More recently, early last month, Attorney General Pam Bondi sported an FBI jacket and a green camouflage cap when traveling with other senior officials to spotlight the arrest of the terrorist charged with planning the deadly suicide attack at the Kabul airport during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. And Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who'd trained to be a teacher but never became one, emerged instead from the ultimate cosplaying world of World Wrestling Entertainment.



Even the more serious Cabinet secretaries sometimes appear to be playacting, if not cosplaying—all scrambling to embody whatever it is they think Trump wants them to be. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for instance, seems to be masquerading as an isolationist, at least compared with foreign-policy positions he previously held as a senator. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a former hedge-fund manager, is now playing the role of a tariff hard-liner who actually believes that Trump's recent tanking of the stock market was all part of the art of the ultimate deal.



Hegseth's wife, meanwhile, has prompted concerns and criticism by accompanying her husband to at least two meetings with foreign-military counterparts where sensitive information was discussed, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.



But it's clear that Jennifer Hegseth, a former Fox News producer, is not actually a Defense Department official; if she were, she likely would have advised her husband that perhaps he should spend less time publicly bench-pressing, and more time getting his fast-fraying department under control.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

April 30 will mark the 100th day of Donald Trump's presidency

Donald Trump

 Welcome to the Wall Street Week newsletter, bringing you stories of capitalism about things you need to know, but even more things you need to think about.  I'm David Westin, and this week we told the story of President Donald Trump's first 100 days (the second time) and how two very different companies, Mars and Enel, have found success by embracing their own versions of stakeholder capitalism. If you're not yet a subscriber, sign up here for this newsletter.

April 30 will mark the 100th day of Donald Trump's presidency (this time around). Presidential historian Barbara Perry took us back to FDR's coming to office in 1933 in the midst of the Great Depression, bringing with him the first “100 day” agenda. Trump has signed 130 executive orders this year as of April 17, blowing past FDR's 99 executive orders he signed in his first 100 days.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Six months after Kemi Badenoch was elected leader of the UK Conservatives, the conversation in the party is already turning toward removing her.

With the Tories expected to lose large numbers of seats across England in local elections on Thursday, more than two dozen MPs and officials told Bloomberg that Badenoch — who became leader on Nov. 2 — is not the right person to take the them into the next general election due by mid-2029. Instead, the party's lawmakers are increasingly of the view she should be replaced with Robert Jenrick, the right-wing shadow justice secretary, they said, requesting anonymity discussing internal unrest.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

A growing number of Americans are using buy now, pay later loans to buy groceries, and more people are paying those bills late, according to new Lending Tree data released Friday. 

The figures are the latest indicator that some consumers are cracking under the pressure of an uncertain economy and are having trouble affording essentials such as groceries as they contend with persistent inflation, high interest rates and concerns around tariffs. 

In a survey conducted April 2-3 of 2,000 U.S. consumers ages 18 to 79, around half reported having used buy now, pay later services. Of those consumers, 25% of respondents said they were using BNPL loans to buy groceries, up from 14% in 2024 and 21% in 2023, the firm said.

Meanwhile, 41% of respondents said they made a late payment on a BNPL loan in the past year, up from 34% in the year prior, the survey found.

Lending Tree's chief consumer finance analyst, Matt Schulz, said that of those respondents who said they paid a BNPL bill late, most said it was by no more than a week or so.

""A lot of people are struggling and looking for ways to extend their budget,"" Schulz said. ""Inflation is still a problem. Interest rates are still really high. There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs and other economic issues, and it's all going to add up to a lot of people looking for ways to extend their budget however they can.""

""For an awful lot of people, that's going to mean leaning on buy now, pay later loans, for better or for worse,"" he said. 

He stopped short of calling the results a recession indicator but said conditions are expected to decline further before they get better.  

""I do think it's going to get worse, at least in the short term,"" said Schulz. ""I don't know that there's a whole lot of reason to expect these numbers to get better in the near term.""

The loans, which allow consumers to split up purchases into several smaller payments, are a popular alternative to credit cards because they often don't charge interest. But consumers can see high fees if they pay late, and they can run into problems if they stack up multiple loans. In Lending Tree's survey, 60% of BNPL users said they've had multiple loans at once, with nearly a fourth saying they have held three or more at once. 

""It's just really important for people to be cautious when they use these things, because even though they can be a really good interest-free tool to help you kind of make it from one paycheck to the next, there's also a lot of risk in mismanaging it,"" said Schulz. ""So people should tread lightly."" 

Lending Tree's findings come after Billboard revealed that about 60% of general admission Coachella attendees funded their concert tickets with buy now, pay later loans, sparking a debate on the state of the economy and how consumers are using debt to keep up their lifestyles. A recent announcement from DoorDash that it would begin accepting BNPL financing from Klarna for food deliveries led to widespread mockery and jokes that Americans were struggling so much that they were now being forced to finance cheeseburgers and burritos.

Over the last few years, consumers have held up relatively well, even in the face of persistent inflation and high interest rates, because the job market was strong and wage growth had kept up with inflation — at least for some workers. 

Earlier this year, however, large companies including Walmart and Delta Airlines began warning that the dynamic had begun to shift and they were seeing cracks in demand, which was leading to worse-than-expected sales forecasts.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, met one-on-one in a marble-lined Vatican basilica on Saturday to try to revive faltering efforts to end Russia's war with Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said the meeting could prove historic if it delivers the kind of peace he is hoping for, and a White House spokesman called it ""very productive.""

The two leaders, leaning in close to each other with no aides around them while seated in St Peter's Basilica, spoke for about 15 minutes, according to Zelenskyy's office, which also released photographs of the meeting.

The meeting at the Vatican, their first since an angry encounter in the Oval Office in Washington in February, comes at a critical time in negotiations aimed at bringing an end to fighting between Ukraine and Russia.

In a post on social media platform Telegram, Zelenskyy wrote: ""Good meeting. One-on-one, we managed to discuss a lot. We hope for a result from all the things that were spoken about.""

He said those topics included: ""The protection of the lives of our people. A complete and unconditional ceasefire. A reliable and lasting peace that will prevent a recurrence of war.""

Zelenskyy added: ""It was a very symbolic meeting that has the potential to become historic if we achieve joint results. Thank you, President Donald Trump!""

Steven Cheung, White House communications director, said the two leaders had met privately and had ""a very productive discussion. More details about the meeting will follow.""

A Zelenskyy spokesman had earlier said aides to the two leaders were working on arrangements for a follow-up meeting in Rome later on Saturday. However, Trump's aircraft departed Rome with no word on the second meeting. It was not clear if it had taken place.

In one photograph released by Zelenskyy's office, the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders sat opposite each other in a hall of the basilica, around two feet apart, and were leaning in towards each other in conversation. No aides could be seen in the image.

In a second photograph, from the same location, Zelenskyy, Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were shown standing in a tight huddle. Macron had his hand on Zelenskiy's shoulder.

After Trump and Zelenskyy met in the basilica, the two men joined other world leaders outside in Saint Peter's Square at the funeral service for Pope Francis, who made the pursuit of peace, including in Ukraine, a motif of his papacy.

Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who gave the sermon at the funeral service, recalled how Pope Francis did not stop raising his voice to call for negotiations to end conflicts.

""War always leaves the world worse than it was before: it is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone,"" the cardinal said.

Trump, who has been pressing both sides to agree to a ceasefire, said on Friday that there had been productive talks between his envoy and the Russian leadership in Moscow, and called for a high-level meeting between Kyiv and Moscow to close a deal.

Trump had previously warned his administration would walk away from its efforts to achieve a peace if the two sides do not agree to a deal soon.

After a round of shuttle diplomacy this week, differences have emerged between the position of the Trump White House on peace talks and the stance of Ukraine and its European allies, according to documents from the talks obtained by Reuters.

Washington is proposing a legal recognition that Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014, is Russian territory, something that Kyiv and its allies in Europe say is a red line they will not cross.

There are also differences on how quickly sanctions on Russia would be lifted if a peace deal was signed, what kind of security guarantees Ukraine would have, and how Ukraine would be financially compensated.

Trump and Zelenskyy have had a rocky personal relationship. At their Oval Office meeting, Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of ""gambling with World War Three.""

Since then, Kyiv has tried to repair relations, but the barbs have continued. Zelenskyy has said Trump was trapped in a ""disinformation bubble"" that favored Moscow, while the U.S. leader accused Zelenskyy of foot-dragging on a peace deal and making ""inflammatory"" statements.

But the two men need each other. Trump requires Zelenskyy's buy-in to achieve his stated ambition of bringing a swift peace between Russia and Ukraine, while Kyiv needs Trump to pressure Moscow into diluting some of the more onerous conditions it has set for a truce.

At the Oval Office meeting in February, a reporter who was present from a conservative U.S. news network accused Zelenskyy of disrespecting the occasion by not wearing a suit.

Zelenskyy, since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, has eschewed suits in favor of military-style attire, saying it is his way of showing solidarity with his countryman fighting to defend Ukraine.

In Rome on Saturday, Zelenskyy again decided against a suit, and instead wore a dark shirt, buttoned up to the neck with no tie, and wore a dark military-style jacket over the top of that.

Elon Musk's xAI Holdings is in discussions with investors to raise about $20 billion, Bloomberg News reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The funding would value the company at over $120 billion, according to the report.

Musk was looking to assign ""proper value"" to xAI, sources told CNBC's David Faber earlier this month. The remarks were made during a call with xAI investors, sources familiar with the matter told Faber. The Tesla CEO at that time didn't explicitly mention any upcoming funding round, but the sources suggested xAI was preparing for a substantial capital raise in the near future.

The funding amount could be more than $20 billion as the exact figure had not been decided, the Bloomberg report added.

Artificial intelligence startup xAI didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment outside of U.S. business hours.

The AI firm last month acquired X in an all-stock deal that valued xAI at $80 billion and the social media platform at $33 billion.

""xAI and X's futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,"" Musk said on X, announcing the deal. ""This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach.""

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday floated the possibility of stronger sanctions on Moscow and questioned whether Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to ""stop the war"" against Ukraine.

Trump's social media post about Putin came just after he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met in Rome for their first in-person session since an Oval Office sitdown that devolved into a shouting match. They met just before the funeral of Pope Francis.

""There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Vice President JD Vance posted Trump's statement on his X account. 

""It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ""Banking"" or ""Secondary Sanctions?"" Too many people are dying!!!"" Trump said.

The White House said that Trump and Zelenskyy ""had a very productive discussion,"" but did not include additional details on what was discussed.

Zelensky said that it was a ""good meeting,"" adding: ""Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.""

Trump's remarks come as he's increasing pressure for the two countries to strike a peace deal. Earlier this week, Trump presented the two countries with an offer to end the war. The deal reportedly included, in part, recognition of Crimea under Russian control, which Zelenskyy has repeatedly said is a red line.

In his Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump said Russia stole Crimea from Ukraine, a rare acknowledgement from the U.S. president that Russia illegally annexed the region.

Trump took aim at former U.S. President Barack Obama and suggested that he ""made it possible for Russia to steal Crimea from Ukraine without even a shot being fired.""

Trump told TIME earlier this month that ""Crimea will stay with Russia,"" adding: ""Zelenskyy understands that, and everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time. It's been with them long before Trump came along.""

After his comments, Zelenskyy reiterated that Crimea belongs to Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Trump said Friday that Russia and Ukraine are ""very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to 'finish it off.' ""

He wrote on Truth Social that ""most of the major points are agreed to.""

OKLAHOMA CITY — Amazon and Nvidia told a room of oil and gas executives this week that all options are on the table to power artificial intelligence including fossil fuels such as natural gas.

The tech and energy industries gathered in Oklahoma City at the Hamm Institute for American Energy to discuss how the U.S. can meet the growing energy needs for AI data centers. 

The Big Tech companies have invested mostly in renewable power in an effort to slash their carbon dioxide emissions, but they are now navigating a changed political environment. President Donald Trump has ditched U.S. commitments to fight climate change as he seeks to increase fossil fuel production, particularly natural gas.

There is now growing public acknowledgment from the tech industry that gas will be needed, at least in the near term, to help fuel AI.

""To have the energy we need for the grid, it's going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time,"" Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, said during a panel discussion Thursday. ""We're not surprised by the fact that we're going to need to add some thermal generation to meet the needs in the short term.""

Amazon remains focused on slashing its carbon emissions, Miller said. It is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy and is investing in advanced nuclear and carbon capture technology to reduce the environmental impact of its energy consumption, the executive said.

But those advanced technologies will not come online until the 2030s and Amazon needs steady and secure power now, Miller said.

""We're very explicit that meeting customers' demands for capacity is first and foremost in our priority list, and so having access to power is first and foremost what we focus on,"" Miller said. ""And we have a goal to be net-zero carbon as a company by 2040 and are very focused on that.""

Nvidia is also focused on environmental impact but wants ""all options on the table"" as AI faces an energy crunch, said Josh Parker, the chipmaker's senior director of corporate sustainability.

""At the end of the day, we need power. We just need power,"" Parker said at the panel. ""We have some customers who really prioritize the clean energy, and some customers who don't care as much,"" the executive said.

Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark called for data center developers to be realistic about the energy sources that are currently available. Anthropic estimates that 50 gigawatts of new power is needed by 2027, equivalent to about 50 nuclear reactors. AI demand can help drive the development of ""new and novel sources"" of power over the longer term, he said.

The idea of using coal, however, was met with unease. Trump recently signed an order that aims to boost coal production, citing demand from AI. The Amazon and Nvidia executives did not answer directly when asked during the panel whether they thought coal had a role play in powering AI.

""You have a broader set of options than just coal,"" Clark said. ""We would certainly consider it, but I don't think I'd say it's at the top of our list.""

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes says Bitcoin (BTC) will likely benefit from the ongoing trade war and a US-China decoupling.

In a new interview with the host of the Forward Guidance YouTube channel, Felix Jauvin, Hayes says governments around the world will likely have to print money to offset the impacts of the trade war, which has ignited massive Bitcoin rallies in the past.

“China's not alone. It's every major economy needs to print a bunch of money to basically cushion the effects of this attempted divorce, this decline in globalization. But at the end of the day, yeah, they're going to print money – Bitcoin benefits. 

Now the reciprocal of the current account deficit in the US is our financial account surplus. And so all these dollars that got earned, the trillions of dollars that got earned selling stuff to America, got recycled into Treasury bonds and stocks and Mag 7, all the big US tech stocks. So mathematically, if [US President Donald] Trump is serious about reducing the current account to zero, then foreigners have to sell stocks – period. It's just math. 

And then the question is, okay, well, can the US government survive financially if there's a big decline in capital gains taxes because the market's not going up? I don't think so. Therefore, we get a printing money function and Bitcoin benefits. It finally decouples from tech because of the structural flows and what needs to happen from an affordability standpoint for the US government.”

While some in the crypto space suggest the market turmoil may prompt central banks to start accumulating Bitcoin to diversify their asset holdings, Hayes believes central banks will continue to turn to gold as a hedge, not the flagship crypto asset.

“I actually don't think that they're mentally prepared for that sort of leap. They understand gold. They've been trained in gold. They've read history books about gold.” 

Bitcoin is trading for $94,832 at time of writing, up 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

On-chain data shows the Ethereum whales have sold the asset recently, while key holders on the Bitcoin network have accumulated instead.

Ethereum Whales Have Sold Into The Latest Rally

As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Ethereum whales have participated in selling recently. The “whales” here refer to the ETH entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH.

At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $1.8 million to $18 million. While these bounds don't cover the largest of holders in the sector, they do still contain some of the key investors.

Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the combined balance of these Ethereum whales over the over the past ten days or so:

As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum whales have seen their supply go through a net decline recently. During this selloff, these investors offloaded more than 63,000 ETH (about $113.5 million) inside a 48-hour window.

From the chart, it's visible that the distribution from this cohort has coincided with ETH's recovery rally. This could indicate that these large investors have been capitalizing on the profit-taking opportunity.

While the key investors of ETH may have taken profits, the same isn't true for that of BTC. As the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed in an X post, the trend has been that of accumulation for BTC recently.

In the chart, the analytics firm has attached the data related to the supply of the Bitcoin holders carrying between 10 ($946,000) and 10,000 BTC ($946 million). This range is broader than the one for ETH and includes two key investor cohorts: sharks and whales.

These investors have collectively added a total of 19,255 BTC to their wallets alongside the price rally. Thus, it would appear that the key holders of the cryptocurrency are supportive of the recovery run.

Naturally, this could imply the Bitcoin rally may have more chances of being sustainable than the Ethereum one. That said, things can change quickly in the digital asset sector, so the trend related to the large entities of both might be worth keeping an eye on.

Speaking of accumulation, BTC is currently witnessing high inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as Santiment has pointed out in another X post.

From the chart, it's visible that the recent ETF inflows are the largest in months. As the analytics firm notes,

As Bitcoin has recovered as high as $95.8K today, we are seeing the highest week of net inflows to BTC ETF's since the week before Trump's inauguration in mid-January. Institutions like Blackrock have played a large part in the crypto-wide bounce traders were waiting for.

ETH Price

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,800, up more than 12% in the last week.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a major change to the network's execution layer: replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode with the RISC-V instruction set.

One of the main drivers behind this proposal is the network's decreasing base layer activity and revenue. In the week of March 30, Ethereum collected just 3.18 ETH in blob fees—around $5,000.

Buterin noted that most zero-knowledge (ZK) provers already simulate the EVM by translating it into RISC-V. Switching to RISC-V natively could improve efficiency up to 100x and simplify proof generation. To maintain support for existing contracts, Ethereum would keep old EVM contracts running alongside new RISC-V-based ones. This might involve using a RISC-V interpreter to execute old bytecode or running two systems in parallel within the protocol. Over time, this could also allow Ethereum to support other virtual machines, such as Move.

This proposal comes ahead of Ethereum's scheduled “Pectra” upgrade on May 7, which aims to improve scalability, user experience, and validator limits. Buterin believes that for the execution layer to match the improvements seen in the consensus layer, a more fundamental change is required.

There are growing concerns that Ethereum's shrinking base-layer fees could weaken Ether's value. Analysts warn that if usage continues shifting away from the mainnet, Ether's price could fall further, possibly to $1,100. The RISC-V proposal is presented as a bold but necessary path to maintain Ethereum's performance and relevance in a competitive blockchain environment.

TronWeekly

Crypto World News

April 27, 2025 by Kashif Saleem 

Ethereum has been pushing back against recent market struggles, now trading at $1,809. The 13.41% increase over the past week has caught the eyes of analysts who are digging into the numbers for clues on whether this uptick can last or if turbulence is on the horizon.

Even with this fresh momentum, Ethereum is still sitting about 63% lower than its record high of $4,891, a peak it hit back in 2021. The broader downtrend that began in late 2021 still hangs over the market, reminding everyone that the road to recovery could be long and uneven.

Adding complexity to the current picture, recent data from on-chain movements and exchange activity hints that its future price swings might be influenced more by larger economic trends and strategic moves by big traders rather than organic growth.

A notable recent development is the sharp increase in Ethereum transfers to derivative exchanges. Analysts often view such behavior as a sign of increased speculative trading or shifts in traders' expectations for upcoming volatility.

In a recent post, Amr Taha, a contributor for CryptoQuant's QuickTake, noted that Ethereum experienced unusually large inflows to derivatives platforms in the past two days, with one particular surge crossing the 80,000 ETH mark. These spikes often occur when traders are either bracing for large price swings or preparing to leverage new positions.

Although that kind of movement is not a guaranteed signal for where the market might head, it does show rising anticipation among traders. A market on edge can break either way, and with so much ETH flowing into derivatives, caution is now setting the tone.

Taha highlighted that this spike in derivative inflows came around the same time as a key announcement from former US President Donald Trump. Trump confirmed that he has no plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a statement that reassured markets about the independence of the Fed.

Markets quickly interpreted this as a sign that there would be less political pressure on monetary policy, a crucial factor for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. While macroeconomic signals are not everything, in a jittery market, they still carry significant weight.

Taha emphasized how closely cryptocurrency markets are tied to central bank policy and broader economic health. A measure of stability on that front could help, but technical factors still seem to be leading Ethereum's current moves.

Looking outside Ethereum, movements in the Bitcoin market could have an indirect impact on ETH's price. On April 23, more than $600 million worth of Bitcoin was transferred from whale wallets to exchanges, the largest single-day inflow seen in weeks.

This happened after a surge in the BTC/GBP trading pair, which triggered major short liquidations. According to Taha, the transfer of such a large amount of Bitcoin might suggest that the market is setting up for a fall, especially if fresh selling pressure appears.

For Ethereum, this creates the risk of a short-term pullback. If Bitcoin faces heavy selling, it could drag Ethereum and other digital assets down as well. The buildup of long positions just under Ethereum's current price levels combined with more ETH available on exchanges points to a landscape where liquidity tests are likely.

As Taha put it, “with the buildup of long liquidity below current price, and we might be looking at the classic ‘pump-then-dump' setup, at least short-term.”

AI crypto coins are on the rise again, with the sector's total market cap increasing by more than 33% in just the last two weeks.

It's worth noting that the sector's combined market cap reached a lifetime high of $70.42B in January, following which came a sharp slump. This was the absolute worst the sector had seen, with its market cap plummeting to around $21B on April 9.

However, two weeks later, the market's no more gloomy. Bitcoin has picked up pace, and so has the crypto AI niche. Its market cap has jumped back to $28.8B at the time of writing.

In this article, we'll not only dissect the latest surge in the AI crypto market but also point you towards the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from this rally.

It's not just that the prices of AI tokens have increased. According to a new CoinGecko report, there's increasing investor interest in the category as well.

Out of the top 20 crypto narratives of the first quarter of 2025, 5 were AI-related, accounting for 35.7% of total investor interest. Plus, more than 62.8% of investors' interest accounted for AI and meme coins combined.



Another study done by CoinGecko shows that 48.7% of people think that AI will be more profitable than humans in crypto trading, while 46.6% are willing to trust AI for crypto investing.

A few more mind-boggling numbers we found in CoinGecko's research paper:

This shows a change in perspective among both long- and short-term crypto participants. They're now more confident and comfortable integrating AI into their crypto investment research process.

Needless to say, this also means that now's the best time to invest in AI tokens. As is evident from the tokens mentioned above, the potential for profit is simply insane.

Herein lies an unmissable opportunity for utility-based AI coins like the ones mentioned in this guide.

MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is the best crypto to buy now if you're after a utility-based AI agent coin with the potential to do wonders for your crypto portfolio.

$MIND is an autonomous AI agent that has been designed to follow social sentiment trends and then use that to identify the top trending cryptos before they become viral.



The AI agent will do so by interacting with the crypto community on online platforms, such as dApps and X.

There, it will register the countless biases regarding the crypto market and then pour all that data into its hive-mind intelligence system.

Luckily for you, the token is currently priced at just $0.0037415. If this is your first crypto presale purchase, here's a guide on how to buy $MIND.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the newest crypto-AI partnership that promises to revolutionize the $85B subscription-based digital content industry.

Online creators today struggle with high platform fees and the pain of having to burn the midnight oil just to have a regular flow of content. Enter SUBBD.

It's a one-of-a-kind platform that offers creators a host of AI tools, such as video, voice, and image generators, as well as a profile creation feature, which they can use to upscale and automate content creation, management, and distribution.



In addition to lower fees, creators will also be able to choose between multiple modes of payment, such as pay-per-view (PPV), subscriptions, NFTs, tipping, and more.

What's more, you can also stake your $SUBBD tokens. Staking benefits include access to exclusive content from SUBBD's top talent, creator livestreams, and daily BTS drops, as well as a fixed APY of 20%.

To put it in a nutshell, SUBBD Token is powering the next generation of digital content creation using AI.

Interested? You'll be delighted to hear that the project is in the early stages of its presale ($265K+ raised), which is why you can buy $SUBBD for just $0.05525.

With a total market capitalization of over $250M, ai16z is one of the most prominent AI agent coins on the market right now. That's because it's the first venture capital firm to be run by AI agents.

Designed to disrupt traditional investment models, ai16z uses the mystical powers of AI agents and collective intelligence to gather and study market sentiments and execute trades both on-chain and off-chain.



Launched in October 2024, ai16z boasts over 1,500% in lifetime returns. However, it has made it to our list on the back of some solid recent performance.

$AI16Z is up over 70% in just the last seven days, and it's currently trading at $0.2328. As far as AI coins are concerned, this is one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now.

In addition to a mouthwatering return on your investment, holding $AI16Z also gives you governance rights. Simply put, you'll be able to vote on important decisions, including the project's future and trading strategies.

Although AI crypto coins are admittedly all the rage right now, it's not advisable to put all your eggs in one basket, especially in crypto, where there's high volatility and unpredictability.

Also, just because the segment is firing, there's no guaranteeing the performance of specific tokens. Kindly do your own research before investing. Remember, our articles are not financial advice.

Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is saying Bitcoin (BTC) is primed to continue outperforming altcoins over the near term.

Cowen tells his 894,000 YouTube subscribers that, based on the social risk metric, which gauges crypto market sentiment based on the social media activity of market participants, altcoins could continue underperforming the crypto king.

“I have often said Ethereum is sort of like the index of the altcoin market. If it's doing poorly, interest in crypto is not that high and altcoins aren't really doing that great. And you can see that as Ethereum has collapsed, so too did the social risk. So when we talk about the social interest in crypto and it being low, what it means is that altcoins will likely keep bleeding to Bitcoin.”

According to the widely followed analyst, the loosening of the US monetary policy could turn the tide in favor of altcoins.

“Despite what people say, they truly want altcoin season. That's what they want. And because they keep not getting it, altcoins keep bleeding to Bitcoin…

…in order to see this change, you need monetary policy to change, which can ultimately lead to people getting more interested in the asset class…

…the way you get monetary policy change is you get pain in the markets. We are getting pain in the markets right now. We have seen a lot of pain in the markets. And the more pain that the markets get, the higher the chance that loose monetary policy comes. But in order to see change, you have to have the pain.

Welcome to the pain. I don't know how long the pain is going to last, but it's this type of pain in the markets that you see persist over a long time that then leads to changes in monetary policy.”

The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on Saturday partnered with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by United States President Donald Trump, to advance cryptocurrency applications and boost blockchain adoption.

Trump and his affiliates hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, which launched last year. The US president has promised to regulate the industry favourably and his administration has eased enforcement actions against several big industry players.

A press release from the finance ministry said a WLF delegation visited Islamabad today and signed a letter of intent with the PCC. The delegation comprised Zachary Folkman, Chase Herro and Zachary Witkoff, the son of Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.

“[The] WLF … has signed a landmark Letter of Intent with the PCC to accelerate blockchain innovation, stablecoin adoption and decentralised finance integration across Pakistan,” the press release reads.

It added that the delegation met the prime minister, chief of army staff, deputy prime minister, information and defence ministers to formalise cooperation, “marking a major step toward positioning Pakistan as a global leader in the digital finance revolution”.

The statement said the government has signalled plans to announce comprehensive crypto legalisation policies soon, to bolster “Pakistan's position as one of the fastest-growing crypto markets in the world”.

The letter was signed during a meeting between the WLF and the PCC, which was attended by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb via video link. PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the State Bank governor were also present.

“The scope of cooperation between [the] PCC and WLF outlines collaboration in key areas including: launching regulatory sandboxes for blockchain financial product testing; facilitating the responsible growth of DeFi (decentralised finance) protocols; exploring [the] tokenisation of real-world assets like real estate and commodities; expanding stablecoin applications for remittances and trade; and providing strategic advisory on blockchain infrastructure and global regulatory trends,” the press release reads.

Aurangzeb was quoted as saying, “Pakistan's youth and technology sector are our greatest assets. Through partnerships like this, we are opening new doors for investment, innovation and global leadership in the blockchain economy.”

Saqib, meanwhile, said the agreement was “more than just a partnership, it's a strategic move to empower our young population and integrate Pakistan into the future of global finance”.

The statement said the WLF leadership praised Pakistan's dynamism, stating that Pakistan's energy, vision and talent made it one of the most exciting places in the world to build the future of decentralised finance.

The finance ministry stated that Pakistan, with 64pc of its population under the age of 30, offered one of the world's most promising digital economies.

“The country ranks among the top in global crypto adoption, with an estimated $300 billion in annual crypto transactions and 25 million active crypto users,” the press release said.

“With rising mobile penetration, a vibrant freelance economy, and strong government interest in blockchain, Pakistan's youth are uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of Web3 innovation.”

Last month, Saqib said that the country planned to legalise cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Saqib said Pakistan aimed to create “a clear regulatory framework for governing digital-asset activities to boost the local ecosystem”.

“Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines,” he said, adding that they wanted to attract international investment because the country was a low-cost high-growth market with 60pc of the population under 30.

Bitcoin started it all, but today's crypto world is packed with altcoins— each bringing new ideas and technologies to the table. This article breaks down what investors need to know.

Cryptocurrencies have grown from a small experiment into a global phenomenon. Bitcoin was the first to lead the way, a digital breakthrough created in response to financial uncertainty. But it didn't remain alone for long. A wave of digital currencies followed in its footsteps, collectively referred to as ‘altcoins.' These alternative coins represent a wide and varied world of cryptocurrencies, each bringing new ideas and technologies to the table.

For investors entering the crypto market, understanding the difference between Bitcoin and the ever-growing field of altcoins is crucial. And that is what you will learn in this article.

Launched in 2009 by the pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was the world's first decentralized digital currency. It uses powerful encryption, direct peer-to-peer connections, and scarcity to create something new and secure. With a hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin's fixed supply resembles that of precious metals, earning it the nickname ‘digital gold.'

Bitcoin's purpose is simple and profound: to serve as a store of value and allow people to send money directly to each other, without needing a bank or a middleman. It uses the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which has proven to be a strong, secure, and reliable method. Over the years, Bitcoin has become synonymous with decentralisation and full ownership of one's own money.

Altcoins, short for ‘alternative coins,' refer to every cryptocurrency that isn't Bitcoin. While some are based on Bitcoin's original code with slight changes, most are built with entirely new protocols, platforms, and ambitions.

Ethereum, for example, introduced smart contracts, self-executing agreements that run on the blockchain. XRP stands out for its specific focus on optimising cross-border financial transactions with high speed. Others like Cardano and Polkadot focus on scalable governance models, while stablecoins are linked to fiat currencies to reduce volatility.

At a glance, Bitcoin and altcoins share the blockchain foundation, but their paths diverge sharply. Below are the differences:

Navigating the crypto landscape requires more than enthusiasm; it demands insight. Bitcoin can serve as a foundation in a diversified digital asset portfolio, while altcoins open the door to new and evolving technologies that offer different types of opportunities.

This growing variety of cryptocurrencies shows how much the crypto market has evolved. Staying up to date is essential. From checking the live Bitcoin prices at Kraken to exploring altcoin performance, access to reliable data is a powerful advantage.

The difference between Bitcoin and altcoins isn't just about how they work; it's about what they stand for. Bitcoin is a solid, digital asset built to last. Altcoins are constantly evolving, testing new ideas and shaping the future of finance, identity, and ownership. As blockchain continues to revolutionise the digital economy, understanding these differences and keeping track of the cryptocurrency prices are the first steps toward making confident, well-informed investment decisions.

Despite the broader crypto market's upward movement, the NFT market is struggling, with sales volume dropping by 6.15% to $89.4 million.

At press time, Bitcoin (BTC) is above the $94,000 level. Ethereum (ETH) is up 0.4% and just below the $1,800 level. 

The global crypto market cap is now $2.97 trillion, up from last week's $2.69 trillion.

According to data from CryptoSlam, the NFT buyer count has increased by 54.33% to 391,498, while NFT sellers have grown by 45.06% to 223,311. However, NFT transactions have decreased by 10.25% to 1,404,451.

Ethereum remains the leading blockchain for NFT sales with $25.1 million. This is a 22.07% increase from the previous week. Ethereum's wash trading has surged by 57.01% to $3.4 million.

Mythos Chain has climbed to second place with $15.1 million in sales, a slight 1.21% improvement. Bitcoin has slipped to third position with $14.7 million which is a 14.18% decrease from last week.

Polygon (POL) dropped to fourth place with $9.9 million in sales, a 53.63% plunge. Solana (SOL) rounds out the top five with $9.2 million and rebounded with a 40.70% increase.

The buyer count has grown across most blockchains, with Solana leading with an 83.66% growth rate, followed by Polygon with 57.77% and Bitcoin with 52.82%.

A major shift has occurred in the collection rankings, with DMarket reclaiming the top spot with $9.9 million in sales. Courtyard on Polygon has fallen to second place with $8.8 million, a steep 55.39% drop.

The most surprising development is CryptoPunks' resurgence to third place with $3.6 million in sales. This is a 106.19% increase after its previous decline. The collection has seen across-the-board growth with transactions up 90%, buyers up 107.14%, and sellers doubling.

Guild of Guardians Heroes is fourth with $3.6 million, though sales are down 7.05%. Bitcoin's BRC-20 NFTs are fifth with $2.9 million and have fallen 21.87%.

New entrants in the top collections include Guild of Guardians Avatars, which is sixth with $1.5 million, and Pudgy Penguins, which is seventh with $1.5 million.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Nike (NKE) Faces Lawsuit Over NFT Shut Down","https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2806469/nike-nke-faces-lawsuit-over-nft-shut-down","Sat, 26 Apr 2025 06:59:24 GMT","

Nike (NKE, Financial), renowned for its innovative approach in the world of sports apparel, is currently embroiled in a significant legal battle. The company faces a lawsuit following the shutdown of its RTFKT unit, known for producing Nike-themed NFTs. Purchasers of these NFTs allege substantial financial losses, arguing the NFTs were unregistered securities. The abrupt termination of this venture, they claim, violates consumer protection laws, leading them to seek damages exceeding $5 million.



Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Nike's potential, setting a one-year average price target of $75.67. This represents a substantial 31.32% upside from its current trading price of $57.62. Estimates vary, with a high of $120.00 and a low of $40.00. For more in-depth data, you can visit the Nike Inc (NKE, Financial) Forecast page.

Consensus among 41 brokerage firms indicates an ""Outperform"" status for Nike, with an average recommendation rating of 2.4 on a 1 to 5 scale (1 being Strong Buy and 5 being Sell), reflecting market confidence in the company's future performance.

According to GuruFocus estimates, Nike's GF Value in one year is projected at $96.02. This suggests a remarkable potential upside of 66.64% from its current price. The GF Value is an authoritative gauge of a stock's fair market value, determined by historical trading multiples, past business growth, and anticipated future performance. A detailed analysis is available on the Nike Inc (NKE, Financial) Summary page.

US

Proposed class-action lawsuit alleges Nike misled buyers about security and value of its NFTs.

Nike Inc. has been hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit on Friday by purchasers of its Nike-themed non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and related crypto assets, who claim they suffered major financial losses following the abrupt shutdown of Nike's RTFKT unit.

Filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the lawsuit alleges that Nike misled buyers about the security and value of its NFTs.

Led by Australian resident Jagdeep Cheema, the plaintiffs argue that Nike's NFTs constituted unregistered securities and that they would not have purchased them had they been aware of the regulatory risks or the planned closure of RTFKT.

Nike, headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs also declined to comment.

The RTFKT unit, which Nike acquired in December 2021, was marketed as a cutting-edge digital fashion brand blending gaming, culture, and innovation.

However, Nike announced RTFKT's winddown on December 2, 2024, stating that the innovation it fostered would continue through external creators and projects.

Plaintiffs are seeking more than $5 million in damages for alleged violations of consumer protection laws in New York, California, Florida, and Oregon.

The complaint accuses Nike of ""pulling the rug out"" from under NFT purchasers and failing to properly register the tokens as securities under US law.

The legal status of NFTs remains unsettled, with several lawsuits nationwide questioning whether digital collectibles should be regulated as securities.

Key Takeaways:

Dragonchain, a blockchain platform initially developed at Disney in 2014 and later spun out, was one of many crypto projects caught up in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) assault on unregistered Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Dragonchain raised approximately $16.5 million in 2017 by selling its DRGN tokens to retail investors without going through traditional securities registration.

In 2022, the SEC sued Dragonchain and associated parties for selling unregistered securities in violation of U.S. federal law. The case formed part of a broader regulatory sweep of 2017–2018 bull run ICO projects.



A document presented by a federal court revealed both parties had agreed to a mutual stipulation of dismissal without prejudice — basically bringing the case to a close. 

Key details about the case:

Industry analysts believe ongoing legal defeats suffered by the SEC in cases involving cryptocurrencies — notably Ripple, Coinbase, and Binance — may have prompted a reevaluation of enforcement priorities.

The dismissal of the Dragonchain case arrives at a pivotal moment in the crypto industry's relationship with U.S. regulators:

Some crypto legal experts see it as a strategic retreat by the SEC in cases where prosecution has become legally and politically complex, even though the agency may continue to target newer enterprises and centralized exchanges.

Major figures in the crypto space were quick to respond:

Dragonchain's management has yet to make an official statement following the conclusion of the case. The venture, which has focused more on enterprise use cases for blockchain and solutions for interoperability in recent years, remains active, but no longer as highly publicized as it was during the bull run period of 2017–2018. Whether relief in law and new attention will suffice to power a meaningful comeback for DRGN or its home platform remains unclear.

The Trump administration is pressuring trading partners to Buy American — American energy, defense and agricultural products, that is, and as The Wall Street Journal reports, many anxious global leaders, eager to placate the commander in chief and avoid a prolonged trade war, have voiced support for the idea.

However, just as foreign leaders are saying they'll buy American goods and services, foreign investors, from Japanese pensioners to European mutual funds to state actors are Selling American — specifically American stocks, corporate debt and, worryingly, the treasury bonds America relies on to finance trillions in government spending.

Ross Perot gained political fame (or infamy, depending on who you ask) in the 1990s by arguing that the flow of factory jobs from the Midwest to Mexico from NAFTA would cause a “giant sucking sound going south.” We're hearing a new sucking sound, but this time it's capital, rather than jobs, that's whooshing out of our national doors.

Since the beginning of the year, the US dollar has weakened against nearly every major currency, falling more than 10% against the Euro and Japanese Yen, and more than 8% against the British pound. And while US stock markets are reeling under pressure from Trump's tariffs, European and British markets are up. 

Some fear the damage from tariffs to American business, US financial markets and even the dollar itself could be long lasting. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says Barry Eichengreen, an economist and professor at the University of Berkeley, adding “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.”

Predictions that current policy will lead America down the road to ruin are probably overblown. But this dollar angst raises a pressing and real concern that the US could run out of buyers for its government debt as traditional investors shun treasuries along with other US assets.

In a worst case scenario, China may even dump US debt intentionally to retaliate for tariffs, sending rates higher, impacting everything from car loans to mortgage payments. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to calm markets of these worries, saying, “If a foreign rival were weaponizing the US government bond market or attempting to destabilize it for political gain, I am sure that we would do something.”

So, the US needs to fund key government spending at reasonable rates of interest, but legacy buyers may not line up as eagerly in the future to buy the debt. Now what?

The good news is that a new buyer of US treasuries is emerging, made possible by the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Blockchain-based stablecoins are now the seventh largest buyer of US government debt, exceeding Germany, Australia and other big countries. And they're growing quickly — surpassing $200 billion in size this year and nearly $250 billion today. 

Because stablecoins are fully backed 1:1 by dollar reserves, typically US government debt, they are a persistent and growing buyer of new treasury issuances. Increasingly, government leaders see their potential. In a June 2024 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said, “Dollar-backed stablecoins are becoming an important net purchaser of US government debt.” 

To be sure, stablecoins are still a small piece of the enormous treasury market. But the trend suggests that stablecoins will continue to grow, perhaps capturing as much as 5%-10% share of the global money supply, or $5-$10 trillion, over the next decade. 

Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, the largest American stablecoin issuer, said that the stablecoin market could reach $3 trillion by 2030. For context, a $3 trillion stablecoin market would soak up more US debt than China, Japan or the UK, the three largest current owners of US government debt, combined. 

The US has benefited enormously from the US dollar being the global reserve currency. Despite accounting for about 25% of the world's GDP, the greenback is involved in most of global trade. 

At White House Crypto Summit in February, Scott Bessent said, “We are going to keep the US [dollar] the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that.” China and the rest of the world may be closing a door on America's dollar and on an old regime where the US relied on foreign governments to buy its debt. Stablecoins could be opening a window to its future.

Each mining transaction drains a massive amount of electrical power from the grid.

Crypto is all memes and moonshots until you look at how much power it uses up. 

Digital currencies like Bitcoin require an energy consumption that rivals that of entire countries. Still, there are solutions out there to clean up the field, according to The Regulatory Review.

Crypto coins are a type of digital currency that gained popularity for their nontraditional structure and as investments. A big part of their value stems from being traded on a highly secure platform called the blockchain. 

However, to get onto the blockchain, a ""mining"" process must occur, which is what gives crypto its bad energy rap. Each mining transaction drains a massive amount of electrical power from the grid. 

The energy impact is ""astronomical"" and has increased power bills in some areas by more than 30%, Suffolk University Law School professor Steven Ferrey wrote in a recent paper, per The Regulatory Review. 

Aside from making regular utilities more expensive, the power supply for cryptocurrency also comes largely from polluting sources — although some coins are greener than others. 

That reliance on dirty energy means that crypto worsens the planet's trends of rising temperatures and extreme weather events. 

Ferrey argues that there is a real structural issue here. His reasoning could fill a textbook, but the basics are that there is not enough clean energy available to handle crypto mining, in part because many regions have shot down clean electricity projects. As a result, the field's environmental impact continues to run unchecked. 

He calls this reality the ""legal dark side"" of how cryptocurrency gets its power and said that it will send the United States down the ""highway to climate hell."" 

Advocates for greener cryptocurrency, from experts like Professor Ferrey to groups like Earthjustice, Sierra Club, and the Crypto Climate Accord, all agree: Better interventions in currency mining and energy use is the best path toward a future that is safe and healthy for all.

Ferrey noted that legislating sanctions on crypto has worked in the past, as has incentivizing broad clean energy adoption. He encouraged officials to build more regulations and policies that could protect consumers from rate hikes and even leverage clean energy tax credits to move crypto miners away from polluting energy, The Regulatory Review explained.

Crypto companies can also get the benefits of clean energy directly. One study found that using solar energy for Bitcoin mining lowered developers' operating costs, and another found that they could save millions of dollars by making green investments,according to The Regulatory Review.

Bitcoin started it all, but today's crypto world is packed with altcoins— each bringing new ideas and technologies to the table. This article breaks down what investors need to know.

Cryptocurrencies have grown from a small experiment into a global phenomenon. Bitcoin was the first to lead the way, a digital breakthrough created in response to financial uncertainty. But it didn't remain alone for long. A wave of digital currencies followed in its footsteps, collectively referred to as ‘altcoins.' These alternative coins represent a wide and varied world of cryptocurrencies, each bringing new ideas and technologies to the table.

For investors entering the crypto market, understanding the difference between Bitcoin and the ever-growing field of altcoins is crucial. And that is what you will learn in this article.

Launched in 2009 by the pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was the world's first decentralized digital currency. It uses powerful encryption, direct peer-to-peer connections, and scarcity to create something new and secure. With a hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin's fixed supply resembles that of precious metals, earning it the nickname ‘digital gold.'

Bitcoin's purpose is simple and profound: to serve as a store of value and allow people to send money directly to each other, without needing a bank or a middleman. It uses the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which has proven to be a strong, secure, and reliable method. Over the years, Bitcoin has become synonymous with decentralisation and full ownership of one's own money.

Altcoins, short for ‘alternative coins,' refer to every cryptocurrency that isn't Bitcoin. While some are based on Bitcoin's original code with slight changes, most are built with entirely new protocols, platforms, and ambitions.

Ethereum, for example, introduced smart contracts, self-executing agreements that run on the blockchain. XRP stands out for its specific focus on optimising cross-border financial transactions with high speed. Others like Cardano and Polkadot focus on scalable governance models, while stablecoins are linked to fiat currencies to reduce volatility.

At a glance, Bitcoin and altcoins share the blockchain foundation, but their paths diverge sharply. Below are the differences:

Navigating the crypto landscape requires more than enthusiasm; it demands insight. Bitcoin can serve as a foundation in a diversified digital asset portfolio, while altcoins open the door to new and evolving technologies that offer different types of opportunities.

This growing variety of cryptocurrencies shows how much the crypto market has evolved. Staying up to date is essential. From checking the live Bitcoin prices at Kraken to exploring altcoin performance, access to reliable data is a powerful advantage.

The difference between Bitcoin and altcoins isn't just about how they work; it's about what they stand for. Bitcoin is a solid, digital asset built to last. Altcoins are constantly evolving, testing new ideas and shaping the future of finance, identity, and ownership. As blockchain continues to revolutionise the digital economy, understanding these differences and keeping track of the cryptocurrency prices are the first steps toward making confident, well-informed investment decisions.

              Highlights            



                        New SEC Chairman Paul Atkins pledged to create clear, innovation-friendly crypto regulations, moving away from the enforcement-driven approach of the previous administration.                      


                        Panelists at the SEC roundtable urged a shift from outdated “physical possession” custody rules toward flexible, principles-based standards that are a better fit for blockchain technology.                      


                        Industry leaders warned that without swift regulatory clarity, the U.S. risks losing blockchain innovation to foreign markets that have already embraced clearer crypto frameworks.                      

In his fourth day on the job, the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins took a pro-innovation stance on cryptocurrency in a marked departure from the prior administration's enforcement-first approach.

Speaking at the agency's third Crypto Task Force roundtable on Friday (April 25), Atkins sharply criticized the regulatory direction taken under the Biden administration and pledged to tackle the “long festering issues” surrounding digital assets and blockchain technology.

“Innovation has been stifled for the last several years due to market and regulatory uncertainty that unfortunately the SEC has fostered,” said Atkins, who previously served two terms under former President George W. Bush.

The remarks of the SEC chair set the stage for a major pivot in U.S. crypto policy, one that could encourage the growth of the digital assets market domestically rather than pushing it abroad.

Market participants “deserve clear regulatory rules of the road,” Atkins said, adding that he will work to establish a “rational fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets.”

Atkins said SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce will be leading efforts to create this framework. He praised her “principled and tireless advocacy for common sense crypto policy,” noting she has “justly earned the title of ‘crypto mom.'”

“This is important work,” he said. “As entrepreneurs across the United States are harnessing blockchain technology to modernize aspects of the financial system, I expect huge benefits from this market innovation in terms of efficiency, cost reduction, transparency and risk mitigation.”

The SEC roundtable centered on one of the thorniest regulatory challenges: how broker-dealers and investment firms can safely hold custody of digital assets in compliance with federal securities laws.

Seamus Rocca, CEO of bitcoin-enabled Xapo Bank, told PYMNTS that the SEC's renewed focus on crypto customer is a “welcome step.”

“Secure custody of digital assets isn't a technical nice-to-have — it's the foundation of investor trust. But rules must reflect reality,” Rocca said.

Crypto custody is fundamentally different from traditional finance and needs “purpose-built infrastructure, not a retrofitted playbook. While crypto exchanges may seek to provide bank-like services, it's vital to ensure that consumers are aware of the stark difference in compliance and oversight,” he added.

A big issue causing no small angst is that today's regulatory framework — built around physical possession of paper stock certificates — is not well-suited to blockchain technology. 

“We just have a different system now with the digital asset ecosystem, and it doesn't fit squarely within the rules that were written for a completely different system,” said Susan Gault-Brown, a partner at Allen Overy Shearman Sterling LLP.

Other panelists at the roundtable echoed the sentiment that traditional models of custody don't fit.

“In crypto, we've created a technological infrastructure where you don't need intermediaries and you don't need counterparties,” said Larry Florio, general counsel of 1kx, a crypto fund manager. “There's unique abilities that come with that, and there's unique risks too.”

Adam Levitin, law and finance professor at Georgetown Law, noted: “We're trying to fit a technology designed to be a peer-to-peer payment system into a system for centralized trading, and it's not a good match.”

Levitin said the traditional understanding of a custodian is someone who's going to physically hold your assets. 

“They're going to have a vault or something, and we're going to make sure that the door is a sufficient number of inches thick, and then it's fireproof for 24 hours,” he said. “That's a really different set of skills than are required to secure crypto.”

Several panelists advocated for a principles-based approach to custody regulation rather than focusing on the technology since it's hard for rules to keep up with digital advances. 

“Principles-based rule is probably better than a technology-based one (since) technology is changing quickly,” said Mark Greenberg, vice president of consumer business and product at Kraken. “Keys should be held in systems, not by people, and that means that the old rule of ‘not my keys, not my crypto' probably doesn't apply anymore in that respect.”

A recurring theme was the need for regulatory flexibility to accommodate rapid technological change. If custody rules are too prescriptive, several panelists warned, they risk becoming obsolete as technology evolves.

Several panelists said lack of regulatory clarity drives innovation overseas.

“What was probably most shameful about the last four years was that we received approvals in multiple foreign jurisdictions, and we were essentially hamstrung in our hometown,” said Baylor Myers, vice president of corporate development at BitGo. “It was really shameful and sad, and hopefully that's about to change.”

Brandon Russell, CEO of Etana Custody, agreed. He said that foreign regulators were clearer about their rules, which helped crypto firms a lot.

“If you're going to look to foreign regulation as some kind of guiding light, that's probably the biggest takeaway — there was clarification pretty early on that allowed those markets to evolve,” he said.

The filing states that the funds will be used for general corporate purposes, including Solana (SOL) token acquisitions.

According to the filing, the company may use proceeds from the offering to purchase more Solana, noting:

The company also warned that fluctuations in Solana's price could lead to it converting the tokens into cash at a value “substantially below” the net proceeds raised.

Janover was a real estate financing company connecting lenders and buyers of commercial properties before a team of former Kraken exchange executives bought 728,632 shares of its common stock on April 7. Joseph Onorati, former chief strategy officer at Kraken, has since been appointed as chairman and CEO.

The announcement comes shortly after the leadership of DeFi Development Corp adopted a Solana treasury reserve, “by applying a proven public-market treasury model to an asset that's earlier in its lifecycle, structurally reflexive, and vastly underexposed as compared to Bitcoins.”

The firm's new Solana investment treasury has drawn comparisons to Michael Saylor's Strategy, which has amassed over 538,200 Bitcoin (BTC) as of April 20 — the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder.

The firm's board of directors approved the company's Solana-focused treasury policy on April 4, authorizing long-term accumulation and the launch of Solana validators to enable the staking of its treasury asset.

Parker White, the firm's chief investment officer, who previously served as an engineering director at Kraken exchange, already runs a Solana validator with $75 million in delegated stake.

While the Solana-focused treasury implementation marks a significant step for altcoin adoption, the firm remains concerned by the potential effects of opaque crypto regulations, according to the filing:

The firm cites unclear regulations around digital assets, which may “adversely affect the price of Solana” and, in turn, impact “the market price of our common stock.”

The firm noted that Solana's potential “reclassifying” as a security remains a particular concern, which may lead to the firm being classified as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

However, the firm's share price has been benefiting from its Solana acquisitions. Its shares rose by over 12% when DeFi Development Corp added $11.5 million worth of Solana tokens to its treasury on April 22, Cointelegraph reported.

“The decision by commercial property platform Janover to add SOL to its treasury is truly groundbreaking,” Chris Chung, founder of Solana-based swap platform Titan, told Cointelegraph. “I'm confident we will see many other businesses follow suit before long as crypto becomes increasingly adopted by traditional finance.”

 Senator Cynthia Lummis' doubts about the Federal Reserve's recent decision come as many prominent crypto entrepreneurs have voiced their support. 

United States Senator Cynthia Lummis suggests the crypto industry may be celebrating too soon over the US Federal Reserve softening its crypto guidance for banks.

“The Fed withdrawing crypto guidance is just noise, not real progress,” Lummis said in an April 25 X post. Lummis called the Fed's April 24 announcement — withdrawing its 2022 supervisory letter that had discouraged banks from engaging with crypto and stablecoin activities — “just lip service.”

Lummis, a pro-crypto advocate known for introducing the Bitcoin (BTC) Strategic Reserve Bill in July 2024, pointed out several flaws in the Fed's announcement, even as Strategy founder Michael Saylor and crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano suggested it was a step forward for banks and crypto.

She argued that the Fed continues to “illegally flout the law on master accounts” and still relies on reputational risk in its bank supervision practices. It comes as the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC) is working on a rule to stop examiners from considering reputational risk when reviewing a bank's operations, according to a recent Bloomberg report.

Lummis also highlighted the Fed's policy statement in Section 9(13), which hasn't been withdrawn, stating that Bitcoin and digital assets are considered “unsafe and unsound.”

She also reiterated many of the same staff behind Operation Chokepoint 2.0 are still involved in crypto policy today.

“I will continue to hold the Fed accountable until the digital asset industry gets more than a life jacket, Chair Powell — they need a fair shake,” Lummis said.

Related: If Trump fired Powell, what would happen to crypto?

Custodia Bank founder and CEO Caitlin Long seemed to share a similar view to Lummis.

“THANK YOU for seeing this for what it is,” Long said.

However, other crypto executives praised the Fed's announcement as a positive development for the industry. Saylor said in an April 25 X post that the Fed's move means that “banks are now free to begin supporting Bitcoin.”

Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum, said the Fed's decision “is a significant development, as it will simplify the path to institutional adoption.”

The record-breaking mission offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the geology of our planet's largest layer.

If you want to understand the geology of our home planet, studying the mantle is a great place to start. Separating the planet's rocky crust and the molten outer core, the mantle makes up 70 percent of the Earth's mass and 84 percent of its volume. But despite its outsized influence on the planet's geologic processes, scientists have never directly sampled rocks from this immensely important geologic layer. 

And that's understandable, especially when you consider that the crust is roughly 9 to 12 miles thick on average. Luckily, that average contains outliers—areas of the world where the crust is actually incredibly thin and faulting exposes the mantle through cracks. One such area is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, specifically near an underwater mountain called the Atlantis Massif.  

On the south side of this massif is an area known as the Lost City—a hydrothermal field whose vent fluids are highly alkaline and rich in hydrogen, methane, and other carbon compounds. This makes the area a particularly compelling candidate for explaining how early life evolved on Earth. Additionally, it contains mantle rock that interacts with seawater in a process known as “serpentinization,” which alters the rock's structure and gives it a green, marble-like appearance. 

It was here, 800 meters south of this field, in May 2023 that members of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP)—aboard the JOIDES Resolution, a 470-foot-long research vessel rented by the U.S. National Science Foundation—extracted a 1,268-meter core containing abyssal peridotites, which are the primary rocks that make up the Earth's upper mantle. The results of the study were published in the journal Science.

Although this makes this particular drill core the deepest sample of the mantle yet, going that deep into the rock wasn't the goal of this record-breaking expedition. 

“We had only planned to drill for 200 meters, because that was the deepest people had ever managed to drill in mantle rock,” Johan Lissenberg, a petrologist at Cardiff University and co-author of the study, told Nature. He said that the drilling was so easy that they progressed three times faster than usual. The team eventually drilled a staggering 1,268 meters, and only stopped due to the mission's limited operations window. 

Andrew McCaig—study co-author and University of Leeds scientist—said in an article from The Conversation that, according to a preliminary analysis of the rock, the core's composition contains a variety of peridotite called harzburgite that forms via partial melting of mantle rock. It also contained rocks known as gabbros, which are coarse-grained igneous rocks. Both of these rocks then chemically reacted with seawater, changing their composition. 

While this core represents an incredibly opportunity to learn more about the Earth's mantle, as well as give an in-depth look at the geologic substrate upon which the Lost City rests, the mission didn't quite complete the “grand challenge” of crossing the Mohorovičić discontinuity. Otherwise known as the Moho, the Mohorovičić discontinuity is recognized as the true boundary between the crust and pristine mantle. 

Future missions could continue exploring this site near the Atlantis Massif, but sadly, those missions won't include JOIDES Resolution—the NSF declined to fund more core drilling past 2024. Just as scientists are finally knocking on the door to the Earth's most ubiquitous geologic layer, the future of these kinds of drilling missions is now uncertain.

This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The tricky thing about generating electricity is that for the most part, you pretty much have to use it or lose it.

This fundamental fact has governed and constrained the development of the world's largest machine: the $2 trillion US power grid. Massive generators send electrons along a continent-wide network of conductors, transformers, cables, and wires into millions of homes and businesses, delicately balancing supply and demand so that every light switch, computer, television, stove, and charging cable will turn on 99.95 percent of the time.

Making sure there are always enough generators spooled up to send electricity to every single power outlet in the country requires precise coordination. And while the amount of electricity actually used can swing drastically throughout the day and year, the grid is built to meet the brief periods of peak demand, like the hot summer days when air conditioning use can double average electricity consumption. Imagine building a 30-lane highway to make sure no driver ever has to tap their brakes. That's effectively what those who design and run the grid have had to do.

But what if you could just hold onto electricity for a bit and save it for later? You wouldn't have to overbuild the grid or spend so much effort keeping power generation in equilibrium with users. You could smooth over the drawbacks of intermittent power sources that don't emit carbon dioxide, like wind and solar. You could have easy local backup power in emergencies when transmission lines are damaged. You may not even need a giant, centralized power grid at all.

That's the promise of grid-scale energy storage. And while the US has actually been using a crude form of energy storage called pumped hydroelectric power storage for decades, the country is now experiencing a gargantuan surge in energy storage capacity, this time from a technology that most of us are carrying around in our pockets: lithium-ion batteries. Between 2021 and 2024, grid battery capacity increased fivefold. In 2024, the US installed 12.3 gigawatts of energy storage. This year, new grid battery installations are on track to almost double compared to last year. Battery storage capacity now exceeds pumped hydro capacity, totaling more than 26 gigawatts.

There's still plenty of room to expand—and a pressing need to do so. The power sector remains the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and there will be no way to add enough intermittent clean energy to sufficiently decarbonize the grid without cheap and plentiful storage.

The aging US grid is also in dire need of upgrades, and batteries can cushion the shock of adding gigawatts of wind and solar while buying some time to perform more extensive renovations. Some power markets are finally starting to understand all the services batteries can provide—frequency regulation, peak shaving, demand response—creating new lines of business. Batteries are also a key tool in building smaller, localized versions of the power grid. These microgrids can power remote communities with reliable power and one day shift the entire power grid into a more decentralized system that can better withstand disruptions like extreme weather.

If we can get it right, true grid-scale battery storage won't just be an enabler of clean energy, but a way to upgrade the power system for a new era.

Back in 2011, one of my first reporting assignments was heading to a wind farm in West Virginia to attend the inauguration of what was at the time the world's largest battery energy storage system. Built by AES Energy Storage, it involved thousands of lithium-ion cells in storage containers that together combined to provide 32 megawatts of power and deliver it for about 15 minutes.

“It was eight megawatt-hours total,” said John Zahurancik, who was vice president of AES Energy Storage at the time and showed me around the facility back then. That was about the amount of electricity used by 260 homes in a day.

In the years since, battery storage has increased by orders of magnitude, as Zahurancik's new job demonstrates. He is now the president of Fluence, a joint venture between AES and Siemens that has deployed 38 gigawatt-hours of storage to date around the world. “The things that we're building today, many of our projects are over a gigawatt-hour in size,” Zahurancik said.

Last year, the largest storage facility to come online in the US was California's Edwards & Sanborn Project, which can dispatch 33 GW for several hours. That's roughly equivalent to the electricity needed to power 4.4 million homes for a day.

It wasn't a steady climb to this point, however. Overall grid battery capacity in the US barely budged for more than a decade. Then, around 2020, it began to spike upward. What changed?

One shift is that the most common battery storage technology, lithium-ion cells, saw huge price drops and energy density increases. “The very first project we did was in 2008 and it was on the order of $3,000 a kilowatt-hour for the price of the batteries,” said Zahurancik. “Now we're looking at systems that are on the order of $150, $200 a kilowatt-hour for the full system install.”

That's partly because the cells on the power grid aren't that different from those in mobile devices and electric vehicles, so grid batteries have benefited from manufacturing improvements that went into those products.

“It's all one big pipeline,” said Micah Ziegler, a professor at Georgia Tech who studies clean energy technologies. “The batteries in phones, cars, and the grid all share common characteristics.” Seeing this rising demand, China went big on battery manufacturing and, much as it did in solar panels, created economies of scale to drive global prices down. China now produces 80 percent of the world's lithium-ion batteries.

The blooming of wind and solar energy created even more demand for batteries and increased the pressure to improve them. The wind and the sun are often the cheapest sources of new electricity, and batteries help compensate for their variability, providing even more reason to scale up storage. “The benefits of this relationship are apparent in the increasing number of power plants that are being proposed and that have already been deployed that combine these resources,” Ziegler said. The combination of solar plus storage accounted for 84 percent of new US power added in 2024.

And because grid batteries don't have to be small enough to be mobile—unlike the batteries in your laptop or phone—they can take advantage of cheaper, less dense batteries that otherwise might not be suited for something that has to fit in your pocket. There's even talk of giving old EV batteries a second life on the power grid.

Regulation has also helped. A major hurdle for deploying grid energy storage systems is that they don't generate electricity on their own, so the rules for how they should connect to the grid and how much battery developers should get paid for their services were messy and restrictive in the past. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order 841 removed some of the barriers for energy storage systems to plug into wholesale markets and compete with other forms of power. Though the regulation was issued in 2018, it cleared a major legal challenge in 2020, paving the way for more batteries to plug into the grid.

Eleven states to date including California, Illinois, and Maryland have also set specific procurement targets for energy storage, which require utilities to install a certain amount of storage capacity, creating a push for more grid batteries. Together, these factors created a whole new businesses for power companies, spawned new grid battery companies, and fertilized the ground for a bumper crop of energy storage.

Energy storage is the peanut butter to the chocolate of renewable energy, making all the best traits about clean energy even better and balancing out some of its downsides. But it's also an important ingredient in grid stability, reliability, and resilience, helping ensure a steady flow of megawatts during blackouts and extreme weather.

The most common use is frequency response. The alternating current going through power lines in the US cycles at a frequency of 60 hertz. If the grid dips below this frequency when a power-hungry user switches on, it can trip circuit breakers and cause power instability. Since batteries have nearly zero startup time, unlike thermal generators, they can quickly absorb or transmit power as needed to keep the grid humming the right tune.

Grid batteries can also step in as reserve power when a generator goes offline or when a large power user unexpectedly turns on. They can smooth out the hills and valleys of power load over the course of the day. They also let power providers save electricity when it's cheap to produce, and sell it back on the grid at times when demand is high and power is expensive. It's often faster to build a battery facility than an equivalent power plant, and since there are no smokestacks, it's easier to get permits and approvals.

Batteries have already proven useful for overstressed power networks. As temperatures reached triple digits in Texas last year, batteries provided a record amount of power on the Lone Star State's grid. ERCOT, the Texas grid operator, didn't have to ask Texans to turn down their power use like it did in 2023. Between 2020 and 2024, Texas saw a 4,100 percent increase in utility-scale batteries, topping 5.7 gigawatts.

Grid batteries have a halo effect for other power generators too. Most thermal power plants—coal, gas, nuclear—prefer to run at a steady pace. Ramping up and down to match demand takes time and costs money, but with batteries soaking up some of the variability, thermal power plants can stay closer to their most efficient pace, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping costs in check.

“It's kind of like hybridizing your car,” Zahurancik said. “If you think about a Prius, you have an electric motor and you have a gasoline motor and you make the gas consumption better because the battery absorbs all the variation.”

Another grid battery feature is that they can reduce the need for expensive grid upgrades, said Stephanie Smith, chief operating officer at Eolian, which funds and develops grid energy storage systems. You don't have to build power lines to accommodate absolute maximum electricity needs if you have a battery—on the generator side or on the demand side—to dish out a few more electrons when needed.

“What we do with stand-alone batteries, the more and more of those you get, you start to alleviate needs or at least abridge things like new transmission build,” Smith said. These batteries also allow the grid to adapt faster to changing energy needs, like when a factory shuts down or when a new data center powers up.

On balance this leads to a more stable, efficient, cheaper, and cleaner power grid.

As good as they are, lithium-ion batteries have their limits. Most grid batteries are designed to store and dispatch electricity over the course of two to eight hours, but the grid also needs ways to stash power for days, weeks, and even months since power demand shifts throughout the year.

There are also some fundamental looming challenges for grid-scale storage. Like most grid-level technologies, energy storage requires a big upfront investment that takes decades to pay back, but there's a lot of uncertainty right now about how the Trump administration's tariffs will affect battery imports, whether there will be a recession, and if this disruption will slow electricity demand growth in the years to come. The extraordinary appetite for batteries is increasing competition for the required raw materials, which may increase their prices.

Though China currently dominates the global battery supply chain, the US is working to edge its way in. Under the previous administration, the US Department of Energy invested billions in energy storage factories, supply chains, and research. There are dozens of battery factories in the US now, though most are aimed at electric vehicles. There are 10 US factories slated to start up this year, which would raise the total EV battery manufacturing capacity to 421.5 gigawatt-hours per year. Total global battery manufacturing is projected to reach around 7,900 gigawatt-hours in 2025.

There's also a long and growing line of projects waiting to connect to the power grid. Interconnection queues for all energy systems, but particularly solar, wind, and batteries, typically last three years or more as project developers produce reliability studies and cope with mounting regulatory paperwork delays.

The Trump administration is also working to undo incentives around clean energy, particularly the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The law established robust incentives for clean energy, including tax credits for stand-alone grid energy projects. “I do worry about the IRA because it will change the curve, and quite honestly we cannot afford to change the curve right now with any form of clean energy,” Smith said. On the other hand, Trump's tariffs may eventually spur even more battery manufacturing within the US.

Still, utility-scale energy storage is a tiny slice of the sprawling US power grid, and there's enormous room to expand. “Even though we've been accelerating and going fast, by and large, we don't have that much of it,” Zahurancik said. “You could easily see storage becoming 20 or 30 percent of the installed power capacity.”

Fujifilm's Instax cameras have taken over what Polaroid started so many decades ago. There are still Polaroid cameras, but Instax is the far more popular choice. Fujifilm's cameras are simple and fun. No matter which Instax camera you buy, it's fun. You point, you shoot, you see the results.

The latest in Fujifilm's Instax line is the new Instax Mini 41, a budget option like the very popular Mini 12, but with a more retro, camera-like design. It lacks the manual controls that photographers might want, but it's simple and fun in a way that more capable cameras often aren't.

The Mini 41 is a very plastic camera, though it doesn't look like it. The design makes it look a little like Fujifilm's insanely popular X100VI. Once you pick up the Mini 41, however, the plastic really comes out. It feels like an Instax Mini 12 in a different suit of clothes. This is both good and bad. It's good in that the simplicity and automation remain, but it's not so good in that the plasticky vibes are strong. This is definitely not the Mini 99.

The Mini 12 comes in at $80, the Mini 99 is $200, and the Mini 41 arrives at $129. Why spend more than $80 for nearly the same features? Essentially, you get a camera that looks more like a “camera.” It still has the same fully automatic features of the Mini 12, (including some not-so-good features, like the automated flash that occasionally washes out photos in bright daylight), but it doesn't have the bubbly cartoonish design of the Mini 12.

The old-school camera styling extends to some plastic knurling on the body and around the lens. This is perhaps where the plasticness comes out the most. The minute you touch it, it feels not like actual knurling but like plastic imitating knurling. If that makes sense. Baudrillard would love it. I found it functional enough, if not entirely pleasant to hold.

One big improvement over the previous model is the new lens design, which matches what we've seen in nearly every Instax released in the past year. The lens twists to turn on, then twists further if you want to put it in close-focus mode. This is simple and intuitive and much better than the push level approach of the Mini 40.

This lens offers parallax correction as well, which helps center close-up images (including selfies) by adjusting the position of the “focus” mark in the viewfinder. And fear not, kids, there is still a selfie mirror on the side of the lens.

The Mini 41 is indeed mini, measuring 4.8 by 4 inches and only 2.4 inches deep. It weighs just under a pound (15.1 ounces) with batteries and film loaded. It probably won't fit in your pant's pocket, but it was small enough that I carried it around in a jacket pocket. The batteries are AA, which is nice. Grab yourself a four-pack of rechargable AAs and you'll never have to worry about replacing the batteries.

Images eject out of the top of the camera and take about a minute and half to develop. I found the automatic focus worked well, and adjusting between normal range and close focus gives you a little extra control. (Be careful, though. The images where I did miss focus were all images where I forgot that I had it in close-focus mode.)

Ostensibly, picture quality should be on par with the Mini 12, and in many situations it is, but the Mini 41 also produced the single best image I've ever taken with an Instax camera. Call it a fluke if you want, or perhaps it was just the right combination of elements that make for a great Instax image. I kind of doubt either of those explanations, though, because I shot it into the rising sun and somehow ended up with a great image. Whatever the case, I love that image. Unfortunately my dog did, too. It's the image above with tooth marks in it—a strong argument for the Mini Evo, which would have a digital copy and allow me to reprint.

The wallet-sized image area (1.8 by 2.4 inches) of Instax Mini film does not lend itself to complex photographic compositions but should feel very familiar to anyone used to shooting portrait-oriented images, which is to say everyone. It's also the cheapest film at just over $1 per print.

If you want a budget Instax camera, with fully automatic controls that looks good and is simple to use, the new Mini 41 fits the bill. For anyone who wanted the Mini 12 but didn't want to carry around the Mini 12, this is the camera to get.

The changes from the previous model (most notably the on/off mechanism) make this a better choice. On the other hand, if you want any manual control or creative options, you'll want to look at more expensive Instax models like the Mini 99 ($200) or the Mini Evo ($200).

At a speedy event in New York City this week, Roku announced its plans for 2025, which includes two new streaming sticks, some nice software updates, and upgrades to its top two Roku TVs—most notably the value-forward Plus Series.

The new Roku Streaming Stick has two big selling points—it's compact and it's $30, but like the previous Roku Express, it's confined to HD content. That limits its value, but it could make a solid addition to a small den or kitchen TV, thanks to the addition of the Roku voice remote for searching across the breezy streaming platform. For $10 more, the similarly slim 4K UHD Streaming Stick Plus is the hotter value. Both devices can be powered by most TVs directly, meaning no need to plug them into a wall outlet, and they include new software features like a “Coming Soon to Theaters” row and personalized sports highlights.

On the TV front, Roku's top-line Pro Series TVs get a modest update, including “custom factory calibration” to ensure a more accurate picture. However, it's the affordable Plus Series that receives the more significant makeover, including the addition of mini-LED backlighting. While we'll have to put it to the test, this should help improve dimming control for better contrast and deeper black levels with less light bleed. All Roku TVs will also now include a Bluetooth headphone mode for quick sound swapping.

The new streaming sticks are available for preorder and are expected to ship on May 6, while Roku will announce new TV pricing and availability later this year. —Ryan Waniata

Meta has announced the rollout of its AI-powered real-time translation feature for the Meta Ray-Bans smart glasses to all markets. That means if you're traveling to another country, you can download the language pack and hold conversations in English, French, Italian, or Spanish without connecting to Wi-Fi or a cellular network. Just say “Hey Meta, start live translation” and you'll hear them talking in your preferred language through the speakers in the glasses, while the other person can view a translated transcript on your phone.

I've experienced Meta's translation with text before and found it adequate for reading my children's books in Spanish; Meta AI even offered, unprompted, some funny insights. When traveling, my coworker Kate Knibbs discovered that live translation is a little awkward when it's limited to the written word. Live translation with other speakers should make it much more useful.

The company also announced new frame styles and colors, like the Skyler cat-eye style in chalky gray, as well as a few more software features. You'll now be able to send and receive messages from Instagram on your glasses, ask Meta AI to play music from an expanded list of music apps (as long as you ask in English), or ask Meta AI to identify songs in passing. Meta is also expanding access to Meta AI in other countries in the European Union, as well as launching the glasses themselves in Mexico, India, and the United Arab Emirates. —Adrienne So

Kia EVs are finally part of the Tesla Supercharger club, the company has confirmed, and its cars can now access more than 21,500 of Tesla's DC fast chargers in North America.

The move, which was originally approved in January, expands Kia's charging network by more than 80 percent and sees the automaker joining the likes of Ford, Rivian, Volvo, and Mercedes-Benz in tapping into Tesla's resources.

As part of the move, the company announced that its refreshed 2025 EV6 and the 2026 EV9 will come with Tesla-compatible NACS connectors, but existing Kia EV owners with a CCS1 charging port can get adapters from their dealer. —Verity Burns

Anyone for coffee? This week, Cuisinart announced what it's touting as its very first espresso bar collection—a Mama, Papa, and Baby Bear of three bottomless portafilter machines. The range starts with a vanishingly slim profile, 15-bar EM-160 Espresso Bar Slim retailing at $230, and tops out with a $600 “Grind and Brew” EM-640 model with 16 espresso grind settings. The mid-sized $300 machine, EM-320, doesn't have a grinder but adds 5 bars of pressure compared to the Slim.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

This is hardly Cuisinart's first foray into espresso, but it does amount to a bit of a reboot for the American brand. Each device in the Espresso Bar collection comes equipped with a frothing wand, a 52-millimeter stainless steel bottomless portafilter, and an option on cold-extracted espresso for iced lattes or martini lovers. The devices offer a fairly tall profile: Cuisinart advertises that each will allow room for a 20-ounce travel mug. Likely the most distinctive of the three machines, the lowest-priced “Slim” device is less than 7 inches wide.

Tuesday was the official launch for the new line, but retailers like Williams-Sonoma and Crate & Barrel quietly added the Cuisinart appliances to their websites in mid-April—an increasingly common strategy from manufacturers who want advance reviews on retailer websites by the time the company's PR officially declares liftoff. —Matthew Korfhage

The coffee news doesn't stop there. With the fanfare and tightly controlled pre-hype usually reserved for iPhone launches, San Francisco coffee device maker Fellow announced its first espresso machine. The retro-futuristic-looking Espresso Series 1 comes in black, cherry red, or malted chocolate. It offers adaptive pressure at the coffee puck, guided brewing, and a steam wand with a thermostat that stops frothing at the designated temp.

Fellow reserved its biggest excitement for the Espresso Series 1's patented new boiler system, which the company says will offer what it calls the “holy grail of espresso”—true temperature and pressure stability, in a home espresso machine market best known for wild fluctuations and slow heat-ups.

The company's research and development head, Nick Terzulli, explained the tech at a livestreamed launch event from the company's San Francisco office. The new “boosted boiler” involves three independent heating elements combining fast heating with a thermal mass heater, a mini-boiler, and a heated group head for tight temperature control at the output. With all three in concert, Terzulli says, you can achieve the thermal stability of a commercial dual boiler on a 120-volt circuit, with less than two minutes heating time. “If you understand physics, you understand why my head is exploding inside my body, right?” Terzulli said.

The device costs $1,500, but anyone who buys during the first two weeks of the presale can reserve the Espresso Series 1 for $1,200 and get $100 in free coffee. —Matthew Korfhage

Strange things are happening over at Duolingo's headquarters. After its infamous green owl mascot faked his death earlier this year, the language learning app continues its abnormal behavior and wants to teach a new subject that transcends language: chess. It's still in early testing with a limited number of Duolingo users, but it will roll out to iOS in English in the coming weeks, with other platforms to follow in the following months.

OK, teaching chess isn't all that abnormal for Duolingo. The company began its first non-language courses in 2023 with music and math. Chess is the latest, and it continues the signature gamified learning experience the app is known for. The course is built for people who might find the game intimidating and starts with basics like how each piece moves, patterns, and strategies. You can play fast-paced mini-matches to hone your skills or full games against Duolingo's in-app chess coach.

A new app called Lately launched on the App Store a few weeks ago, targeting people with ADHD to help them arrive on time and rewarding them for doing so.

The service is designed to help users manage their travel plans by notifying them when it's time to leave for a trip, sending reminders 30 minutes, 10 minutes, and 5 minutes before departure. It also features Live Activities on iPhone and Apple Watch that display a countdown to leave.

To encourage timely departures, Lately employs a point reward system with four difficulty levels. 

The easiest level, “Goldfish,” awards users 3 points for being early, 2 points for being on time, and 0 for being late, while the other levels — “Coffee,” “Grown Up,” and “Yoda” — become progressively less forgiving. Yoda, for instance, deducts 2 points for being late. 

As users accumulate points, they level up and unlock various virtual characters within the app that serve as achievement badges. While the reward may appear simple, it may provide users with a sense of progress and accomplishment.

Lately was created by indie developer Erik MacInnis to address challenges faced by individuals with ADHD, particularly related to time management.

“I've always been the ‘late one' in my friend group,” MacInnis told TechCrunch. “For many of us, our toughest challenges to leaving on time are time blindness and poor time estimation. Lately addresses both of these problems by keeping the user constantly aware of when to leave, and it's gamified, so you get points when you arrive on time, which honestly feels good.”

While other similar apps exist — such as an Android app called Time to Leave — MacInnis believes they're outdated. ADHD apps like Structured and TickTick are mainly for task management and don't specifically address time blindness for commuting.

During our testing, we found Lately to be helpful, but we wish it could provide time estimations for commuters in large cities who use public transportation or biking. Currently, the app only offers options for driving or walking.

Despite this small limitation, we believe the app can be successful among its target demographic. 

Individuals with ADHD frequently feel unmotivated, and specialists often suggest utilizing a reward system to help with self-discipline. Another gamified app, Finch, has gained attention for its point system. The self-care app encourages users to complete daily chores at home or engage in other healthy habits by rewarding them with points that can be used to customize their virtual pet.

MacInnis revealed future plans for Lately, which include a social feature that automatically notifies friends when users leave, when they are five minutes away, and when they arrive. An Android version is also part of the long-term roadmap.

Lately is available for free, but there is also a premium subscription ($3 per month or $10 per year) that offers features like customizing difficulty levels and scheduling recurring trips.

Elon Musk's xAI Holdings is in talks to raise $20 billion in fresh funding, potentially valuing the AI and social media combo at over $120 billion, according to a new Bloomberg report that says talks are in the “early stages.” If successful, the deal would be the second-largest startup funding round ever, behind only OpenAI's $40 billion raise last month.

The funding could help alleviate X's substantial debt burden, which is costing the company a whopping $200 million monthly in servicing fees, per Bloomberg's sources, with annual interest expenses exceeding $1.3 billion by the end of last year.

A raise of this size would also showcase AI's continued investor appeal, as well as reflect Musk's surprising emergence as a political power player inside President Trump's White House.

Musk will likely draw from some of the same backers who've consistently funded his ventures, from Tesla to SpaceX, including Antonio Gracias of Valor Equity Partners and Luke Nosek of Gigafund. Gracias has even taken on a role as a lieutenant in Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.

xAI didn't respond immediately to comment.

Perhaps no one in the world has made such catastrophic tech flubs this year as U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. 

The saga started when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, reported that he had been mistakenly added to an unauthorized Signal group chat by U.S. National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, where numerous high-ranking government officials discussed detailed plans for attacking the Houthis in Yemen, including the times and places where such attacks would occur.

To be fair, we've all made some embarrassing tech mistakes. But for most people, that means accidentally liking an ex's Instagram post from five years ago — not sharing top-secret government military plans on a commercial messaging app with unauthorized recipients.

This mishandling of massively sensitive information was already troublesome enough, but this week, The New York Times reported that Hegseth shared information about the attacks on Yemen in another Signal chat, which included his lawyer, his wife, and his brother, who had no reason to receive such sensitive information; Hegseth's wife doesn't even work for the Pentagon.

These security failures are particularly egregious — how do you manage to accidentally loop in a journalist on your military plans? But this is far from the first time that contemporary technology has landed global governments in tricky situations — and we're not just talking Watergate.

The fitness tracking/social media app Strava can be a privacy nightmare, even for your average athlete. The app allows people to share their exercise logs — often runs, hikes, or bike rides — on a public account with their friends, who can like and comment on their morning jogs in the park.

But Strava accounts are public by default, meaning that if you aren't savvy enough to check your privacy settings, you will inadvertently broadcast to the world exactly where you work out. Strava defaults to hiding the first and last 200 meters of a run as a means of obscuring where someone lives, since people are likely to begin and end runs near their home.

For anyone on the internet, it's still risky to broadcast a 200-mile radius of where you live, but it's even more dangerous if you're a member of the military at a secret base, for instance.

In 2018, Strava unveiled a global heat map, showing where in the world public users have logged activities. This doesn't really matter if you're looking at a map of New York City, but in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, few people use Strava aside from foreigners, so one can assume that hot spots of activity may occur at or around military bases.

Okay here is where things get problematic: Via Strava, using pre-set segments we can scrape location specific user data from basically public profiles (and yes those exist w/in bases and lead us straight so social media profile of service members). https://t.co/VDNBGcKvIY

To make matters worse, users could look at certain running routes on Strava to see the public profiles of the users who logged activities there. So, it would be possible for a bad actor to find a list of U.S. soldiers stationed at a certain base in Iraq, for example.

Venmo is a peer-to-peer payments app, yet for some reason, it defaults to publicly sharing your transactions. So, by simply opening my Venmo app — which synced my Facebook friends to my account at some point, probably over 10 years ago — I can see that two girls I went to high school with got dinner together last night. Good for them.

The information we share on Venmo can be pretty boring and benign, but dedicated fans of reality shows like “Love Is Blind” will search for contestants' accounts to predict who from the show is still dating (if the couple sends each other rent money, then yes, they probably live together).

So, if you can find reality stars on Venmo, why not search for the president? 

In 2021, some BuzzFeed News reporters decided to search for Joe Biden's Venmo. Within 10 minutes, they found his account.

From Biden's account, the reporters could easily find other members of the Biden family and his administration and map out their broader social circles. Even if a user makes their account on Venmo private, their friends list will remain public. When BuzzFeed News contacted the White House, Biden's profile was wiped clean, but the White House didn't provide a comment.

So, yes, reporters did indeed locate the Venmo accounts of Pete Hegseth, Mike Waltz, and other government officials, too. Some things never change.

You can take all of the precautions you want to protect your messages, but nothing can save you from the looming possibility of human error.

Carles Puigdemont, the former president of Catalonia, led a movement in 2017 to attain independence from Spain and become its own country. But the Spanish government blocked this attempt and ousted Puigdemont from leadership. When the Spanish government issued a warrant for the arrest of Puigdemont and his allies, they fled to Belgium.

A few months later, the Spanish media attended an event in Belgium where Puigdemont was expected to speak — he sent in a video of a speech instead, but as the clip was playing, a Spanish broadcaster noticed that a former Catalan health minister, Toni Comín, was texting with his screen fully visible.

The camera operator zoomed in on Comín's phone, exposing texts from Puigdemont, where he had resigned himself to defeat in his attempts to bring about Catalan independence. 

Puigdemont later tweeted that he was expressing himself in a moment of doubt but that he didn't intend to back down.

No matter what steps you take to encrypt your private messages, you might want to look over your shoulder before reading sensitive information in public — especially when you're texting with a self-exiled former president.

Amazon is raising eyebrows with the timing of its big book sale for 2025, which runs from April 23 to 28 — which means it's competing directly with Independent Bookstore Day.

As writer Maris Kreisman explained in Lit Hub, Independent Bookstore Day is an annual event organized by the American Booksellers Association (ABA), with events, special guests, and exclusive merchandise at 1,600 participating bookstores. And this year, it's taking place on April 26 (today).

“I implore you: if you live near an indie bookstore (and I know that many of us still don't and I hope one day we all do), you must go,” Kreizman said.

Indie bookstores do appear to be on the upswing in the United States, at least according to last year's numbers from the ABA. But of course, Amazon remains dominant — in 2020, a House committee estimated that the company controlled more than 50% of the total online and offline print book market, and it's even more dominant in e-books.

So it's not exactly a good look for the company to time its big sale to compete with a nationwide, celebratory bookstore event.

In fact, Bookshop.org — an Amazon competitor that partners with indie bookstores — emailed customers with a note from CEO Andy Hunter describing Amazon's sale as “a calculated move by a company that has already put half the bookstores in the country out of business, controls over 60% of the market and sells far more books than all indie bookstores combined.”

“The people at Amazon responsible for the timing of their ‘Book Sale' should be ashamed, but they are shameless,” Hunter said.

Amazon, however, released a statement describing the timing overlap as “unintentional”: “The dates for our sale were set this year to accommodate additional participating countries.”

Given the company's scale, it's certainly possible that Independent Bookstore Day barely registered with the people scheduling the sale. Even so, ABA CEO Allison Hill told Vulture, “At best it's insensitive and at worst it seems like a tactic to hurt small businesses.”

Move over, PayPal mafia: There's a new tech mafia in Silicon Valley. As the startup behind ChatGPT, OpenAI is arguably the biggest AI player in town. Its meteoric rise to a $300 billion valuation has spurred many employees to leave the AI giant to create startups of their own.

The hype around OpenAI is so high that some of these startups, like Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence and Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab, have been able to raise billions of dollars without even launching a product. 

But there are lots of other startups in the OpenAI mafia ecosystem. These range from AI search giant Perplexity to xAI, the new owner of X (formerly Twitter.) There's also smaller outfits with some futuristic plans, like Living Carbon, which is creating plants that suck more carbon out of the atmosphere, or Prosper Robotics, which is building a robot butler.

Below is a roundup of the most notable startups founded by OpenAI alumni.

Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in 2021 to form their own startup, San Francisco-based Anthropic, that has long touted a focus on AI safety.  Later, OpenAI co-founder John Schulman joined Anthropic in 2024, pledging to build a “safe AGI.” OpenAI reportedly remains multiple times larger than Anthropic by revenue ($3.7 billion compared to $1 billion for 2024, The Information reported). But Anthropic has quickly grown to become OpenAI's biggest rival and was valued at $61.5 billion in March 2025.

OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever left OpenAI in May 2024 after he was reportedly part of a failed effort to replace CEO Sam Altman. Shortly afterward, he co-founded Safe Superintelligence, or SSI, with “one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence,” he says. Details about what exactly the startup is up to are scant: It has no product and no revenue yet. But investors are clamoring for a piece anyway, and it's been able to raise $2 billion, with its latest valuation reportedly rising to $32 billion this month. SSI is based in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel.

Mira Murati, OpenAI's CTO, left OpenAI last year to found her own company, Thinking Machines Lab, which emerged from stealth in February 2025, announcing (rather vaguely) that it will build AI that's more “customizable” and “capable.” The San Francisco AI startup has no product or revenue but plenty of former top OpenAI researchers and is reportedly in the process of raising a massive $2 billion seed round valuing it at $10 billion, minimum.

Aravind Srinivas worked as a research scientist at OpenAI for a year until 2022, when he left the company to co-found AI search engine Perplexity. His startup has attracted a string of high-profile investors like Jeff Bezos and Nvidia, although it's also caused controversy over alleged unethical web scraping. Perplexity, which is based in San Francisco, is currently raising about $1 billion at an $18 billion valuation as of March 2025. 

Kyle Kosic left OpenAI in 2023 to become a co-founder and infrastructure lead of xAI, Elon Musk's AI startup that offers a rival chatbot, Grok. In 2024, however, he hopped back to OpenAI. Palo Alto-based xAI recently acquired X, formerly Twitter, and gave the combined entity a valuation of $113 billion. The all-stock transaction raised some eyebrows but is a good deal if you're betting on Musk's empire.

Emmett Shear is the former CEO of Twitch who was OpenAI's interim CEO in November 2023 for a few days before Sam Altman rejoined the company. Shear is working on his own stealth startup, called Stem AI, TechCrunch revealed in 2024. Although there are few details about its activity and fundraising so far, it has already attracted funding from Andreessen Horowitz.

Computer vision expert Andrej Karpathy was a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI, leaving the startup to join Tesla in 2017 to lead its autopilot program. Karpathy is also well-known for his YouTube videos explaining core AI concepts. He left Tesla in 2024 to found his own education technology startup, Eureka Labs, a San Francisco-based startup that is building AI teaching assistants.

Jeff Arnold worked as OpenAI's head of operations for five months in 2016 before co-founding San Francisco-based accounting startup Pilot in 2017. Pilot, which focused initially on doing accounting for startups, last raised a $100 million Series C in 2021 at a $1.2 billion valuation and has attracted investors like Jeff Bezos. Arnold worked as Pilot's COO until leaving in 2024 to launch a VC fund.

David Luan was OpenAI's engineering VP until he left in 2020. After a stint at Google, in 2021 he co-founded Adept AI Labs, a startup that builds AI tools for employees. The startup last raised $350 million at a valuation north of $1 billion in 2023, but Luan left in late 2024 to oversee Amazon's AI agents lab after Amazon hired Adept's founders.

Tim Shi was an early member of OpenAI's team, where he focused on building safe artificial general intelligence (AGI), according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked at OpenAI for a year in 2017 but left to found Cresta, a San Francisco-based AI contact center startup that has raised over $270 million from VCs like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and others, according to a press release.

The trio all worked at OpenAI in 2016 and 2017 as research scientists before founding Covariant, a Berkeley, California-based startup that builds foundation AI models for robots. In 2024, Amazon hired all three of the Covariant founders and about a quarter of its staff. The quasi acquisition was viewed by some as part of a broader trend of Big Tech attempting to avoid antitrust scrutiny. 

Maddie Hall worked on “special projects” at OpenAI but left in 2019 to co-found Living Carbon, a San Francisco-based startup that aims to create engineered plants that can suck more carbon out of the sky to fight climate change. Living Carbon raised a $21 million Series A round in 2023, bringing its total funding until then to $36 million, according to a press release.

Shariq Hashme worked for OpenAI for 9 months in 2017 on a bot that could play the popular video game Dota, per his LinkedIn profile. After a few years at data-labeling startup Scale AI, he co-founded London-based Prosper Robotics in 2021. The startup says it's working on a robot butler for people's homes, a hot trend in robotics that other players like Norway's 1X and Texas-based Apptronik are also working on.

Jonas Schneider led OpenAI's software engineering for robotics team but left in 2019 to co-found Daedalus, which builds advanced factories for precision components. The San Francisco-based startup raised a $21 million Series A last year with backing from Khosla Ventures, among others.

Margaret Jennings worked at OpenAI in 2022 and 2023 until she left to co-found Kindo, which markets itself as an AI chatbot for enterprises. Kindo has raised over $27 million in funding, last raising a $20.6 million Series A in 2024. Jennings left Kindo in 2024 to head product and research at French AI startup Mistral, according to her LinkedIn profile.

It is extremely difficult to find a high-quality electric scooter for under $200 anymore, especially in 2025 when the most popular ones easily cost over $500.

But Amazon is currently offering the Maxshot electric scooter for just $199 which is a huge 29% discount from its regular price of $279. This great deal has made it the #1 best seller in its category and shows just how popular (and value-for-money) this scooter is. Also keep in mind that this is the record low price for this model.

See at Amazon

The Maxshot electric scooter is built to meet the needs of daily commuters and weekend adventurers. It is fitted with 8.5-inch tires, for a smooth and stable ride on urban roads and rough surfaces. The scooter comes in models with a 350W motor which allows riders the choice of the power and speed level that suits their lifestyle. At a top speed of 19 to 22 mph, it's fast enough to keep up with city traffic but slow and safe enough to maneuver for most adults.

Depending on your journey, you can ride anywhere between 21 to 28 miles per charge which is more than most people commute, run errands or enjoy leisure rides for each day. The dual suspension provides you with a smooth ride even on bumpier roads and holds fold which makes it easy to carry onto public transportation or store in small crevices at home or in the office.

The Maxshot scooter also comes equipped with a smart app so that you can monitor speed, battery, and ride statistics from your smartphone. That level of connectivity is typically reserved on much more expensive scooters so it's even more astonishing to see it featured here at this $200 price point. Safety hasn't been left behind either: there is decent braking and decent lights for nighttime riding or low-light conditions.

If you've been waiting for the ideal moment to invest in an electric scooter, this is the opportunity you really don't want (and should not) to miss. Deals like this, especially on a best-selling and feature-packed model, don't come around frequently. At $199, this electric scooter offers a combination of performance, range, and smart features that's practically never found at this price.

There are still a couple of times a year when having a decent printer handy can be a lifesaver. Whether printing important documents, last-minute forms or vital reports, the need hasn't disappeared completely.

Instead of spending $500 on a pricey model, there is a better and less expensive option: the HP LaserJet M209d. This black and white compact laser printer is now available on Amazon for just $69, which is a huge 42% markdown from its original price of $119.

See at Amazon

The compact size of this laser printer enables it to find a comfortable home in any small work space or home office without occupying much real estate. Although small in stature, the HP M209d offers breathtaking speed and quality. With a print speed of up to 30 pages per minute for single-sided prints and up to 19 images per minute for automatic duplex printing, you'll not be kept waiting long for your documents to finish. The initial page is out in as little as 6.9 seconds.

The HP LaserJet M209d produces clear black-and-white prints at a resolution of 600 x 600 dpi which is perfect for text documents, forms, and business reports. The printer has a 150-sheet paper input tray, which means that you will not need to reload paper frequently – not even for large print jobs. The output tray can hold up to 100 sheets and the device supports numerous media sizes and types.

The HP LaserJet M209d is simple to install: The printer is plugged into your computer with the supplied USB cable and does not require complicated wireless installation. Only when required, smart-guided control panel buttons illuminate and allows simple usage even for those who are not tech-savvy. HP's Auto-On/Auto-Off technology makes the printer power efficient, switching on when in use and off when idle.

Who hasn't been left stranded with a dead phone in the worst possible moment? If you're traveling, working late hours or just hanging with friends, a dead battery is a real nuisance. The good news is that now there's an inexpensive way to guarantee you'll never again go through that inconvenience. For just $15 on Amazon, down from $24 (36% off the normal price), you can buy the INIU portable charger which is one of the top-rated power banks on the market.

See at Amazon

What's really amazing about this deal isn't the price but the quality and features packed into such a small package. This charger is the thinnest 10,000mAh power bank available on the market right now, just 0.5 inches thick. That means it can slip into any pocket, bag or backpack and is perfect for daily commutes or extended flights. Despite its ultra-slim profile, this power bank packs enough juice to fully recharge all the latest iPhone 16, Galaxy S25 and more, several times.

The speed is also very impressive: Because of its 3A high-speed charging, you can charge your phone up to 78% in an hour twice as fast as with most standard chargers. Power bank's AutoFit technology automatically detects and delivers the optimal charging speed for your device so you get the fastest (and safest) charge every time.

Safety is INIU's top priority and this power bank has a unique 15-layer SmartProtect system: The advanced safety net guards against overheating, overcharging, and damaging your batteries so that you can charge your devices with complete confidence. There's also a top-tier three-year warranty which gives you confidence that this power bank is built to last and will keep your devices safe.

As you'd probably imagine, this power bank is compatible with most devices including the latest iPhones and Samsung Galaxies, Pixels, iPads, Bluetooth headphones, fitness trackers, and more. Whether you have to charge your phone, tablet or even smaller devices like AirPods and smartwatches, the INIU power bank will be able to accommodate that.

Deals this good don't last long – and with this charger, you'll never have to worry about running out of battery again.

If you've been waiting for the perfect moment to upgrade your kitchen with a top-rated air fryer, now is the perfect time to act. The COSORI air fryer 9-in-1 is one of the most popular (if not the most popular) models on the market, and it is currently on sale for just $89 on Amazon.

This is only $2 cheaper than its record low price history and a huge decrease from its standard $119 price tag, so this sale is just too good to pass up. Over 20,000 units alone have sold so far this month, and clearly, this air fryer is a home cooking enthusiast who is looking for convenience.

See at Amazon

The COSORI 9-in-1 air fryer has a revolutionary TurboBlaze technology, boasting a 3600 rpm fan and up to 450°F temperatures. The combination of these two technologies yields perfectly crispy and juicy results whether air frying chicken wings, roasting vegetables or baking desserts. The higher airflow system and precise temperature control make sure each dish cooks with perfect consistency so you've consistent textures and flavors with every bite. With nine separate functions including air fry, roast, bake, broil, dehydrate, proof, reheat, frozen, and keep warm, this machine wipes out an array of kitchen appliances and enables you to experiment with an unlimited amount of recipes.

The COSORI's state-of-the-art five-fan speed design and wide temperature range of 90°F to 450°F let you cook slow-proofed dough to quickly crispy snacks. The compact yet spacious 6-quart square basket allows enough space to cook family-serving sizes without claiming too much precious counter real estate. Its deeper and broader build means you can prepare more in a single sitting which makes it ideal for families or those who love meal prep.

With TurboBlaze technology, cooking times are significantly less than with old-fashioned ovens or even other air fryers. This lets you cook perfectly crispy fries or a batch of chicken tenders in record time even on the most hectic weeknights. All that power and the air fryer still operates at under 53 dB so your kitchen is quiet and comfortable.

Health-conscious chefs will appreciate that this air fryer uses up to 95% less oil than deep frying so you can enjoy all your favorite crispy foods with a lot less guilt. The nonstick basket and the accessories are dishwasher-safe. A customizable preheat function offers the option to optimize results or skip preheating for an even faster start.

This COSORI air fryer is not frequently priced below $119, so to be able to get it today for $89 is a really great opportunity.

If you've been considering swapping out your home sound system (or simply seeking a better way to watch movies), you need to take a good hard look at this sale on the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar.

Today, Amazon is offering this very popular soundbar for just $98 which is a record-low and a staggering 25% off its normal price ($129). With the tariffs increase looming that would soon enough apply to all electronics, having this type of deal now is a wise move not to be hurt by any shock later.

See at Amazon

The Sony S100F is an excellent choice if you're looking to upgrade the sound of your TV without the hassle of a traditional home theater system. Thin (35.5 inches wide by 2.5 inches high) but powerful, this soundbar delivers robust and clean sound from its 120W S-Master digital amplifier and 2.0 channel design. The S100F's internal Bass Reflex speaker lets you experience rich and punchy bass without sacrificing clarity. You will also love the S100F voice boost feature so that every word can be heard clearly and loudly.

It's super easy to install the S100F and the installation as straightforward and uncomplicated as it gets: It hooks into your TV via just an HDMI ARC cable, keeping things tidy and cable-free. You can also connect it using the supplied optical cable or USB input if you wish. The S-Force Pro Front Surround technology used in the soundbar creates a virtual surround sound for a sound that envelops your room but is much bigger than something of its size would provide.

One of the great things about the Sony S100F is that it is Bluetooth-enabled: That means the soundbar is not just for TV use-only-you can also plug in your smartphone or laptop and use it as a powerful wireless speaker. The Bluetooth connectivity makes it very convenient. The soundbar also supports USB playback so you can plug in a flash drive and play your favorite albums immediately.

While tariffs on electronics rise, those kinds of sales are not common. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock.

If you're looking to turbocharge your PC, laptop, or PlayStation 5 with the kind of storage performance that leaves loading screens in the dust, now's your chance to do it! Amazon's Easter weekend flash sales have dropped the Samsung 990 PRO 2TB internal SSD to just $169 which is a massive 32% off its usual $249. And if your storage needs are a little more modest, the 1TB version is also on sale for a low $99, a great 38% discount from its regular price of $159. The 4TB model is at $299 down from $464. With upcoming tariff hikes likely push electronics prices even higher in the US, this is a great opportunity you should not miss.

The 2TB Samsung 990 PRO is the undisputed star of this flash sale: It's not just the abundance of storage that makes it stand out but also the sheer performance packed into this slender M.2 drive. With up to 7,450 MB/s sequential reads and up to 6,900 MB/s sequential writes, it's built to take full advantage of the PCIe 4.0 interface and makes it perect for everything from massive game libraries and 4K video editing projects to lightning-quick system load times.

Random read and write speeds reach as high as 1.4 million and 1.55 million IOPS, respectively, which means you'll experience nearly instantaneous file transfers and app launches even when juggling huge datasets. Samsung's V-NAND technology and a robust 2GB DDR4 cache ensure that performance remains consistent even during long and intensive sessions.

What you will absolutely love about the Samsung 990 PRO (be it the 1 or 2TB model) is its power efficiency: You get up to 50% more performance per watt over the previous 980 PRO, all while remaining cool thanks to Samsung's smart nickel-coated controller and improved thermal control. This drive is built to last, too, with a 1,200 TBW endurance rating and a five-year warranty that makes it a good investment if you need storage that will be able to keep up with years of heavy use. If you're a gamer, you will appreciate up to 65% improved random performance for faster load times.

Keep in mind that the 1TB and 2TB capacities are all supported by Samsung's Magician software which offers easy access to optimization tools, health indication, and firmware updates to ensure your SSD continues to perform at its best.

These short-term sales are well-timed given the current market scenario. With tariff increases just around the corner, prices of high-end electronics like SSDs are going to increase massively in the near future. Amazon's Easter weekend sale is maybe the last-chance to grab these high-end drives at a fraction of their usual price before new stock arrives at increased prices. Even compared to Black Friday, these deals stand out as some of the best we've seen all year.

The Ryzen 5 7533HS is a new Rembrandt-R-based APU that AMD quietly introduced to the market last year and is just now appearing in budget laptops via realVictor_M at X. To clarify, this isn't exactly a brand-new chip; it is simply a rebadged Ryzen 5 7535HS, with lower boost clocks and presumably a more attractive price tag for partner(s).

The Ryzen 5 7533HS breaks away from AMD's original naming convention for the Ryzen 7000/8000 series, where the last digit was used to indicate versions within an architecture ('0' for the lower model and '5' for the upper model), like Zen 3 (7530) versus Zen 3+ (7535). This isn't entirely surprising as AMD has a history of abandoning naming schemes, evident with their latest shift to ""Ryzen AI"". The Ryzen 5 7533HS is tagged under the Rembrandt-R family, with Zen 3+ cores and an RDNA 2-based iGPU.

In terms of specifications, the Ryzen 5 7533HS is nothing special. It wields a six-core / twelve-thread layout, along with 3MB of L2 and 16MB of L3 cache. The included Radeon 660M iGPU offers six RDNA2-based Compute Units. There's a 150 MHz drop in boost clocks compared to the Ryzen 5 7535HS. As the 'HS' modifier indicates, the APU has a configurable TDP between 35W and 54W, with support for DDR5-4800 (SODIMM) and LPDDR5-6400 (Soldered RAM) memory types.

While the Ryzen 5 7533HS won't certainly top any performance charts, it still appears to be a solid choice for affordable laptops. On that note, this chip has only appeared in several of Lenovo's newest laptops, like the ThinkBook 16 Gen 7, IdeaPad Slim 3/5, just to name a few. This strongly hints at Lenovo exclusivity, and that's not surprising considering that rumors suggest AMD's latest Ryzen Z2 Go, launched in January, was developed explicitly for Lenovo's Legion Go S.

As it stands, AMD's mobile portfolio looks something like this (in order of descending price and performance): Strix Halo (Ryzen AI Max), Strix Point (Ryzen AI 360/370), Krackan Point (Ryzen AI 340/350), Hawk Point (Ryzen 200), and Rembrandt-R (Ryzen 7035). There might be some shuffling with a potential Gorgon Point (Strix Point Refresh), but don't expect any massive changes until Medusa Point (Zen 6 APUs).

As the opioid crisis continues, the number of babies born with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) – a condition that affects infants whose mothers used opioids during pregnancy – has risen 5-fold over the past 20 years. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there are 20,000 infants a year in the United States born with signs of NOWS. These infants often require extended hospital stays and, in some cases, treatment with medications like morphine to relieve withdrawal symptoms.

A new study from Walter Kraft, MD, an internist and clinical pharmacologist at Thomas Jefferson University, and his team further explored the potential of ondansetron, a medication commonly used to treat nausea and considered safe during pregnancy, to help reduce withdrawal symptoms in newborns with NOWS.

The research expands on data from Dr. Kraft's previous work, along with collaborators at Stanford University, of a clinical trial conducted at Jefferson and other sites. That study explored the impact of ondansetron in 90 infants and found that it significantly reduced the severity of withdrawal symptoms. 

The current investigation, led by first author Kevin Lam, PharmD, used Bayesian population pharmacokinetic modeling – a mathematical method that describes how different patients process a drug – to identify the concentration of ondansetron that would lead to symptom relief. The model can be used to simulate optimized ondansetron doses.

In the past, we might have used gut intuition and said, 'Let's just double the dose'. Now we can use mathematical modeling to be much more likely to find an effective dose and require fewer patients to enroll in a clinical trial.""

Dr. Walter Kraft, MD, internist and clinical pharmacologist at Thomas Jefferson University

Dr. Kraft, who is also a faculty member at Sidney Kimmel Medical College, says his team is seeking funding for future clinical trials to explore whether ondansetron can reduce the number of symptoms experienced by infants with NOWS or shorten their hospital stay.

""This is a complex medical and societal issue. There's unlikely to be a single solution,"" Dr. Kraft said. ""We're optimistic that ondansetron may be part of a multi-pronged approach to improving care for these infants.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Blood proteins offer early warning for liver disease","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250425/Blood-proteins-offer-early-warning-for-liver-disease.aspx","Sat, 26 Apr 2025 01:20:00 GMT","

Scientists have identified five specific blood proteins that can accurately predict a person's risk for developing a serious form of liver disease as early as 16 years before they experience symptoms, enabling early intervention and possible prevention and treatment, according to a study to be presented at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) 2025.

The findings address metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which has become the most common form of liver disease worldwide and is continuing to increase. People with MASLD face up to twice the mortality rate of those without the disease.

Imagine if we could predict risk of MASLD years before it starts. Too often, people do not find out they are at risk for liver disease before they are diagnosed and coping with symptoms. The field urgently needs effective biomarkers and predictive models, and our research shows that plasma proteins offer novel potential strategies for early prediction and intervention.""

Shiyi Yu, MD, resident physician, department of gastroenterology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, China

Researchers analyzed blood samples from more than 50,000 participants in the UK Biobank. They followed their health records for more than 16 years, identifying levels and combinations of proteins in the blood associated with developing liver disease later in life. Screening more than 2,700 proteins, they found five - CDHR2, FUOM, KRT18, ACY1, and GGT1 - that appear to be early warning signals for MASLD. The combined levels of these five proteins achieved 83.8% accuracy at predicting disease five years from onset and 75.6% accuracy at predicting 16 years ahead of diagnosis. Adding clinical biomarkers such as body mass index and daily exercise amount to the protein levels achieved even greater accuracy of 90.4% at five years and 82.2% at 16 years.

""We achieved similar results when we tested this predictive model in a separate cohort of people in China, further supporting the robustness of the model and showing it can be effective across diverse populations,"" Dr. Yu said.

As an observational study, the research does not demonstrate a causal connection between the plasma proteins and the development of liver disease. Further research is underway to explore possible pathways.

Dr. Yu will present data from the study, ""Plasma proteomic profiles predict metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease up to 16 years before onset,"" abstract 323, at 8 a.m. PDT, Sunday, May 4.

...

Chelsea's stance on a possible swoop for Kevin De Bruyne has been revealed in a new report as the Manchester City midfielder prepares for a new chapter ahead of leaving the club in the coming months.

De Bruyne is set to part ways with the four-in-a-row Premier League champions after being told he is not part of Pep Guardiola's plans for the 2025-26 campaign, with the 33-year-old having struggled for fitness and consistency in the last 12-18 months.

The Belgium international has – since announcing his upcoming departure – revealed he was left shocked when club bosses relayed their decision on his future as De Bruyne holds a firm belief he still has plenty to offer and compete at the highest level.

     

It remains to be seen where the six-time Premier League winner will be playing next season as clubs across Europe, Saudi Arabia and the United States queue up to secure the arrival of one of the world's best midfielders.

Aston Villa are the latest club in the Premier League known to have held internal talks over a potential move for De Bruyne after the Belgian refused to rule out staying in England and joining one of Manchester City's direct rivals.

Clubs in the Major League Soccer and Saudi Arabia have held a long-standing interest in the Manchester City midfielder, who is believed to prefer the United States to settle his family over Saudi Arabia as a destination.

De Bruyne is also understood to be wary of featuring for Manchester City in the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States between June and July – as a precaution to avoid any further injury setbacks that could derail him joining his next club.

As a result, the playmaker has reportedly informed Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola of his desire to leave the club at the end of their Premier League campaign so as to recover and take some time off with his family to assess offers and make a decision on his future.

Elsewhere in the Premier League, Chelsea are unlikely to make a move for De Bruyne and bring their former player back to Stamford Bridge ahead of what is expected to be a busy summer of transfer dealings in west London, as reported by Matt Law writing for the Daily Telegraph.

De Bruyne joined Chelsea from boyhood club Genk in 2012 and after a loan spell at German side Werder Bremen, the midfielder was deemed surplus to requirements by then Blues manager Jose Mourinho, who sold De Bruyne to Wolfsburg in January 2014.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

In a world where image is currency, Qatar has built itself a gleaming facade. From hosting the 2022 World Cup to owning elite clubs like Paris Saint-Germain and pouring billions into European football leagues, this small Gulf nation has placed itself center stage on the global map.But behind the glittering surface of stadiums, billboards, and superstar athletes lies a far more troubling reality. According to multiple reports in the American press, Qatar is not just an emerging sports powerhouse; it is also a key player in financing international terrorism. And sports, it seems, are a convenient smokescreen.  As early as 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported: “Qatar is playing a double game – on one hand presenting itself as a modern global hub and on the other, continuing to funnel money to terror groups like Hamas and al-Qaeda.”Is the soccer field being used as a political tool?Ahead of the 2022 World Cup, The New York Times noted that “Qatar's use of soccer is not just a marketing tactic – it is a political instrument for shaping a new global narrative.” Football is no longer just a pastime or investment; it is a statecraft strategy. AdvertisementQatar Sports Investments, the nation's sovereign wealth fund, owns Paris Saint-Germain and ranks among the most influential entities in global sports. Beyond sports, Qatar has made massive investments in Western media and infrastructure – including direct stakes in ESPN, hotel chains in London, real estate in Manhattan, and global advertising networks – all designed to secure vast cultural influence.

(credit: REUTERS/FABRIZIO BENSCH)However, the question remains: How does the United States, which maintains a major military base in Qatar, continue to turn a blind eye to this double game? How can the world's leading superpower allow this tiny nation to serve as a lifeline for extremist Islam? Qatar often labels its financial transfers to Gaza as “humanitarian aid.” However, a 2020 US Treasury report revealed that significant portions of those funds ended up in the hands of Hamas, used for military purposes such as paying salaries to terrorists, digging tunnels, and producing rockets.In the American press, Qatar is frequently cited as the principal financial backer of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement linked to numerous terror attacks in Europe over the past decade.What's most alarming is the West's silence in the face of this mounting threat to the free world. AdvertisementCountries ignore the darker side of the Qatari regimeMANY COUNTRIES benefit from Qatari investments and prefer to ignore the darker side of its regime. Some even reward Qatar with awards, contracts, and favorable media coverage.One of the organizations receiving Qatari patronage is the International Union of Muslim Scholars. Founded in 2004 and headed by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, the union's clerics have consistently claimed that Palestinian suicide bombings against Israelis are istishhad (martyrdom) and that Hamas is not a terrorist organization.In his latest publication, the union's current head, Sheikh Ali al-Qaradaghi, elaborated on the importance of issuing a fatwa (legal ruling) calling for jihad against the “Zionist enemy.” Among his declarations: “It is the duty of every able Muslim in the Islamic world to take up arms against the occupation in Palestine.” The fatwa further states that a full blockade by land, sea, and air must be imposed on the Zionist occupier.  The union is headquartered in Qatar, enjoys Qatari funding, and its leader resides in Doha.Qatar's influence over Europe has also grown, particularly in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which forced the European Union to urgently seek alternatives to Russian gas. As of Q2 this year, Qatar ranks as the EU's third-largest supplier of liquefied natural gas, trailing only the US and Russia.At the same time, several mosques across Europe funded by Qatar have become hubs of radicalization and terrorist sympathies.Militarily and strategically, the US and Qatar share strong ties. The US Central Command's headquarters in the Persian Gulf is located in Qatar, home to the Al Udeid Air Base and the As Sayliyah Army Base. While Qatar relies on the US for security, it is also a strategic asset for Washington.A report by the National Association of Scholars, a US-based conservative academic watchdog, revealed that Qatar donated $4.7 billion to American academic institutions between 2001 and 2021.UN Secretary-General António Guterres has maintained a notably warm relationship with Qatar. In 2018, Qatar signed a series of agreements with him, pledging $500 million to various UN programs and funding new offices in Doha.Qatar also finances the United Nations Office of Counter-TerrorismIRONICALLY, QATAR, which funds Hamas, also finances the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism. As of October 31, 2023, Qatar was the office's top donor, providing nearly 40% of its total budget, almost $140 million.According to Bloomberg, Qatar's sovereign wealth funds now control more than $450b. in assets worldwide, giving it powerful leverage over banks, investment firms, academic institutions, journalists, and politicians alike.And Qatar's reach doesn't end on Earth; it extends into space. The country's satellite company, Es'hailSat, partnered with Eutelsat to launch two major communication satellites into orbit via the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket. The satellites serve civilian, radio, television, and governmental purposes.Qatar has also begun developing satellite surveillance capabilities and a military satellite program. The nation claims these are for defense, yet no one at the ESA seems to have asked: Why does Qatar need a military satellite?It's not unreasonable to suspect that intelligence gathered via this satellite could be shared with Iran or used to disrupt Western satellite communications.The consequences are already evident: Terror networks are growing stronger, religious extremism is spreading, and Western democracies are struggling to combat the rising Islamist wave. The gap between Qatar's polished global image and its actual role in security destabilization is dangerous. It breeds moral and political paralysis and enables terror infrastructures to thrive under a veil of money.If the West wants to preserve its values and independence, it must act decisively. That means enforcing transparency in foreign investments, requiring every sports club, university, and financial institution to disclose its funding sources.It also means legislating oversight over international sports bodies and enforcing accountability against countries that exploit the arena to whitewash regimes like Qatar's.Qatar should be officially designated a state sponsor of terrorism, at least until it halts the flow of funds to terror-linked organizations.Sanctions should be placed on journalists and influencers funded by Qatar, and their financial ties must be brought to light, even if that means challenging powerful interests.Qatar has successfully branded itself as a Western-friendly, open, touristic, and sporty nation. But the truth – repeatedly reported by American media – is starkly different. Behind the cosmopolitan image lies a consistent policy of funding Islamic extremism and terror.It's time for the world to wake up and start asking questions about the money reshaping Western democracies – before it's too late.The writer is the CEO of Radio 100FM, an honorary consul, deputy dean of the Consular Diplomatic Corps, president of the Israel Radio Communications Association, and a former NBC TV correspondent.

As early as 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported: “Qatar is playing a double game – on one hand presenting itself as a modern global hub and on the other, continuing to funnel money to terror groups like Hamas and al-Qaeda.”Is the soccer field being used as a political tool?Ahead of the 2022 World Cup, The New York Times noted that “Qatar's use of soccer is not just a marketing tactic – it is a political instrument for shaping a new global narrative.” Football is no longer just a pastime or investment; it is a statecraft strategy.

A report by the National Association of Scholars, a US-based conservative academic watchdog, revealed that Qatar donated $4.7 billion to American academic institutions between 2001 and 2021.UN Secretary-General António Guterres has maintained a notably warm relationship with Qatar.

The Lionesses winger could be a decisive figure as the Gunners head to France needing to beat the eight-time European champions

Arsenal are certainly up against it this weekend. After losing the home leg of their Champions League semi-final clash with Lyon by a 2-1 scoreline, the Gunners have to beat the eight-time European champions on their own patch on Sunday if they are to reach the final of this competition for the first time since they triumphed in it back in 2007.

Lyon's last home defeat came over a year ago, when they were beaten on penalties by Fleury in the semi-finals of the Coupe de France. Their last home defeat in 90 minutes was over two years ago, when Chelsea were 1-0 winners in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie. In short, it's not often that OL are beaten in their own backyard.

But there are reasons for Arsenal to believe. The Gunners created plenty of chances in that first leg, they just didn't take them; in the last round, they completed an unlikely comeback, overturning a 2-0 deficit against Real Madrid by winning 3-0 at home; and, crucially, both Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly should be fitter and sharper this time around. If that quarter-final triumph is anything to go by, then the latter's creativity could well make the difference, too.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Andrey Rublev has endured a strange start to his 2025 season, as he struggles to find consistency.

The Russian began his year with a shock defeat at the Australian Open, when Rublev lost to Joao Fonseca in three sets.

He failed to impress at his next two tournaments in Montpellier and Rotterdam, before Rublev won the Qatar Open, seemingly out of nowhere.

Since then, Rublev has won just two matches on the ATP Tour and looks set to drop out of the world's top ten.

Looking to return to winning ways at this year's Madrid Open, the Russian reflected on the time he won the biggest title of his career while feeling ‘super sick'.

Speaking on the ATP Tour's YouTube channel, Rublev looked back on how he felt physically during his second Masters 1000 title win.

“For sure, the title in Madrid, the things I faced there, I never faced in my life,” he said.

“I was super sick there, basically. I could not eat, I could not sleep.”

Remarkably, the sickness allowed Rublev to find an extra gear, which helped him secure victory.

“That sickness somehow gave me disconnection from all my personality. So I was not thinking about anything related to my life,” he said.

“Only that I hope if I lay [in bed] for an extra five minutes I feel a bit better.

“With that thought, somehow my head was completely clear, and feeling the worst physically, I was playing some of my best tennis.”

His best tennis saw him take down the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz on his way to the final.

Rublev then beat Felix Auger-Aliassime to lift a Masters 1000 title for the second time in his career, having won in Monte-Carlo one year earlier.

The world number eight would no doubt love to repeat the feat in 2025 and retain both his title and place in the top ten.

Rublev advanced to the third round of the 2025 Madrid Open without ever taking to the court, as Frenchman Gael Monfils withdrew from the event.

His route to the final is tough, however, and he could face a tricky test against in-form Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals.

Rublev and Zverev have faced off ten times previously on the ATP Tour, with the German enjoying the better of proceedings, winning on seven occasions.

The Russian did, however, win their most recent encounter on clay, securing his place in the 2023 Bastad semi-finals with a comfortable straight sets win.

If he were to advance past Zverev things likely wouldn't get much easier as he could then take on two players he holds a losing record against in the semi-finals and final.

Only time will tell if Rublev can defy the odds and defend his Madrid Open title, but it certainly looks like he'll be up against it.

Rublev will make his first appearance at this year's tournament on Sunday, April 27, when he takes on Alexander Bublik for a place in the fourth round.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

We've already seen some great matches at the Mutua Madrid Open, but Saturday's collision between Tommy Paul and Joao Fonseca is Avengers-level for the second round.

He will look to build on that against Paul, who hasn't played since he melted down against Jenson Brooksby in the Houston final.Between Paul's rust and Fonseca's outrageous all-court firepower, the Brazilian is going to feel like this is a real opportunity to knock off one of the best players in the world.

The conditions also favor Fonseca quite a bit. The Brazilian has some things he needs to clean up, but he has a big serve and an even bigger forehand. Fonseca also has the ability to go backhand-to-backhand with Paul, even if it is his weaker side of the court. While Fonseca's forehand gets all the attention, he's quite strong on the backhand wing. And I think his two-hander will hold up well against Paul's, which is one of the best in the men's game.Fonseca simply has the bigger weapons on the court in this match—and the altitude and bouncy courts should only make it harder for Paul, an elite baseline defender, to grind him down. Fonseca should also win over the crowd, which will give him a little extra adrenaline. That will only make him more difficult to deal with.

The only real concern I have here is that Paul is an elite returner, and Fonseca's hold percentage (80.8%) isn't close to where it's should be when he really puts everything together. So, Paul will likely put some pressure on the Brazilian. But I trust Fonseca to find ways to deal with that pressure, and I also like his chances of pestering Paul when it's the American's turn to serve. Paul has improved a lot as a server over the years, but he only holds at 75.8% on clay.This may look like a tough draw for Fonseca, but in other ways it feels like a good one. The 18-year-old has already proven he's going to be a bigger factor on the ATP Tour than people expected this year.Pick: Fonseca ML (-165)

Sinner has not played since winning the Australian Open at the start of the season and accepted a ban in February following a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had challenged a tribunal's decision to clear him after two positive tests.

The 23-year-old was allowed to return to training on April 13th, and his suspension will end on May 4th, before his competitive return at the Italian Open, which gets underway three days later.

Sinner, who spent time building fitness mindful of the French Open starting on May 25th, was assured of retaining the top ranking for his home tournament after his closest challenger, Alexander Zverev, crashed to an early defeat in Monte Carlo.

""We're training very hard. Hopefully, we'll get some momentum going again ahead of the clay season. It certainly won't be easy for me,"" Sinner told broadcaster ORF Sudtirol.

""The first games will be really difficult. But hopefully I'll be able to get back into the rhythm and then we'll see how it goes.""

Sinner, who trained with Britain's world number six Jack Draper at the Tennis Club de Beaulieu in France recently, said there were plenty of positives from his enforced absence from the tour.

""I think at the beginning of the three months, it was quite nice,"" Sinner added.

""A bit of time away from all the grind, I spent time with family, with friends. I was doing new things and getting to know myself better, finding out where I stand.

Novak Djokovic makes his 2025 Madrid debut against tough Italian Matteo Arnaldi during second-round action on Saturday. Stefanos Tsitsipas, who retired in Barcelona, takes on struggling veteran Jan-Lennard Struff.

(4) Novak Djokovic vs. Matteo Arnaldi

This year has been a bit of a struggle for Novak Djokovic. The world No. 5 hasn't won an ATP title since 2023, although he did win the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last year. He got close in Miami, but he lost in two tiebreakers to the young Czech Jakub Mensik. Djokovic has not won a match on clay yet this season, with a shock opening loss to Alejandro Tabilo in Monte-Carlo two weeks ago. He was miserably out of sorts; Tabilo is ranked No. 32 in the world and at no point did the Serb even threaten to take control.

Fortunately for Djokovic, Matteo Arnaldi is also off the boil. The Italian holds a 9-9 record on the season, including his three-set win over Borna Coric in the first round earlier this week. Arnaldi would ordinarily be dangerous for Djokovic, especially because he has already played a match. But in this case Djokovic will be motivated to get more play in before Roland Garros. It's likely to be patchy at times, but look for the first meeting between Djokovic and Arnaldi to go the favorite's way.

(17) Stefanos Tsitsipas vs. Jan-Lennard Struff

April has not been kind to Stefanos Tsitsipas. The former world No. 3 is ranked 18th in the world in part because he failed to defend his 2024 title in Monte-Carlo. Of more concern, the Greek withdrew from his quarterfinal match against Arthur Fils last week in Barcelona, with some speculation that Tsitsipas had injured his back. The 17th seed got a first-round bye in Madrid, so his injury hasn't been tested yet.

Jan-Lennard Struff has been a tricky matchup for Tsitsipas. The former French Open runner-up holds a scant 5-4 record over the German. Struff is a good clay-court player, so the surface won't give Tsitsipas much of an advantage. The bad news for Struff is that he has had a miserable season. He is 3-10 on the year, not counting his “win” in the first round with the retirement of Botic van de Zandschulp. Struff's last completed match win came way back in February in Marseille, so there is no indication that Struff has enough in the tank right now to dispatch a player of Tsitsipas' caliber.

Cheryl pick: Tsitsipas in 2Ricky pick: Tsitsipas in 2

Two quite horrible matches! Logically you'd go for Tsitsipas 2-0. HOWEVER, it was only a week ago when he had to retire with a back injury. We've seen so many walkovers this tournament daily so it wouldn't suprise me if we saw Stef retire. Struff looking marginally better than he has been vs Botic, slightly less errors. He's got some points to defend here so I do think he will pose a challenge + leads clay H2H. As for Djoko, anything can happen. He could just walk over Arnaldi, or Arnaldi could raise his level as many do vs Djoko and make it a close battle.

Sorry I think Djoko in 3 sets. Struff in 3 (with a clause being if Tsitsi isn't fully fit)

Struff would only win by retirement

WWW?

Now that Fils is out it opens it up for Tsitsi.

Matteo Arnaldi stunned fourth seed Novak Djokovic on Saturday at the Mutua Madrid Open.


The Italian delivered an inspired performance against his lifelong idol and capitalised on a below-par Djokovic to oust the three-time champion 6-3, 6-4 in the second round.

“He's my idol, he's always been,” Arnaldi said of Djokovic. “I was just glad that I could play him. I never played him, just practised with him. To play him at a stage like this was already a victory for me. He's not at his best right now, so I came on court to try to play my best tennis and win, and it happened, so right now I don't even know what to say.”

OMG 😅When you beat your idol...@mattearnalds | @MutuaMadridOpen | #MMOpen pic.twitter.com/gz2S2PwpY7

Arnaldi, No. 44 in the PIF ATP Rankings, expertly utilised the entire court, blending hefty firepower with delicate drop shots to keep Djokovic on his toes. He thrived on the ad-side, crushing inside-out forehands while Djokovic pressed for winners early in rallies, reflected in the Serbian's 32 unforced errors, including 17 from his backhand.



“I was just trying to rally a bit at the start, trying to make him [make] some mistakes,” Arnaldi said. “Then once it starts, you start to feel better, the tension goes a little bit away. He gave me a little bit in a few games. For sure it helped me that I broke him straight away so I was like, ‘Alright, that's a good start' and then after that, it was an escalation. I started to play better and I think it became a quite good match.”



After an early exchange of breaks in the first set, Djokovic hit back-to-back double faults at 3-4, Deuce, handing Arnaldi a crucial break which allowed the Italian to serve for the opener.

 

Holding break point at 3-3 in the second set, Arnaldi was nearly in the most defensive position possible yet stole the thrilling exchange and lifted his arms in the air to the roar of the crowd. The next game, he courageously dug out of a 0/40 hole to hold serve and rode that momentum to the finish line, closing the one-hour, 41-minute match.






Djokovic has now suffered three consecutive defeats. He reached the Miami final before falling to Jakub Mensik and then lost to Alejandro Tabilo in his Monte-Carlo opener. The Serbian, who was aiming for his 100th tour-level title this fortnight, leaves Madrid with a 12-7 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win-Loss Index.

Arnaldi next faces Damir Dzumhur, who overcame 32nd seed Sebastian Baez 1-6, 6-1, 6-2. The 24-year-old Arnaldi's win against Djokovic in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting marks the second Top 5 victory of his career, both of which have occured in Madrid. In 2023, he ousted then-No. 4 Casper Ruud at the Caja Magica.

The American took to the courts for the first time in weeks, hoping to remain symptom-free as she prepares for the second Slam of the year.ByLiya DavidovPublished Apr 26, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 26, 2025

Two-time Grand Slam champion Taylor Townsend came clean on social media about missing out on the beginning of the clay-court season.Since reaching the doubles semifinals at the Miami Open, the second-ranked doubles player has pulled out of tournaments, all the way through next week's Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome.“I'm sure you guys have been wondering where I've been, why I've been withdrawing from tournaments,” the American said on Instagram. “In Miami, I fell and ended up getting a mild concussion in my quarterfinal doubles match and had two days off, played my semifinal match on Friday, and ended up getting a lot worse, so it's my first time back out on court in almost a month.”

Tests later confirmed she suffered a concussion, an injury Townsend only recently began recovering from.“I was hoping to be ready for Madrid but ended up doing some workouts and some tests and all of my symptoms came back, so these last three or four days have been the first time that I have had no headaches,” she said, “which is really great and I'm happy to be back on court.“I really wanted to give myself a chance to heal.

Tennis fans might be shocked to learn who has been the game's most successful male player on clay in the past five years. The French Open at Roland Garros gets underway next month, with the current Madrid Open forming an integral part of the build-up.

The returning Jannik Sinner will head in as the No.1 seed. However, it's Carlos Alcaraz who is the defending champion after winning the Grand Slam for the first time last year, following in the footsteps of his compatriot Rafael Nadal. The ‘King of Clay' remains the most dominant player in history at the tournament, finishing his career having won it 14 times.

Novak Djokovic is also expected to challenge strongly in France as he bids for a record-breaking 25th Slam title. However, the Serbian had a chastening outing at the Monte-Carlo Masters, surprisingly beaten in the first round by Alejandro Tabilo.

However, neither Djokovic nor Alcaraz top the list for most matches won on clay since the start of 2020. Instead, that honour goes to Casper Ruud, who lost in the final at Roland Garros to Nadal in 2022 and Djokovic a year later.

The Norwegian has won 120 matches on the surface in that period. Stefanos Tsitsipas, another player still searching for a first Slam win, is second on the list with 94.

World No.3 Alcaraz sits on 90 victories. However, it is also worth noting that the 21-year-old only made his ATP Tour debut in 2020, and it wasn't until the following year that he emerged as a player capable of challenging the elite.

Fourth on the list is Alexander Zverev at 85. As a result of the injury lay-offs Djokovic has endured, he doesn't even make the top five, with Paraguayan star Alexander Baez following Zverev with 81.

Ruud, 26, is likely to have played considerably more matches on clay than fellow top stars, though. His last tournament win on the surface came last year, when he beat Tsitsipas in the final of the Barcelona Open.

      On 25 May, the opening day of the 2025 French Open, the year's second Grand Slam tournament will pay tribute to Rafael Nadal on the Philippe-Chatrier court, its organisers announced last week.


     
      Nadal, who won 14 singles titles at the Roland Garros, had an astonishing win-loss record of 112-4 over two decades. He extended his career towards the end, suffering through a series of injuries and long recovery periods, just so he could win one more title in Paris. Perhaps he felt that 15 would have been a good number to end at.


     
      He didn't, losing in the first-round last year, which brought an end to his long, unique connection with the tournament. So strong is that connection that the Paris Olympics last year made him a torch-bearer for the event even though he is a Spaniard.

Not just those two weeks, but the preceding several weeks when tennis moves into its clay court phase, as tournament after tournament across Europe is played on the surface. Over these weeks, for about 20 years, Nadal was the defining figure in tennis, even if his career coincided with two other great players, who were cast into the shadows for just that period.

     
      In the absence of Nadal in 2025, clay-court tennis is missing its most pivotal name.

     
      After last year's loss to Alexander Zverev, a player Nadal had beaten in the 2022 French Open semi-finals (Zverev retired hurt) en route to his last title at the venue, Nadal said that he might yet come back to play at the venue. But by November of last year, he announced that he was retiring from the sport.

     
      That first-round result may not have been unexpected, considering Nadal had not been fit enough for some time but hanging on to hope and a miracle. For the Roland Garros faithful, so used to seeing the Spaniard dominate, hustle, brawl and bulldoze his way to one title after another, it was a tragic end. Nadal's record on clay courts is the best (with a win percentage of 90.5%) in the professional era of men's tennis

     
      But the kind of domination Nadal had on clay makes his absence notable as the clay-court season gathers speed. The field is wider open now, with no single player owning the narrative as he did.

     
      The first major clay court tournament on the men's tour, an ATP 1000 event, was the Monte-Carlo Masters, which Carlos Alcaraz won on 13 April. Madrid this week and Rome from 7 May follow, interspersed with smaller events at Barcelona, Munich, Hamburg, Geneva, all on outdoor clay, leading up to the French Open.

     
      On his first appearance at the French Open in 2005, Nadal, who had grown up playing on the clay courts of Spain, won the title. He beat Federer in the semi-final, dropped just three sets in the tournament. He had already, at age 19, entered the tournament as one of the favourites, having won at Monte Carlo, Madrid and Rome in the lead-up to the French Open.

     
      His record on clay courts is the best (with a win percentage of 90.5%) in the professional era of men's tennis, according to the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals). During this time, Nadal won 484 and lost just 51 ATP matches on clay, 63 of his 92 career titles came on the surface.

     
      “He makes you suffer. First he takes your legs, then your mind,"" once said Casper Ruud, who lost to Nadal in the 2022 French Open final.

Also read: India's women tennis team storms into Billie Jean King Cup playoffsThere is no obvious male successor to Nadal on clay. Alcaraz is the leading one, following up his title in Monte-Carlo with the final of the Barcelona Open on 20 April. Holger Rune beat him in the final on a court ironically named Pista Rafa Nadal in 2017, in honour of the player who won here 12 times. The loss prevented the Spaniard Alcaraz from emulating Nadal, who was the last to win back-to-back Monte-Carlo-Barcelona titles in 2018.

     
      “The great thing, we saw last year, was that he (Alcaraz) is so good on the natural surface because he's such an incredible athlete,"" ESPN commentator Renne Stubbs said ahead of this year's Australian Open in February over an online media conference. “To see him play on clay and then turn around and play so beautifully on grass, which are two different moving styles, but it shows you how good he is as a natural athlete as far as moving.""

     
      Alcaraz's immediate rival, world No.1, Jannik Sinner, does not favour clay so much. Ruud is a natural on clay, has been to the French Open finals twice and semi-finals once in the last three years. Djokovic, now on his last legs, is one of only three men to have beaten Nadal at Roland Garros. One of the others to do so is Zverev, who has made it to the semi-finals in Paris for the last four years and just won his third straight title on Munich's clay courts. With a win percentage of 76, Stefanos Tsitsipas, who has slipped down to 16 in rankings, does best on clay compared to other surfaces.

     
      However, none of these players have it in them to build a Nadal-like domination given the number of years they have already spent on the tour.

     
      Younger players like Brazil's Joao Fonseca, 18, and Czech Jakub Mensik, 19, are just making their breakthroughs, miles away from leaving indelible marks on the surface. This year, Fonseca just won his first title, in Buenos Aires, on clay while Mensik got his first, in Miami on a hard court, beating Djokovic in the final.

     
      Nadal's successor on clay—though she has a long way to go before she gets even close—is most likely Iga Swiatek, who has won three of the last four French Opens and was undefeated on the surface in 2022. Last year, the 23-year-old won all tournaments on the surface except one. She has played 100 career matches on clay and won 89 of them.

     
      The next ruler of clay could well be its queen.

Carlos Alcaraz has opened up on the extreme measures Wimbledon organisers take to maintain the competition's reputation as the most prestigious in tennis.

The back-to-back defending champion has won the tournament twice on the bounce, having beaten Novak Djokovic in 2023 and again successfully fended off the Serbian last year.

Alcaraz's success in 2024 made him the ninth man in the Open Era to defend the Wimbledon title and the youngest to achieve this feat since the legendary Roger Federer.

In doing so, the 21-year-old also became the first male player born in the 2000s to win both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year.

But Alcaraz's triumphs in SW19 were almost halted by a seemingly peculiar rule by the powers above.

The Spaniard explained that his coloured underwear almost landed him a suspension at Wimbledon, as they were deemed to be in violation of the tournament's all-white kit policy.

Alcaraz explained that the briefs were visible through his shorts, and that organisers told him he would not be allowed to play if he repeated the offence. 

The world No 3 told the Netflix docuseries, My Way: 'I think Wimbledon is one of the most elegant tournaments in the world, if not the most elegant one, be it for its prestige or its rules.

'You can't step onto the court unless you're dressed in all white.

'I was wearing colour briefs and you could see them through my shorts, and they called me out on them, saying, ""Next time, we won't let you play.""

'I mean, this really goes to show you just how strict they can be!'

Victory at Wimbledon this year would secure Alcaraz a third title in a row. In doing so, he would become the youngest man in the Open Era to do so at the All England Club.

However, this achievement would still be a far cry from the record for the most consecutive titles on the hallowed grass courts.

Both Roger Federer (2003 to 2007) and Bjorn Borg (1976 to 1980) won five successive crowns at Wimbledon, meaning the Spanish superstar still has a ways to go yet.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Il Etait Temps stuns Jonbon with Sandown Celebration","https://www.wimbledonguardian.co.uk/sport/national/25118073.il-etait-temps-stuns-jonbon-sandown-celebration/?ref=mr&lp=32","Sat, 26 Apr 2025 15:39:24 GMT","

Il Etait Temps stunned Jonbon to run out an easy winner of the bet365 Celebration Chase at Sandown.

Off the track for almost a year, the seven-year-old breezed to victory under Danny Mullins.

The form was in the book, when he was last seen he beat Gaelic Warrior at the Punchestown Festival having also won at Aintree, but the fact he had missed the whole of the season saw him go off a 9-2 chance.

Ridden by Danny Mullins, he pinged every fence and appeared on the bridle at the Pond Fence.

Jonbon, who had shifted marginally right at some of his fences but in the main jumped well, had no excuses as Il Etait Temps breezed by on his way to a five-and-a-half-length win to hand Jonbon his first defeat away from the Cheltenham Festival. The winner's stablemate Energumene was third.

Willie Mullins said: “I didn't expect that and I was hoping both him and Energumene would finish, pick up some place money and both be sound. But to do what he did, I couldn't believe it there in the stands and that has to be one of the moments of the whole year I think, for him to come out and do what he did.

“He looks top class and that's his fifth Grade One I think. He's not a big, chasing type and to put him against Jonbon it looked like father and son, but he can jump and he's athletic and stays and he does everything.”

On the near season-long absence, Mullins added: “He had a little knee problem and was supposed to be back at Christmas and then Easter and every time we got close it went wrong.

“We said we'd put him by for Punchestown but then we needed him for today and thank god we did, but he has been working very well at home.”

Nicky Henderson said of Jonbon: “He's run well and he's jumped and travelled and done everything right.

“He's danced every dance this season and unfortunately Cheltenham didn't work. He had his hardest race there in finishing second, trying to get into the race and that flattened him enough.

“Aintree was great and we are all starting to think that extra half-mile might help him. He's a very good two-miler but we'll be having a chat about it.

“It's tempting to go Shloer, Tingle Creek and then have a look. But I think we're all thinking that extra half-mile – and dare I say plus – might just help him out. There's one way to find out and that's to try him, but we'll see.

“He'll go back to Martinstown (Stud) and have a lovely summer of champagne and caviar and then we'll have a chat and work it out.”

Connections of third-placed Energumene felt the ground was too quick for him to play a significant role but there are no plans to retire the dual Champion Chase winner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Terry Skiverton: Dons 'still in a good place' despite losing to Port Vale","https://www.wimbledonguardian.co.uk/sport/25118082.terry-skiverton-wimbledon-still-good-place-defeat/","Sat, 26 Apr 2025 15:48:29 GMT","


  AFC Wimbledon assistant manager Terry Skiverton insists the Dons are ""still in a good place"" despite losing to Port Vale ahead of the final game of the season.



  Wimbledon were beaten by Port Vale today (April 26) in the last scheduled game at the Cherry Red Records Stadium for the season - elongating a poor run of form.



  Vale, who secured their automatic promotion to League One, scored twice in quick succession although the second goal in particular was draped in controversy as referee Declan Bourne failed to stop the game for a head injury to Wimbledon defender Riley Harbottle.



  In the aftermath of the second goal, manager Johnnie Jackson was shown a red card for his protests against the referee's decision.



  ""Harbottle gets a head injury and the referee plays on for 20 seconds and Vale go on to score,"" said Jackson's right hand man - Terry Skiverton.



  “Harbottle was then down for five and a half minutes and then had to go off for the same injury.



Terry Skiverton was disappointed with the referee not stopping play for Harbottle's head injury (Image: Kirk Pritchard) “Seven minutes later, one of their players goes down with a head injury whilst we're on the attack and guess what the referee does? He blows up for a head injury – we are really disappointed with that.""



  Despite feeling hard done by, Skiverton admitted that Port Vale deserved to be promoted today.



  He said: “They're a really good side with experienced players and they got promoted today through being professional, slowing the game down, not allowing us to gain momentum and they've got the likes of Ronan Curtis to come on and see the game out



  “It's disappointing from our point of view but it's a good lesson and it's good to see a team get promoted against you because now we know what we have to do.



  “That support base turned up in numbers today and got behind us but we need to give them more in attacking threat – we didn't give them enough today and we're aware of that.""



  “The fans are still 100 per cent behind us – we could feel that.""



Marcus Browne was brought on in the second half after being sidelined with an injury for the past few weeks (Image: Kirk Pritchard) Marcus Browne and Myles Hippolyte both featured from the bench in the loss - their first appearances in weeks due to injury.



  “We're still in a good place – we've got the skipper (Jake Reeves) back, we've got Browne back, we've got Hippolyte back and we're going into this last game of the season with a fully fit squad.



  “This club's not been in this situation for a good few years and we need to make sure that we stick together and not let the doom and gloom get to us.



  “If someone said to us that we're going to go into this last game of the season to get play-offs and potentially get promoted we'd have bitten their hand off.”



  Skiverton claimed that the red card shown to Jackson ""doesn't change anything"" ahead of the Dons' trip to Grimsby next Saturday (May 3).



  ""The gaffer will still be there watching, he'll have a voice down to the bench and the players will continue to give it everything they can,"" he said.



  “The big thing we've got to take away from today is putting more emphasis on the opposing goal – we need to create more chances and be a bit braver in our attacks.""



  A win at Grimsby next weekend would secure a play-off place for the Dons.

The pursuit of greater prize money in tennis continues to be a major topic of discussion.

Earlier this year, the Professional Tennis Players Association [PTPA] launched a significant claim against the tennis tours.

The PTPA asked for several changes to the sport, perhaps none more significant than a greater distribution of prize money.

Shortly after, the top 20 players in men's and women's tennis sent a letter to the four Grand Slams, demanding a ‘substantial increase' in prize money at the events.

One of the ATP Tour's most outspoken stars has now been asked just how far he and others would be willing to go to make change happen.

Appearing as a guest on the Changeover podcast, Frances Tiafoe was asked whether he'd join his fellow ATP stars in a hypothetical boycott of the US Open in a bid for changes such as an increase in prize money.

“The problem is, though, and you need the best players in the world to do it, the problem is, though, I just don't trust these guys out here,” said Tiafoe.

“I feel like they're fake.

“Everyone would be like, oh, yeah, [in] the meeting before, yeah, man, screw this, man, f— this, man.

“I ain't playing, like, we all need money. It's about the tour, it's about the next generation, this and that.

“Next day, you see everybody tying their shoes, over there doing bands and all that.

“You don't know who's really about it or not, because you say it, and then you —– around and pull out, and then all these dudes stayed in.”

Tiafoe believes it will be tricky to make change happen until players get on the ‘same page'.

“That's how I feel about the PTPA and the lawsuits, it's like, it's cool and whatever, and you know, those guys who are in support of it, or behind it, I'm sure are trying to do good things for the game,” he said.

“But until we get real unity, and everyone's really on the same page, for me personally, it doesn't really move the needle.”

It would likely be hard for Tiafoe to agree not to take part at Flushing Meadows, considering his previous successes at the US Open.

Twice, the 27-year-old has reached the last four in New York, his most successful Grand Slam tournament, by quite some distance.

In 2024, Tiafoe lost to Taylor Fritz in the semi-finals of the US Open, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 4-6, 1-6, narrowly missing out on a place in his first Major final.

Some have, however, expressed concerns over his level at the event compared to others, as Jon Wertheim questioned whether Tiafoe puts ‘too much emphasis' on the US Open, in a discussion with Andy Roddick last year.

The American is yet to truly get going in 2025, potentially proving Wertheim correct.

Approaching the end of April, Tiafoe has accumulated just 500 points on the ATP Tour, fewer than 46 other players in men's tennis.

Tiafoe has had real issue stringing wins together this year, often winning just a singular match at a tournament before falling to defeat.

He enjoyed his best week this year in Houston, when Tiafoe lost to Jenson Brooksby in the final of the US Men's Clay Court Championships.

Tiafoe will hope to enjoy another strong showing on the clay at this week's Madrid Open tournament.

The American will take to the court against Luciano Darderi in the second round on Saturday, April 27.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Arnaldi broke Djokovic right away for a 2-0 lead, and closed out the center-court contest with a hold at 15. The return of serve may be the 24-time Grand Slam champion's signature shot, but it was ineffective against the Italian in this must-break situation, and during the match at large. Arnaldi saved four of five break points and prevailed in straight sets despite winning just 55 percent of his first-serve points.Returning at 3-4 in the second set, Djokovic got to 15-40, but Arnaldi held strong, showing virtually no nerves against a player he idolizes.

That's not to say that Ben Affleck's 'Accountant' sequel and the 'Star Wars: Episode III' rerelease aren't also feeding the box office boom, with overall revenue up more than 100 percent over last year.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The weekend box office is on fire, with ticket sales up more than 100 percent over the same frame last year.


	The blaze is led by Warner Bros.' Sinners, directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B. Jordan. Heading into its sophomore outing, the film was expected to compete with Ben Affleck-starrer The Accountant 2 for the top spot with anywhere from $20 million to $25 million. 




	But the supernatural period vampire pic continues to defy all the odds and is now on course to easily stay No. 1 domestically with a phenomenal $42 million to $44 million after earning $13 million on Friday (rival studios all are betting on the higher number). Either way, Sinners — which opened to $48 million a week ago — could enjoy one of the smallest drops in history for a movie playing outside of the year-end holidays

Graced with virtually perfect audience scores and the best reviews of filmmaker Coogler‘s already acclaimed career, Sinners has transformed into the rare title that has become a runaway water-cooler sensation. It's expected to finish Sunday with a 10-day cume hovering around $120 million in a major victory for Warners' movie chiefs Pamela Abdy and Michael De Luca.




			Popular on THR		







	Amazon MGM Studios' new action-thriller The Accountant 2 and Disney's 20th Anniversary release of Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith are also fueling the boom (ditto for Warners' A Minecraft Movie, which remains high up on the chart in its fourth weekend). Depending upon who you ask, the order of the three movies varies and won't be determined until Sunday or even Monday.


The Accountant 2 is hoping for a second-place finish with a promising $23 million-$25 million after scoring strong reviews and exit scores, including an A- CinemaScore. That would be a win as Amazon MGM ramps up its theatrical ambitions (it's now home of the James Bond franchise).


	The first Accountant, released by Warners, opened to $24.7 million in 2016 on its way to grossing $155.5 million globally and becoming the most-rented digital film in 2017.


	Reuniting Affleck and director Gavin O'Connor, Accountant 2 currently sports a fresh 76 percent critics score on Rotten Tomatoes, compared to a rotten 53 percent for the first film. Consumers are far more entranced, judging by the sequel's current 93 percent audience Rotten Tomatoes score.

	











	Affleck produced the sequel via his and Matt Damon's Artists Equity, alongside Lynette Howell Taylor for 51 Entertainment and Mark Williams for Zero Gravity Management. The film made its world premiere at SXSW last month, winning the audience award for the Headliners section.


	Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Daniella Pineda, Allison Robertson and J.K. Simmons co-star in Accountant 2, which sees Affleck's character compelled to step in and help solve the murder of an old acquaintance with the help of his estranged brother and a U.S. Treasury agent. Together, they uncover a deadly conspiracy, becoming targets of a ruthless network of killers who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets buried.


Revenge of the Sith is looking at a weekend haul of anywhere from $21 million to $23 million, which would be one of the top openings ever for a rerelease (one rival shows the film earning $25 million). The crownholder belongs to 1977's Star Wars, which grossed $35.9 million when it hit theaters again in 1997, not adjusted for inflation, according to Comscore.


	The Star Wars rerelease comes amid the 20th anniversary of the final of George Lucas' prequel films. The prequels, while divisive at the time, have only grown more appreciated in recent years, with a generation of kids who grew up with them considering them their preferred Star Wars trilogy. Star Hayden Christensen received a rock star-esque greeting last week at the Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo, while he and Sith star Ewan McGregor reprised their roles for the Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi in 2022, returning their versions of the characters to the zeitgeist.

	











	In terms of more recent rereleases in the franchise, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace earned $8.7 million on its opening weekend in May 2024, while the rerelease of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi grossed $5.1 million in late April 2023.


	Both Accountant 2 and Sinners are R-rated and are competing with Revenge of the Sith for male attention, although the latter has the advantage of also playing to families.


	Screen Gem and Sony's new horror offering Until Dawn looks to round out the top five with a forgettable opening in the $7 million to $8 million range.

""So, when you bring that word out, you know, I feel like they're the GOAT of evil, and it just conflates,"" the comedian said during a conversation with Al Gore on Friday's 'Real Time.'


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Bill Maher still defends his White House visit with President Donald Trump.


	During the latest episode of his weekly HBO series, Real Time, the host sat down with Al Gore where the former vice president admitted that he understood why Maher accepted the invitation to meet with Trump, recalling how he himself met with Trump ahead of the Republican president's first term.




	“It's just that [when] somebody comes with an offer and says, this person who's been dominating our life, whether you like him or not, for 10 years like nobody ever has in history, would you like to see it up close?” Maher said on the show. “Would you like to see the Trumpadopoulos up close? You know, I mean, of course, who wouldn't?”

	Earlier in the interview, the duo discussed Gore's recent speech opening San Francisco Climate Week, in which the 2000 Democratic presidential candidate criticized the Trump administration and made headlines for creating parallels between the actions of the Republican president and his team in their second term and what happened in the early days of Nazi Germany.


	“I understand very well why it is wrong to compare Adolf Hitler's Third Reich to any other movement,” Gore said. “It was uniquely evil, full stop. I get it. But there are important lessons from the history of that emergent evil.”


	He added, though, “It was [Jürgen] Habermas' mentor, Theodore Adorno, who wrote that the first step in that nation's descent into hell was, and I quote, ‘the conversion of all questions of truth into questions of power.' He described how the Nazis, and I quote again, ‘attacked the very heart of the distinction between true and false.' End quote. The Trump administration is insisting on trying to create their own preferred version of reality.”


	On Friday's show, Maher said, “I just think Nazi is a hard word to use with nuance. So, when you bring that word out, you know, I feel like they're the GOAT of evil, and it just conflates.”


	Gore defended his speech, though Maher argued that “the side of the country that voted for Trump, [when] they hear Nazi, they just go, ‘Oh, you're calling us Nazis.'”


	He added, “First of all, it's a bit of a false premise, as bad as they are. And also it just says to them, ‘Well, you just hate us.' One thing I've learned in recent years is that the one thing that's more powerful than money is hate.” 

	











	Their conversation came after Maher responded to Larry David's satirical “My Dinner With Adolf” essay that mocked the comedian's visit with Trump where he said the president was “gracious and measured,” and not like the “person who plays a crazy person on TV.” During a Thursday interview with Piers Morgan, the Real Time host said his essay was “insulting to six million dead Jews” and that “it's an argument you kind of lost just to start it.”


	“Look, maybe it's not completely logically fair, but Hitler has really kind of got to stay in his own place,” Maher said Thursday. “He is the GOAT of evil. We're just going to have to leave it like that.” 


	In David's “My Dinner With Adolf” essay, he satirically recalled having dinner “with the world's most reviled man, Adolf Hitler.” He added, “I had been a vocal critic of his on the radio from the beginning, pretty much predicting everything he was going to do on the road to dictatorship. No one I knew encouraged me to go. ‘He's Hitler. He's a monster.' But eventually I concluded that hate gets us nowhere. I knew I couldn't change his views, but we need to talk to the other side — even if it has invaded and annexed other countries and committed unspeakable crimes against humanity.”


	The guest essay pulled similar verbiage from Maher's monologue from his April 11 episode where he recounted his visit with Trump and Kid Rock. During the visit, Maher said, he “never felt I had to walk on eggshells around” the president. 

	











	He added, “Honestly, I voted for [Bill] Clinton and [Barack] Obama, but I would never feel comfortable talking to them the way I was able to talk with Donald Trump. That's just how it went down, make of it what you will.”

The award was presented by Miranda Lambert, who won in the same category 18 years ago.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



Ella Langley received her first Academy of Country Music Award, for new female artist of the year, on Friday afternoon (April 25). While onstage for her set at Rock the Country in Knoxville, Tennessee, Langley received the news via a congratulatory video from Miranda Lambert, the winningest artist in ACM history.


	It was hardly a surprise because Langley was the most-nominated artist for the upcoming 60th ACM Awards, with eight nods. None of the other nominees for new female artist of the year – Kassi Ashton, Ashley Cooke, Dasha and Jessie Murph –  had more than that one nomination.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“I'm here to tell you how proud I am of you for being the top nominated artist for the Academy of Country Music Awards this year,” Lambert said in the video. “You are my friend, first and foremost, a fellow dog rescue advocate, you are a co-writer, you are my soul sister in country music and a partner in crime. We are gonna celebrate so big in Dallas, Texas! They ain't even ready!”


	Lambert won in that same category in 2007 – one year after Carrie Underwood took the prize, and one year before Taylor Swift did. (A pretty good run, there.)


	This was the second nomination in the new female artist of the year category for both Ashton and Cooke, which means they cannot be nominated in the category again. Dasha and Murph can be, due to the generous policy at both the ACM and CMA Awards whereby new artists can be nominated twice in the category.


	Langley, 25, is also nominated for female artist of the year and in four categories for “you look like you love me,” her breakthrough hit featuring Riley Green. The sexy duet is nominated for single of the year, song of the year, music event of the year and visual media of the year. Langley is nominated as both artist and songwriter in the song of the year category and as both artist and director in visual media of the year.


	“you look like you love me” reached No. 1 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart, No. 7 on Hot Country Songs and No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. Langley co-wrote all of the songs on her debut album, hungover, which reached No. 11 on Top Country Albums and No. 49 on the all-genre Billboard 200.


Zach Top was presented with the award for new male artist of the year on Thursday. The ACM has yet to present the award for new duo or group of the year. The nominees are Restless Road, The Red Clay Strays and Treaty Oak Revival.

	











	Langley will be celebrated for her win at the 60th ACM Awards, hosted by Reba McEntire. The show will stream live for a global audience on Prime Video and the Amazon Music channel on Twitch on Thursday, May 8, at 8 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. CT / 5 p.m. PT from the Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas. A limited number of tickets are available for purchase on SeatGeek.


The ACM Awards are produced by Dick Clark Productions, which is owned by Penske Media Eldridge, a joint venture between Eldridge Industries and Billboard parent company Penske Media.

The alt-pop star leaned into her Nashville inclinations in her first gig at the California country festival, but mostly just demonstrated how singular she's always sounded. 


													By
												

	Andrew Unterberger



	The more you watch of Lana Del Rey supposedly going country, the more apparent how ridiculous any talk of her pivoting to any genre really is. 


	For 15 years now, LDR has essentially been a genre unto herself: a unique and borderline-illogical blending of obviously classic influences with some game-changingly modern sensibilities, one that mostly befuddled critics and radio and the charts early on, even as she was inarguably becoming one of the most important pop stars of her generation. She's been wildly influential without ever being less than unmistakable; no matter what sonic, thematic or characteristic elements other artists may borrow from her, none of them would ever risk being taken for Lana herself. This is all to say: no matter what style of music she's making, Lana Del Rey has one genre and that's “Lana Del Rey.” 


	But of course, Lana did lean into The Stagecoach of It All while making her debut performance at the Indio, Calif. country festival on Friday (Apr. 25). Singing in a white dress in front of a set of an idyllic-looking rural house at dusk, she looked like she walked on stage straight from an old Loretta Lynn album cover. Early on, she brought out George Birge — himself a Saturday performer at the festival — to duet on his current hit “Cowboy Songs,” an extremely country radio-friendly song Del Rey says she can't get enough of. (You can certainly imagine a Lanafied version of the chorus, though it was strange to hear her singing on such a zippy and muscular hook in 2025.) And of course, she invoked two all-time genre classics during the show by covering Tammy Wynette's “Stand by Your Man” (“You can't do this set without it”), and then closing the proceedings with a family singalong to John Denver's “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” a recent entry into the LDR cover canon.

	But the new songs? Country-ish in their tempo and in some of their thematic content (and occasional lyrics about “all these country singers”), perhaps, but not in any way that feels at a remove from what she's done her whole career: Lana has long centered the emotional abandon and cinematic sway of country in her songs. You could hear that even in some of the crowd-elating classics Lana performed in the midst of her Grand Ole Opry moment — tweak a couple lyrics and add some banjo and “Ride” is basically a The Chicks single; turn down the sex and turn up the sarcasm and “Video Games” could've been penned by Kacey Musgraves. Nothing about the stately balladry and gender-role explorations of songs like set-opening duo “Husband of Mine” and “Henry, Come On” felt without precedent in her catalog; she could have introduced them as deep cuts from Blue Banisters or Chemtrails Over the Country Club and many of her fans probably would've bought it. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	If there was a pronounced difference with Del Rey in Country Mode on Friday night, it was that she seemed… maybe more polite and unassuming than we're used to her being? Watching her express her very sincere-seeming gratitude at being invited to Stagecoach, and about the size and passion of her Friday night crowd, it was very easy to forget that she was once a highly divisive figure in popular music, one prone to controversy in both her lyrics and public statements. There was no trace of any of that in the smiling, hostly, happy-to-be-here performer who took the stage on Friday night. 

	










A post shared by Billboard Country (@billboardcountry)


	Well, almost none. If you missed a little of the unpredictability and ostentatiousness that characterized early-years Lana Del Rey– and still informed highlights from her work up until this decade — then you probably loved “57.5,” a shuffling new song referring to her number (in millions) of monthly listeners on Spotify, which also includes a bridge which begins with LDR proclaiming “I kissed Morgan Wallen” and going onto advise listeners against going ATVing with him. It takes a lot of “yes, really” to explain, but it was still probably the best of the new songs that she debuted: some real country s–t, but more importantly, pure Lana through and through, in a way no other artist or genre could ever totally capture.

The pair's March 21, 2026, show will mark the first stadium comedy show since 2022, amid a recent boom in the live comedy space.


													By
												

	Dave Brooks



	Comedians Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias and Jo Koy are playing SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on March 21, 2026, officials with the stadium announced earlier this week. 


	Titled One Night Only, the show is produced by comedy promoter Icon Concerts and is anticipating a paid attendance of up to 55,000 fans.


	“We've been wanting to do this show for a number of years but it wasn't until recently that we've been able to make everyone's schedule work,” explains Mike Bernal, vp of Icon Concerts. “Gabriel [Iglesias] is an L.A. hometown hero and Jo is nearby in Seattle and has a huge following in Southern California and sold thousands of tickets in the market.”

	











	Bernal says initial presales have been strong, noting “they are selling evenly across all price points, which is what we like to see.” Ticket prices start at between $69 to $113 for the 500 section, $138 to $170 for the midlevel 300 section and $326 for floor seats.




			Trending on Billboard		







One Night Only will mark a rare feat in the live comedy business; in the last decade, only a handful of comedians have headlined stadiums, including, most recently, Iglesias, who headlined Dodger Stadium in 2022. In 2015, Kevin Hart performed before an audience of more than 53,000 fans in Philadelphia, and last year, comedian Nate Bargatze became one of the first comedians to sell more than 1 million tickets in a single year, earning $82 million from an impressive 148 shows.


	Comedy is a bigger business than ever in the live space. The top 10 comedy tours generated a combined $397.3 million from 4.3 million fans last year, according to Billboard Boxscore. That's up 52% from 2023, when the top 10 generated $260 million from 2.9 million fans.


	Iglesias came in at No. 3 on Billboard's Top Comedy Tours chart for 2024, grossing $42.8 million with 603,000 tickets sold from 124 shows. Koy ranked No. 10 on the chart, grossing $26 million from 83 shows in front of 368,000 fans. 


	“Since day one, I wanted to bring comedy to the stadium,” explains Adolfo Romero, vp of programming and booking for SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park, which is home to a number of smaller venues, including a new Belgian spiegeltent built for CineVita, the cinema live experience first announced in December.


	“We're at a 750-person capacity in the spiegeltent,” Romero said. The complex also includes the 6,000-capacity YouTube Theater, which has played host to a number of comedy events, including the 2024 Black Comedy Festival.

	











	“We want to make sure that when people go out to see comedy, it's not just the Laugh Factory or in Hollywood,” says Romero, adding that he hopes One Night Only “showcases the stadium in a different way,” noting SoFi's carefully designed sightlines and visual technology designed to enhance the live experience.


	“Sound is really important to them, and we have the five levels of LED screen as well at the stadium [that] they can also use as part of the show,” Romero said. “Their production team is working with our team to ensure that the sound and the sidelines for fans coming in are going to be the best for comedy.”


	Tickets for the show are now on sale at Ticketmaster.com.

	Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has amassed 386 million subscribers for his YouTube channel, more than any other person on Earth. But he's not stopping there. He's expanding into television with the Prime Video series Beast Games, a reality competition show where contestants vie for $5 million, “the largest cash prize in TV history!”


	MrBeast is among the major names set to take part in today's virtual Deadline's Contenders Television: Documentary, Unscripted & Variety  award-season event, which kicks off at 9 a.m. PT. It's your guide to a different kind of competition — one where the ultimate prize is Emmy gold.

	We've got comedy covered with Seth Meyers, host of Late Night with Seth Meyers; Saturday Night Live cast members Mikey Day and Ego Nwodim; and The Daily Show's Desi Lydic. Standup comic Iliza Shlesinger will tell us about her Prime Video comedy special Iliza Shlesinger: A Different Animal.


	Animals of every description populate The Americas, the nature series from Universal Television Alternative Studio and NBC. Tom Hanks narrates the 11-part show that examines the super continent all the way from Northern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America. Executive producer Mike Gunton will join Contenders to discuss the wonders revealed, like flamingos that hold a “dance off” at the top of the Andes.


	Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson and Joseph Patel, who won Academy Awards for their 2021 documentary Summer of Soul, will tell us about their follow-up: Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius), streaming on Hulu.

	Music made Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip hop producer-performer who launched a record label before branching out into fashion, media and more. But it's been a sharp decline for the mogul, who awaits trial on federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges. His career and the allegations that threaten to send him to federal penitentiary are explored in the explosive Investigation Discovery docuseries The Fall of Diddy. Directors-executive producers Emma Schwartz and Yoruba Richen will join Contenders to discuss Diddy's fate.


	We'll explore a climactic chapter from World War II with a panel on The Eyes of the World: From D-Day to V-E Day. And we'll get the straight story on The Traitors, the cunning Peacock series hosted by Alan Cumming, and some trickery from David Blaine, who travels the world in David Blaine Do Not Attempt in search of prodigious prestidigitators.

Associate Editor


SPOILERS: This post contains details about Final Destinations: Bloodlines


	After 25 years, death has a few twists in store for fans of the Final Destination franchise.


	With the sixth installment Final Destination: Bloodlines premiering May 16 in theaters, director Zach Lipovsky recently teased how the upcoming sequel deviates from the series of horror movies.


	“For this film, the first premonition takes place in 1969,” he explained to SFX Magazine. “There are lots of deaths during the premonition, which is what normally happens in the opening sequence of a Final Destination movie, but we then come out of the eye of a different person in the modern day. That's new. For a lot of fans, I think that's going to immediately throw them for a loop. It's going to make them lean forward to try and figure out what's going on.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Lipovsky, who co-directed with Adam Stein, added, “As moviegoers, we love it when you have to lean forward in your seat because a movie is being unpredictable. We switch up a lot of the predictability, including who's going to die next and how they are going to die. You might think it's one person, but it's not. There's a delight in that.”


	The deadly 1969 premonition was teased in the first trailer, which dropped last month, surpassing 178.7 million worldwide views to become the second-most viewed horror movie trailer in its first 24 hours.


Final Destination: Bloodlines goes back to the very beginning of Death's twisted sense of justice. Plagued by a violent recurring nightmare, college student Stefanie heads home to track down the one person who might be able to break the cycle and save her family from the grisly demise that inevitably awaits them all.

A post shared by K A R E N (@eukarensilvaoficial)

Former The Voice Kids‘ contestant Karen Silva has passed away, less than a week after being admitted to the hospital. On April 20, a message was posted on her Instagram.

“Singer Karen Silva is facing a health problem and, at the moment, she is still under medical care, with the support and affection of her family and team. We ask for respect, empathy and prayers as she recovers peacefully. Any updates will be made by our official channels We thank everyone for the love.”

A post shared by K A R E N (@eukarensilvaoficial)

Sadly, the 17-year-old died four days later. 

Silva passed away at 5 am on April 24 at the São João Batista Hospital in Volta Redonda, according to The Daily Mail. Doctors say she suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, due to bleeding into her brain caused by a blood vessel rupturing. 

Her family is devastated and in shock at the suddenness of her death. Her father told local media that she seemed fine the last time he saw her. “She left home to have lunch on Friday, and three hours later she was in a coma. For this year, 2025, we had big plans. For her, her clothing brand, new songs for her album.”

“To know my daughter passed like this, it hurts so much,” he continued. “It still hasn't sunk in.”

Silva was only 12 when she appeared on The Voice Kids in Brazil. She mesmerized both the judges and the audience, advancing to the semi-finals in the competition.

Silva's final Instagram post, made on March 6, featured a carousel of photos and videos from February's Carnival.

After her death was announced, a tribute to the rising star was posted to her Instagram page with the caption, *Note of sorrow* 

“It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of the young singer Karen Silva, aged 17, occurred after days of hospitalization at São João Batista Hospital, in Volta Redonda, as a result of a hemorrhagic stroke.

Karen enchanted Brazil with her powerful voice and striking presence even in childhood, when she participated in The Voice Kids in 2020. Since then, he has followed a luminous path, uniting talent, charisma and representation at every step.

More than an up-and-coming artist, Karen was a symbol of empowerment, especially for Black girls who found in her inspiration and strength to dream. Her music, her message and her joy leave a deep mark on all who met her and followed her journey.

In this moment of great pain, we send our solidarity to their parents, Manoella and Fernando, with friends, family and fans. May the memory of your light continue to guide us.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘The Voice' Schedule: When Do the Live Shows Start","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/the-voice-live-shows-begin/","Sat, 26 Apr 2025 02:08:37 GMT","

The Knockouts Part 3 of “The Voice” season 27 aired on April 14, with 20 contestants set to sing in the upcoming Playoffs, which will air on Monday, April 28, at 8 p.m. EST, NBC reported. 

Part two of the Playoffs will air on May 5, during which the season 27 coaches, Adam Levine, Kelsea Ballerini, John Legend, and Michael Bublé, who each have five members on their team, will choose two to go on to the next live round, which will likely begin on May 12.

The format of “The Voice” changed to once a week on Mondays instead of two days in a row, but the live rounds will feature some episodes on Tuesdays, per NBC.

Ballerini has a diverse team of singers, and as of now, she has Jaelen Johnston (21), Darius J (35), Alanna Lynise (21), Tinika Wyatt (50), and Iris Herrera (19) going to the Playoffs.

On Bublé's team are Jaydn Cree (23), Adam David (34), Kaiya Hamilton (26), Barry Jean Fontenot (31), and Angie Rey (25).

Legend has Olivia Kuper Harris (34), Renzo (33), Ari Camille (21), Bryson Battle (21), and BD.ii (31).

Team Adam consists of Conor James (28), Britton Moore (21), Ethan Eckenroad (26), Lucia Flores Wiseman (22), and Kolby Codell (33).

On the April 14 episode of “The Voice” season 27, Kelsea Ballerini used her last steal to take Darius J from Levine.

“I have been waiting for this for so long,” the “Peter Pan” singer said. She shared, “I think Darius is so special. He has this certainty about him and this joy, quirkiness. I don't think I have anyone on my beat on that level of full-encompassing performer. I fought so hard for Darius since the jump.”

During the blind auditions, Darius J sang Usher's “Caught Up,” which made Bublé turn around first. Levine immediately pressed his button next. Ballerini followed soon after, resulting in a three-chair turn.

As the coaches fought to have the singer on their team, Levine told him, “When it comes to ‘The Voice,' I've honestly done it all. I just feel like it's going to be a very magical ride. Please pick me as your coach.”

Ballerini chimed in, “You are the best entertainer I have seen on this stage. Hearing your voice is one thing, and it is electric, and it's magnetic.”

She continued, “Seeing you use your voice is a whole different level. Like, you are such an artist, and my gut is telling me that I can do this with you.” Ultimately, Darius J went with Levine until Ballerini's steal. 

Tune in on April 14 to see which artists make it to the next round and ultimately land them in the live shows. Fans can also stream “The Voice” episodes the next day on Peacock.

After news broke of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Dorit Kemsley's divorce from her estranged husband Paul (PK) Kemsley, her castmate Erika Jayne lent her thoughts. 

“I literally just found out online like everyone else, maybe an hour ago, and, obviously, I reached out to her,” she told Us Weekly in an interview published on April 26. 

Jayne added, “She's got more important things to do than to talk to me right now.” The reality star continued, “How does anybody feel when they hear that a family's broken up? You feel badly. This is sad. It's a sad thing.”

On April 25, TMZ reported that Dorit had filed for divorce from PK that day, and requested full legal and physical custody of their two kids, Jagger and Phoenix. 

According to the publication, Dorit is asking for spousal support, and sources say they don't have a prenuptial agreement.

A post shared by Dorit Kemsley (@doritkemsley)

Dorit opened up about her marriage problems with PK during season 13 of “RHOBH.” In an episode, she told Kyle Richards that she felt alone after facing an armed home robbery in October 2021, and then having PK travel a lot for work.

At the reunion, she said, “After we wrapped, things got progressively worse, and him and I were at probably an all-time bad.”

She said that at the time, they weren't separated, even though PK was staying at a hotel with Boy George. 

“We were struggling and we were working through things,” she told host Andy Cohen. When asked how she and PK were doing, Dorit answered, “Better than ever.” 

The mom of two explained that after PK stopped drinking, their relationship improved. “It was a pivotal moment,” she said.

In November 2023, Dorit told Us Weekly, “We've been very open and honest this season, talking about the challenges over the last couple of years, and they have been difficult.”

“But I've also gone through a lot of challenging things personally. So, you know, that's where we are. But, I think we're definitely good,” she continued.

Dorit added, “We're both hopeful. And, you know, everything is fine. [We're] working on the marriage.”

A post shared by Dorit Kemsley (@doritkemsley)

Dorit was very open about her separation from PK during “RHOBH” season 14, and she told Interview in March, “You know, we were very amicable and friendly, and then we filmed. And when the show first aired, we'd filmed seven, eight months before that, so it's really difficult when you're in the present moment to think where you were eight months ago, right?”

“That's the difficulty about filming the show and then watching it. So if you have something like I was going through — like what I am going through — it becomes very again when you watch it back, even though it's not,” she explained.

The “RHOBH” star continued, “So yes, I think that PK struggled with watching some episodes. He knew going into the season I had to live in truth and be able to share, because that's my job and that's what I signed up to do.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Sydney Sweeney Levels Up with “Split Fiction” Movie Role","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/sydney-sweeney-starring-split-fiction-movie/","Sat, 26 Apr 2025 02:08:37 GMT","

Sydney Sweeney is about to take the next step that every superstar wishes to: star in a movie adaptation of a video game.

Variety dropped the news that the recently released “Split Fiction” is getting a film version and Sweeney will star. A big time director and just as big writing team are also on board.

“Wicked” director Jon M. Chu is helming the movie. “Deadpool & Wolverine” team Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick will write the script.

Although she is set to star, Sweeney is not yet attached to a character. The actress is also going to executive produce. 

“Split Fiction” follows book authors Mio Hudson and Zoe Foster on a fantastical adventure after they're trapped in a world featuring their stories deep in their shared subconscious. They must escape and protect their creative ideas.

Two players take control of both characters simultaneously as they play through the action adventure game. Split screen combat and exploration are just a couple of the gameplay mechanics introduced over the several hours long journey.

“Split Fiction” was released on March 6. Reviews were overwhelmingly positive for the game. Fans praised the dynamic between the two leads while also championing the story, gameplay and other elements of the world. Two million copies were sold during the game's initial release.

Hazelight Studios is the developer. Their previous game, “It Takes Two,” is also being adapted into a movie as well as a television show. 

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Dany Garcia, and Hiram Garcia will produce under the Seven Bucks Productions banner. Amazon MGM, Hazelight Studios and Story Kitchen are producing as well. No stars have been attached but Johnson is in discussion to do so.

Video game movie adaptations have become popular as of late. After the success of the “Sonic the Hedgehog” franchise, Hollywood has welcomed the new slate of IP ready to be mined. 

Previous game-to-movie adaptations include “Super Mario Bros,” “Mortal Kombat” and “Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.” After several decades of a handful of ups and mostly downs, the industry welcomed newer versions of those films with “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” “Mortal Kombat (2021)”, and “Tomb Raider.”

Recent releases “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” and “A Minecraft Movie” both scored massively at the box office thanks to A-list stars and built in fanbases.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kim Richards Makes Rare Fan Appearance in New Jersey [Exclusive Photos]","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/kim-richards-fan-appearance-rare-photos/","Sat, 26 Apr 2025 16:49:24 GMT","

Kim Richards made a rare public appearance in New Jersey. On April 25, the former “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star appeared at the Chiller Theatre Expo at the Hilton in Parsippany, NJ.

EntertainmentNOW was on hand to get exclusive photos of Richards, 60, who appeared to be in great spirits as she met up with fans at the sci-fi and pop culture convention.

Richards was set up at a booth as she greeted fans at the convention. The former Bravo star was surrounded by photos from her acting career as well as a poster from her “Real Housewives” days. Richards was in her element as she posed for photos with fans and signed autographs.

The former RHOBH star looked happy and healthy as she spent time with fans who have followed her since her days as a child star in TV shows and films such as “Nanny and the Professor” and “Escape to Witch Mountain.”

The Kim Richards sighting comes two months after her sisters Kyle Richards and Kathy Hilton confirmed she has been spending time in Florida.

In addition to Richards, other celebrity guests at the weekend-long “Chiller Theatre” fan fest include “The Exorcist” star Linda Blair, “MASH” legends Loretta Swit and Jamie Farr, and “Cheers” alum John Ratzenberger.

A post shared by Hollywood Show (@hollywoodshow1)

Richards has been out of the public eye in recent months. She did not appear at all on the most recent season of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” In January, she traveled back to the West Coast for a meet and greet at The Hollywood Show. The fan expo was held January 10 and 11 at the Los Angeles Marriott Burbank Hotel.

While greeting fans, she spoke to podcast host David Yontef. The “Behind the Velvet Rope” host raved about Richards' “lovely energy” as she met up with fans.

“Let's not forget Kim Richards is an actress,” Yontef told his podcast listeners. “She was on ‘Escape from Witch Mountain.' There are people that are a very huge fans of that show and all the other work that she's done.”

In September 2024, TMZ reported that Richards had an alleged relapse with alcohol.  But during the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” reunion, her sisters both said she was doing much better now.

7.3

Genre:

Jazz / Experimental

Label:

Drag City

Reviewed:

April 26, 2025

Perpetually glazed drone trio Bitchin Bajas and minimalist polyrhythm factory Natural Information Society have once again burbled up from the neon miasma where the cosmos meets your Discogs want list. Totality, an expansive, blissful 43-minute slow boat of nü-kosmische and minimalist rock, comes nearly 10 years after their last full-length collaboration, 2015's Autoimaginary. That album imagined the charged meeting between Terry Riley (circa 1964) and Terry Riley (circa 1969): The Bajas' new-age synth gush and fluttering flutes paved the Curved Rainbow Road, Natural Info Society steadily driving their drums, harmonium, and Moroccan guimbri down the autobahn. In matching up the tangerine dreamers in the former group and the dream syndicate outsiders in the latter, it would be a challenge to not produce something beautiful. The two bands are deeply steeped in the Chicago experimental music community, enthralled by 20th-century minimalism and Sun Ra, constantly aiming for ecstatic peaks, and willing to ride a wavelength indefinitely.

Naturally, their second album together delivers all their gorgeous hallmarks—warm harmonium drone, weightless synths, and Möbius strips of low end courtesy of Natural Information Society leader Joshua Abrams. If you expect a little more this time around, it's only because the bands have come so incredibly far individually in the last decade. Bitchin Bajas have consistently expanded their palette. Bajas Fresh, their 2017 career peak, sharpened their synths into diamonds of arpeggiated euphoria; the 2021 Sun Ra tribute Switched On Ra let them explore more amorphous and nocturnal zones; and 2022's excellent Bajacillators updated their sound with the hyperreal blips of Laurie Spiegel's Music Mouse software, sounding like a connection between the Berlin school and Japanese ambient. For their part, Natural Information Society have simply become one of best American rock bands going: a propulsive, celebratory dance act endlessly grooving somewhere on the perimeters of Afrobeat, avant-jazz, Gnawa music, and Steve Reich.

On Totality, NIS mostly deal in atmosphere and drama. Nearly 17 minutes long, the self-titled opener pulsates and throbs with specks of percussion and errant electronics, spiraling like dank, dazed, psychonautical jams in the vein of the Grateful Dead's “Dark Star” or Black Sabbath's “Planet Caravan.” Around the 12-minute mark, Abrams kicks into a lackadaisical 7/8 bassline and the track slowly morphs into a Jon Hassell-style dance under the moonlight. Side B sprawler “Always 9 Seconds Away” has a similarly sleepy crawl but plays like a doom-jazz version of the memory game Simon, its disjunctive melody growing like lichen.

The album finds its heights on the outliers, a pair of comparatively shorter tracks driven by NIS drummer Mikel Patrick Avery. The Harmonia vibes of “Nothing Does Not Show” are perfectly complemented by Avery's percolating rhythms, giving some focus to the haze. Closer “Clock No Clock” is a true marvel of jazz-motorik, Avery bustling with percussive raindrops, building to a hectic (yet marvelously mellow) climax.

Another sublime slab from two bands seemingly incapable of making a bad record, Totality doesn't really play to either bands' strengths as of late. National Information Society mostly keep cool, instead of firing up a perpetual-motion machine for head-boggling grooves. Bitchin Bajas remain flame-keepers of the sphere where Teutonic poise meets new-age fuzzies, but here they act as patient collaborators instead of scene-stealing spacemen. Still, this seven-headed hydra of head music remains a great ambassador of vibes.

							By 

	Mac William Bishop



	“Vladimir, STOP!”


	These were the feeble words of a cowardly blowhard, whose failure to bring the Russo-Ukrainian War into line with his imagined reality has begun to leave an impression on the one thing that matters most to President Donald Trump: his own ego.


	Trump has never understood the war in Ukraine, and as a result he has never had a meaningful plan for ending it.


	But for this president, failure is always someone else's fault. In the Trump White House, the buck stops with Joe Biden. Or the “stolen” 2020 election. Or Hillary Clinton. Or Barack Obama. Or Volodymyr Zelensky.


	On Saturday, on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis, the embattled Ukrainian president met with Trump in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.


	“Good meeting. We discussed a lot one on one. Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional cease-fire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out. Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic,” Zelensky wrote afterwards.

	











	The American president enjoys flashy, high-profile meetings that showcase his personal influence. The “impromptu” meeting was clearly engineered, a bit of carefully orchestrated high-stakes unofficial diplomacy that would make a Jesuit like Pope Francis proud. Photos from the funeral show Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer gathered around Trump: All of them have reason to hope they can shift his views and keep America in the game.


	Trump has a pathological inability to admit when he is wrong — this is the kind of man who used a sharpie to revise an official hurricane forecast because he misspoke, after all. So it shouldn't be a surprise that he has been unwilling to gather his courage, face the truth, and change course after his confident promises to end the war in Ukraine in “24 hours” turned out to be nothing more than hot air.


	Always keen to claim Russian President Vladimir Putin has all the cards, what Trump sees as a poker game is in fact a knife-fight. And everyone involved gets cut in a knife-fight, no matter what cards they were holding at the table.

	If the United States wants to break that fight up, it would be wise to do it wielding a pretty big stick. The White House has the ability to do this — to hit Putin where it hurts, economically and militarily, the only pressure points to which Russia will respond.

	











	Trump could, as he previously threatened, expand economic sanctions against Russia; he could increase U.S. energy exports and cut into the Kremlin's war chest; he could use Presidential Drawdown Authority to send vital weapons to Ukraine while backfilling American military stocks with new munitions; he could employ the bully pulpit to urge Congress to increase funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, demonstrating to Moscow that America isn't backing down; he could support European efforts to expand military cooperation with Kyiv.


	None of these would cross any red lines; none of these could be construed as escalatory.


	But Trump — in his eagerness to ally the world's most powerful democracy with a tyrannical aggressor — continues to do nothing to stop Russia but stand on the sidelines uttering weak-kneed protestations, and even those sparingly.


	How many times must it be explained that Ukraine is fighting for its existence, while Russia is fighting for conquest? Does anyone need to be told that asking Ukraine to surrender is equivalent to telling a neighbor he should let the armed intruder harm just a few of his kids, so that you can get back to your barbecue in peace, without all the screaming and commotion next door?

	Ukraine's dogged resistance mystifies those who are cowards at heart. Why would anyone want to keep fighting when — as Vice President J.D. Vance is always eager to point out — they are clearly losing?


	Simple. Because fighting a losing battle is preferable to extinction. The average barista in Kyiv, awaiting mobilization orders as he messages with friends on the frontlines, has a clearer understanding of the desperate situation than do most American politicians. And yet 82 percent of Ukrainians believe they must continue to fight, even if the U.S. withdraws all support.


	“Nations that went down fighting rose again, but those that surrendered tamely were finished,” Winston Churchill told his War Cabinet in May 1940. The modern history of Ukraine — the past 150 years of it, and more — is of a people struggling to define their national identity, amid an unenviable strategic position, crushed between great powers.


	In April 2022, I was at a forward operating base in Donetsk Oblast, speaking to a Ukrainian Marine about Russia's claims that only far-right extremists — “Ukronazis” as Moscow's propaganda called them — believed in a future separate from Russkiy Mir, or the “Russian World.” He found the entire idea laughable, protesting “but no one has done more for Ukrainian nationalism than Vladimir Putin.”

	











	Americans, in general, don't do nuance and complexity. And Trump, specifically, is so uninformed and convinced of his own genius that it is difficult even to engage with the views that drive his crackpot schemes.


Ukraine started the war? Hogwash. The war is a continuation of one that started in 2014, amid years of lies and broken promises by Putin.


	Zelensky is the biggest obstacle to peace? Nonsense. Putin started the war; it is the Russian military that occupies Ukrainian lands and attacks Ukrainian cities.


	Russia is a land of untapped economic opportunity, more important than Europe? Insanity. In 2021, before the war started, U.S. exports to Russia were $6.4 billion. That same year the U.S. exported $271.6 billion to the European Union alone.


	What can a reasonable person say to such a parade of lies and fallacies? Why entertain such nonsense?


	Oh, right. Because the American people elected this chaos monkey, this self-absorbed buffoon, knowing full well that he is all of those things and worse. But even so, part of his appeal was his promise to end this bloody war that has at times taken us to the brink, with open talk of the use of nuclear weapons.


	The “final offer” peace plan unveiled by Trump's minions in Paris last week was shameful idiocy of the highest order, offering Russia nearly everything it wanted and giving Ukraine nothing.


	It is the latest non-starter in a bunch of razzle-dazzle bullshit about rare-earth minerals, or trade deals, or whatever else catches the fancy of a man whose sharp business sense and financial acumen resulted in four bankruptcies, and the erasure of trillions of dollars in value from the stock market since he took office on Jan. 20. Trump has promised to walk away from Russia-Ukraine diplomacy if he doesn't get his way, which he almost certainly won't. 


	“No matter how a war starts, it ends in mud. It has to be slugged out — there are no trick solutions or cheap shortcuts,” said Gen. Joseph Stilwell, the U.S. commander of the China-Burma-India Theater in World War II.


	It should be obvious to any serious person that the only way to end the war is to put pressure on Russia and create guarantees for Ukraine's security. This was obvious to the man Trump originally put in charge of handling negotiations with Russia and Ukraine, special envoy Keith Kellogg. Even before Trump won office again, Kellogg put together an “America First” peace plan that called for decisive leadership and “bold diplomacy,” and continuing “to arm Ukraine and strengthen its defenses to ensure Russia will make no further advances and will not attack again after a cease-fire or peace agreement.”

	











	It was obvious to Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who in April 2022 wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News: “The Ukrainian people have shown spirit, heart, and productiveness. They now need all the guns, tanks, and planes capable to defeat Russia militarily, and retake Crimea and the Donbas to restore their borders.”


	Where are such voices now?


	The MAGA apparatchiks have been silenced. The party line inside the Trump administration now is to portray support for Ukraine as warmongering, and friendship with Russia as the overriding priority for American foreign policy. Creating robust alliances, taking principled stands against tyranny and aggression, supplying military equipment through drawdowns — this is all woke nonsense, used by corrupt effete foreigners to take advantage of honest red-blooded Americans, or whatever.


	It was obvious that the culture wars had come for the real war in Ukraine back in January 2024, when the U.S. Congress shirked its responsibilities as representatives of the American people to block approval of a funding bill under Biden for Ukraine.


	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) led the charge in kowtowing to Trump, the megalomaniac who holds a mesmerizing influence over his party, the man every Republican politician fears, knowing that if they act against his will, he will unleash the rage of his red-hatted cult with a poorly spelled social media post, rife with Teutonic capitalization of nouns.


	There are no checks on Trump. So when he says, as he did last week, that if Russia and Ukraine don't accede to the deal he has offered, “We're just going to say, ‘You're foolish, you're fools, you're horrible people,' and we're going to just take a pass,” there is every reason to believe him. Likely, he will once again cut off military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, moves that would effectively provide support to Russia.


	That will be tragic. There are conflicts in which Washington has little interest or leverage, such as the civil war in Sudan, or where it has twisted itself into such intricate Gordian knots of ethical compromise and geopolitical intrigue, such as with Israel's war in Gaza, that it is difficult to discern where America's interests lie.


	Ukraine is more straightforward. That the United States has a constructive role to play in this conflict is not a matter of justice, it is one of pragmatic self-interest — which just so happens to align with some of the highest values our nation espouses: liberty, democracy, and the rule of law.

	











	With an eye on Ukraine, the world has already begun to re-arm, investing trillions of dollars on tools of death and destruction as the perceived threat of future conflict grows. Leaders who have previously eschewed nuclear programs have begun to rethink their position.


	Will the world be a safer place if dictators are given free rein to pursue schemes of territorial expansion? Will the world be more stable if the only guarantee of survival for smaller nations is to acquire nuclear arsenals?


	There are already over 12,000 functioning nuclear weapons in the world, the bulk of which are held by Russia and the United States. Do we want to see more nuclear proliferation, with ever more borders regarded as violable? As I embedded with Ukrainian military units and watched Russian missiles rain down across the country in the first weeks of the war, it was easy to see that a Pandora's Box of instability and conflict was opening — one which had the potential to spiral into the destruction of humanity.


	“A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it!” as Leo Tolstoy's Prince Andrei observes about “the so-called Battle of the Three Emperors” in War and Peace: “Why did we lose the battle at Austerlitz? Our casualties were about the same as those of the French, but we had told ourselves early in the day that the battle was lost, so it was lost.”

	The defeatists in the Trump administration believe Ukraine's battle is lost, and want nothing further to do with helping to secure the peace. Ukrainians will continue to resist regardless. It isn't just shameful for Trump to walk away from this fight against the tyranny and chaos that threatens to engulf us all.


	It is a disastrous error which will have dire consequences.

	Rosa DeLauro



Rosa DeLauro represents Connecticut's 3rd District in the House of Representatives. She is the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, as well as on the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee.


	Last December, I wrote about the dangers of Donald Trump's nomination of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the unqualified, dangerous individuals appointed to lead key public health agencies. I made the case that these appointments, starting with Kennedy, were a deliberate attempt to break our health system, and would make Americans sicker.


	As the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, and of the Labor, Health, and Human Services (LHHS) subcommittee, I prioritize funding and oversight for these agencies. I know the importance of their missions.


	I did not expect Kennedy to simply obliterate health agencies that are key to our nation's progress and leadership in public health.

	Over the past four months, President Trump and RFK Jr., along with unchecked billionaire Elon Musk, have followed through on their threats to destroy the agencies that protect our health. As part of their drastic and haphazard purge and reorganization at HHS, they have eliminated entire agencies. Among them are institutions that have saved the lives of someone near to each and every one of us.


	The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which operates the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline — eliminated.


	The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which is responsible for ensuring access to health care for uninsured, isolated, and vulnerable people, like HIV/AIDS patients, mothers and children, and families in rural communities — eliminated.


	The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), which helps us respond to and prepare for public health emergencies — eliminated.


	And even the Administration for Community Living (ACL), the driving force behind programs like Meals on Wheels that curtail senior hunger and isolation — eliminated.

	I do not believe the American people want less health research, more infectious disease outbreaks, and cuts to Medicaid. The president took time in his first address to Congress to recognize a young boy battling brain cancer. But now, the White House and Republicans are taking resources away from people fighting cancer and diseases of all kinds.

	











	The administration has fired or pushed out thousands of experts and experienced staff who help keep Americans safe from infectious diseases, including Measles, HIV, and tuberculosis.


	Take the example of Peter Marks, the country's top vaccine regulator at the Food & Drug Administration, who helped develop the Covid vaccines at record speed under the first Trump administration. This effort helped prevent over three million additional deaths according to a study from the Commonwealth Fund. None of that mattered, because Marks was told to resign or be fired. In his resignation letter, Marks wrote that, quote, “it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.”


	At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where DOGE has already fired or pushed out 2,400 employees, Kennedy has eviscerated the offices that track the most urgent and alarming threats to public health, from HIV to cancer. These offices collected data that allowed everyone from community physicians to parents to make informed decisions about their families' health. Without this data, our public health experts will have a harder time identifying trends and prioritizing resources in our communities.

	HHS has terminated $11 billion in funding for state and local health departments, and DOGE is demanding CDC slash nearly $3 billion in grant funding, illegally cutting CDC's annual discretionary funding by over 30 percent. They are eliminating scores of CDC programs, including HIV prevention and tobacco prevention programs — programs that help save the lives of men, women, and children all across this country.


	Why on Earth are these the places DOGE is searching for so-called waste? The life of a teenager that does not become addicted to cigarettes is not a waste.


	At the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy has fired more than 2,000 employees, including several Directors of NIH's individual institutes. The administration has withheld federal funding from universities that do not adopt their preferred policies, cancelled research on topics they do not like, put tight restraints on NIH grants, and illegally impounded funding appropriated by Congress. The Administration has even terminated research funding for mRNA vaccines — one of the most promising innovations in medical research.


	There are a few glimmers of hope, and we are now seeing pushback at every level. The public is outraged at the enormous harm this effort has wrought. Dozens of courts have put restraining orders on the Administration's actions. But courts can only play defense.

	











	As the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to lead the fight against this shortsighted, dangerous plan. Congress is an institution that responds to external pressure, and we need to bring the pressure from Americans everywhere if we are going to protect ourselves from this lawless and reckless Trump administration.


	I want to close with an example that hits close to home for me and for millions of American families. In my district, scores of research programs at Yale University's graduate programs are funded by NIH grants. One PhD student at Yale, whose passion for science was inspired by their stepmother's melanoma diagnosis, was awarded the NIH Chemistry-Biology Interface Training Grant, which they are using to explore mechanisms of cancer metastasis.

Virginia Giuffre, the woman who accused the late convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein of trafficking her as a teenager, has died by suicide at the age of 41.


	Giuffre died in Neergabby, Australia, where she had been living, confirmed NBC News. “It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,” her family said in a statement to the outlet. “She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.”


	Giuffre, born Virginia Roberts, had alleged that she was brought into Epstein's circle by his now-convicted sex trafficker associate Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000, when she was 16, with the pair grooming her to provide sexual services to Epstein. At that point, she had already experienced the trauma of sexual assault by a family friend, lived on the streets of South Florida as a child runaway, and suffered abuse at the hands of Miami sex trafficker Ron Eppinger, who pleaded guilty in 2001 to smuggling women from Europe for prostitution.

	











	As the investigation into the harrowing allegations of sexual abuse against Epstein began, Giuffre became the most prominent whistleblower and provided key information to law enforcement that contributed to the conviction of Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for helping Epstein recruit, groom, and abuse girls. Giuffre alleged in depositions that she had been trafficked to powerful men in Epstein's orbit including former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell and Prince Andrew. Both denied the allegations.


	Epstein was arrested and charged by federal prosecutors with sex-trafficking and conspiracy in 2019. Just a month later, as he was being held without bail in Manhattan after pleading not guilty to the federal charges, Epstein was found dead in his jail cell. His death was ruled a suicide.

	In 2015, Giuffre founded Victims Refuse Silence, since renamed as Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (SOAR), a nonprofit advocacy group for survivors of sex trafficking. Following Epstein's death, she sat down with BBC and during the interview Giuffre claimed she had been trafficked to Prince Andrew and raped by the royal on three occasions, echoing allegations she had first made in a 2014 Florida court filing. She later sued Prince Andrew for sexual assault, and he settled the case out of court in 2022, before he would have been forced to give a sworn deposition. Andrew also pledged a donation to Giuffre's charity but did not admit to any of her claims.

	











	“Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking,” her family's statement read. “She was the light that lifted so many survivors.”

	In the recent Time magazine cover story on the first 100 days of Donald Trump's second term, a presidential aide explained the president's revenge strategy: “Look, either we come after you, we shut you down, or you're going to help me out.”


	There's a famous scene in Goodfellas that explains this mob boss mentality. In voiceover from Ray Liotta's wiseguy Henry Hill, we learn that the New York Mafia don Paulie tells anyone who owes him fealty, or really anything, “Fuck you, pay me” — or else. Unfortunately, Trump appears to be running the federal government with this same goon-like approach. Even worse, it's working — way too well. 


	When the president essentially said to Disney and Meta, Nice companies you got there, ABC and Facebook, it would be a shame if something happened to them, millions of dollars in settlements were soon dished out to Trump's presidential library fund. (What books would be on the shelves of a Trump library, besides The Art of the Deal, are anyone's guess.)

	











	Allegedly fierce law firms like Paul Weiss, Kirkland & Ellis, and Skadden Arps also bent the knee and capitulated, to the tune of hundreds of millions of billable legal hours. Columbia University soon followed suit to avoid the president's wrath (and preserve $400 million in funding). “I've gotta be doing something right, because I've had a lot of law firms give me a lot of money,” Trump gloated to Time.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Both houses of the GOP-controlled Congress have backed down, too, refusing to stand up to Trump's ruinous tariff policies that threaten to plunge us into a worldwide recession. A glum and shaken Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski recently admitted to her constituents that she and her colleagues “are all afraid,” and warned that “retaliation is real.” House Speaker Mike Johnson, a noted profile in courage, told Time: “President Trump is the most powerful force in politics in the modern era. Everybody wants to be on this train — and not in front of it.”

	Well, not everyone. Harvard has fought back against Trump's relentless bullying, filing a federal lawsuit accusing the administration of violating its First Amendment rights. A group of law firms have banded together to sue, protests have broken out in every state led by coalitions like 50501, and an anti-Elon Musk campaign and boycott have helped tank Tesla's stock amid the so-called Department of Government Efficiency's devastating budget cuts. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been barnstorming the country on an anti-oligarchy tour, speaking to massive crowds in places like Salt Lake City, no less. 

	











	Trump's current poll numbers are historically dismal, with a majority of respondents disapproving of his actions just four months into this term. Yet, the president in the Time interview expresses only triumph and ego. He even pushes back on the bedrock idea that the United States is a nation ruled by laws, not men. “We are a government where men are involved in the process of law, and ideally, you're going to have honest men like me,” Trump told Time. This is the road to autocracy masked as Trumpian exceptionalism.

	Trump likes to compare himself to Al Capone, Scarface himself. Like Capone did to Chicago during Prohibition, Trump threatens multiple pillars of our society — corporate America, universities, Congress — and through his ongoing campaign of fear, he's reaped millions. Turns out, the most powerful man in the world can be an effective shakedown artist.  


	Despite his fantasies though, the mob boss Trump more closely resembles is John Gotti. The “Dapper Don” and Trump rose up in the Seventies and Eighties in New York City. They were both from the outer boroughs — impressively coiffed, garish, brash invaders who dominated the tabloids with their exploits. Gotti, the most notorious mobster of his day, ruled by fear, intimidation, and murder. He was from the Goodfellas school of gangster, too. So naturally, one of his crime family underlings is now a MAGA politician in New Jersey. The “fuck you, pay me” ethos is an ugly and abiding side of the American way. Gotti and the Goodfellas crew got theirs in the end. Trump is another matter. His uncanny luck, political cunning, influence, and power have managed to keep him above the law — with no end in sight.

Lana Del Rey had a huge confession (and a little diss) to make at Stagecoach. While performing her new song “57.5” Friday night, the musician revealed she and Morgan Wallen once shared a kiss.


	“I kissed Morgan Wallen/I guess kissing me kind of went to his head,” Del Rey sang. “If you want my secret to success/I suggest don't go ATVing with him when you're out west.”

Lana Del Rey kissed Morgan Wallen! Lana was performing new song 57.5 at Stagecoach when she made the confession #lanadelrey #honeymoon #morganwallen #lanadelrey575 #stagecoach #stagecoach2025 


	The confession came after Del Rey — dressed in a red dress à la “Summertime Sadness” — alerted the crowd: “This is the last time I'm ever going to say this line.” After the Wallen confession, Del Rey made it clear: “Now I got a man, he really loves me… A fan of mine,” seemingly about her husband Jeremy Dufrene whom she alluded was in the audience.


	The song title, “57.5,” was an ode to the number of fans she has, as she repeated the refrain “57.5 million listeners on Spotify” in the chorus of the song.

	











	Del Rey's Stagecoach performance featured three new songs set to appear on her 10th studio album, The Right Person Will Stay, which is expected later this year. She opened her Palomino Stage hourlong set with “Husband of Mine,” about Dufrene, and also played a new track titled “Quiet in the South.”

	Last year, Del Rey performed at Stagecoach alongside Paul Cauthen to perform “Unchained Melody.” She also headlined Coachella last year.

Saturday April 26, 2025 

TechTron 2025, the University of Asia Pacific's (UAP) flagship technology festival, commenced today with vibrant energy, showcasing innovation, engineering prowess, and the spirit of academic-industry collaboration.

The national-level festival is jointly organised by the UAP EEE Project Club and the IEEE UAP Student Branch under the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), UAP.

The grand opening ceremony at UAP Plaza was graced by Professor Dr Qumrul Ahsan, Vice-Chancellor of UAP, as the Chief Guest. In his inaugural remarks, he said, ""TechTron 2025 is an exemplary event that inspires students not only to excel academically but also to serve society through real-life innovations. Events like these build vital bridges between academia and industry, and UAP remains steadfast in encouraging such impactful initiatives.""

Professor Dr G R Ahmed Jamal, Dean of the School of Engineering, noted, ""To lead technological advancement in today's ever-evolving world, students must be empowered with innovation, practical knowledge, and problem-solving skills. TechTron provides the perfect platform for showcasing these abilities.""

A H M Jadidul Karim, Head of the Department of EEE, commended the EEE Project Club and the IEEE UAP Student Branch for their tireless efforts. He expressed pride in UAP's role in hosting a festival that unites aspiring engineers from across the nation.

TechTron 2025 welcomed students from over 35 universities across Bangladesh, engaging them in a rich array of technology-based competitions and exhibitions, including innovative project showcases, robotics challenges, poster presentations, and online gaming contests. The event served as a dynamic stage for young minds to exhibit creativity, sharpen problem-solving capabilities, and demonstrate technical expertise.

The day's festivities culminated in an awards ceremony, celebrating the ingenuity of participants and reaffirming UAP's enduring commitment to promoting STEM education, innovation, and industry readiness. Architect Mahbuba Haque, Chairperson of the Board of Trustees, UAP, graced the closing event as Chief Guest.

Special Guests included Engr Muhammad Jahangir Alam, Chief Engineer, Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB); Dr Md Shamiul Fahad from Intel Corporation, Oregon, USA; and Fahim Mahmud, UAP EEE alumnus and Country Manager at Crown Micro Global Bangladesh Ltd. Their presence underscored the powerful symbiosis between academia and industry—a theme that echoed throughout this year's celebrations.

The event drew deans, faculty members, students, and distinguished guests from numerous public and private organisations, creating a vivid tapestry of Bangladesh's future engineers and innovators.

Actress, Sahiba Bali is known for her powerful on-screen performances and has also been managing her role as a content creator. She has become famous in both domains, and for a couple of years, she has been known for her work in movies and shows such as Amar Singh Chamkila, Tanaav, and Laila Majnu. However, in a recent Instagram story, Sahiba revealed an eerie experience she faced that shocked even netizens.

Sahiba Bali's gifts disappeared from her room automatically
Sahiba, who is an influencer and also an actress, is someone who likes to be away from the limelight. In a recent story that went viral on Reddit, Sahiba shared that she does not necessarily believe in paranormal activities or ghosts, but she does believe in energies. And it's so weird that she does not know why she is sharing this. The actress made a selfie video and showed on top of the table that she had kept some gifts that she got from Egypt. It had some dates, jewellery, a tomb and a crystal. In her words:

""Now, a tomb basically represents death right, and the crystal was part of the pyramid. And last night I kept everything here so when I woke up in the morning, no one had entered my room. My dates and random jewellery are there but the two things that are not there are the tomb and the crystal, and it is bizarre. And I searched my entire room, I kept it last night before sleeping. I have woken up. Everything is constant except the presence of those two.""

Netizens discuss Sahiba Bali's tomb souvenir vanishing
A Redditor saw the story of Sahiba's crystal vanishing and shared that sometimes it happens when there is too much negativity. It meant that it took away all the negativity. A Redditor also said, ""According to an obscure Egyptian legend, there's a type of protective spirit called a Sah-Hekau- a guardian of objects linked to death. These spirits don't always manifest physically."" One user wrote, ""Sundar log bhi bhootpaglu hotey hai. What's bizzaaareee is she was definitely high."" One also said, ""IDK about her incident but I do believe in this!""

A netizen blames cricketer, Shreyas Iyer for paranormal activity that took place with Sahiba Bali
For the unversed Punjab Kings (PBKS) player, Shreyas Iyer was earlier seen engaging in playful banter with Sahiba. She had branded him as a rude person as he did not invite her to the gym. Sahiba was seen sitting in the car with Shreyas and telling him that his tattoo was cool and intricate. He said his tattoo was immaculate, to which she told him why he was scolding her. She said she would walk with him as he had his gym class, to which Shreyas did not even call her. A netizen wrote:      


""Shreyas iyer le gaya hoga. Us se puchle ek baar.""

When Sahiba Bali shared about having a non-social media life

""I recently got a car, and the car dealership knew of me. They were really excited that I purchased the car from them. They said, 'Please make a Reel and put it up'. I said no. They said, 'All influencers and actors do that'. But I didn't want to.""

And it's so weird that she does not know why she is sharing this. The actress made a selfie video and showed on top of the table that she had kept some gifts that she got from Egypt. It had some dates, jewellery, a tomb and a crystal. In her words:

""Now, a tomb basically represents death right, and the crystal was part of the pyramid. And last night I kept everything here so when I woke up in the morning, no one had entered my room. My dates and random jewellery are there but the two things that are not there are the tomb and the crystal, and it is bizarre. And I searched my entire room, I kept it last night before sleeping. I have woken up. Everything is constant except the presence of those two.""

Netizens discuss Sahiba Bali's tomb souvenir vanishing
A Redditor saw the story of Sahiba's crystal vanishing and shared that sometimes it happens when there is too much negativity. It meant that it took away all the negativity. A Redditor also said, ""According to an obscure Egyptian legend, there's a type of protective spirit called a Sah-Hekau- a guardian of objects linked to death. These spirits don't always manifest physically."" One user wrote, ""Sundar log bhi bhootpaglu hotey hai. What's bizzaaareee is she was definitely high."" One also said, ""IDK about her incident but I do believe in this!""

A netizen blames cricketer, Shreyas Iyer for paranormal activity that took place with Sahiba Bali
For the unversed Punjab Kings (PBKS) player, Shreyas Iyer was earlier seen engaging in playful banter with Sahiba. She had branded him as a rude person as he did not invite her to the gym. Sahiba was seen sitting in the car with Shreyas and telling him that his tattoo was cool and intricate. He said his tattoo was immaculate, to which she told him why he was scolding her. She said she would walk with him as he had his gym class, to which Shreyas did not even call her. A netizen wrote:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=paranormal","Nightly Bruin: Inside UCLA's Parapsychology Lab","https://dailybruin.com/2025/04/25/nightly-bruin-inside-uclas-parapsychology-lab","Sat, 26 Apr 2025 04:20:00 GMT","

Amber Chen/Daily Bruin staff

Before ghost-hunting shows and viral psychic videos, UCLA ran a real parapsychology lab, hidden in the old Neuropsychiatric Institute. In this episode of Nightly Bruin, Jina Bae, Audrey Turner, Olivia Miller and Srinidhi Naragajan uncover the strange history of the lab – from psychic experiments and telepathy tests to celebrity visits and chilling premonitions that turned tragically real. Featuring exclusive interviews with Dr. Barry Taff and Dr. Judith Orloff, we dive into the forgotten story of when UCLA tried to study the unexplainable – and what it cost.



Jina Bae: Hello, and welcome to nightly Bruin, where we uncover the mysterious side of UCLA. My name is Jina bae, and I'm a podcast contributor at the Daily Bruin.

Audrey Turner: And this is Audrey Turner, and I am a podcast contributor as well. Today, we are tapping into the paranormal, the study that tries to explain the unexplainable.

JB: So, first, what is parapsychology?

AT: Psychology Today defines it as a field of study that investigates paranormal or psychic phenomena, including purported mental abilities such as telepathy or telekinesis. Parapsychologists aim to test the existence and explore the nature of experiences and abilities in the paranormal realm.

JB: And what do they study?

AT: So they study extrasensory perception, telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, psychometry and a lot more.

JB: And where was this studied?

AT: It was actually studied right here at UCLA for 10 years, 1968 to 78.

JB: Wow, how did people react to this?

AT: According to Barry E. Taff, who is a former researcher at the UCLA Parapsychology lab. Reality TV entertainment polluted its legitimacy. This caused people to doubt it, labeling it as pseudoscience. As a matter of fact, Carol Burnett came by the Parapsychology lab to try creating photos with her mind. The people making the exorcist visited while researching for the movie. William Fredkin, the director, actually consulted with the researchers.

JB: Speaking of the entertainment industry, who was Thelma Moss?

AT: Yeah, so she was a Broadway actress turned screenwriter. Her interest in starting the lab was catalyzed by a former encounter with Alec Guinness, the star of one of her movies, and then James Dean, someone who the two met at a restaurant. Dean showed the two a sports car, and Guinness warned him that if he got in that car, he would be dead in the next week. Dean brushed it off, but ended up being killed in an accident the very next Friday.

JB: Did Moss continue pursuing this path as a screenwriter?

AT: No, she did not. Unfortunately, her husband died just after their daughter was born in 1954, which drove her to depression and suicide attempts. She attempted some other psychiatric treatments, but finding them lacking, she turned to LSD assisted therapy. After her positive experiences with it, she wrote a book called “My Self and I,” eventually pursuing a psychology doctorate degree.

JB: Where did her experiences take her next?

AT: Well, she decided to start teaching at UCLA, specifically in the field of medical psychology. However, one of her most notable aspects of her teaching career was founding a lab that studies paranormal phenomena.

JB: What were some of the most significant areas of research?

AT: Her controversial research on Kirlian photography is what she's best known for. She was excited by the prospect of creating images that embody religious halos and the legendary aura that could aid treatment for rare diseases like cancer.

JB: Is this technique still used today?

AT: It's not used for treatments Moss envisioned, but rather for more of an art form today.

JB: Is there anyone notable that she trained?

AT: Barry E. Taff, Kerry Gaynor and Judith Orloff are three established parapsychologists who she trained, who completed tasks ranging from examining haunted locations to becoming an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at UCLA.

JB: Barry E. Taff was a researcher with his own psychic abilities; the lab published a paper specifically on Barry E. Taff in a medical journal.

AT: Is this paper available to the public?

JB: No, according to Taff, publishers rejected publication of the research paper as the data collected from him was unique. Thus editors assumed that the equipment was broken.

AT: Well, how did the lab collect data, if not on a researcher himself, like Barry E. Taff, how did this lab operate on a daily basis?

JB: Researchers Barry E. Taff and Karry Gaynor would go to investigate houses. They had a methodological approach, as they had an extensive interview with subjects who reported cases of paranormal activity first.

AT: What were these questions for?

JB: The questions were to weed out cases that had normal explanations. Turns out, in the 4800 cases, most of them had normal explanations.

AT:  Okay, well, how about the cases that didn't have normal explanations?

JB: There was one famous case in Culver City, where reports mentioned seeing objects moving on their own and weird lights appearing out of the blue. The first time researchers entered the house, they said a frying pan flew out of the cupboard at them. Researchers took the cabinet apart in attempts to figure out what was happening, but failed to make meaningful conclusions. Ultimately, the Culver City case was turned into a movie called The Entity with Barbara Hershey.

AT: What happened to the lab? Did anyone visit?

JB: People did. One such case involved Albert Salmi, a Hollywood actor known for Escape from the Planet of the Apes, Dragonslayer, Caddyshack and Gunsmoke. In the 1970s, Salmi's wife, Roberta, visited the UCLA parapsychology lab. During her visit, several research subjects reported unsettling premonitions – visions of a tragic fate for Roberta. They predicted a dark and violent event involving Roberta and her husband, raising concerns that something tragic might unfold in the future. She ignored the warning.

AT: Wow. So what happened next?

JB: Then, years later, in April 1990 Albert Salmi killed Roberta in a murder suicide in the couple's home. Taff himself later recounted this event, emphasizing how research subjects at the lab had predicted the tragedy years before it happened.

AT: So, what were the objectives of these studies?

JB:  According to Doctor Barry Taff and Kerry Gaynor in an interview following the release of the movie “The Entity,” they stated their effort is to reveal an objective reality to supernatural events that had been treated as subjective experiences for the past hundreds of years.

AT: So, were there other institutions, apart from UCLA lab, that conducted research in the field of parapsychology?

JB: Yes, some other notable institutions included the Duke University's Parapsychology laboratory of the 1930s to 1960s, Stanford Research Institute, which ran between 1970s to 80s, and the Princeton engineering animals Research Lab running between 1979 to 2007 notably, the Stanford Research Institute was a CIA responsive research to develop military applications of remote viewing, the alleged ability to perceive distant or unseen locations, objects or people through extrasensory perception. The idea was to train individuals to visualize and describe hidden targets, such as enemy military installations, without being physically present.

AT: And I know there are a lot of students who would love a research position in a Parapsychology lab. So, does the UCLA lab still exist today?

JB: No. The lab gained so much popularity that it drew the attention of influential people in the field, like Carlos Castaneda and Uri Geller. But this popularity led to UCLA shutting down the lab and firing Moss in 1978.

AT: So, how long did Thelma continue her work for?

JB: She continued working in private, but due to a cerebral aneurysm in the 1980s she had to stop working.

AT: And, she had a prominent influence, according to her, she was able to improve the telepathic abilities of her subjects with techniques like sensory deprivation, emotionally charged material and drug induction, which are employed by many parapsychologists today.

JB: Our producer contacted Barry E. Taff, who is willing to speak with us for the episode of Nightly Bruin.

Olivia Miller: The Daily Bruin sat down with Barry Taff and Judith Orloff to explore the unexplainable and their experiences being involved in the world of parapsychology, which The Bruin couldn't independently verify.

OM: Doctor Taff, welcome to The Nightly Bruin.

 Barry Taff: Thank you for inviting me. I'm happy to be here.

 OM: So, can you start by telling us a little about yourself?

 BT: Okay, it's real simple. Growing up, I was having chronic paranormal experiences – telepathic, precognitive, out-of-body – all that. And it was normal for me, but it wasn't normal for my friends and family. They began to think, “What's wrong with Barry?” You know? So they kept happening, and the older I got, the more frequent they became.

So I learned that a woman named Dr. Thelma Moss had a laboratory at UCLA dealing with parapsychology – not a department, a laboratory. It was located in what's called the old Neuropsychiatric Institute, part of the medical center. Now it's called the Semel Institute because Terry Semel gave money to it. We were on the fifth floor – it was weird, the bottom floors were two levels lower, then it went up. We were on the fifth floor, the small lab, and that's where the fruitful work was being done.

And what really was the demise of her career was getting involved in Kirlian photography – which is a waste of time. It's not paranormal photography, it's corona discharge, and it can be manipulated by things like humidity or lack of moisture. Because she got away from the actual paranormal work and focused on Kirlian.

She was hired as a clinical psychologist to have patients, evaluate them and write assessments – but she was doing more of the Kirlian photography. How all this began was with Dr. West – he was the head of the NPI. We met, but we didn't really know each other. 

What I didn't know until a few years ago was that he was the one who sent intelligence people to my research group, not Dr. Moss. So he knew what we were doing, but he couldn't acknowledge it or he'd be fired.

I should say another thing that got me involved with this field is that I'm a medical intuitive. I can look through people like I'm looking through glass. I can diagnose the problems people have – or are going to have – with regularity. And it's caused a lot of problems. Friends and people feel very awkward or stressed around me, worried I'm going to pick up something on them. It's that simple, and I can't explain it.

OM: Do you have an exact reason why it shut down?

 BT: Well, it's pretty simple. Universities – whether they're public like the University of California or private like USC or Stanford – they exist on endowments. People endow money to the university so they can keep functioning. If the university is linked to something that most people think is wacky or crazy, those endowments disappear. It's that simple. Paranoia, I get it. If I weren't there, I'd say, “No, no.” But that's what it comes down to.

 OM: This kind of work is not accepted in mainstream science. And I think in previous phone calls, you were saying how it's sometimes labeled as anti-science. Right, so how do we bridge the gap between making this a more legitimate field of study?

BT: Study my ability in telepathy and precognition, clairvoyance, whatever you call it. I'd be in one part of the lab, in a special chamber – an isolation chamber that shields you from the environment. I'd be in there, and Dr. Moss would be doing something else on campus or further away. My job was to describe what I saw. This went on for weeks and months. Nothing – until something critical happened.

They took measurements of my body, including an EEG. So they wired me up – electrodes on my head – and in normal waking consciousness, like I am now speaking, I was generating about 10 hertz at about 1,000 microvolts, which would kill a horse. They did it again. You could hear the needles on the dial – boom, boom, boom – because the amplitude was so high. We did it again.

A study was done and submitted to medical journals. One of them published it in 1974 or '75, I forget the journal's name. But one thing they refused to publish was the neurophysiological data. They said anyone who had that kind of amperage in their brain would die, go into seizure or worse. They wouldn't publish it.

We went to three different labs at the medical center and got the same measurements. Most people generate weak EEG signals. So I was talking to Dr. Moss, and they said, “We're sorry, but this can't be real. No one has brainwaves like that.”

So I became a research assistant in the lab. I was finishing my bachelor's degree and then entered a doctoral program at UCLA in psychophysiology and biomedical engineering – a cheaper way to study medicine. But I got in trouble because I asked too many questions in class. Professors told me, “If you keep asking questions, we'll throw you out.” They didn't like being questioned, especially when they didn't have the answers.

I got my doctorate in 1975, and the lab was still running. I did two things. One was what became known as remote viewing – the ability to see what's in another room or location. This was before video cameras. My theory was, if you use a standard learning paradigm, could you train people to be psychic – people who'd never had those experiences?

Worst case, nothing happens. Best case, something. So we started running the work – couple times a week, using sensory deprivation. Complete darkness, no sound, only your mind. Rather than writing things down, I told people to verbally describe what they saw.

This went on and on. We had lots of people come in – some regular men and women, but others just kept showing up. I didn't know who they were. One gave us a name for something that sounded really bizarre. I remember describing a new submarine with something called the Trident D5 missile. This was before those submarines were even built.

These people kept showing up. We described environments we couldn't have known about. And some of the things I or others said were so specific, they demanded we surrender the audio tapes because there was classified information on them.

Then the government started visiting our group more frequently. We didn't know who these people were at first. They were mostly men, some women – adults, older than me by at least a decade. We had visitors from the Department of Defense, DARPA, the CIA, the NSA – all these intelligence agencies. They kept trying to test us, and it worked.

We could control it to a degree. It worked well enough that we were shocked by the continuity of it. The method we used, standard learning paradigm, if you're doing a specific task, and you're informed as to when it is working properly or not working properly, you'll begin to understand what to do to make it work again. Standard learning paradigm. When you're in any form of academia, that's normal.

Eventually, we got bored. We moved on to something even more compelling: investigating poltergeists and hauntings. Over the years, we've done thousands of cases. I'd say 99% of them, you go out, interview people, measure the environment, and leave. That's it. It's like winning the billion-dollar lottery, very rare.

But once in a while, something happens that really shakes everything up.

My old colleague Kerry Gaynor was in Hunter's Books in Westwood, talking about our work. A woman overheard and said, “Excuse me, my house is haunted.” She gave us her number. We went out to her house in Culver City on August 22, 1974. Rundown shack. Smelled like something died, decomposing odor, urine.

Her name was Doris Bither. Well, the first thought I had was that she needed psychologist intervention, not parapsychological investigation. The house was horrible – hot, humid, no air conditioning. We didn't think we could do anything. But about a week later, she called again. More things were happening. It wasn't far from where both Kerry and I lived, so we went back.

Same kind of thing – really hot, really humid. We were in the kitchen. One of the lower cupboard doors flew open, and an iron skillet flew across the kitchen. We checked – animals, no kids, no wires or springs.

Skeptics say “How far did it go?” Who cares?  We were there to collect data. Something paranormal was clearly happening.

As the case evolved, we found that the phenomena were somehow tied to music. When she played certain music, stuff would happen. She played Black Sabbath – music that could drive anything, living or dead, crazy. The cupboard flew open again. In her bedroom, we captured a photo that looked like a comet, this ball of light with a tail.

We were using Tri-X 6400 film, Kodak's sensitive black-and-white film at the time. Things just kept escalating. Items moved around. Lights showed up in the room. We ended up investigating that case for 10 weeks – long for us.

At one point, we were in her bedroom. Lights started showing up. To make sure it wasn't coming from outside, we sealed all the windows with black poster board. Since we couldn't tell how fast it was moving, we even labeled the walls with magnetic orientations – West, North, East, whatever.

And then we saw these beautiful, floating, corpuscular masses – if you remember what a lava lamp looks like. It looks like these large things of green Jell-O zipping around the room. watched them come and go. We took photos.

One night, Doris was sitting on her bed. Lights zipped around her. We captured two of our most famous photos from that case. In one, you see Doris flinching, lights arcing around her. In another, there's a secondary arc in the upper left corner.

Here's what we learned. Before Doris moved to Culver City with her four kids, she'd lived in Santa Monica. Similar phenomena had occurred there, but less frequently. So we started to think this was an extension of Doris, not the house.

I don't personally believe there was some conscious entity assaulting her. That's what people think, but my gut tells me otherwise. If I met her today, the first thing I'd do is test her for epilepsy.

In my 56 years in this field, almost every poltergeist agent I've met turned out to be seizure-prone or epileptic. That doesn't mean all epileptics are poltergeists, but there's something in between we haven't identified yet.

Many people will be like, “Oh, by the way, I'm epileptic,” after telling us about their experience. It's almost always the missing link.

I discuss this in my book, “Aliens Below.” I use the term “inductive resonance coupling,” a physics concept. If someone is hypersensitive to these services, their body may be more permeable. The environment affects them, and they end up emitting things they wouldn't otherwise.

Doris eventually moved from Culver City to Carson. Now she was wise. We never brought her in front of the media. She would've been a terrible public witness. By that time, I knew Frank Delfino, the filmmaker, director and writer. We invited him to meet Doris. And she was very cryptic with Kerry and I, she wouldn't even tell us her age. Nowadays, I get up and leave. Not worth our time.

So she moved, and the phenomenon moved with her. She never told her new neighbors about anything.

OM: Now, we turn to our conversation with Dr. Judith Orloff, a UCLA psychiatrist, author and former member of the parapsychology lab who explores the connection between intuition, energy and emotional well-being.

Srinidhi Nagarajan: I saw that you joined the UCLA parapsychology lab when you were 19 years old, so I was curious about what drew you in and what your first encounter with the work was like. 

Judith Orloff: Yes, that lab was run by my mentor, Dr. Thelma Moss, who was a premier parapsychologist. And she studied – you know, in today's terminology, she studied consciousness. In those days, it was called parapsychology.

JO: More she was, what brought me there was that I was an empathic child. I was an empath, and I had very strong intuitions that came true that were very hard for me to integrate into my life, and my parents, who were both doctors, and I have 25 doctors in my family, said, “Never mention another one of your intuitions again at home.” So I went through a period where I got involved with drugs as a teenager, and I was eventually sent to the psychiatrist, Dr. Jim Grold, who was able to say to me, “In order to be whole, you have to incorporate your intuition into who you are.” And I'd like you to go see this parapsychologist, Dr. Thelma Moss at UCLA. So my psychiatrist, at a very young age, sent me over there, which was fantastic. You know, it was the best thing that ever could have happened to me. And she welcomed me into her lab. She gave me to test, me to – she gave me her keys. I went to her little office downstairs, and she tested me, and I held her keys, and she says, “Just tell me what comes to you. It could be anything.” And so I shared some impressions that I had, and she said, “They're very accurate. I think you need to come and volunteer in our lab, and you're going to learn so much and feel so much better about yourself as a result.” And so I began, you know, at that age, to work in the most wondrous place that is imaginable for me, because I, you know, it always felt not a part of, I always felt different. I always felt nobody understood me, and this was the first place where they truly did understand me. I mean, more than that, scientists were basing their careers on this topic. So it was just a teeny, tiny little lab. It was like a hole in the wall, and so it didn't have much space in the UCLA system, but Jolly West befriended Thelma Moss and was her champion, so she stayed there for many years.

SN: I'm very curious to hear a bit more about what Thelma Moss was like as a mentor, like, maybe apart from those kind of – that initial integration throughout your work in the lab, how she encouraged you to embrace your abilities and helped you feel involved in the work that was happening, and just kind of more about your experience with her in general.

JO: Well, she always wore a white coat with her name on it. She was a very strong woman, very authoritative woman. She didn't put up with much, you know, she just was devoted to the work, and she was very curious. She, despite her traditional psychological background, she wasn't an MD. She was a psychologist. She invited all kinds of healers to the lab. She was very curious and open. And we had Uri Geller come to the lab, who was a psychic years ago. I'm hesitant to use the word psychic because it turns people off, but an intuitive years ago, who used to bend metal with his mind, and so she brought him to the lab, and we witnessed this. And in fact, my own keys got bent. My house keys got bent during the experiment, so I'll always remember that. And she was, what she did, she assigned me a project. It was a year-long project of something called Kirlian photography. And what that is, is that it's a special photographic technique that measures, supposedly, the energy field around plants. And so I picked five of my favorite plants, the leaves, and I would take pictures of them each month to see how they changed with the seasons. At the end, we saw, you know, what happened, you know, in terms of the plants. And we also did some fun things, where if someone came into the lab, we'd ask them to put their hand next to the plants. And sometimes the plant liked the person. And the other times, you know, you saw the energy going completely the other way, you know. And then some people would embrace – so, you know, a lot of people don't think that there's anything to Kirlian photography, but I really think there is. And I think plants have been proven, you know, years later, to, you know, have an amazing form of communication with each other and the world and us with plants. So it was before all the information, scientific information, came in. And so I was working in that capacity and witnessing different healers as they did – of laying on of hands, you know, and different kinds of intuitive readings. What was – can you understand what an important turning point that was for me, when I had never been understood before, and here was just all these people suddenly out of the blue. And so I'm very grateful to my psychiatrist at that time, and in fact, he inspired me to go into psychiatry, you know, which I've been in for 30 years. It all worked out.

SN: Although there are these researchers that were very supportive of this field, I'm curious how you and the others in the lab handled skepticism that you faced, both internally and from the broader scientific community. I'm curious how that kind of expanded, you know, as you began working with the lab, and how you learned, maybe from your mentors, you know, techniques to handle that, and just how you all approach that kind of skepticism in general.

JO: Well, it's part of the landscape. You know, what I learned from the lab and what I practice is total acceptance of skepticism. People are entitled to believe as they will, and if it goes against their basic belief system, they don't want to develop their intuition. They don't want to see reality bigger than what they're used to. That's fine, you know, I don't have any negative feelings about it, but those what I do know, and certainly since I've written books, and, you know, I wrote my first book, Second Sight, which was all about me integrating intuition with traditional medicine and my childhood, and how I came to grips with my intuition, how I brought it together in terms of who I am anyways, you know, I built my whole professional life on the basis that we're more than just one thing. We can be intellectual, we can be intuitive, we can be heart-centered, we can be logical. You know, we don't have to just be one thing. And so there's so many people who are attracted to that, let me tell you that for the ones who are skeptical, God bless them. I hope they're happy and go about your path, you know. I'm just thrilled everybody's here on this beautiful Earth, you know, trying to make sense out of it.

SN: Kind of building off of what you just said about integrating the intuitive, the intellectual, all these different fields. What was it that kind of prompted you to pursue traditional medicine after your time at the lab? And did you ever feel sort of tension between your scientific training and your intuitive experiences? Or did you feel like that was kind of a natural path for you?

JO: I kind of swung like a pendulum. I spent those years with Thelma Moss, a few years with Thelma Moss, and then I had a dream while I was working in her lab, in which a voice came to me in the dream and said, “You need to become a psychiatrist in order to have the credentials to legitimize intuition and medicine,” basically. And in the dream, I thought, Oh, my God, that's – you know, that's OK. I thought, that's great. But then I woke up, and it was the last thing I wanted to do, believe me. I didn't – my parents, you know, I was brought up around doctors all the time, you know. My parents had such active practices, and they were so in love with their work. But I didn't want to do that. I wanted to become an artist or a writer, and my friends were always on the fringe and the edge, so I had no interest really when I woke up with doing it. But because of Thelma and because I was starting to trust my intuition, I enrolled in Santa Monica College just to see how it would go I had dropped out of school, by the way, at that point when I was with Thelma, and one course became two, became, you know, all the years of medical training, because it was my destiny. And so I just gave it a little chance. I enrolled in one class just to see how it would go. And I remember it was a geography class because there was nothing left. It was perfect because it talked about the physical dynamics of the wind and the moon and the stars and the Earth and how we're all connected. And it was just perfect for me. So that's how I got started. And then I – when I went to medical school, I had a very hard time with the first year, because it was a science. I wasn't – I was more artistic and this was all scientific, and I had a hard time learning to think that way, but I had, you know, very wonderful people along the path who helped me think that way, who helped me study, who helped me to open up my mind to that. And then I graduated USC, and then I did my psychiatric residency at UCLA, where I still supervise residents on a weekly basis, teaching them to integrate intuition and empathy into their patient care. I supervise them with their patients.

And so that's kind of the long arc of this story, but I want to say that when I went through my medical training, I strayed very far from the intuitive realm. Again, I got deeply immersed in science, and the only people I saw who had any kind of intuition were psychotic people who came into the emergency room, who were psychotic and claiming to see God or claiming to predict the future. And so, psychic was equated with psychotic, which was not good from my perspective. And so I kind of strayed away. That was the only paradigm psychiatry had at that point for trying to explain the whole thing. And so I went very far. But then when I graduated my residency, I went far for about, oh, maybe eight years, eight years, you know, through my medical training. And then after I graduated, my intuitive side began to open up again. And then from then on, it stayed open.

SN: I was wondering if maybe you could explain for us what the difference is clinically between intuition and something like psychosis, and how you distinguish those lines within your psychiatric work?

JO: Yes, well, intuition is listening to the still small voice inside that tells you the truth about things, either through compassion or through neutrality. That's how the most accurate intuitions are. Psychosis is when you hear voices talking to you, telling you to hurt yourself or hurt somebody else or do something negative or destructive, and intuition never tells you to do that.

SN: I see. So intuition is more about kind of listening to like your inner thoughts, and that are guiding you in the right direction, versus something that you kind of verbally hear, that may be pushing you to do something not ideal, that's kind of harmful to you and other people. That makes sense, that's a really great distinction. And I was also wondering what advice you would give to someone who is curious about their intuition but is afraid of judgment or being wrong, or just kind of, you know, associated fears with trusting that part of themselves a little bit more?

JO: Right. Well, you will be wrong. That's part of the process. Now, when you learn to trust your intuition, it's a learning curve. So, you know, I suggest people get my first book, Second Sight, or my second book, “Guide to Intuitive Healing,” to have a plan in terms of how to develop your intuition – like listening to your gut feeling, that's very important. Or listening to a hunch you might have, or listening to a dream that you might get with somebody, or listening to your body, so that if you feel, let's say, drained around somebody, that's your intuition telling you something's off.

So I would suggest be very self-compassionate. It's a process. The more you practice, the better you get. And to share it with like-minded people. You know what? In the beginning, what you don't want to be around are all these people – naysayers saying, “Oh, you can't do it, this is not good,” and there are plenty of them. Let me tell you, there are plenty of them. But to be around positive people who just, you know, want to support you in listening to your inner voice.

SN: I actually had one quick question about the lab that I forgot to ask earlier that I wanted to touch back on. So in my research, I found that the time you were working there, the lab was not officially sanctioned by UCLA. And so I was wondering how that affected, maybe, the work being done, and how seriously it was taken at the time, like that aspect, specifically the thought that it wasn't sanctioned.

JO: But to be honest with you, when I was that age and I walked in there, I don't think I knew anything about that. That was not, I wasn't, they didn't share that with me. It wasn't a big worry that I heard about all the time, and so I didn't know, and I didn't care. I found my tribe. You know, I just was so happy that somebody understood me.

SN: You mentioned your first book, “Second Sight.” I would love to hear a little bit more about maybe what inspired you to write that, to talk about your journey and compile your advice in that way.

JO: So, “Second Sight” was my first book. It took me eight years to write, and it was because I had so much fear about what people would think of me when it came out. You know, I had a lot of fear that my medical colleagues would mock me or would somehow hurt me in the medical profession. My mother, who was a physician, really fed into that belief system. You know, she said, “Be careful, you know, you don't want to offend anyone, you don't want people to think you're weird,” you know, all that voice. And so that took some working through for me, you know, to be able to feel comfortable.

But my desire to share with people my process – and that as a psychiatrist, as a therapist, as a massage therapist, as – you know, anybody in the helping professions, it is vital to incorporate intuition into how you work with people. And I knew that at the time, and I wanted – and because of my dream that I had years ago, I knew that that was part of what I was supposed to be doing here. And so I wanted to write it in such a way through a personal journey, so people can know what I went through and my pain and my shame of having these abilities and how I was able to get through it, to get to a point of really being helpful to large numbers of people.

And so this book was the vehicle to do that. And I found that when the book came out, and I saw all the positive response to it, and people saying, “I needed to hear this. I needed to learn this. I want to learn how to incorporate intuition into working with patients,” I knew that everything would be all right because I saw the good it could be done from it. So I recommend everyone who's starting to read “Second Sight” and then my second book, “Guide to Intuitive Healing,” which are five steps to developing intuition that could get you started.

SN: I was also wondering, if you were to design a modern-day research lab like the one that you were part of – the one that helped you feel more connected to yourself and added this scientific validity to things that were affecting you on a day-to-day basis – I was wondering what, you know, the design of that lab might look like? Maybe elements, crucial elements that you would involve in it, or just kind of what ideas come to mind when thinking about incorporating that into the modern day?

JO: Yeah. Well, I think the Institute of Noetic Sciences up in Northern California epitomizes that lab, because they do all kinds of studying of – not – it's called non-local consciousness. That's the term that's the scientific term for it – non-local consciousness. And so, you know, they do – Dr. Dean Radin, who's this incredible researcher, devoted for many, many years, you know, has done many studies on – double-blind studies on – intuition and what's accurate and what isn't accurate.

And so you would need to have a research – a team of research scientists who know – understand double-blind protocols to do this kind of research. And so you need to have qualified people who could organize the study and get grants, you know, in order to prove – well, they don't need to prove to themselves, but to prove to others in the scientific community how to – you know, what the use of intuition and how it can be documented in the double-blind study and put in journals that traditional scientists would respect. So that's very important to get the team together.

And there's always some version of a sensory deprivation chamber where you can do the work so you're not intruded upon by excess noise or light or people walking in, and to have a very quiet environment. And then also, I would say, to have groups – Thelma did this too – we had intuition groups where we invited the community to come once a week to talk about how to develop intuition and to have that. And, you know, maybe now, you know, online – because we didn't have any internet – online to be able to have groups or to create communities and to help people learn and grow.

And a special program for healthcare practitioners, as I have a Becoming an Intuitive Healer program that I would love to put into this lab, and, you know, help people in the science – in the scientific community – and those who are treating patients, those in patient care, how to incorporate this into their work, and also how to take care of themselves so they don't get drained and exhausted from their work. Very important. So there's a few that I thought about. Those are a few points. Good question.

SN: You've talked a lot about kind of the practice of incorporating what you teach into actual patient care. And so I'm curious maybe, what are a couple of the things – the pieces of advice that you give to maybe your residents or healthcare practitioners?

JO: Okay, well, there's two possibilities. The practitioner could use his or her intuition to help enhance their abilities to understand patients, and/or the patients can learn from the practitioners how to do that and how to trust themselves. And so, first thing always: Trust your gut feeling.

Now, what's the difference between the mind and a thought, and a gut feeling? Now the mind is linear. The mind will give you A plus B equals C, gives you columns of positives and negatives. But that's not what the intuition does. Intuition gives you flashes of truth or how – guidance on how to move forward. So to learn the difference between that, to be able to take breaks between patients rather than back to back. And I know that's hard, because I supervise two women who are psychiatric residents now, and they're so busy. UCLA keeps them so busy, so it's hard sometimes to get that – even that breath. But it's important to at least take a breath between patients so you can be centered and not frazzled.

And then also, too – I'm a big believer in meditation. That's my primary spiritual practice. And, you know, where you're able to calm down and breathe and center yourself and come from your heart and connect to yourself every day and say nice things to yourself during meditation – not horrible things like beating yourself up. So learning how to treat yourself in a very positive, respectful way, learning how to tune into your body, your intuition, your gut feeling when you're with patients and to weigh the intuitive information and learn how to use it.

Like, sometimes– like, one thing that I teach is: When do you share an intuition with a patient? That kind of thing. And I tune into whether it would be helpful or not to share it and how to share it. So everybody has to learn not to do that. You – what I might say if I got guidance to go forward with saying anything is to say, “You know, I think it might be helpful to go to your internist, to get a workup for stress.” You know, I wouldn't scare people. So there's a finesse and a technique in how you talk to people with intuition that are common mistakes people make.

So, you know, I would help the patient or the whoever you're talking to – or, you know – to get through it and to say what's good to say, what isn't to say. If they make a mistake, that's fine. Learn from the mistake. So, as you can see, it's a beautiful asset, but you have to have someone in charge who has some experience, you know. So, you know, I'm very happy, you know, over the years, to have been able to train other healthcare practitioners with these basic skills so they could go out and do that for other people.

SN: Thank you so, so much for your time, Dr. Orloff.

JO: Thank you.

In Supernatural's 15-year run, Sam and Dean have met demons, angels, monsters, hunters, and more. Some would become friends or unlikely allies, while others would become their enemies. Every new character needed to be introduced, and a number of them were more memorable than others.

While Sam and Dean Winchester have pretty awesome first introductions in the pilot episode, plenty of other characters create lasting impressions with notable debuts. Every so often, Supernatural would introduce a new character in a way that was not only memorable but also revealed who they were in a single scene.

In season seven's ""The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons Tattoo,"" Sam and Dean get an alert from Frank—an eccentric, paranoid hunter, who was looking into Dick Roman. The message warned them that someone was hacking into his files. Enter Charlie Bradbury, a spunky hacker with a special ""spark"" and a love of sci-fi and fantasy.

A terrifying member of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse could be the perfect villain for a Supernatural revival. 

 Audiences first meet Felicia Day's Charlie as she rides up on her yellow scooter, puts her headphones on, and goes to work. She cheerfully swipes her badge and steps onto the elevator. Realizing she is alone, Charlie dances like no one's watching. She plays it cool as the doors open to her floor, where she goes to her desk to transfer money from conservative politicians to animal charities. Then she shows pictures of her latest hookup to her co-worker, saying, ""If you can't score at a reproductive rights function, then you simply cannot score.""

When Sam gets whammied with a love spell by an obsessed fan, Becky Rosen, he no longer wants to hunt with Dean, but with his new bride. Bobby sends another hunter named Garth to help Dean with his investigation. The first time audiences set eyes on the newest Supernatural character, he's happily slurping on a milkshake.

Dean sits down and asks Garth if Bobby filled him in on the case. Garth, being a straight shooter, says, ""He told me two things. One, he's tangling with a major-league nest up in Oregon territory. Numero dos, he said you'd be all, uh, surly and premenstrual working with me. But, hey, man, sticks and stones."" When Dean shows Garth the newspaper article about their case, Garth immediately flips to the funny pages, laughing and saying, ""Oh, Marmaduke, you crazy.""

A big, bad demon that wants Sam's head on a pike was teased a few episodes before viewers met her. In ""Jus In Bello,"" Sam, Dean, and a few others fight off a horde of demons working for Lilith. They manage to exercise them, but one gets away and reports what happened.

In its 15-season run, Supernatural introduced some very bizarre concepts and storylines some of which didn't work for the fans.

After Sam and Dean leave, a young girl enters the police station. She sweetly asks about Sam and Dean. The secretary, Nancy, asks for her name, to which she responds, ""Lilith."" Before anyone can react, her eyes turn gray, she holds up her hand, and a bright light fills the room, killing everyone inside. Using a child as her ""meat suit"" was a hint at her twisted brand of cruelty that audiences would see later in ""No Rest for the Wicked.""

 Arthur Ketch was an enforcer and torturer for the British Men of Letters. Ketch was teased before he was officially introduced. First, as the person to call when interrogations weren't yielding answers, more extreme measures were needed. In ""American Nightmare,"" Ketch's face isn't seen, but he is around, following Sam and Dean's investigation. When they let the psychic girl go, he kills her casually and without hesitation.

In Supernatural's season four premiere, Castiel's true nature is foreshadowed in a brief exchange between Bobby and Dean.

Before the heist, viewers see Castiel spying on Crowley as he wraps up a crossroads deal. A rich banker wanted to make a deal, but since he was a ""big fish,"" Crowley showed up to seal the deal personally. The banker was put off by the idea of kissing a man, and Crowley had no patience for it, saying, ""You can cling to six decades of deep-seated homophobia, or give it up and get a complete bailout for your bank's ridiculous incompetence."" The scene shows off Crowley's charisma, intelligence, and love of making people feel uncomfortable in less than ninety seconds.

Cain, the father of murder and the first knight of hell, bore the Mark of Cain. Dean and Crowley seek him out when searching for the First Blade, the only weapon that could kill Abaddon. From the moment Crowley spots Cain tending to his bees, he is on edge. Crowley's fear and discomfort tell Dean just how dangerous Cain is.

Panic and fear have gripped residents of Musukwani area in Jakara, Kano Municipal Local Government Area, following the mysterious disappearance of two young boys believed to have gone missing inside a large, deep ditch in the neighborhood.

The alarming incident has raised fresh concerns, with locals linking the location to possible supernatural forces due to repeated strange occurrences in the area.

Eyewitnesses say the latest case happened on Monday, April 21, 2025, when one of the boys reportedly removed his clothes and wallet — which contained money — and handed them over to some people nearby before entering the ditch.

“We were sitting here when the boy came, took off his clothes, including his wallet with money, and asked us to keep them for him. He said he was going into the ditch to check something, as they usually store things like rods inside. He never came back. Even after nightfall, we closed our shops and went home. The next morning, there was still no sign of him. His belongings are still with us,” Abdul Basit Yusha'u Safiyanu told DAILY POST.

This is not an isolated incident. Just a few days earlier, another boy named Dan Sani also entered the same ditch with a friend and was never seen again. His disappearance remains unresolved.

Musa Hamza, a community leader and maternal uncle of (Dan Sani) one of the missing boys, expressed deep concern and frustration.

“He's my nephew, about 12 years old. He and his friend came to the ditch. He told his friend to wait while he went in. When the friend noticed he wasn't coming back, he ran home to tell us. We searched everywhere — even the mortuary — but nothing. All we have now are rumors and fear. Even the fire service officers who entered the ditch struggled to get back out,” he lamented.

Efforts to rescue the boys were made by the Kano State Fire Service. According to the commission's spokesperson, Saminu Yusuf Abdullahi, the service received a distress call at exactly 3:55 p.m. on April 21.

“In response to a call from one Hamisu Wakili, our team rushed to the site in Jakara, but unfortunately, we could not find the missing individuals, and had to call off the operation,” he confirmed in a phone interview with DAILY POST.

Residents, however, believe the ditch may have more than meets the eye. Some, like Sadam Saraki, linked the area to paranormal activity, claiming it has long been known as a hub for spiritual and mysterious happenings.

Now, the people of Jakara are calling on the Kano State Government and emergency agencies to urgently investigate and take action before more lives are lost.

“People are scared. We can't sleep with both eyes closed anymore,” one resident said.

The fate of the missing boys remains unknown, as the community anxiously awaits answers.

                I write articles on the Swiss Abroad and “Quirky Switzerland” as well as daily/weekly briefings. I also translate, edit and sub-edit articles for the English department and do voiceover work for videos.
Born in London, I have a degree in German/Linguistics and was a journalist at The Independent before moving to Bern in 2005. I speak all three official Swiss languages and enjoy travelling the country and practising them, above all in pubs, restaurants and gelaterias.            

Every year, at 6pm on a Monday in April (this year it's April 28), a cotton-wool snowman is set on fire on Zurich's Sechseläutenplatz. But not just any snowman. This is the Böögg (pronounced “berk”), the headline-grabbing highlight of the Sechseläuten, a traditional spring holiday in Zurich.

Sechseläuten, which means the “six o'clock ringing of the bells”, has various roots. On the one hand it's based on fire customs linked to the spring equinox, during which boys burnt self-made straw effigies with scary masks – “Bööggen”, linked etymologically to the bogeyman – around the city. On the other, members of guilds used to regulate working hours by ringing bells; in winter, craftsmen and traders would work until 5pm and in summer until 6pm.

In 1892 both traditions merged, and since 1902 burning a snowman, representing winter, has been a fixed part of the Sechseläuten custom.

The parade featuring various guildsExternal link kicks off at 3pm. Around 3,500 guild members in costumes, 50 horse-drawn floats and 30 bands make their way through the city to Sechseläutenplatz. The procession – and the burning of the Böögg – attracts tens of thousands of spectators, including many politicians and other big names from the world of business, sport and culture. Hundreds of thousands of people also follow the drama from the safety of their television sets.

At 6pm, on the sixth stroke of the bells of the Grossmünster cathedral, the pyre beneath the Böögg, perched on a ten-metre throne, is lit. Horse-riders circle the burning snowman until the explosive finale. Groundhog Punxsutawney Phil (see box) might have inspired a Hollywood comedy, but the Böögg is hard to beat for drama.

Groundhog Day

Groundhog Day is arguably the most well-known weather-prediction tradition, observed regionally in the United States and Canada on February 2. It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow, it will retreat to its den and winter will go on for six more weeks; if it doesn't see its shadow, spring will arrive early. The ceremony held at Punxsutawney in western Pennsylvania, starring a semi-mythical groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil, has become the most frequently attended ceremony.

Bear shadows

Similar to Groundhog Day, people in Serbia, Romania and Hungary watch for bears emerging from hibernation on February 2 (or February 15 in Serbia). They reckon that if a bear sees its shadow, it will go back into its den and sleep for another 40 days, prolonging winter.

Woolly bear caterpillars

Every year thousands of people flock to a town in North Carolina to watch the US's biggest woolly bear caterpillar race. The winner gets the honour of predicting the weather for the upcoming winter. Here's a guideExternal link on how to “read a worm” (it involves the colour and pattern of the stripes).

Frogs in jars

A belief existed in the German-speaking world (including in Switzerland) that frogs could predict the weather. This grew from observing European tree frogs climb up vegetation in sunny weather, and led to frogs being kept inside jars equipped with a small ladder. The term Wetterfrosch (weather frog) has survived as a somewhat name epithet for meteorologists, implying their predictions can't be trusted.

Ants

Afar women in Ethiopia observe the behaviour of ants, specifically the Dakura “jump about” ant, to predict the coming rainy season. Women fetching water gather around the wells and scratch a ditch in front of an army of Dakura ants. If the ants go inside the ditch or cross the ditch, then it is considered that the next rainy season will be dry. However, if the ants avoid the ditches and rush to go roundabout without directly crossing or getting inside the ditches, this is an indicator of a good rainy season. As this paper explainsExternal link, the Afar community says the ants avoid the ditches because they have instinctively sensed rains or floods and are trying to avoid being washed away.

Not that things have always gone smoothly. In 1923 it rained so hard that the sodden Böögg didn't burn. 

In 1941 Switzerland's wartime farming policy meant the field was needed to grow crops, so the Böögg got a reprieve. He wasn't so lucky the following year, although because the field was still being used to grow potatoes, the crowds had to keep their distance. In 1943 the field was still needed for food, so the Böögg was moved onto the dam in the port in Enge, where the following year he fell into Lake Zurich. He was fished out and his head was thrown into the fire. What a way to go.

Who would have thought a snowman could be political: in 2006 the Böögg was abducted by leftist “revolutionaries” a few days before the Sechseläuten. In a midnight raid they smashed a window of the garage where he was stored and left a chocolate Easter bunny and a hammer and sickle emblem in his place, saying the snowman “had had enough of putting its head on the line for capitalists”. Since then, several back-up Bööggs have been held in reserve, with the main one stored at a bank near Sechseläutenplatz.

In 2020 and 2021 the Sechseläuten parade was cancelled owing to Covid, returning as normal on April 25, 2022. While the Böögg had a year off in 2020, in 2021 the burning was held in a gorge, without an audience, in canton Uri. The event was broadcast live on television.

Then last year saw the “Böögg debacle” when strong winds forced the organisers, worried about stray sparks and embers, to abort just before ignition. “It could have resulted in a mass panic,” Felix Boller, president of the Zurich Guild Committee, said at the timeExternal link.

However, the Böögg didn't get a year off: he was burnt two months later in Heiden, in the host canton of Appenzell Outer Rhodes. The exiled Böögg proved to be particularly resilient: while the pyre burnt relatively quickly despite the wet conditions, it took a while for the shoulders and head of the snowman to catch fire: his head exploded after 31:28 minutes, predicting a mediocre summer. And he wasn't that wrong.

While the Böögg's ability to predict the weather is erratic, he does score the odd hit.

“It's noteworthy that, ahead of the hot summer of 2003, the Böögg had exploded after only five minutes and 42 seconds,” said the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss)External link. “However, this was obviously pure coincidence. The Sechseläuten forecasts do not stand up to climatological scrutiny.”

The shortest time on record is 5:07 minutes in 1974 and the longest is exactly 57 minutes in 2023.

“Before the second-hottest summer of 2022, the Böögg only exploded after almost 40 minutes. Before the third- and fourth-hottest summers of 2018 and 2015, the burn time was between 20 and 21 minutes. In these three years, the Böögg was a poor forecaster. Even in 2019, with the fifth-hottest summer on record, it didn't provide an accurate forecast, burning for just under 18 minutes.”

According to MeteoSwiss, it's “not surprising” that the Böögg scores so poorly as a forecaster. “How is a burning snowman made of cotton wool supposed to have good predictive qualities?” it said.

“In reality, the burn time depends on the construction of the pyre, the humidity of the firewood and the weather on the day of the Sechseläuten. Last but not least, there is the all-important factor of how much fire accelerant is used,” it explained.

“Nevertheless, although the Böögg's summer forecast cannot be scientifically supported, Zurich would certainly not be without its oracle.”

A woman who lost a ring handed down to her by her grandmother is so desperate to find it that she consulted a psychic in the hope of locating it. The ring was lost while on a walk with her nephew and she is hoping someone will come forward having found the sentimental item

Lucinda Roberts, 40, from Flushing was out walking in her home village with her nephew three weeks ago when the ring was lost. The ring had belonged to her grandmother, and was given to Lucinda by her mother when undergoing a liver transplant.

The ring, which has a cameo design on it, was slightly loose on her finger, however she did not notice it had slipped off until returning home. Ever since, Lucinda has searched high and low, retraced her steps multiple times, and spoken to local residents in the hope that someone might have found it and handed it in.

Lucinda said: ""My grandmother passed away ten years ago in 2015 and she left some jewellery to my mother. Years ago she had been burgled and had her engagement and wedding ring stolen and the ring which was my grandmothers, and given to me by my mother, was one of the few pieces which were not taken.

""I was given the ring as a gesture from my mother while I was having struggles with my health. I had to undergo a liver transplant due to having an autoimmune disease.

""Around three weeks ago, while walking through Flushing and caring for my young nephew who was visiting, I lost the ring. It was slightly loose on my finger, and I did not notice it had slipped off until I returned home.

""The ring has very little monetary value but holds immense sentimental meaning to me. It is one of the few personal things I have from my grandmother, and losing it has left me heartbroken.""

Despite every effort to find the ring, it has not yet turned up. Lucinda has called on neighbours and others in the village to see if they have any idea where it could be. She has even contacted holiday parks to see if anyone there may know where it could be. However she felt there may be one more person who may be able to help- a psychic.

Lucinda said: ""I have used psychics before as I find them very insightful. I was able to live after having a liver transplant from a donor who sadly died and the psychic I used was especially supportive when I was wracked with survivors' guilt.

""So in a final effort to find closure, and desperate to locate the irreplaceable ring, I contacted a psychic I use in Newquay. She told me something I had feared. She believes the ring had been found by two people - holidaymakers - visiting the village and they decided to keep it rather than report it.

""I am clinging to the hope that kindness and community spirit might still bring my grandmother's ring home.

""To whoever may have found the ring, please know if it is returned, there shall be no questions asked. I would love to be reunited with the ring which has such a sentimental value.

""In a world where I was given a second chance of life, I would like to be able to have a second chance of having the ring back in my life.""

The NFL draft slide Shedeur Sanders began in the first round grew into an avalanche in the second and third rounds on Friday, and while teams seemingly ran away from the Colorado quarterback, the explanation as to why started to get murky.

Look, I don't believe the NFL is blackballing Shedeur Sanders. 

Or punishing his father, Deion Sanders. 

Or conspiring to put the next generation of one of the league's most decorated names out of business.

Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images

But it would take a damn fool to dismiss the possibility that something is in play either with the teams or the player that extends beyond sheer athletic talent and is causing a problem.

Up until the start of the third round on Friday, I was fully on board with the idea that Shedeur Sanders hadn't been selected in either the first or second round because the league's personnel people simply didn't think he was good enough. 

I based it on all those sacks Sanders took the last two years, and those pro day hiccups, and his good-not-great arm. I was fully invested in the idea that the evaluation process was simply doing its thing.

I didn't blink when Cam Ward went first overall to the Titans because he's the real deal. I agreed with the Giants picking Jaxson Dart because his ceiling is much higher than Sanders'.

Look, I even understood the Tyler Shough selection by the New Orleans Saints because you put his athletic abilities and arm and speed and size next to Sanders, it's clear the Saints picked the more gifted prospect.

But then the third round came and all sorts of weird started happening.

Jalen Milroe got drafted at No. 92 overall by the Seattle Seahawks. And this is where I stipulate that Milroe ran a 4.37 at his pro day and Sanders didn't run at his because it would have been somewhere in the 4.8 range.

But Milroe is less accurate and slower at reading defenses than Sanders.

And Milroe, the latest Alabama quarterback surrounded by a depth chart full of future NFL players, did less with more talent at Alabama than Sanders did at Colorado and Jackson State.

Then things got really wacky. The Cleveland Browns, at one point connected to Sanders with their No. 2 overall pick, selected for the fifth time in this draft.

Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel throws out a pass during the Oregon football's Pro Day Tuesday, March 18, 2025, at the Moshofsky Center in Eugene, Ore.

And after not taking Sanders in the first round, and not taking him with either of their picks in the second round, and not selecting him with their initial pick of the third round, they turned in the card for Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel with the No. 94th overall selection.

The Browns, ladies and gentlemen, lost the plot right there.

Gabriel is not a better prospect than Sanders. He's 5-foot-11 and 205ish pounds, so he's not bigger. He doesn't have an appreciably stronger arm.

He's simply not the superior athlete. Or better prospect. An ESPN draft analyst selected a comparable player in his profile of Gabriel before this draft.

Kellen Moore.

And, yes, Gabriel was productive at Oregon and Oklahoma and UCF.

But is he a better quarterback prospect than Sanders because he processes quicker and reads defenses better and can throw from different arm angles? No.

And that's where I become convinced it's no longer strictly about athleticism and talent and the tape with Sanders. It has to be something else.

And I'm not alone.

""This thing is surprising,"" Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton said Friday night. ""… I think we all are surprised … The talent, holy cow.""

Payton, a former quarterback coach and offensive coordinator, knows the quarterback position. And he's certain Sanders can play. And furthermore, Payton is certain when Sanders does play, he's going to make some NFL people look bad.

""Like, there'll be this chip on his shoulder,"" Payton said. ""And beware because this guy is going to play in this league. I think it's hard for any of us to explain what other people are looking for. We're focused on what we're looking for and, yeah, I think it's surprising.""

Cleveland Browns general manager Andrew Berry responds to questions during Watson's introductory press conference at the Cleveland Browns Training Facility on March 25, 2022.

So let's ask one of the people who was looking at quarterbacks and picked Dillon Gabriel, why every NFL team seems to be running away from Sanders.

""You know what, I think it's unfair for me to comment, I guess, maybe on behalf of the industry,"" Browns general manager Andrew Berry said. ""All I can say is this: You know, the time that we spent with Shedeur, and what he's done throughout his college career is impressive. He's an impressive young man. He's a really good quarterback.

""Sometimes, fit comes into play, and I'd also say this, there are four more rounds of the draft. Lastly, it's less about where you get picked, and what you do after you get picked. That's really the most important thing.

""Getting to know him over the course of the spring, he has a ton of resolve and I think he's going to find himself in a really good spot.""

That doesn't answer the question. It merely suggests the Browns think Sanders will be productive, but are comfortable with that production happening elsewhere.

So there has to be something about Sanders that so far is putting NFL people off. There's something beyond quarterback play because, again, Gabriel and Milroe are not necessarily better players.

So, is it the whole entitlement thing that some anonymous scouts have mentioned? We have to consider that because Sanders can come off as kind of arrogant.

""You think I'm worried about what critics say or what people got to say?"" Sanders told reporters at the scouting combine. ""You know who my dad is? They hated on him, too. So it's almost normal. Without people hating, it's not normal for us. So we like the adversity. We like everything that comes with the name. That's why we are who we are.""

Some teams, frankly, could see this and believe Sanders to be confident and strong-willed.

But others could see him as lacking introspection or the willingness to self-examine. People like that always think it's a you-problem instead of a them-problem. And that is a terrible trait for a quarterback or leader.

Perhaps that, more than physical traits and the tape, is why teams are so far not picking Sanders.

Learn the types, symptoms and treatments","https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/what-are-ovarian-cysts-all-about-cyst-formation-symptoms-and-treatments","Sat, 26 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that form on or inside the ovaries for a variety of reasons. Often, they disappear on their own, but sometimes, they can grow very large, burst or cause an ovary to twist.

Ovarian cysts are very common in people who menstruate, with an estimated 10% to 30% of women — and potentially more — developing at least one in their lifetime.

These fluid-filled sacs develop in or on the ovaries, the small organs located on each side of the uterus that produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone and release eggs each month as part of the menstrual cycle.

Most ovarian cysts form as a result of the normal menstrual cycle and don't cause any issues. However, not all ovarian cysts are the same. While some are harmless and painless, others are extremely painful and can even be cancerous. The type of cyst and its associated complications determine a person's symptoms and their course of treatment.

Learn more about ovarian cysts, why they form, and when they need treatment.

""An ovarian cyst is a fluid filled sac that forms on, or within the ovary,"" Adam Taylor, a professor of anatomy at Lancaster University in the U.K., told Live Science in an email. ""They are often large, and in many cases a similar size to the ovary itself."" An ovary is about 1.2 by 0.8 by 0.4 inches (3 by 2 by 1 centimeters), Taylor said, while most ovarian cysts are often between 0.4 and 1.2 inches (1 to 3 cm) across.

Ovarian cysts can be divided into two broad types: functional and pathological. Functional ovarian cysts, also called ""simple cysts,"" are most common, as they can form as a normal part of the menstrual cycle. They're called ""functional"" because they usually result from the expected function of the ovaries and are not cancerous or otherwise associated with disease. They may still cause noticeable symptoms, however, especially if they are large. 

There are two kinds of functional cysts, named follicular cysts and corpus luteum cysts, based on which tissue they form within.

Compared with functional cysts, other forms of ovarian cysts are less common. These are not related to the menstrual cycle and are known as pathological cysts, or complex cysts. They typically develop due to abnormal cell growth that can be triggered by a variety of factors, including hormonal disorders, pelvic infections or conditions like endometriosis.

(In some cases, hormonal disorders can also contribute to the formation of functional ovarian cysts, as they can affect ovulation.)

Pathological cysts are mostly benign, or noncancerous. They include dermoid cysts, cystadenomas, endometriomas, and small cysts associated with the hormonal condition polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

However, a small percentage of pathological cysts — less than 1% — are malignant, or cancerous. These ovarian cancer cysts are masses of cancer cells and more common after menopause.

Functional ovarian cysts are common and considered a normal part of the menstrual cycle, and because of that, ""approximately 1 in every 10 women will have an ovarian cyst at some point in their life,"" Taylor said. ""Having had one sees you more likely to have another.""

Functional cysts can form from either follicles or the corpus luteum. To understand how and when these cysts form, let's first review the phases of the menstrual cycle:

Each ovary contains egg follicles — tiny sacs that contain immature eggs (oocytes). At the beginning of each menstrual cycle, several of these follicles start to mature and grow. One of the mature follicles eventually bursts open and releases an egg, during ovulation. After releasing the egg, the empty follicle becomes a temporary, hormone-secreting structure called the corpus luteum.

If the egg isn't fertilized, menstruation begins. The corpus luteum then breaks down and stops producing hormones, and estrogen and progesterone levels fall, causing the lining of the uterus to shed.

Follicular cysts occur when a mature follicle doesn't burst to release an egg and instead grows into a fluid-filled cyst. Meanwhile, corpus luteum cysts form when the corpus luteum doesn't shrink as it should at the end of the menstrual cycle but instead reseals and builds up with fluid.

These functional ovarian cysts tend to go away in a few weeks and usually cause no symptoms. These typically grow to around 1.2 inches (3 cm), although corpus luteum cysts may, on occasion, grow up to 4 inches (10.2 cm) wide.

""As these cysts form as part of the menstrual cycle they are most commonly seen in women who are between puberty and the menopause,"" Taylor said. ""These functional cysts are typically benign and will resolve on their own.""

Pathological cysts tend to be larger than functional cysts. They include ovarian dermoid cysts, also known as teratomas, which are benign tumors that often form before birth and can contain tissue, such as hair, skin, teeth or fat. Dermoid cysts form when germ cells — stem cells which are supposed to become eggs — go rogue and start developing into other tissue types instead. 

They also include cystadenomas, which are cysts that develop from ovarian tissue and fill with a watery or mucous fluid. Cystadenomas can sometimes grow to about 3.9 inches (10 cm) across, on average, but some have been found to be as large as 11.8 inches (30 cm) in diameter.

Conditions like endometriosis, which occurs when tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, can result in the formation of cysts named endometriomas. These form when uterine-lining-like tissue grows on the ovaries. These are often named ""chocolate cysts,"" due to the fact that they contain thick, old blood, and they can cause painful periods, pelvic pain, pain during sex, and fertility issues. Around 10% of people who menstruate have endometriosis, and an estimated 17% to 44% of people with endometriosis may develop an endometrioma.

Another condition, named polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is caused by high levels of androgens (male sex hormones) and can result in the formation of several tiny cysts that measure only a few millimeters across. These form around the edge of the ovary as a result of underdeveloped follicles not maturing enough to release an egg. About 6% to 13% of reproductive-age women are estimated to have PCOS. 

Importantly, though, not all people with PCOS have cysts on their ovaries, and the presence of cysts does not necessarily mean you have the condition.



Ovarian cysts often don't cause any symptoms at all; many people have them without knowing. When symptoms do show up, they can vary in severity, depending on the type and size of the cyst, as well as whether the cyst has ruptured or is twisting an ovary.

""Each woman will present different symptoms,"" Taylor said. The most common symptom is pelvic pain, often caused by the ovary's blood supply being impacted or by the stretching of the peritoneum, which is a protective layer that sits above the uterus and ovaries. 

Other symptoms may include bloating or a feeling of fullness, pain during sex, heavier or lighter periods, unusual vaginal bleeding, and the need to urinate more frequently. Sudden, severe pelvic pain; fever; or vomiting may mean a cyst has ruptured or twisted, which requires urgent medical attention.

Doctors use several techniques to figure out if an ovarian cyst is present, usually starting with a pelvic exam to check for swelling or tenderness in the ovary area. A pelvic exam is a physical examination of the reproductive organs of the pelvis.

Health care providers may then perform an ultrasound, which uses sound waves, to detect the size and shape of the cyst. This helps them to determine if the cyst is functional or pathological, and whether the cyst is fluid-filled, solid or ""mixed."" Doctors may also do a blood test to check for markers of ovarian cancer, as well as to measure hormone levels.

Sometimes ovarian cysts may rupture, meaning they tear open and spill their contents into the pelvic cavity. This can happen if a cyst is particularly large or as a result of physical activity, such as sex or exercise, that somehow pops the cyst.

""There are many physical things that can cause an increase in pelvic or abdominal pressure, which can also cause cysts to rupture — exercise, lifting, sex or physical trauma,"" Taylor said. Underlying conditions that affect the ovaries, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, can increase the risk of cyst rupture, he added.

A rupture may not result in any symptoms and may resolve on its own, or if it does cause discomfort, it can be managed with over-the-counter pain medications. However, a cyst rupture can also be very painful and cause various symptoms, including bloating, vaginal bleeding, nausea or vomiting. If a ruptured cyst is bleeding significantly, this can cause dizziness or fainting and would require prompt medical intervention.

""Where a ruptured cyst is in proximity to a blood vessel, it may cause significant bleeding, which can be life-threatening and may necessitate surgery,"" Taylor said. ""Where pelvic pain is at a level that is prolonged or uncomfortable it should be checked out to ensure that there is nothing life-threatening happening in or around the ovary.""

If an ovarian cyst is particularly large or heavy, it can result in ovarian torsion, in which the ovary rotates around its own ligaments, thus cutting off its blood supply. This can result in extreme pain, nausea and vomiting, and surgery is required to prevent the ovary from dying and prevent further complications, such as abdominal infections.

Treatment for ovarian cysts depends on many factors, including the type of cyst, its size, and any symptoms it may be causing.

Small functional cysts often disappear on their own and don't require any medical treatment. That said, they can be regularly monitored to make sure they aren't growing.

Any minor pain associated with cysts can be treated with painkillers, like ibuprofen. However, if these symptoms don't go away or if the cyst is growing, much larger than usual, causing severe pain, or suspected to be cancerous, it may be surgically removed.

""The type and extent of surgery depends on what structures are being impacted as sometimes these cysts can affect the urinary and gastrointestinal systems,"" Taylor said.

Laparoscopy, also known as keyhole surgery, is generally performed if the cyst is small and benign, while laparotomy, or open surgery, may be required to remove larger cysts. The latter procedure may also be used if the cyst is suspected to be cancerous.

In rare cases, if the cyst is found to be cancerous, one or both ovaries also be removed.

David Zweig's new book ""An Abundance of Caution"" (MIT Press) is an account of the decision-making process behind the extended closures of public schools during the pandemic. In fascinating and meticulously reported detail, Zweig shows how some of the most trusted members of society—from Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists to eminent health officials—repeatedly made fundamental errors in their assessment and presentation of evidence.

By fall 2020, many students in Europe were already back in classrooms—and so were their peers in private schools in America and in public schools across mostly “red” states and districts. Yet millions of other children across the U.S. remained under extended school closures.

Whatever inequities that existed among American children before the pandemic, the selective school closures exacerbated them, disproportionately affecting the underprivileged. Deep mental, physical, and academic harms—among them, depression, anxiety, abuse, obesity, plummeting test scores, and rising drop-out rates—were endured for no discernible benefit.

The story of American schools during the pandemic serves as a prism through which to approach fundamental questions about why and how individuals, bureaucracies, governments, and societies act as they do in times of crisis and uncertainty. Ultimately, this book is not about COVID; it's about being ill-equipped to make decisions under duress.

David Zweig is a writer, lecturer, and journalist. His writing has appeared in The Atlantic, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Free Press, and his newsletter, Silent Lunch. He is the author of Invisibles, about the power of embracing anonymous work in a culture obsessed with praise and recognition. His new book is An Abundance of Caution: American Schools, the Virus, and a Story of Bad Decisions.

An American man identified as the son of a deputy director of the CIA was killed in eastern Ukraine last year while fighting under contract for the Russian military, an investigation by independent Russian media said. 

Michael Alexander Gloss, 21, died on April 4 last year in “Eastern Europe,” an obituary published by his family said. He was the son of Juliane Gallina, who was appointed the deputy director for digital innovation at the CIA in February last year. 

The story of how the son of a top-ranking US spy died fighting for Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is an unlikely tale of how homegrown anger at the US and online radicalization led from a middle-class Virginia childhood to the killing fields of eastern Ukraine.

On a VKontakte page attributed to Gloss, a high-school football player born to parents who both served in the military, he described himself as “a supporter of the multipolar world. I ran away from home. Traveled the world. I hate fascism. I love my homeland.” 

He also posted the flags of Russia and Palestine.

Gloss is one of more than 1,500 foreigners who have signed contracts with the Russian military since February 2022, investigative Web site iStories said. 

The database for the enrollment office was later leaked, exposing him as having signed the contract in September 2023. 

Sources told iStories that Gloss had been deployed with “assault units,” those engaged in harsh frontline fighting, in December 2023. 

An acquaintance said that he had been deployed to a Russian airborne regiment sent to storm Ukrainian positions near the city of Soledar.

“With his noble heart and warrior spirit, Michael was forging his own hero's journey when he was tragically killed in Eastern Europe on April 4, 2024,” his family wrote in the obituary, which did not mention Russia and Ukraine or discuss the circumstances of his death.

In university, Gloss was active in gender equality and environmental protest circles. He joined Rainbow Family, a left-wing environmental protest group, and in 2023 traveled to Hatay, Turkey, to assist in the recovery following the earthquake that killed more than 56,000 people. 

He had also become increasingly angry at the US for its support of Israel and the war in Gaza.

While in Turkey, Gloss began expressing a desire to go on to Russia. “He was usually watching videos about Palestine and was so angry at America,” one acquaintance told iStories. 

“He started thinking about going to Russia. He wanted to [wage] war with the USA, but I think he was very influenced by the conspiracy theory videos,” they added. 

After receiving a visa to Russia, he traveled around the country before arriving in Moscow, where he joined the military shortly before his documents expired. 

Photographs and videos obtained by iStories showed he was sent to a Russian training camp, where he mostly trained alongside Nepali contract soldiers. 

Three months after enlisting, he was deployed to Ukraine as a member of an assault battalion, an acquaintance said. 

A number of acquaintances told the outlet that he had not been interested in fighting, but hoped the army would allow him to receive a Russian passport and stay in the country.

The circumstances of Gloss' death are not known. A friend said that his family had been informed by the Russian government of his death, but were given little other information. 

“It was announced that he died within the borders of Ukraine,” the friend wrote. “We do not know whether he participated in the war. They did not provide any other detailed information.”

It was not clear whether the Russians performed a background check on Gloss or knew the identity of his mother.

In a post on X, directed at Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Bukele listed off a number of family members of high-level opposition figures in Venezuela, journalists and activists detained during the South American government's electoral crackdown last year.
“The only reason they are imprisoned is for having opposed you and your electoral fraud,” he wrote to Maduro. “However, I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that
