                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian authorities say they have detained a man described as a “Ukrainian special services agent” in connection with a car explosion that killed Russian General Yaroslav Moskalik on Friday. The suspect allegedly purchased the car that exploded in Balashikha, less than 20 miles east of Moscow, according to TASS citing Russia's Federal Security Service. The FSB also accused him of planting an explosive device in the car, but said that it was detonated from Ukraine. Video published by TASS on Saturday appeared to show charred electronics and parts of the car. Russia's Investigative Committee had previously said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device packed with shrapnel. The influential Russian military blog Rybar said Moskalik was not in the Volkswagen car when it exploded but was close to it after walking out of a nearby building. TASS video also showed the man being put into a van, and included footage of him apparently in custody describing his alleged recruitment by Ukraine's special services. It's unclear if he was under duress during the confession. No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion. Moskalik was killed on the same day US special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin to discuss efforts to end Russia's war on Ukraine. After the three-hour meeting, US President Donald Trump initially voiced optimism that both sides were “very close to a deal.” But the next day, Trump questioned whether Putin wants a peace deal shortly after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican for Pope Francis' funeral. In a Truth Social post sent as he returned from Rome after the meeting, Trump raised the prospect of apply﻿ing new sanctions on Russia after its assault on Kyiv last week. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking' or ‘Secondary Sanctions?' This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump is finding out that getting through to Russian President Vladimir Putin is not as easy as he might have thought. Since returning to the White House, Trump has held at least two lengthy phone calls with Putin and has repeatedly sent his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet the Russian leader in person in Moscow, with the latest trip on Friday. Not only did Witkoff come back empty-handed, he also repeated several key Kremlin talking points. The latest US proposal includes recognizing Russian control of Crimea – a long-standing red line for Ukraine and its European allies, officials familiar with the details have told CNN. “I would say the negotiations are going very well — from Putin's point of view,” Angela Stent, a foreign policy expert and former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, told CNN. “Putin is playing a waiting game because he believes that time is on his side and that he can force Ukraine into a more disadvantageous position and persuade Kyiv and its European allies with the help of Washington that there is no alternative to a peace settlement on Russian terms,” John Lough, the head of foreign policy at New Eurasian Strategies Centre, a think tank based in London and Washington, told CNN. Stalling, haggling over every detail, or saying no without explicitly saying “no” is a classic Russian tactic, employed by Putin and his top negotiators on several occasions in the past, such as during the negotiations for a ceasefire in Syria. Trump's words since coming back into office indicate that he sees the world in a similar way to Putin, Stent said – as consisting of a handful of great powers to whom smaller countries should submit. Remember, he hasn't criticized Trump for any of these things,” she said. Ultimately, Trump has made it clear that he has little interest in the future of Ukraine – even suggesting Ukraine “might be Russia someday.” So, if Putin continues to drag the process along, it may give Trump a way out. Lough said that Putin's KGB training has shaped the way he approaches negotiations. “Putin famously described his job in the KGB as ‘work with people.' He was trained in the art of manipulating interlocutors. He is known to prepare meticulously for negotiations and is a master of detail,” Lough told CNN, adding that the Russian leader is known to be “quick on his feet and can charm and intimidate in the same breath.” Putin has employed this technique on Trump in the past, according to Kalina Zhekova, an associate professor at University College London (UCL) who specializes in Russian foreign policy. Related article Trump's ‘lone ranger': How Steve Witkoff became the de facto point man on America's foreign policy challenges “This was indicative of Putin's calculated ‘tit-for-tat' approach that views diplomacy as a game with winners and losers. He was also likely aware that his counterpart is someone with a fragile ego who is easily impressed by theatrical gestures and gifts,” Zhekova said, adding that the summit was widely seen as a win for Putin, because Trump was reluctant to denounce Moscow's interference in the 2016 US presidential election, contradicting US intelligence reports and effectively siding with the Kremlin. He often creates chaotic situations to get more options and can change his mind when it suits him, which makes it even more difficult to negotiate with him. Witkoff, a real estate magnate with zero previous experience in politics or diplomacy, has been trying to strike a deal with a former KGB lieutenant colonel who has outlasted five US presidents, eight UK prime ministers, three Chinese leaders and six NATO chiefs, having personally negotiated with many of them. Both are experienced politicians but have no proven track record when it comes to Russia. All three speak fluent English and are experienced diplomats who know how to deal with Americans. Moscow might be dragging its feet in hopes that Trump will lose his patience and abandon his goal of ending the war. Signs of that are already emerging: Rubio said last week that the US could walk away within “days” if there are no signs of progress. And CNN reported this week that Trump is getting frustrated with the lack of progress and privately told advisers that mediating a deal has been more difficult than he anticipated. Related article For Vladimir Putin, Russia's position in the world is personal. She added that, for Trump, getting the US out of Ukraine and stabilizing relations with Russia are more important than achieving peace. Trump, of course, is not the first US president to believe he can build a good relationship with Russia. “Every US administration in my memory has come in with some idea that they're going to reset – they all use that word – the relationship with Russia, that they have an opportunity to turn the page and start again. Greene, who is also a professor of Russian politics at King's College London, said that this succession of failures has meant that Moscow “has come to see the United States as fundamentally inconsistent.” Some former presidents tried to build personal relationships with Putin – George W. Bush invited the Russian leader to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, where he drove him around in a Ford pickup truck. Bush famously wrote later that he “looked the man in the eye” and “was able to get a sense of his soul.” And that's not what the Bush administration was prepared to do,” Stent said. America's relationship with Russia did somewhat ease under the Obama administration – but mostly because Putin wasn't officially in the top seat for some of that time. He stepped down in 2008 to become prime minister because of term limits. He returned as president in 2012 and has since changed the constitution. And so we tended to exaggerate the possibilities for cooperation, and then were deeply disappointed when we didn't get it,” he told CNN. Graham, who served as a special assistant to Bush, said that the only way forward is to understand that Russia and the US will always have a complex, competitive relationship. “It's important to remember that there are different ways of rivalry. We could have the type of very profound adversarial relationship that we have at this point, with, I would say, an unacceptably high risk of military confrontation between Russia and the United States … or we could have something that I like to call competitive coexistence, where the competition is largely in an economic, commercial, cultural, ideological, diplomatic realm, and not so much in the military realm,” he said. The point, Graham and others say, is that Russia will not disappear.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran and the United States began in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, talks that likely will hinge on the Islamic Republic's enrichment of uranium. Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will return Saturday to the secluded sultanate of Oman, where experts on both sides will start hammering out the technical details of any possible deal. Iran and the United States held in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, ending the discussions with a promise for more talks and perhaps another high-level meeting next weekend.

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Iran and the United States held in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, ending the discussions with a promise for more talks and perhaps another high-level meeting next weekend. “This time, the negotiations were much more serious than in the past, and we gradually entered into deeper and more detailed discussions,” he said. “We have moved somewhat away from broader, general discussions — though it is not the case that all disagreements have been resolved. A senior U.S. administration official said that the talks were “positive and productive.” “This latest round of direct and indirect discussions lasted over four hours,” the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has mediated the two previous round of talks in Muscat and Rome, offered a positive note at the end of Saturday's negotiations. Iran and the U.S. “identified a shared aspiration to reach agreement based on mutual respect and enduring commitments,” al-Busaidi posted on X. “Core principles, objectives and technical concerns were all addressed. Talks will continue next week with a further high level meeting provisionally scheduled for May 3.” Meanwhile on Saturday, a major explosion rocked a port in southern Iran just after the talks began, killing four people and injuring more than 500 others. Authorities offered no immediate cause for the blast, which appeared to have been caused by a highly combustible material — though officials ruled out its oil and gas industry. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. Trump, traveling to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, again said that he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't. “The Iran situation is coming out very well,” Trump said on Air Force One. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. He added: “There are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal — a much nastier deal — and I don't want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.” Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. The demand that all enrichment stop also has been repeated by Rubio. However, Iranians remain hopeful that the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows during which it took more than 1 million rials to buy $1. “It's OK to negotiate, to make the nuclear program smaller or bigger, and reach a deal,” Tehran resident Farzin Keivan said. After all, we've suffered a lot for this program.”</p>

LONDON (AP) — A lettercard penned by one of the Titanic's most well-known survivors from onboard the ship, days before it sank, has sold for 300,000 pounds ($399,000) at auction. In the note, written to the seller's great-uncle on April 10, 1912, first-class passenger Archibald Gracie wrote of the ill-fated steamship: “It is a fine ship but I shall await my journeys end before I pass judgment on her.” The letter was sold to a private collector from the United States on Saturday, according to auction house Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, England. The letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an “exceptional museum grade piece.” Gracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. He went on to write “The Truth about the Titanic,” an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City. Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman slammed NFL teams for not drafting University of Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who was not selected until the fifth round of the 2025 NFL draft, claiming race played a factor in their decision. Bowman, who lost his House seat last year after a primary challenge, ranted about his draft slide in a post on X Friday morning. They don't care that he's a leader, intelligent, tough and completed 77% of his passes with no o line and no running game,” Bowman said. They don't care that he's a leader, intelligent, tough and completed 77% of his passes with no o line and no running game. Bowman also referred to former Ole Miss quarterback Eli Manning, also from a famous football family, refusing to play for the then-San Diego Chargers in 2004, eventually forcing a trade to the New York Giants, in claiming a double standard. “He's entitled but Eli Manning wasn't entitled when he refused to be drafted by San Diego? He's not athletic, but that didn't stop Joe Montana, Drew Brees or Tom Brady. America continues to fear strong black men who come from means and have a strong sense of themselves without submitting to the ‘dominant' culture,” he added. Sanders has been criticized as a prospect for lacking elite arm strength and athleticism, taking too many sacks due to poor pocket presence and holding onto the ball too long, an average win-loss record at Colorado, and a lack of maturity. While he has been touted as one of the more accurate passers in the draft, his completion percentage was inflated by the large number of short screen passes his team's offense ran. Questions about his maturity were put in the national spotlight when he publicly blamed his offensive line after a loss to Nebraska in 2024, and they were amplified shortly before the draft when scouts leaked how terrible his team interviews during the NFL combine allegedly went. One NFL assistant coach said his interview with Sanders was “the worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life. In addition to questions about the player, there are also concerns about his father creating unnecessary distractions. The outspoken hall of famer made a number of controversial comments prior to the draft, leading some to speculate whether that would lead to problems with team chemistry or negative headlines. ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith blasted Sanders not being picked in the first three rounds as a “damn disgrace” and claimed it was similar to former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick not being signed after protesting the national anthem — although Kaepernick's playing ability had noticeably declined prior to the protests. Y'all still think this doesn't have anything to do with teams hatin on @DeionSanders. In a different way, this is Kaepernick all over again…..being kept out. Y'all still think this doesn't have anything to do with teams hatin on @DeionSanders. In a different way, this is Kaepernick all over again… being kept out. I don't care what anyone says!” Smith said. Bowman and Smith have an unlikely ally in their frustration with Sanders not being drafted, as President Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to call the NFL owners “STUPID” for not drafting Sanders, who he claimed “is all set for Greatness.” “What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID? He's also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be ‘picked' IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!” Trump said. Sanders was drafted 144th overall to the Browns, who also selected Oregon QB Dillon Gabriel in the third round. After the Browns passed up on him in the first round, his father mocked the organization whose QB room consisted of former Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco and former first round pick Kenny Pickett. “Flacco my age!” the retired player-turned-coach said with a smile. Sanders will now be Flacco's teammate and will battle for a spot on the 53-man roster or practice squad in the preseason as the team is unlikely to keep four quarterbacks.</p>

Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is urging Americans to dispose of their prescription medications properly. He addressed the issue in a video posted on X, marking National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, which is April 26. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has set up free, anonymous drop-off sites across the country where Americans can leave their unused prescription medications. U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. speaks during a press conference announcing of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) intent to phase out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes in the nation's food supply, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., April 22, 2025. While some may think that flushing prescriptions down the toilet is a safe alternative to throwing them away and can prevent people from accidentally ingesting it, Kennedy warns that there are dangers to that too. "We don't fully know the effects of low levels of birth control hormones or antibiotics or chemotherapy agents and so on, in the water, but it's not good," Kennedy said in the video. An image of HHS Secretary nominee RFK Jr. juxtaposed next to a bottle of pills made by drug manufacturers. According to the FDA's "Flush List," there are several opioid medications that are safe to flush, including Vicodin, OxyContin and Percocet. However, the FDA warns that drugs that do not appear on its Flush List should not be flushed down the toilet. The DEA sees National Prescription Drug Take Back Day as more than a way for Americans to clear out unwanted or unused medication. On its website advertising the take back day, the DEA frames it as a way to prevent "medication misuse and opioid addiction from ever starting." During its most recent take back day in October 2024, the DEA collected 629,953 pounds, or 314 tons, of medication across 4,644 collection sites. The FDA provides instructions on how to safely dispose of medications, as well as needles and syringes safely.

Amber Kelleher-Andrews, best known for her work as a celebrity matchmaker, has died. The relationship expert's matchmaking company, Kelleher International, shared a heartfelt tribute after her death. "We are heartbroken to share the news of the passing of Amber Kelleher-Andrews — beloved Co-Founder, Co-CEO, matchmaking visionary, and devoted wife and mother. We extend our deepest condolences to her beautiful family, her many friends, the clients whose lives she touched so profoundly, and her mother, Jill Kelleher, the founder of Kelleher International," the statement read. Amber Kelleher-Andrews, famed celebrity matchmaker, has died at 56. In 2013, Kelleher-Andrews worked with "Desperate Housewives" star Eva Longoria on the reality television series, "Ready for Love." Kelleher-Andrews was featured and offered her dating advice on the short-lived show. "Amber's passion and vision helped shape Kelleher International into the globally recognized leader it is today. Pictured: (l-r) Tracy McMillan, Matt Hussey, Amber Kelleher-Andrews, Giuliana Rancic, Bill Rancic, Ben Patton, Tim Lopez, Ernesto Arguello on "Ready for Love." Kelleher-Andrews was also featured on Comedy Central's "The Show Biz Show with David Spade" as she helped him look for romance during a humorous segment. The Hollywood matchmaker's work was additionally featured on "Good Morning America," "Nightline," "Extra," "Entertainment Tonight" and more. The Hollywood matchmaker's work was additionally featured on "Good Morning America," "Nightline," "Extra," "Entertainment Tonight" and more. In 2023, Kelleher-Andrews previously spoke with Fox News Digital to share her insight on a relationship trend at the time – why short women like dating tall men and vice versa. Kelleher-Andrews, who's from Montecito, California, told Fox News Digital that while women tend to be paired with tall men, confident men don't seem to care as much. In 2023, Kelleher-Andrews previously spoke with Fox News Digital to share her insight on a relationship trend at the time. "My most confident male clientele don't have a height preference at all," said Kelleher-Andrews. "They are completely comfortable with the female partner being any height, including much taller." She added, "I have noticed that these extremely confident men are so secure in who they are and what they bring to the table that they don't find those extra inches as a must-have or a prerequisite for love." However, the majority of her male clients have voiced a height preference, and eight times out of 10 they've requested to be partnered with a woman who's shorter than them, said Kelleher-Andrews. With more than 30 years of experience in the match-making field, Kelleher-Andrews said she believed men generally "feel more masculine, confident or protective when they are significantly taller than their female partner."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: A version of this story appeared in CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Legends of young heroes fighting lions to the death appear in Roman records and artwork, but scant physical evidence of these beastly battles exists. His remains were buried between 1,825 and 1,725 years ago in what archaeologists believe to be a “gladiator graveyard” — hundreds of miles from Rome — in York, England. Watch chimpanzees sharing fermented fruit, which contains intoxicating traces of alcohol. What's nearly as long as a bus, has teeth the size of bananas and has a scientific name that translates to “terror crocodile”? The roughly 26-foot-long creature of nightmares is believed to have lived between 82 million and 75 million years ago, dining on dinosaurs in the rivers and estuaries of North America. While prior research on the giant reptile's evolutionary background has put it in the same group as alligators and their ancient relatives, a new analysis of fossils and DNA suggests it belongs on a different branch of the crocodilian family tree. That assessment boils down to one key trait: Deinosuchus had special glands and a tolerance for salt water, according to the study. Further animating our understanding of the creatures that populated prehistoric Earth are trace fossils — or ancient animal tracks frozen in time. Researching these fascinating rocks is like “trying to study ghosts,” said Conner Bennett, lead author of a study that described the story behind several trace fossils in the collection of Oregon's John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. For example, one set of tracks estimated to be about 50 million years old tells the story of a small wading bird pausing near a lakeshore in central Oregon to search for food. Tucked away in one of the world's largest collections of fossilized insects, the oldest recorded ant species nearly remained overlooked. Anderson Lepeco, a researcher at the University of São Paulo's Museum of Zoology in Brazil, spotted the “extraordinary” specimen as he was perusing some of the museum's fossils. That's when he came across the hell ant, preserved in limestone. The critter was believed to have lived among dinosaurs some 113 million years ago — several millennia before previously found ants, according to new research. “I was just shocked to see that weird projection in front of this (insect's) head,” Lepeco said. “Other hell ants have been described with odd mandibles, but always as amber specimens.” At wildlife conservancies in Africa, four-legged friends are invigorating efforts to combat poaching. Professional dog trainers Darren Priddle and Jacqui Law of Carmarthen, Wales, spearhead the initiative, called Dogs4Wildlife. After they saw a picture of a poached African rhino on social media in 2015, they set out to use their expertise training animals to help combat illegal hunting. The duo has since sent 15 stalwart canines to five sub-Saharan African countries, including Shinga, a Belgian Malinois, and Murwi, a Dutch shepherd, who protect big game at Zimbabwe's Imire Rhino and Wildlife Conservancy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This photo provided by Emily's Entourage in April 2025 shows Emily Kramer-Golinkoff, who has cystic fibrosis caused by a rare genetic mutation, during a trip to Maine. Emily Kramer-Golinkoff can't get enough oxygen with each breath. Advanced cystic fibrosis makes even simple things like walking or showering arduous and exhausting. But her case is caused by a rare genetic mutation, so medications that work for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis won't help her. The same dynamic plays out in other genetic conditions. Stunning advances in genetic science have revealed the subtle, insidious culprits behind these brutal diseases and have started paving the way for treatments. But patients with these exceedingly rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than those with more typical forms of these diseases — and many are now pinning hopes on experimental gene therapies. “We feel such pure joy for our friends who have been lifted from this sinking ship,” said Kramer-Golinkoff, 40. “But we just feel so eager and desperate to join them. It's really hard to be in this minority of people left behind.” Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations. What it amounts to, he says, is “mutational discrimination.” Charities – including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily's Entourage – are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation. While it likely won't be available for years, “just to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,” Kramer-Golinkoff said. Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body. It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master's degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients' overall quality of life. Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect. Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain. For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations – affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don't benefit from modulator therapies. While there's little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop “mutation agnostic” gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. “There's a huge push to develop these therapies,” said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins. At this point, she's living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily. “We're incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies.</p>

Criminal defense attorney Brian Claypool discusses how Democratic leadership in California has impacted the rise of violent crime in San Francisco. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., offered a dire warning to fellow Democrats recalling an exchange he had with a Target cashier in San Francisco, insisting his party has a "major problem." During a panel discussion on Friday's "Real Time with Bill Maher," Schiff was asked to weigh in on the current state of the Democratic Party and how it governs, particularly in a state like California. "So we're gonna to have to change how we do business in California," Schiff told Bill Maher. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., admits his party has a "major problem" while recalling an exchange he had with a Target cashier in San Francisco. Schiff then recalled an experience he had two years ago in San Francisco when his luggage was stolen out of his car, admitting it was the one time he did not heed warnings from others about not leaving valuables in vehicles while in the city. "And what was most memorable about the experience for me as I went to this Target in South San Francisco, 10 o'clock at night, and I'm getting the toiletries I'm gonna need for my next two days in the city," Schiff said. "And then I get to the cashier. The cashier asked me if I want one of those Target bags with a little bullseye on it. And I said, ‘Yes, that Target bag is gonna be my luggage for the next two days," Schiff continued. "And she asked me what happened, and I told her, and she basically said in not so many words, 'Yeah, Democrats are a---h---s.' And I thought, you know, if the cashier in South San Francisco at 10 o'clock at night believes that Democrats are a---h---s because the shampoo was locked up and my stuff got stolen out of the trunk, we've got a major problem that we have to address." I hope all the Democrats listen to that story." Schiff expressed hope in San Francisco's new Democratic mayor Daniel Lurie, who he says is "helping lead the way in how we kind of reinvent how Democrats are doing governance." "Real Time" host Bill Maher said he hopes all Democrats hear Schiff's "awesome" San Francisco story. Joseph A. Wulfsohn is a media reporter for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom (D-CA) backed a bill Friday that would print the number for a suicide hotline and LGBT crisis center on the back of all public middle and high school student ID cards. The move is in direct opposition to President Donald Trump‘s administration plan to cut funding for a nonprofit network that provides LGBT-specific youth counseling at the suicide hotline. “Suicide is the second leading cause of death among LGBT youth. Cutting off kids' access to help is indefensible,” Newsom told Politico. “While the Trump administration walks away from its responsibility, California will continue to expand access to life-saving resources, because the life of every child — straight, gay, trans — is worth fighting for.” It was the first to sue Trump over tariffs and is also challenging the Department of Government Efficiency‘s cuts to AmeriCorps. They provide around-the-clock support, including a toll-free hotline, online chats, and text message support that connects people in crisis with trained counselors. During the bill's first hearing in April, Republican assembly member Josh Hoover pushed back on why it was necessary to add a LGBT-specific hotline number when there is already a general hotline number on student IDs. “My concern has nothing to do with the ability to call a hotline, obviously, that is something that I support,” Hoover told Politico. “But if you go right now to the Trevor Project website, there are a number of resources provided that are very political in nature.</p>

When quarterback prospect Shedeur Sanders fell out of the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft, there were some who couldn't believe he hadn't been picked by an organization, although it wasn't considered a total shock. But with Friday night seeing three more quarterbacks not named Sanders come off the draft board, the reaction was pure shock. There have been 102 prospects taken off the board, and with Round 4 beginning at noon in Green Bay, everyone is wondering which NFL team will finally pull the trigger on Sanders. Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders watches a drill at the NFL football scouting combine in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 1, 2025. Surprise and shock might not even be the words to describe this fall down the draft board, arguably being the biggest we've seen in recent memory for someone whom many considered to be, at the very least, a Day 2 selection. "It's gotta be about more than football," he said during the NFL Draft broadcast on the network. "He's the best pure passer you can draft. When you start to see developmental projects like Jalen Milroe and Dillon Gabriel – and nothing against those guys, but they're not nearly the player that Shedeur Sanders is. When they go before him, the only thing you can say is that it's more than football." Tyler Shough (New Orleans Saints), Milroe (Seattle Seahawks), and Gabriel (Cleveland Browns) were all selected on Friday night in respective order. Mel Kiper Jr., the longtime NFL Draft analyst with ESPN, has been adamant about Sanders' talent, ranking him the highest-graded prospect on his big board. He was vocal about Sanders making it out of the first round on Thursday night, but he was appalled to see what happened the next day. "I think it's disgusting," he said during a lengthy rant after Day 2 came and went. "I don't understand what the heck's going on with this. Joel Klatt, who called several Buffaloes games this past college season for Fox Sports, has seen what Sanders can do for a football program in person. Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) throws a pass against Central Florida during the first half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Sept. 28, 2024, in Orlando, Fla.  (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack, File) It's narratives that are built up, lazy, and quite frankly, trash. When you come out as an anonymous source about some meeting that you had, and you don't think that some kid measured up to what you wanted him to be when he walked in your room, I think that's trash. "Shedeur Sanders is going to be a good quarterback in the National Football League, and I think he's going to go make some head coach and some fan base very happy, because he's already done that in his career in what I think is a very difficult spotlight for his dad at the University of Colorado and a program that was nothing before he got there for two decades." "His play on the field would suggest he should already have been selected," Klatt explained. "There were some quarterbacks, their play on the field probably doesn't warrant a selection over his play on the field. "The reason he's undrafted at this point is because of the person that sat with those teams and did not, for whatever reason, jell with them." It's not just the analysts opining about Sanders' draft situation – even President Donald Trump jumped into the mix to say how crazy it was. "What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?

ESPN host Stephen A. Smith called it "a damn disgrace." Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton, who already has a young quarterback after taking Bo Nix in the first round last years, admitted his surprise and even the Buffaloes football account on X posted 10 minutes worth of Sanders highlights, just to remind everyone of how good he can be on the gridiron.

Melania Trump is celebrating her birthday on April 26 as she's been resuming her White House duties for the second time. To commemorate the first lady's 55th year, Fox News Digital takes a look back at her path from growing up in Slovenia to stepping into her role in the White House. Trump was born on April 26, 1970, in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, at Splošna bolnišnica Novo mesto General Hospital, to parents Viktor and Amalija Knavs, according to public records. The first lady was christened at the Church of St. Lawrence in Novo Mesto, where she was given her name, Melania. Melania Trump was baptized at The Church of St. Lawrence in Novo Mesto, Slovenia.

Melania Trump attended the Church of St. Nicholas with her family in Sevnica. Fox News Digital also spoke with the first lady's fifth-grade teacher, Milena Krajnc. Krajnc shared that Trump was a good student and was always willing to help classmates who were falling behind. Milena Krajnc, pictured here in Sevnica, Slovenia, on March 20, 2025, was first lady Melania Trump's fifth-grade teacher at Sava Kladnika Elementary School. The mayor shared that it would have been an "undoubtedly happy time for those who were young" growing up in the 1970s and '80s, "as economic progress was evident." America's first lady, Melania Trump, was raised in the town of Sevnica, Slovenia. "We must consider that Slovenia and Sevnica are part of Central Europe, characterized by a quality of life that is inclusive and hardworking," he went on. "Slovenia, as the westernmost republic of Yugoslavia, was significantly more aligned with Western culture and standards compared to the southern republics," he added. A local bakery in Sevnica, Okusne Dobrote, created apple pies named in honor of Melania Trump to mark her birthday. At age 16, the first lady began a successful modeling career, marked by many high-profile advertising campaigns and various philanthropic works, according to the White House website. She moved to New York in 1996 and became a citizen of the United States 10 years later, records show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This story contains quotes of abusive language toward Katherine Legge that were released to CNN by her team. British racing driver Katherine Legge told CNN Sports that she has been inundated with thousands of hateful messages, death threats, vulgar and inappropriate comments across multiple social media platforms since she entered NASCAR in March. One direct message on X said that she should hang herself, the same account adding in a separate, public, post, “You need to be assassinated.” Another advised her to “swallow a shotgun.” Initially, she wanted to ignore her trolls and deny them the oxygen of publicity, but after a difficult weekend on the track at Rockingham she decided to speak out. Speaking exclusively to CNN about the abuse, Legge says that while she welcomes fan engagement online, the amount of vitriol is only getting worse. “Online bullying is getting more toxic, and I think that somebody needs to call it out,” she said. At the conclusion of her college career, the basketball star Angel Reese said tearfully, “I've been through so much, I've seen so much. Death threats, I've been sexualized, I've been threatened.” WNBA star Breanna Stewart said that police were investigating homophobic death threats that had been sent to her wife and the French tennis player Caroline Garcia reported comments on X that told her to consider suicide and, “I hope your mom dies soon.” Legge has observed the abuse that athletes endure in other sports, and even some of the invective that is aimed at male drivers in NASCAR. However, she is currently the only female driver on the circuit, and she suspects that as a result, her treatment is worse. “I think it's more prevalent with women in sports, especially with women in male dominated sports, because we stick out more, you know? CNN has seen many of the X posts in which Legge has been targeted for abuse online, ranging from “Please get the f**k out of NASCAR” and “I hope you wreck every car you drive in” to sickening vulgarities that are too offensive to print. Her team say that many more toxic messages have been posted on YouTube and Facebook. I can honestly say it doesn't phase me one way or the other, because they are people who I would not ask an opinion of. I would ever go online and try and bring somebody else down to raise myself up and so I feel sorry for them, I guess, is the best way of putting it.” Legge says she doesn't think that any of the death threats would seriously be carried out, but NASCAR is providing a security detail for her upcoming races and the sport's head of security has alerted law enforcement in her hometown of the situation. Speaking to CNN, NASCAR Commissioner Steve Phelps described the posts as incredibly upsetting. Phelps also defended Legge against any of her critics who thinks she is somehow undeserving of her place on the track. “This is a woman who has competed very successfully in all forms of motorsports and we want her here at NASCAR. They can take their opinions and their hate right out of NASCAR, because there's just no place for it,” he said. Legge's two races so far this season have resulted in DNFs (did not finish,) one of which she takes personal responsibility for. She's been contracted for 11 more races in the Xfinity and Cup series, driving for the Chevrolet-backed teams Jordan Anderson and Live Fast. All I can do is keep improving and, if they have the capacity, they will change their opinions, and it will die down a little bit. Beyond hoping that being a more successful competitor will dampen the online abuse, Legge said the only way to truly extinguish it in society is to make it socially unacceptable. It's something that you're taught as a child isn't cool,” she said. “I didn't set out to be a role model,” she added. Events beyond her control have now forced her to further embrace that responsibility, and she hopes her example will inspire others to speak up or, at the very least, learn how to cope with being bullied. “I tried to be the best role model that I could be for like, a nine-year-old Katherine, act as a beacon of light and maybe somebody being bullied somewhere, even if it's just one person, if they see this and they think, ‘OK, I'm gonna ignore it,' then it's been worth it,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: “My Happy Place,” a CNN Original Series following celebrities on deeply personal journeys, airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT. CNN also tapped anchors and correspondents to share their happy places. CNN's Boris Sanchez finds happiness scuba diving in Key Largo, Florida. People wandering down to spend a little time in the Florida Keys often end up staying much, much longer. Johnson met a guy in Miami on a Thursday who said he could come sleep on his couch in Marathon. This is no blank-slate stretch of asphalt — the route, leapfrogging from one key to the next over 42 bridges, has seen tragedy and more than its share of colorful characters. Driving straight from Miami to Key West can take about four hours if things go smoothly. “I think people are learning more about the joy of the other Keys,” said Will Keizer, a captain at Captain Hook's Marina and Dive Center, which has three locations in the Keys. “If you want bar-to-bar-to-bar busy, Key West is your jam — no doubt about it,” said Keizer, who's originally from Michigan and has lived in the Florida Keys for about eight years. But “if you want to slow down, take in the sights,” he says, it's time to explore beyond Key West. For wreck divers, the 510-foot Navy dock landing ship USS Spiegel Grove now serves as an artificial reef six miles offshore. Local dive shops run trips to the wreck, where sea turtles mingle with coral, sponges and cascades of colorful fish. Also on Key Largo at Mile Marker 103, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park — the first undersea park in the US — offers snorkeling and scuba trips and glass-bottom boat tours. Drive on and you'll soon find yourself in Islamorada, a community stretching across five inhabited islands. Among the more than 400 dead were hundreds of World War I veterans who were working on a section of the Overseas Highway. And people could then, from 1938 on, drive straight through from the mainland all the way to Key West.” The extension to Key West — inspired by plans for the Panama Canal and its trade possibilities — was dubbed “Flagler's folly” by skeptics, but the first train reached Key West on January 22, 1912. Continuing south along US 1 in Islamorada, you can't miss Robbie's on Lower Matecumbe Key  —  a one-stop compound  for kitschy souvenirs, sport-fishing charters, cold drinks, hot meals and a tarpon feeding frenzy. (For a quieter feeding atmosphere, Bud N' Mary's, a couple miles before you hit Robbie's, doesn't charge admission to its dock.) Some daredevils will let tarpon, which can grow up to 8 feet long, gulp their hands to the wrist for a great video moment, but Robbie's visitors on a relatively quiet day in March were dangling fish through holes in a net, seemingly reluctant to participate in any unnerving limb gulping. Also in the menagerie was a manatee named Samantha and an aggressive flock of pelicans poised to snatch fish not promptly gobbled up by the tarpon. And policing the dock with a padded stick to maintain order was Ron Hauter, a Robbie's employee whose right hand showed signs of tangling with the critters. At the time, Hauter, who had just moved down from Crystal River, Florida, was two weeks into his dream of living in the Keys. Florida native Carl Hiaasen, a novelist and former Miami Herald reporter and columnist, had the same dream growing up in Broward County and lived it for about nine years before he sold his house on Lower Matecumbe Key. But the island chain has served as the backdrop for some of his satirical crime novels, including “Bad Monkey,” which recently became an Apple TV+ series starring Vince Vaughn. “I've set several novels in the Keys because I still find it an intriguing place, not just for the natural beauty, but for the people — the characters — it's attracting … You have an outlaw component, who's drawn to the Keys, and you have dreamers, and you have families, and you have retirees and … just retired scoundrels,” Hiaasen said. Traffic snarls are one reason why Hiaasen ultimately returned to eastern Florida. But for each resident who gets fed up with some of the hassles of Keys life, there's someone like Ron Hauter ready to give it a shot. Everything is so aggressive in the Keys — I love it.” Regular traffic can be fierce along Route 1 — and when there's a wreck? Case in point: A Monday afternoon accident on the Seven Mile Bridge — the longest and most impressive modern span in the Florida Keys — snarled traffic for hours in early March. Fortunately, the Turtle Hospital, at Mile Marker 48.5, required less than a mile of backtracking, and a planned overnight in Marathon allowed for leisurely waterfront dining instead of hauling down to Key West, feeling hours behind schedule. The Turtle Hospital rescues, rehabilitates and, in many cases, releases sea turtles brought in because of boat strikes, disease and other hurdles encountered by the five species found in local waters. The 90-minute guided visit involves turtle education, a look at the medical facility and an outdoor tour to see (but not touch) turtles awaiting release as well as others deemed too vulnerable to live in the wild. Marathon, a community of 13 islands, also offers casual waterside dining where marine wildlife adds to the ambiance. Over on the Gulf side of Marathon, Keys Fisheries offers order-at-the-window seafood, a full bar and waterfront seating with sunset views and glimpses of the sharks, tarpon and pelicans that patrol the marina. Down the highway, near Mile Marker 47, the old Seven Mile Bridge — nicknamed “Old Seven” — is a prime place to get out and explore on foot. A 2.2-mile section of the old railway bridge, which was converted for highway traffic in the ‘30s and used until a new bridge was completed in 1982, reopened in 2022 to pedestrians and cyclists. At the end of the repurposed section, you can access Pigeon Key, a tiny island where hundreds of railway construction workers lived from 1908 to 1912. Admission is $15 for adults arriving on their own via Old Seven or $28 for those who opt to ride a tourist train from a parking lot a few miles back. The railway construction workers toiled six days a week, 70 to 80 hours per week for $1.50 per day, according to guide Eric Johnson. There's a small museum dedicated to their work on the island and several original buildings. When the railway was first converted into a highway, the tracks were removed and a 22-foot sheet of steel was laid down and paved. The old train tracks became railings on either side. The narrow highway eventually earned the nickname “Highway of Mirrors,” according to Pigeon Key history, because cars passed so close to one another that their side mirrors were knocked off, littering the road. Snorkeling trips run from the park out to Looe Key, a protected reef about 9 miles southwest of the park. Captain Hook's also runs expeditions to Looe Key. At Looe, an hour spent floating above colorful parrotfish, angelfish and barracuda brings time to a near-standstill. Some 30 miles down the highway, Key West awaits — with its rollicking bars, rooster soundtrack, Jimmy Buffett lore and historic sites tied to Harry S. Truman and Ernest Hemingway. But you should resist the urge to race to Key West straight from the airport in Miami or Fort Lauderdale, says Cori Convertito, a curator and historian at the Key West Art & Historical Society. “Hopefully Key West isn't going anywhere anytime soon — so take your time.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liberal Leader Mark Carney arrives for a tour of Algoma Steel in Sault Ste. TORONTO (AP) — Canadians will vote for a new government on Monday in an election that has been upended by U.S. President Donald Trump ‘s trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state. Prime Minister Mark Carney and the governing Liberal Party appeared poised for a historic election defeat until Trump slapped heavy tariffs on Canada and began threatening its sovereignty. Trump's attacks have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips to their southern neighbor and avoiding buying American goods when they can. The opposition Conservative Party had hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity cratered as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump. There are no primaries or runoffs — just a single round of voting. Like the U.K., Canada uses a “first-past-the-post” voting system, meaning the candidate who finishes first in each constituency will be elected, even if they don't get 50% of the vote. This has generally cemented the dominance of the two largest parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, because it's difficult for smaller parties to win seats unless they have concentrated support in particular areas. Carney replaced Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader, Carney, on March 9. Carney was sworn in as Canada's 24th prime minister on March 14. He hopes to retain the job and avoid becoming one of Canada's shortest-serving prime ministers. Carney, 60, is one of the two main candidates. He successfully navigated financial crises when he headed the Bank of Canada and later ran the Bank of England, becoming the first non-U.K. citizen to do so since its 1694 founding. A highly educated economist, Carney worked for 13 years for Goldman Sachs in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He has financial industry and public service credentials. He and the party seemed headed for a big victory in the election until Trump's near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them. Poilievre, 45, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put “Canada first.” For years his party's go-to attack dog, he frequently criticizes the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada's public broadcaster. There are two other parties that have official status in Parliament.</p>

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will return on Saturday to the secluded sultanate of Oman, where experts on both sides will start hammering out the technical details of a possible deal. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Oman has been a mediator between Tehran and Washington. Last weekend's talks in Rome offered a more-equal flight distance between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who are leading the negotiations. But Rome remains in mourning after the death of Pope Francis, whose funeral will be held on Saturday. Araghchi himself took time out Friday night to sign copies of his latest memoir, “The Power of Negotiation,” at the Muscat International Book Fair. The Muscat talks come as Iran appears to have lined up Chinese and Russian support. On Thursday, Chinese, Iranian and Russian representatives met the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that likely will verify compliance with any accord like it did with Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. However, Iran has greatly restricted the IAEA's inspections — leading to fears internationally that centrifuges and other nuclear material could be diverted for non-peaceful purposes. It added that China respects Iran's “right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.” The Trump administration has kept France, Germany and the U.K. out of its direct negotiations with Iran, something similarly reflected in Witkoff's negotiations with Russia over ending its war on Ukraine. Witkoff traveled Friday to Moscow ahead of Saturday's meeting in Muscat. “They have an opportunity to do away with the grip of Special Interest groups and forge a different path.” The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Rubio, speaking on a podcast released this week, also kept up a Trump line that Iran needed to stop its enrichment of uranium entirely. “If Iran wants a civil nuclear program, they can have one just like many other countries can have one, and that is they import enriched material,” Rubio said. However, former CIA director Bill Burns, who took part in the secret negotiations that led to the 2015 nuclear deal, expressed skepticism Iran would give up its program like Libya did in 2003. “I don't personally think that this Iranian regime is going to agree to ... zero domestic enrichment,” Burns said in a talk Monday at the University of Chicago. But Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. Witkoff also has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. Trump initially announced the Iran talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his side. But Israel, which for years has targeted Iran's nuclear program with attacks on its facilities and scientists, has kept open the possibility of airstrikes to destroy Tehran's enrichment sites. On Monday, Israel's military conducted drills preparing for possible new Iranian missile attacks, the country's public broadcaster KAN reported. Araghchi has described Iranian security services as being “on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.” However, Iranians on Friday in Tehran remained hopeful the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows. After all, we've suffered a lot for this program.” Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,” Giuffre's family said in a statement to NBC News. “She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.” “Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors,” they added. Giuffre met Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell as a teenager in 1999. She groomed Giuffre, who was then underage, to service Epstein and his other associates sexually from that time until 2002. She alleged that Epstein forced her to have sex with him and other high-profile men, including Prince Andrew. The two quickly married and she ended her association with Epstein. She first came forward publicly with her accusations in 2011. She founded the nonprofit group Victims Refuse Silence, relaunched as Speak Out, Act, Reclaim, or SOAR, in 2021. She settled a lawsuit against Andrew in February 2022, which involved an apology for his association with Epstein and the treatment of Giuffre. He also sent a “substantial donation” of unknown value to Giuffre's charity. She said doctors gave her four days to live. I'm ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time, but you know what they say about wishes. Her brother, Danny Wilson, told NBC News that her suicide was likely motivated by a combination of physical pain from the crash and psychological pain from past abuse. “She was in real physical pain — suffered from renal failure. But I think that the mental pain was worse.”</p>
