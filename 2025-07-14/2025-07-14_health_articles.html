                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have identified over 250 proteins that are strongly affected by malaria, which could help predict the severity of the disease and thus enable faster treatment for the most critical patients. The study, published in the journal Immunity, was conducted on 72 adult travellers diagnosed with malaria at Karolinska University Hospital after returning from tropical regions. By analysing blood samples from these individuals, who were followed for a year, the researchers were able to identify around 700 proteins that changed during the infection, of which over 250 were strongly affected. "Malaria can quickly become life-threatening, but it is difficult to predict at an early stage which patients are at risk of deterioration. Our results show how a set of proteins can help identify high-risk patients more quickly and enable more effective treatment," says Anna Färnert, professor at the Department of Medicine, Solna, Karolinska Institutet, and senior physician at Karolinska University Hospital, who led the study together with Christopher Sundling at the same institution. In this study, we have been able to measure such a large number of proteins with high precision in the blood of malaria patients for the first time. Maximilian Julius Lautenbach, first author, postdoctoral researcher, Department of Medicine, Solna, Karolinska Institutet The researchers emphasize that further studies are needed to validate these findings in larger patient groups and to explore the potential clinical applications of the protein signatures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This transcript has been edited for clarity. I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I'd like to discuss what I consider to be an absolutely fascinating paper, and one that I will say has very interesting results but raises many more questions than it answers. The paper is entitled, “Addition of metastasis-directed therapy to systemic therapy for oligometastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (EXTEND): a multicenter, randomized phase 2 trial,” published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. You might ask what metastasis-directed therapy in pancreatic cancer means. Have we really made much of an impact on pancreatic cancer? In fact, in my earlier years of training, if somebody came up with the idea, or suggested as part of a trial or treatment of an individual patient, that they would focus on metastases in pancreas cancer, you might say they're crazy, or you might say: “Yeah, but they probably don't know anything about the disease and its natural history.” They randomized 41 patients with five or fewer metastatic lesions — with oligometastatic disease, they could have numerous lesions — to undergo what they've described as comprehensive metastases-directed therapy. The progression-free survival (PFS) in the metastases-directed therapy group was 10.3 months vs 2.5 months in the group of patients who received chemotherapy only, with a hazard ratio of 0.43 and statistical significance. Remember, this was a very small study, but we see more than a tripling in the PFS. There was no difference in overall survival, which is not at all surprising because it was a very small sample size. Very importantly — and essential to doing this trial ethically — a crossover was permitted at the time of progression, meaning that if a patient received chemotherapy only and progressed, they could potentially get stereotactic radiation to sites of metastatic disease. They might have also benefited from that kind of strategy to the metastasis-[therapy] so that overall survival in the small population may not be different. Again, there was a tripling of the time to disease progression. We would need more centers involved and maybe some modification in the study design in this trial because of any issues that the investigators may have identified. Of course, overall survival would be a fair endpoint to look at, but again, crossover would be essential, and that might influence an ultimate outcome.PFS is a very valid endpoint. The only other point to mention is, with these results — and as I mentioned, advances in radiation and imaging — is it reasonable to potentially consider this type of approach for individual patients as a component of aggressive standard of care? Of course, this would be with very adequate informed consent from patients, because we don't know what the impact will be. With the limited morbidity associated with the radiation, for an individual patient with pancreatic cancer who has an adequate performance status and limited metastases, if we give them chemotherapy and also directed radiation, is it reasonable to consider that as an appropriate treatment option outside the setting of a clinical trial? I think this is a very valid question that needs to be addressed. In my opinion, the answer in some settings should be yes, but that needs to be discussed much more widely than simply in this randomized phase 2 trial.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Did the COVID-19 pandemic affect obesity rates in Canada? A new study in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.241421 found obesity rates based on body mass index (BMI) increased faster in the 4 years after the start of the pandemic than in the previous 11 years, especially in younger adults. "Compared with the average increase during the 11 years before the pandemic, the prevalence of obesity [as measured by BMI] increased at a greater rate during the 4 years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2023), suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health restrictions may have adversely affected obesity prevalence in Canada," writes Dr. Laura Anderson, associate professor, Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact and co-director of the Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis (CHEPA), McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, with coauthors. Obesity is a risk factor for a range of diseases and can negatively affect a person's health and well-being as well as increase the burden on the health care system. The large study, which included data on 746 250 adults aged 18 and older, looked at trends in BMI over 15 years, from January 2009 to March 2020 and from April 2020 to December 2023. Researchers found that BMI-defined obesity rates increased from 25% in 2009 to 33% in 2022, an absolute increase of about 8%. After the pandemic started, obesity increased by just over 1 percentage point a year, about twice the pre-pandemic rate of increase. "We observed important subgroup differences, with several groups that had a lower historical prevalence of obesity showing a substantial increase during the pandemic, including females and young adults. This raises concerns about potential adverse long-term consequences," write the authors. The authors observed a small increase in underweight adults during the study period and note that being underweight can have negative health effects. They caution that efforts to address rising rates of obesity should consider unintended effects of weight control messaging on people with eating disorders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new AI tool reads lung cancer biopsy slides in under an hour, accurately predicting mutations and saving patients delays, costs and tissue loss, marking a turning point in precision cancer care. Study: Real-world deployment of a fine-tuned pathology foundation model for lung cancer biomarker detection. A recent Nature Medicine study compiled a large international clinical dataset of digital lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) slides to facilitate the development of a computational epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) biomarker. LUAD is the most prevalent form of lung cancer, with EGFR being the most common somatic mutation in kinase genes. Accurate EGFR testing is crucial to ensure patients receive the correct first-line therapy. EGFR testing is done for patients with advanced-stage LUAD; otherwise, molecular testing in lung cancer is the standard line of investigation. EGFR testing is significantly below the level determined by clearly published guidelines. There could be many reasons, including technical hurdles in obtaining and processing samples for testing and insufficient material from diagnostic biopsies. Computational methods to detect EGFR mutations can significantly improve the clinical workflow for lung cancer diagnostic biopsies. Only the digitized pathology slides from the diagnostic Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) biopsy would be used as a substrate, enabling the result to be reported with no physical processing and little cost. The immediate production of results should also allow for informing all other downstream decisions. This study developed the EAGLE (EGFR AI Genomic Lung Evaluation) and showcased its clinical usefulness as an H&E-based computational biomarker. Unlike the traditional workflow, AI-assisted screening often precludes rapid testing. This was done while maintaining overall high screening performance. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)- based testing was still required for samples that were screened positive. A large international clinical dataset of digital lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) slides was compiled to train the algorithm in line with the broad biological and technical variability expected from real clinical deployment. A total of 5,174 slides from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were used to fine-tune a state-of-the-art pathology foundation model. Model validation was done using 1,742 internal slides from MSKCC and on external test cohorts to ensure robustness. A silent trial was conducted by deploying EAGLE in real time to simulate its performance in a real-world setting. EAGLE performed at the expected level on novel cases and was deemed suitable for clinical implementation. Using tissue amount as a proxy for tumor amount, the surface area was calculated based on the tiles used for model inference. The model's performance on external cohorts was also in line with the internal validation and showed an AUC of 0.870. A silent trial was run at MSKCC to test real-world applicability. As in the previous case, the model performance was lower in metastatic specimens (AUC 0.760), compared to primary samples (AUC 0.896). The overall AUC was comparable to previous results at 0.853. These results further supported the deployment of EAGLE for primary samples. The artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted workflow could lead to a lower number of samples being rapidly tested, based on the output of EAGLE. Three threshold strategies were explored in the trial to determine how many rapid tests could be spared while maintaining performance comparable to traditional workflows. Depending on the chosen threshold, the AI-assisted workflow reduced rapid tests by 18% to 43% while preserving high NPV and PPV values. The turnaround time for EAGLE was also a key advantage, delivering results in a median of just 44 minutes, significantly faster than the minimum 48 hours needed for rapid testing and several weeks for NGS. The real-world setting silent trial was important as it helped researchers understand how the newly devised protocol performed, including possible sources of false negative and false positive results. By examining attention heatmaps overlaid on tissue slides, the team identified that false positives often involved biologically related mutations like ERBB2 insertions or MET exon 14 skipping events. False negatives tended to occur in samples with minimal tumor architecture, such as cytology specimens or blood-heavy biopsies. EAGLE is meant to identify likely positive cases and efficiently rule out EGFR mutations. Because EAGLE does not distinguish between EGFR subtypes that require different targeted therapies, NGS confirmation is still necessary before treatment selection. This study presented a validated computational pathology model for detecting EGFR mutation in LUAD. The model can reduce tissue consumption, improve diagnostic efficiency, and accelerate AI adoption in clinical practice. EAGLE achieved its performance by fine-tuning a vision transformer-based foundation model, highlighting a shift toward more generalizable AI tools in pathology. Future research should consider additional biomarkers and study them in a prospective clinical trial. Priyom holds a Ph.D. in Plant Biology and Biotechnology from the University of Madras, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent review by researchers at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM) shows Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) and SARS-CoV-2 infections may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This ongoing inflammation can harm brain cells and may help speed up the buildup of harmful proteins linked to Alzheimer's. The olfactory system is lined with a specialized neuroepithelium that can serve as an entry point for pathogens to the brain. After initial infection, these microbes can travel along the olfactory nerves, ultimately reaching the brain's olfactory bulbs, which are linked to areas of the brain for memory and cognition. This pathway is particularly relevant given that loss of smell is an early symptom in both COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease. PCOM researchers documented that individuals carrying this gene variant appear to be more susceptible to both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections, potentially amplifying their risk for developing the disease. “These findings bring us one step closer to understanding the complex interactions between infections and Alzheimer's disease,” said PCOM's Brian J. Balin, PhD, a professor of Neuroscience and Neuropathology and director of the Center for Chronic Disorders of Aging (CCDA), who co-authored the report. “As we continue to learn more about the role infectious agents play in the development of this disease, we hope to create new avenues for prevention and treatment.” Balin and his team have dedicated over two decades working under the hypothesis that infectious agents could be a trigger for the process that causes the accumulation of amyloid and tau build-up, which are key indicators of Alzheimer's disease. Most recently, he helped establish PCOM's Pathobiome Research Center to further examine the connections between infectious processes and other chronic disorders in addition to Alzheimer's disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals in early life, including during gestation and infancy, results in a higher preference for sugary and fatty foods later in life, according to an animal study being presented Sunday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are substances in the environment (air, soil or water supply), food sources, personal care products and manufactured products that interfere with the normal function of the body's endocrine system. To determine if early-life exposure to these chemicals affects eating behaviors and preferences, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin conducted a study of 15 male and 15 female rats exposed to a common mixture of these chemicals during gestation or infancy. Our research indicates that endocrine-disrupting chemicals can physically alter the brain's pathways that control reward preference and eating behavior. These results may partially explain increasing rates of obesity around the world. Understanding the harmful health impact that exposure to these types of chemicals can have on eating patterns may help inform public health recommendations and personal efforts to improve diet-related health complications." Researchers administered behavioral studies throughout the rats' lifespans, including into adulthood, to observe preferences for high-fat foods and a sucrose solution. Findings showed that male rats with early-life exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals had a temporary preference for the sucrose solution, while female rats showed a strong preference for high-fat food that resulted in weight gain. Researchers observed changes to gene expression throughout all areas sequenced in male rat brains, and varying changes to gene expression in the region of female rat brains associated with reward. "It's important that people understand that there are negative impacts associated with consuming or being near endocrine-disrupting chemicals early in life. With this knowledge in hand, consumers may want to consider reducing personal interaction with environments, food and other types of products containing these chemicals during pregnancy and early childhood to reduce the risk of developing obesity later in life," Hilz added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A novel artificial intelligence (AI) application capable of diagnosing endocrine cancers with speed and accuracy is being presented Sunday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. The research, presented by Jansi Rani Sethuraj, B.S.N., R.N., C.C.R.N., from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, introduces a universally accessible and computationally efficient AI application. This AI application aims to democratize expert-level cancer diagnostics, making them available on basic internet-connected devices, including smartphones. Endocrine cancers, affecting organs such as the thyroid, ovary, pancreas, pituitary, and adrenal glands, pose unique challenges due to their complex hormonal effects and difficult diagnostic profiles. With an estimated 10 million cancer-related deaths each year, the need for innovative, scalable diagnostic solutions is imminent. This new AI-powered tool leverages advanced deep learning architectures, such as EfficientNet and ResNet, to analyze diverse medical data, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (USG), and histopathology images, enabling comprehensive and accurate cancer detection. According to Sethuraj, the AI models demonstrated exceptional diagnostic accuracy, reportedly exceeding 99% in certain validation datasets across multiple endocrine cancer types. These results align with recent studies showing AI can achieve high accuracy in endocrine tumor classification, though real-world performance may vary. Two researchers, Ramya Elangovan and Kavin Elangovan of AIM Doctor in Houston, Texas, curated anonymized endocrine cancer image datasets representing diverse populations spanning six continents. The application's reliability and usability were independently evaluated by healthcare professionals from multiple international institutions, highlighting its potential for global applicability. By enabling clinicians and primary care providers to access expert-level diagnostic support anywhere, this technology has the potential to reduce diagnostic errors, accelerate treatment decisions, and improve patient outcomes globally, especially in resource-limited settings. "By democratizing access to advanced diagnostics, this AI innovation marks a paradigm shift in cancer care, offering hope for earlier detection, more precise treatment, and better survival for patients facing endocrine malignancies," said the chief mentor of this project, Elangovan Krishnan, M.B., B.S., P.G.D.H.M., M.Tech., M.S., Ph.D., of AIM Doctor. "This AI-powered application can deliver fast, reliable, and affordable endocrine cancer diagnostics to anyone, anywhere, thereby helping to close gaps in cancer care and advance health equity worldwide."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cancer deaths linked to obesity have tripled in the United States over the past two decades, according to a study being presented Sunday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. The study, which examined more than 33,000 deaths from obesity-associated cancers, revealed sharp increases in cancer deaths, especially among women, older adults, Native Americans and Black Americans. This research underscores the need for targeted public health strategies such as early screening and improved access to care, especially in high-risk rural and underserved areas." Faizan Ahmed, M.D., lead researcher of Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune City, N.J. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 40.3% of adults have obesity. Obesity is a complex disease resulting from multiple genetic, physiological, hormonal, environmental and developmental factors. In addition to certain types of cancer, obesity raises the risk of developing serious chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and chronic and end-stage kidney disease. He found age-adjusted mortality rates increased from 3.73 to 13.52 per million over two decades, with steep increases among women, older adults, Black people, Native Americans and rural populations. State-level analysis revealed that Vermont, Minnesota and Oklahoma had the highest rates, while Utah, Alabama and Virginia had the lowest. In the interview, Lloyd M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tiny plastic fragments are turning up in milk and cheese, raising urgent questions about how our favorite dairy products travel from farm to fridge, and what we're really eating. Study: Assessing microplastic contamination in milk and dairy products. What if your morning latte came sprinkled with tiny plastic flakes that slip past the tongue? Scientists estimate that people ingest tens of thousands of such fragments yearly, according to recent reviews, yet dairy, a staple for millions, remains understudied. Plastics line feed bags, milking tubes, cheese molds, and retail wraps, offering countless entry points for debris smaller than 5 millimeters. While seafood and bottled water dominate MP headlines, dairy products also travel equipment-dense routes before reaching consumers. Identifying when and where fragments accumulate could help redesign processing lines, select safer polymers, and guide smarter packaging policy. Larger, long-term investigations are still needed to pinpoint the riskiest steps and craft effective industry standards. Twenty distinct plastic types infiltrated dairy products, including unexpected polymers like polyacrylate (found in paints/adhesives) and silicone (common in seals and gaskets), revealing contamination from diverse industrial sources. Investigators bought 28 commercial dairy items, such as 4 cartons of ultra-high-temperature (UHT) milk, 10 fresh cheeses aged less than 1 month, and 14 ripened cheeses matured for more than 4 months, from major northern-Italian retailers. Products arrived on ice at the European Center for the Sustainable Impact of Nanotechnology (ECSIN) and were stored at –20°C until analysis. After thawing, 100 mL of milk or 10 g of quartered cheese underwent sequential enzymatic and alkaline digestion to dissolve organic matter. Samples received trypsin solution, potassium hydroxide, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in a temperature-controlled shaker, then were vacuum-filtered through 3 μm silver membranes. Dense particles were separated by triple flotation in saturated sodium chloride (NaCl), refiltered, and oven-dried. Each membrane was scanned with micro Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode (μ-FTIR-ATR); spectra matching at least 80% confirmed polymer identity. All work took place inside an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) class 7 cleanroom equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration. Procedural blanks never exceeded 10 fragments, and spiked-water recoveries averaged 84%, supporting analytical reliability. Particles as small as 24 micrometers – thinner than a human hair – slipped into samples, highlighting the challenge of detecting the tiniest plastic fragments lurking in food. MP appeared in 26 of 28 samples, demonstrating that dairy consumers ingest plastic before food even leaves the refrigerator. Across all items, scientists counted 266 particles spanning 20 polymer types. These values echo earlier reports that high-fat, highly processed dairy products such as butter and milk powder harbor the greatest MP loads. Fragments dominated particle shape, accounting for 77% of observations, whereas fibers comprised 22% and beads less than 1%. Such irregular shards likely arise from friction inside pumps and shredders or abrasion of plastic films. Smaller dimensions matter because tiny plastics can traverse intestinal barriers more readily than visible debris, which raises toxicological concerns but was not specifically addressed in this study. Images and Fourier-transformed infrared micro-spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode analysis (μ-FTIR-ATR) spectra of three identified MP with different shapes and colors: A polypropylene, B poly(ethylene terephthalate), and C polyethylene (black line for MP spectra from dairy products, red line for MP spectra from reference libraries). Color analysis offered origin clues: gray particles (68%) were common in polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride, polymers widely used in gaskets, conveyor belts, and stretch wrap. Transparent fragments, limited to poly(ethylene terephthalate), pointed to bottle-grade plastics, while blue and red flecks suggested food-contact gloves or line markings. Beyond common plastics, unusual suspects like polyvinylidene fluoride (a specialty plastic) and polyoxymethylene (used in gears) popped up occasionally, suggesting potential contamination from very specific equipment parts. Statistical dispersion, expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV), differed by polymer. Silicone showed the widest spread (CV ≈ 127%), hinting at sporadic equipment failures, whereas polyacrylate and polyvinyl chloride were more uniformly present (CV ≈ 35-38%). During curd formation, whey removal reduces mass yet traps solids, including MP. Extended aging intensifies this by evaporating moisture, explaining why ripened cheese contained five times more particles than milk. The pattern matches studies showing that purified powders and shelf-stable spreads are MP-dense; lengthy contact with plastic molds, aging racks, and barrier wraps appears to be a critical pathway. Cheese preparation itself could be a contamination risk point: The study meticulously described "quartering" cheese samples (repeatedly cutting and recombining) to get a representative piece, acknowledging this handling step requires extreme care to avoid adding plastic bits during analysis. Ripened cheeses, celebrated for complex flavor, also concentrate the highest MP loads, many small enough to bypass gastrointestinal defenses. Findings highlight the urgency of auditing every link in the dairy supply chain, replacing abrasion-prone polymers, bolstering clean-room standards, and developing and testing biodegradable alternatives. Until such interventions mature, informed consumers, vigilant regulators, and proactive manufacturers share responsibility for reducing invisible plastics that journey from production line to breakfast table, safeguarding both public health and the integrity of a global food staple.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major review finds that diets high in ultra-processed foods may rewire the developing brain, amplifying risks for ADHD, depression, and even dementia, spotlighting the urgent need to rethink what children and expectant mothers eat. Review: The consequences of ultra-processed foods on brain development during prenatal, adolescent and adult stages. The review also describes habitual overconsumption and reward dysfunction related to UPF-driven changes in brain reward circuitry, though it does not explicitly characterize these as “addiction-like eating behaviours.” This highlights the urgent need for public health strategies targeting maternal and child nutrition. The soft textures of UPFs actually trick the brain: They're designed to be eaten quickly, reducing exposure to oral sensors that signal fullness. This hidden feature directly promotes overeating before your body registers satisfaction. While effects on adults are well-documented, the impact of UPFs on brain development during vulnerable life stages, such as early childhood, adolescence, and pregnancy, is less understood. By the 1980s, concerns over health impacts began to grow, and in 2009, the NOVA classification system formally defined UPFs, distinguishing them from minimally processed and whole foods. The NOVA system groups foods into four categories based on processing levels, with UPFs being the most altered and least nutritious. UPFs now account for more than half of dietary energy intake in many developed nations, with consumption also rising in middle-income countries. Of particular concern is the increasing intake among children and adolescents, a population highly susceptible to nutritional deficiencies. This trend could have profound effects on brain development and mental health, as well as exacerbate sensory-driven selective eating behaviours (such as those seen in ARFID), a selective eating disorder that the review discusses in the context of UPFs' uniform texture and sensory properties but does not causally link to UPF consumption. Such effects may reinforce a cycle of poor health outcomes across generations. This figure illustrates the profound and cumulative effects of UPF consumption across different life stages, prenatal period, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age, highlighting their role in a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and cognitive disorders. The interconnected arrows emphasize how exposure to UPFs in one stage can amplify health risks in later stages, creating a continuous and reinforcing cycle of adverse health outcomes. Certain nanoparticles (like titanium dioxide, common in processed foods) sneak past the brain's defenses, piling up inside neurons and glial cells where they can disrupt learning and memory pathways. Large-scale studies consistently tie UPFs to weight gain and obesity across age groups. Diets rich in UPFs also elevate risks of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. During pregnancy, high UPF intake predicts pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and poorer neonatal outcomes such as congenital heart defects and pre-term births. Beyond these disorders, UPFs displace nutrient-dense foods, producing micronutrient deficits that are especially harmful during rapid growth and neural maturation. Emerging evidence further links heavy UPF consumption to hyperactivity, inattention, depression, and anxiety, with potential for cumulative, lifelong neurocognitive harm. The review notes that deficiencies in specific nutrients, such as iron and zinc, associated with high UPF intake, may impair neurodevelopmental processes and cognitive functions in offspring. Animal evidence is also discussed, such as findings that trans-fat intake during pregnancy can induce hippocampal inflammation and memory deficits in offspring. UPFs thrive where food skills, budgets, and time are limited. Lower-income, single-parent or dual-working households lean on cheap, ready-to-eat products, while school meal programmes often reinforce these habits, as UPFs provide 65% or more of lunchtime calories in many UK schools. Urbanization, frequent snacking, dining out, poor sleep, and persuasive marketing magnify exposure. Adolescents are the heaviest consumers, although intake falls with age. Cultural context matters, with Japan's education-focused school lunches showing that policy can curb reliance on UPFs. Eating is regulated by intertwined homeostatic (energy need) and hedonic (reward seeking) systems. The review discusses how repeated UPF exposure can hypersensitize reward circuits and reinforce habitual or compulsive consumption, using terms such as "reward dysfunction" and "habitual overconsumption" rather than "addiction-like behaviours." Key hubs include the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and insular cortex, all integrating metabolic cues, memories, and emotions to shape food choice. The third trimester and early childhood are highly plastic phases; inadequate maternal or infant nutrition can permanently alter synaptogenesis and myelination. Adolescence represents a second vulnerable window: the prefrontal cortex and mesolimbic dopamine system are still maturing, heightening sensitivity to rewarding foods and emotional stress. Repeated UPF exposure during these periods strengthens hedonic pathways and weakens inhibitory control. Bisphenols aren't just about bottles: Found leaching from UPF packaging, these chemicals cross the placenta and meddle with genes crucial for setting up a baby's dopamine and serotonin systems, potentially wiring the brain for future anxiety or hyperactivity. UPF availability, aggressive advertising, and screen time create an obesogenic environment that cements taste preferences for energy-dense, sweet, and salty foods. Early life UPF consumption predicts chronic inflammation, persistent obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and a greater risk of mental health disorders into adulthood. The review also notes that the prevalence of ARFID and other eating disorders may be exacerbated by UPFs' sensory properties, but does not present a direct causal link. Curbing UPF intake in mothers, children, and adolescents is therefore vital to break the intergenerational cycle of diet-related disease. UPFs may disrupt key neurodevelopmental processes like synapse formation, myelination, and neurotransmitter signaling, primarily through inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetic changes, and gut microbiome alterations. Deficiencies in nutrients like long-chain fatty acids, zinc, iron, and protein due to high UPF intake may impair emotional regulation, memory, and cognition in children. Some UPF components, including nanoparticles and additives, may further harm the developing brain. For example, nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide and certain additives can cross the blood–brain barrier, potentially impairing memory and learning, while exposure to bisphenols may disrupt dopamine and serotonin signaling in the developing brain. Teen brains are primed for UPF hijacking: During adolescence, the brain's reward center (striatum) fires up faster than the frontal control regions. This natural imbalance makes teens extra vulnerable to UPFs' hyper-rewarding signals, cementing hard-to-break eating habits. Cumulative exposure to UPFs from fetal life through adulthood is now clearly associated with a wide range of neurocognitive consequences, from early executive dysfunction to increased dementia risk later in life. The mechanisms include altered brain reward signaling, gut–brain axis disruption, and inflammation-driven neural changes. The authors call for public health policy levers—such as reducing UPF availability, mandating unambiguous front-of-pack food labelling, and stimulating product reformulation—as well as prioritizing longitudinal neuroimaging research to confirm causality and pinpoint sensitive developmental windows. Policy efforts should aim to reduce UPF availability, improve food labelling, and promote reformulation. Clinicians should also encourage diets rich in fiber and minimally processed foods to support brain development and long-term cognitive health.
