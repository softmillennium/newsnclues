                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian soldier of the Akhmat Chechen Special Forces Unit walks near destroyed military vehicles in Kazachya Loknya, Kursk Oblast, Russia, on March 18, 2025. I never thought that I would now be the one needing to speak up about a colorful, well-written, and beautifully photographed piece of war journalism. Here we are because on July 12, The New York Times released a field report from Russian territory in Kursk Oblast, after it had been retaken from Ukrainian forces in March this year. I want to believe that I'm tolerant and flexible, and understand that different publications in different countries might look at this war a little bit differently than us here at The Kyiv Independent. And overall, of course, we understand and place a very high value on the importance of the world not forgetting about this war. We now stand at one of the most crucial moments in Russia's full-scale war — where the events of the next few months, particularly in the United States, could play a deciding role in whether our home, Ukraine, exists as an independent country in a few years' time or not. On the surface, the article by the German-Russian Magnum photographer Nanna Heitmann is very well put together — impressive writing, emotional quotes from suffering civilians and soldiers, the proper caveats on casualty figures stated by Russian authorities, and, of course, Heitmann's compelling photography, for which she has gained numerous accolades in her career so far. This shouldn't need to be spelled out — this piece proactively creates a narrative of moral equivalence in a war where the moral landscape could hardly be more black and white. It seems like it should be obvious to anyone — but for some reason, not to the New York Times editorial board. Having worked in this field for almost three years now, I can tell you that soldiers don't usually want to have to babysit journalists in a war zone. That's why embedded front-line access is not always an easy thing to come by, let alone for a photographer working for the newspaper of an “unfriendly nation.” There are three reasons why soldiers are ready to bring journalists to the front line: either they've received an order from higher up to do so, they see a direct personal benefit in bringing these journalists along, or there's simply a great deal of personal trust — or perhaps even friendship — with the journalist. When I went to Kursk Oblast myself in the weeks after Ukraine's incursion last year, I went twice: once unofficially, with my soldier friends, and once on an official press tour organized by the Ukrainian military. This isn't the first time that Heitmann has worked with Akhmat either. Her work previously sparked outrage in Ukraine when an image of a wounded soldier at one of Akhmat's field hospitals near occupied Bakhmut was placed alongside the image of a Ukrainian child — in a diptych presented by World Press Photo in an attempt to show the duality of war — or something ridiculous along those lines. Would it be seen as acceptable by the New York Times editorial board to have their journalist embedded with a Nazi German SS unit on the battlefields of Eastern Europe in World War II? Here, we have one of the most notoriously brutal military units of this war, the elite guard of a fascist regime within a larger fascist aggressor state — giving this Western reporter repeated, exclusive access to the front line. I really hate the fact that I have to go there — but would it be seen as acceptable by the New York Times editorial board to have their journalist embedded with a Nazi German SS unit on the battlefields of Eastern Europe in World War II? As a flagship Western media outlet, in a country that has long been the center of the free world – but is now facing a moral crisis of its own – The New York Times has an inherent duty to document these historic events with some level of moral grounding. I'm not saying that no reporting should be done from Russia. When thinking about how to do it right, I think of the brave and dignified BBC correspondent Steve Rosenberg, who is there, occasionally rubbing shoulders with the Kremlin inner circle, but doing so with the clear, focused understanding that he is covering the attempt by a massive, tyrannical empire to annihilate an independent state. But here, instead of reporting like that of Rosenberg, what we get from Heitmann and The New York Times is reporting more along the lines of that of Anastasia Trofimova, the Russian “independent” filmmaker who — after directing documentaries with Kremlin propaganda channel RT — made her film, “Russians at War,” about the “human side” of those soldiers who signed up to kill and torture, steal and rape in Ukraine for money. And yet, when we were on the territory of another sovereign state, I understood that something here was inherently different. For that reason, I said as much in my reports. I explained in our video story that our access was controlled by the Ukrainian military, and that this was an unprecedented situation — for a Ukrainian war reporter to be entering another country with an occupying army, speaking to civilians to whom the soldiers personally brought us to. In this managed environment, nothing I saw or heard about the treatment of the locals could be taken as representative fact. The historic moment demanded that we report on this. But there were ethical problems, and we acknowledged them from the outset. Neither in this article from Heitmann, nor in the other work she has done inside occupied Ukrainian territory, is any of that self-awareness evident. Perhaps including it would ruin her next opportunity to embed with Akhmat. Perhaps it wasn't there in the first place. And in a time where Americans — from ordinary voters, to thought leaders, and up to the president himself — are more vulnerable to “both-sidesing” narratives on this war than ever, an approach like this could have real consequences for the future existence of Ukraine. The New York Times, you can and must do better. Francis Farrell is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump officials' recent attempt to dispel concerns about “chemtrails” has perplexed and angered some experts who say the administration has itself promoted the conspiracy theory while also spreading climate misinformation. “This is an intriguing strategy … in an administration that, depending on agency, is actively promulgating conspiracy theories or at least conspiratorial thinking,” said Timothy Tangherlini, a professor at the Berkeley School of Information who studies the circulation of folklore and conspiracy theories. On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a website about contrails, trails of white vapor emitted aircrafts. Conspiracy theorists call the streaks “chemtrails” and believe they contain polluting chemicals meant to achieve mass sterilization, weather control or other nefarious plots. Though “it is reasonable to ask questions”, those beliefs are inaccurate, the page makes clear. Officials also launched a second webpage focused on geoengineering, which correctly notes that schemes to “cool the Earth by intentionally modifying the amount of sunlight” are “being studied”. The websites were published as baseless rumors swirled claiming weather-altering technology fueled recent catastrophic flooding in Texas. Sijia Xiao, a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who for a 2021 study interviewed 20 current and former chemtrails believers, said the conspiracy theory attracts many people looking for simple explanations to tragedies. “Several participants in my interviews, they related chemtrails to their personal health problems or environmental concerns like pollution,” she said. “Rather than addressing climate change – which makes floods like those in Texas, North Carolina, New Mexico, and Illinois more intense, more deadly and more frequent – Trump's EPA is wasting taxpayer money chasing baseless conspiracy theories that scientists debunked years ago,” said the Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a climate hawk. “It's a distraction from the Trump administration's free pass to big oil on its pollution.” Since Trump re-entered the White House in January, EPA has slashed funding for climate research, removed all mentions of climate from federal websites, and cut staff for weather forecasting and scientific agencies. The president has also repeatedly referred to green regulations as a “scam” and repeated climate denialist talking points, while his administration has spread misinformation about elections and vaccines. As recently as two months ago, Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump's health and human services secretary, also suggested that the chemtrail conspiracy theory is real, saying in a televised town hall he would “do everything in my power to stop” their spread. Some have been able to integrate the new EPA websites into those stories, claiming they merely provide evidence that the government is continuing to cover up information about chemtrails. The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said. “Conspiracy theory is a self-fulfilling feedback loop where everything can be turned into evidence of supporting their beliefs,” said Xiao. Though the chemtrail belief is not based in reality, real conspiracies have existed through American history, said Tangherlini, including ones that involved the cover-up of covertly sprayed chemicals. “Just like big tobacco lied about cigarettes causing cancer, big oil has spent decades running a vast conspiracy to deceive the public on climate change,” he said. “That's why Maga [Trump's Make America Great Again movement] wants us talking about this chemtrails garbage – because there's a real conspiracy implicating their big oil cronies that they don't want the American people to think about.”</p>

If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Musallet's brother finally was able to retrieve him and bring him to a nearby hospital, but he died from his injuries before arriving there. “This was a lynching, not a ‘clash,'” said Imraan Siddiqi, executive director of the Washington State office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Musallet is at least the ninth U.S. citizen to be killed by Israeli forces or settlers since 2022. The U.S. government has historically accepted the results of Israel's investigations into killings like those of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi. Under pressure, the Department of Justice finally opened a probe into the 2022 fatal shooting of Abu Akleh, but more than three years after her killing it has not released its findings. “Israeli settlers lynched 20-year-old Palestinian American Sayfollah Musallet, while U.S. officials stayed silent,” the group said. He was visiting family for the summer in the West Bank when settlers beat him to death while he protested illegal land seizures.” Diana, cousin of American citizen Sayfollah Musallet – a 20-year-old beaten to death on Friday by settlers near his family home in the occupied West Bank – making a statement on Saturday. “Why do Israelis keep murdering Americans?” said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now. “Seems it's always just really Israel First for these folks.” Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. An immigration raid in Camarillo, California, on Thursday led to an hourslong standoff between protesters and federal border agents, who blocked the roads with military-style vehicles and tear-gassed community members, including children, as crowds attempted to protect dozens of farmworkers from arrest. The Department of Homeland Security said over 300 immigrants were detained in dual raids on cannabis farms and agricultural fields in Camarillo and the coastal city of Carpinteria. Jaime Alanís, 57, had worked at the farm in Camarillo for 10 years and provided for his wife and daughter who live in Mexico. “It was almost unlike anything that we had ever seen before,” says Angelmarie Taylor, a student and volunteer with 805 Immigrant Coalition who was present during the raid in Camarillo.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump has defended attorney general Pam Bondi amid calls from Maga world for her to go. In a lengthy social media post, Trump hit out at complaints from critics who have accused Bondi of withholding more information about Jeffrey Epstein's sudden death and his so-called client list. “LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB,” Trump wrote in all caps, encouraging his supporters to “not waste time and energy” on Epstein. She had also repeatedly pledged to reveal potentially damaging evidence including “a lot of names” and “a lot of flight logs” relating to Epstein. But the justice department last week released a memo concluding there was no evidence suggesting the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender kept a “client list” to blackmail high-profile figures. It also found no evidence to suggest foul play in Epstein's death, which had previously been ruled a suicide. Bondi sought to clarify her remarks in the White House on Tuesday, telling reporters that she had been commenting on the entire Epstein “file” and other files. Tucker Carlson has told NBC News this morning that he now believes the justice department doesn't actually have “much relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein's sex crimes”. “Rather than just admit that, Pam Bondi made a bunch of ludicrous claims on cable news shows that she couldn't back up, and this current outrage is the result,” Carlson said. Attorneys general or governors from 24 states and the District of Columbia sued in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, arguing that the US Department of Education and the office of management and budget threw schools nationwide into chaos by unconstitutionally freezing funding for six programs approved by Congress. The administration also froze funding used to support adult literacy and job-readiness skills. Instead, the education department notified states on 30 June that it would not be issuing grant awards under those programs by that deadline. It cited the change in administration as its reason. An OMB spokesperson at the time cited an “ongoing programmatic review” of education funding and said initial findings showed what he termed as a misuse of grant funds to “subsidize a radical leftwing agenda”. OMB also raised objections to the use of the grant money to support scholarships for immigrant students and lessons that involved LGBTQ+ themes. The Democratic-led states said the sweeping funding freeze has disrupted school systems, resulting in summer school and after-school programs being canceled or put at risk and the halting of other initiatives with little time for school districts to fill in the holes left in their budgets. The lawsuit follows a series of other cases Democratic-led states and others have filed challenging the administration's sweeping efforts to freeze or terminate federal funding for programs out of step with Trump's agenda. The notorious new “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration jail in the Florida Everglades contains hundreds of detainees with no criminal records or charges, it was disclosed yesterday, as lawmakers decried “inhumane” conditions inside after touring the facility. Donald Trump has insisted that the remote camp in swamp land populated by pythons and alligators was reserved for immigrants who were “deranged psychopaths” and “some of the most vicious people on the planet” awaiting deportation. But at least one detainee shouted out to politicians during Saturday's visit that he was a US citizen, the Democratic Florida congressman Maxwell Frost said. And the Miami Herald obtained and published a list of 700 people held in cages showing that at least 250 had committed no offense other than a civil immigration violation. Authorities have refused to release a list of those sent there by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (Ice). There are Ice agents there every day, and I was told directly from the guy running the whole thing that Ice tells them exactly what to do, how to put everything together. “I made every single one of those,” the former president told the New York Times in an interview published yesterday when asked about claims that he was incapacitated and unaware of clemency decisions. Biden called the people making those claims “liars”, adding: “They know it.” He pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, of convictions on federal gun and tax charges, too. And he also granted pre-emptive pardons to other members of his immediate family, along with the former top public health adviser Dr Anthony Fauci and ex-joint chiefs of staff chair Gen Mark Milley. Conservatives have alleged that the commutations and pardons, along with executive orders passed during his term, are not binding because they were signed using an autopen printer to reproduce a signature and could therefore not be verified as being directly authorized by Biden himself. “As you know, other presidents used it, including Trump. But the point is that … we're talking about a whole lot of people.” “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency,” he said in June. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false.” But Rutte did say that Germany, Finland, Canada, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Denmark would be among the buyers to supply Ukraine. Trump said the weapons the US would send to Nato to support Ukraine in its war against Russia would include Patriot missile systems and batteries, Reuters reports. “It's a full complement with the batteries,” Trump said when asked whether he would send Patriot missiles specifically. “We're going to have some come very soon, within days... a couple of the countries that have Patriots are going to swap over and will replace the Patriots with the ones they have.” Trump's threat to put “severe tariffs” on Russia over the Ukraine war comes amid a bipartisan push for sanctions on Moscow. The bill, backed by Republican senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal, calls for a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that continue to buy Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports, according to the Associated Press. The move essentially targets countries like China and India, which account for about 70% of Russia's energy trade and finance much of Moscow's war effort. “I use trade for a lot of things,” he added. Donald Trump is still speaking now in the Oval Office alongside Nato leader Mark Rutte. Trump, while announcing Patriot missiles being sent to Kyiv, said the US will impose “very severe tariffs” on Russia in 50 days if there is no deal to stop the war in Ukraine. While the Maga world is in disarray over the Epstein files, president Donald Trump is hosting Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte in the White House for talks that will also include state secretary Marco Rubio, defense secretary Pete Hegseth and members of Congress. A former New York police officer and Secret Service agent who provided security to presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama, Bongino is best known as a far-right Maga podcaster and conspiracy theorist, who vocally supported Donald Trump's lie that the 2020 presidential election was “stolen”. Bongino had never served in the FBI, and his appointment as deputy marked the first time in its 117-year history that the second-in-command post has not been held by one of its senior agents. As a podcast host, Bongino spent years pushing Epstein conspiracy theories, and has reportedly been very upset with attorney general Pam Bondi over how the Epstein files were handled. Asked by reporters yesterday if Bongino would remain in his position, Trump said: Here's more on Bongino from my colleague Robert Tait: In his administration's claim that it did not have a list of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged clients, and that the convicted sex offender was not murdered, it succeeded in upsetting the rightwing influencers and commentators – and reportedly even Trump's deputy FBI director – people who typically champion his every move. The feds spent decades investigating Epstein and have had total access to his property for years, they still cannot give us a straight answer? But within the rightwing, Epstein-curious sphere, others had continued to wade in. “Pam Blondi [sic] is covering up child sex crimes that took place under HER WATCH when she was Attorney General of Florida,” wrote Laura Loomer, the 32-year-old conspiracy theorist whose influence over Trump has come under scrutiny. “She is afraid of that being discussed and brought to light. When the justice department said that Epstein did not keep a client list and no more files related to his sex-trafficking investigation would be made public, the White House claimed Bondi had been talking about the “entirety of all of the paperwork and relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes”, which satisfied few rightwing commentators, many of whom have built careers on propagating conspiracy theories. That answers were out there and would be provided. Incredible how utterly mismanaged this Epstein mess has been. And it didn't have to be,” said Jack Posobiec, who promoted the baseless theory that high-level Democrats were running a child sex ring out of a Washington pizzeria. Posobiec was among a group of rightwing influencers who were given binders labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” during a visit to the White House in February – although many were disappointed that those documents contained little new information. “There are some extremely bizarre things about the video of Epstein's cell that Pam Bondi's DOJ released as proof no one killed him. First, a full minute appears to be missing from the video and secondly, it does NOT appear to be the same cell as the photo released on Jan 5, 2020,” wrote Robby Starbuck, a rightwing influencer and Trump supporter. Next the DOJ will say ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed.' Donald Trump has defended attorney general Pam Bondi amid calls from Maga world for her to go. In a lengthy social media post, Trump hit out at complaints from critics who have accused Bondi of withholding more information about Jeffrey Epstein's sudden death and his so-called client list. “LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB,” Trump wrote in all caps, encouraging his supporters to “not waste time and energy” on Epstein. She had also repeatedly pledged to reveal potentially damaging evidence including “a lot of names” and “a lot of flight logs” relating to Epstein. But the justice department last week released a memo concluding there was no evidence suggesting the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender kept a “client list” to blackmail high-profile figures. It also found no evidence to suggest foul play in Epstein's death, which had previously been ruled a suicide. Bondi sought to clarify her remarks in the White House on Tuesday, telling reporters that she had been commenting on the entire Epstein “file” and other files. Tucker Carlson has told NBC News this morning that he now believes the justice department doesn't actually have “much relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein's sex crimes”. “Rather than just admit that, Pam Bondi made a bunch of ludicrous claims on cable news shows that she couldn't back up, and this current outrage is the result,” Carlson said. It's an honor to serve the President of the United States – and I'll continue to do so for as long as he calls on me.” Over the past week, Maga hardliners, including Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, former White House adviser Steve Bannon and – reportedly – FBI deputy director Dan Bongino, have been strongly critical of a joint decision by US attorney general Pam Bondi and the FBI to not release further information about Epstein held in government files, including a so-called client list. And on Friday, NBC News reported that Bongino was considering stepping down from his post at the FBI after a “heated confrontation” with Bondi over the issue. He's threatening to quit and torch Pam unless she's fired.” Trump last night played down the resignation rumors, saying he had spoken to Bongino who sounded “terrific”. But Maga influencer and far-right activist Laura Loomer had this prediction for Politico: “I don't see how there can be a situation where Bongino can coexist with Blondi [Loomer's derisive moniker for Bondi] as attorney general, and so I wouldn't be surprised if we see a resignation from Bongino. Perhaps I'm wrong, but it would not shock me if Bongino resigns in the next week.” I think [Trump's] trying to protect some billionaire friend of his. That's what he lives for more than anything else in the world: protecting billionaires. Look at what he did with the so-called ‘big, beautiful bill'. Politico also notes that “the growing number of Democrats making similar efforts on the Epstein files spans a wide breadth of the party's membership, from New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Georgia senator Jon Ossoff; from relative backbenchers to members of the Senate leadership, like Hawaii senator Brian Schatz.”</p>

WASHINGTON, July 14. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump is considering supplying JASSM air-launched cruise missiles to the Ukrainian armed forces, the Military Watch Magazine reported citing an anonymous source.

According to the media outlet, "the missiles would equip the Ukrainian Air Force's growing fleet of F-16 fighters, which although comprised of obsolete Cold War era variants, could serve as effective launch platforms for the missiles while flying deep behind friendly lines."

The JASSM is a weapon with a range of about 370 kilometers. The JASSM-ER modification has a range of 1,000 kilometers.

Earlier, Axios reported that, later on Monday, Trump intends to announce a new plan to arm Ukraine that will include sending offensive weapons to Kiev. Sources told the news portal that the plan will likely "include long-range missiles that could reach targets deep inside Russian territory, including Moscow." However, the sources are unaware of any final decision regarding this.

Previously, at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, the American leader told reporters that the US will send additional weapons to Ukraine, including Patriot air defense systems paid for by the European Union.</p>

King Charles will host Trump at Windsor Castle, about an hour from central London, the palace said in a statement. The usual venue for state visits, Buckingham Palace, is undergoing significant renovations this year. Related article King Charles emphasizes bonds between UK and France as he welcomes Macron in first European state visit since Brexit Typically, second-term US presidents are not invited for a second state visit. In keeping with tradition, former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush were offered lunch or tea with the monarch during their second administrations. A formal invitation was then sent in June, but the two leaders were unable to meet during the summer due to scheduling conflicts. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. “His Majesty has known President Trump for many years and looks forward to hosting him and the First Lady later this year,” a palace aide told CNN in June. All senior members of the Royal Family are expected to take part. Trump is also embarking on a private visit to Scotland later this month, where he will meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, according to a Downing Street spokesman. Downing Street said the meeting will not be a formal bilateral. Trump is expected to attend the opening of a new course at his golf resort in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The president owns another golf course – Trump Turnberry – in Ayrshire, Scotland. During his first formal state visit in 2019, Trump was hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace. But due to security concerns, there was no public procession along The Mall in London, and the president arrived by helicopter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Volodymyr Zelensky has named First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko as the next prime minister of Ukraine, he said on July 14, launching a government reshuffle. "I have proposed that Yuliia Svyrydenko lead the Government of Ukraine and significantly renew its work," Zelensky said in a post on X. Svyrydenko said she would soon present the list of proposed ministers. The parliament's next session is to begin this week. Rumors about replacing Shmyhal — the country's longest serving prime minister — have circulated since last summer. The Kyiv Independent operates without a wealthy owner or a paywall, relying solely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. When asked when certain weapons, including missiles to Patriot air defense systems, were expected to arrive in Ukraine, Trump responded by saying "a full complement with the batteries... We're going to have some come very soon, within days." Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal is being considered for the role of Ukraine's Defense Minister as part of an anticipated government reshuffle, two sources close to the Defense Ministry told the Kyiv Independent on July 14. The technology is critical for Ukraine's air defense as Russia's aerial attacks have escalated significantly over the past few months The Kyiv Independent asked teens in Ukraine aged between 14 and 17 about their experiences during Russia's war. Tariffs that are about 100%, we call them secondary tariffs," Donald Trump said in a joint press conference in the White House alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Russian troops launched drone attacks on Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts on July 14, killing one person and injuring at least 21, local authorities reported. "I have proposed that Yuliia Svyrydenko lead the Government of Ukraine and significantly renew its work," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. "We discussed the path to peace and what we can practically do together to bring it closer," President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote. The aircraft had three crew members and two technicians on board, Russian pro-government media outlet Kommersant reported. "Constructive dialogue between Russia and the U.S. will always achieve more than the tired, destructive language of pressure," Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, wrote. The deployment took place in Sumy Oblast, a northeastern region bordering Russia that has recently faced renewed Moscow's attempts to advance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, July 14. Russia is ready to hold another round of talks with Ukraine, but Ukraine is clearly not in a hurry to do so, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted. "Kiev is clearly taking its time. We still await proposals concerning the timelines. The Russian side is willing to continue and hold a third round [of talks]," he said. The second round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine was held in Istanbul on June 2. The meeting lasted just over an hour, and the delegations communicated in Russian. The sides exchanged documents showing their vision of various aspects of resolving the conflict. Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's chief negotiator, said that Moscow had submitted a two-part memorandum to Kiev. Russia and Ukraine also agreed to carry out an "all for all" exchange of seriously ill prisoners of war and those under 25 years.</p>

The Senate this week is set to consider a $9.4 billion rescissions package that would codify cuts identified by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—including cuts to National Public Radio (NPR), the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and foreign spending.

President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) can spare no more than three defections to pass the cuts. But with time running out, several Senate Republicans have expressed skepticism about the proposed cuts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No Canadian licence plates were visible on Main Street in Presque Isle, Maine on a recent Saturday, as the region's leaders seek to persuade Canadians to return. New signs greet Canadians still crossing the border into northeastern Maine with a cheery bilingual message of “Bienvenue à nos amis canadiens!” Officials have taken care to ensure the Maple Leaf is still fluttering, and that frayed flags are replaced. The airport in Presque Isle has urged its employees to be delicate in conversation with Canadian travellers who may not want to hear American views on trade and tariffs. No joking about the 51st state, local tourism authorities have urged. No chatting even amongst staff about how nice it would be to get to Canadian Tire without a passport, lest a Canadian customer overhear. Any of that at this moment is in “especially poor taste and we can treat the topic like talking about politics between staff and customers – we just don't do it,” said Jacob Pelkey, the Aroostook County tourism developer with the Northern Maine Development Commission. The county, which stretches around the northeastern corner of Maine and is home to nearly half of the state's points of entry with Canada, is hoping it can find a new language to reassure Canadian neighbours — some of them family relations and fellow church members, others long-time customers — and keep them coming to the U.S. For months, rhetoric from the White House has kept large numbers of those travellers away (then-prime-minister Justin Trudeau, too, specifically urged Canadians not to vacation in Maine). Local businesses that depended on customers from neighbouring New Brunswick have seen sales fall by a quarter, with April and May land crossings into Maine down nearly a third from last year. Canadian students at a local university switched to online courses rather than risk intense border scrutiny. The quest to find a more welcoming vocabulary has, however, thrust this part of Maine into a confrontation with the limitations of language. What turn of phrase, after all, can soothe the economic pain of businesses struggling to cope with punishing new tariffs or, at the very least, dramatic new uncertainty? Can anyone find a way to speak louder than Donald Trump? 'Please,' I guess,” said Joe Marino, the meat manager of Andy's IGA in Houlton, Me., a family-owned grocery store that once counted on Canadians for 30 per cent of its business. Today, that has shrunk to 7 or 8 per cent, he says. “The state of Maine should be scratching and clawing to try and get as many Canadians across the border as they can,” Mr. Marino said. Yet he struggles to think how that can be done. Not only have tensions with the U.S. kept some from Canada away, but the exchange rate has made cross-border shopping less attractive, while countertariffs have made it potentially costly for Canadians to bring goods back home. Any future improvement in fortunes will, Mr. Marino believes, “boil down to money — is it worth your while to deal with the border crossing?” Last month, Democratic Governor Janet Mills travelled to New Brunswick to tout a “centuries-old friendship” that, she said, “remains strong.” While in the province, she heard from Canadians, including a board member for Saint John Pride, that many no longer feel safe in the U.S. Some in Maine have decided it's best to say nothing at all. “I mean, this whole thing isn't going to be decided between an airport employee and a passenger flying out. So there really isn't any value in entering into that debate.” The Presque Isle airport has been an important nexus for Canadians. “You can just imagine if I have an employee start yakking about the 51st state or, ‘We don't really need Canadians' and so on — that's not going to send the right message to my customers,” Mr. Wardwell said. Tim Lausier, who co-owns the gas station and corner store with his sister, has deep personal connections with Canada, where he was born and still regularly attends hockey games. In the past few months, though, travel to New Brunswick has meant getting an earful. Employees of one plastic manufacturer stopped coming to his service centre after tariffs hit their business. Mr. Lausier doubts he will ever see all of his previous customers again, and he wonders what good any words on a sign can do at a time like this.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hopes had been high for the latest negotiations but after days of negotiations the two sides accused each other of blocking an agreement while on the ground there has been no let-up in Israel's military campaign, which resumed when the last ceasefire collapsed in March. That was before the Israeli airstrike Sunday killed six children and four others at a water distribution point in central Gaza, according to Al-Awda Hospital. Video from the chaotic scene showed multiple casualties including children amid buckets and water carriers. Also in central Gaza on Sunday, at least 12 people were killed and more than 40 injured when an Israeli airstrike targeted a crowded junction, according to Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, Director of Al-Shifa Medical Complex central Gaza City. The dead included a prominent doctor, Ahmad Qandeel, described by the health ministry as “one of Gaza's most respected medical professionals.” “Conditions on the ground are worse than they've ever been,” the acting director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), Sam Rose, told CNN on Monday. “There's a certain tragic and horrific and numbing inevitability about this that the longer it goes on, the worse it will get.” He said Palestinians in Gaza are forced to make “impossible choices” between starvation or risking death to secure aid. Sunday's heavy toll followed several deadly incidents Saturday. The ministry said 27 were killed and many more injured when Israeli troops opened fire on people trying to obtain aid from a distribution site near southern Rafah run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). GHF denied the claim, saying “there were no incidents at or in the immediate vicinity of our sites” on Saturday. Nearly 800 Palestinians were killed while trying to access aid in Gaza between late May and July 7, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), when the GHF began operating. Salmiya told CNN that 40 injured people had been admitted. Geolocated video showed at least one child among the victims. The Israel Defense Forces said Sunday it had destroyed weapons and tunnels used by Hamas in northern Gaza and the air force had carried out attacks on more than 150 targets across the Gaza Strip, including “booby-trapped buildings, weapons depots, anti-tank missile and sniper positions.” The spike in casualties in Gaza comes as talks on agreeing a new ceasefire deal and hostage continue in Doha, with optimism having faded that an agreement can be quickly reached. US President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff said he's meeting with Qatari officials Sunday on the sidelines of the Club World Cup football match in New Jersey as he remains “hopeful” for the prospect of a Gaza ceasefire. Despite days of proximity talks in Doha between Israel and Hamas, significant gaps remain between the warring parties. The detailed maps were left to negotiations between Israel and Hamas, and that appears to be the main sticking point. In a video message released Sunday, Netanyahu said that Israel accepted the latest ceasefire plan presented by the US special envoy Steve Witkoff – but that Hamas had rejected it. Related article Battered but not beaten, Hamas embraces guerilla tactics with deadly force Netanyahu said Hamas wants to stay in Gaza “so it can rearm and attack us again and again.” “I won't compromise on these missions,” Netanyahu added. “Anyone who sabotages such an agreement is willfully acting against the Israeli people for political survival,” they warned, adding, “That is how history will remember him.” Recent opinion surveys in Israel suggest overwhelming approval for a deal that would end the war and return all the hostages, living and dead.</p>
