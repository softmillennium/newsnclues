                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner was able to get revenge over Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon after his defeat in the Roland Garros final. They have now played their first two Grand Slam finals against one another, with Alcaraz saving three championship points to beat Sinner at Roland Garros. In a more one-sided final at Wimbledon, Sinner changed his tactics to beat Alcaraz in four sets on Centre Court. Sinner intentionally being more aggressive was noticed by former doubles world number one Rennae Stubbs, who pointed this out in a social media post. She wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), ‚ÄúServing has been the difference so far. Has to go for it and be the more aggressive player. Serving has been the difference so far. Has to go for it and be the more aggressive player. After what he went through in losing the French Open final and the grace he showed in that defeat, to bounce back and win this title the way he did, absolutely extraordinary @janniksin and team.‚Äù After what he went thru in losing the French open final and the grace he showed in that defeat, to bounce back and win this title the way he did, absolutely extraordinary @janniksin and team.üëçüëçü´° https://t.co/T4yUoAJ9R3 Sinner's more aggressive game style against Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final is noticeable in the match statistics. The Italian hit both 40 winners and 40 unforced errors, showing that Sinner was not holding back in his shots against Alcaraz. Stubbs pointed out the serve as a real differential between the two players, with Sinner producing a higher first serve percentage, as well as a higher second serve win percentage. Sinner now holds three of the four Grand Slam titles, as he looks ahead to his US Open title defence. Both players will take a couple of weeks away from the matchcourt before potentially reigniting their rivalry at the Canadian Open in Toronto.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Swiss superstar remains a leading figure in the tennis community, even if he is not quite as involved as he once was. It is snippets like this which have many fans craving for his increased involvement within tennis, in any capacity. The epitome of class and elegance, he was unsurprisingly the dominant topic when Ljubicic spoke to Swiss-German outlet Tages-Anzeiger late last week. Asked if he felt like Federer might ever return to tennis in a coaching capacity, his answer was firm. The question posed was: ‚ÄúFederer seems to be at peace with himself after his career. Federer hitting on a deserted court at Wimbledon with Mirka watching is what happiness looks like pic.twitter.com/MwUTloj3hU ‚ÄúHe has remained connected to tennis, with the Laver Cup alone. He still wants to be there, but without having a specific role or function. I don't think he'll ever take one [a coaching job] either.‚Äù Jannik Sinner did surpass a Federer Grand Slam record in reaching the Wimbledon final, and is now on the warpath towards his magic eight titles. Federer will have been watching Sunday's gentleman's Wimbledon final with interest, given how Carlos Alcaraz has started his career at the All-England Club. After all, with back-to-back titles over the two previous years, the Spaniard had moved to within six more triumphs of equalling his record. And whilst that might offer some solace to Federer, the 22-year-old is arguably an even bigger threat given how it seems like only one man will challenge him at Wimbledon for the foreseeable future. At least he will remain the only man to have won his first five Wimbledon finals; unless Sinner is now about to start his own reign of terror on the grass.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON ‚Äî Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek beat Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in the Wimbledon women's final Saturday. 13 seed from the United States in a one-sided clinic of a match, ultimately decided by Anisimova's nerves, ≈öwiƒÖtek's clear-headed tactics and the relentlessness that makes her one of the best players in the world. She is the only active WTA Tour player to hold Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces, is now 6-0 in major finals and is second behind Venus Williams (seven) among active WTA players with the most majors. The Athletic's writers, Charlie Eccleshare and Matt Futterman, analyze the final, and what it means for tennis. ≈öwiƒÖtek had played five before today and never lost one; Anisimova had never been on this stage before. And then she walked onto Centre Court in the late afternoon sunshine. Famous people come to watch play every day. And then, unlike her other six matches this fortnight, Anisimova stepped up to the line and‚Ä¶ her serve just wouldn't go in. Then her fearsome, peerless backhand wouldn't go in. Everything looked ready to crumble from there, and that was the story of the first set for Anisimova, a portrait of nerves in action. She won just nine points to 27 for ≈öwiƒÖtek. Her backhand kept tumbling into the net. She made just 33 percent of her first serves. It was as though her arms were not attached to the rest of her body. As Carlos Alcaraz said after his first match here this year, ‚ÄúWimbledon is different.‚Äù Anisimova's biggest strength is her backhand, and so it might have seemed counterintuitive for ≈öwiƒÖtek to target it in the first set. But in so doing, she opened up a world of possibilities for herself, while telling Anisimova that her best shot wasn't going to trouble her. She was constantly moving Anisimova off balance and out of the court by breaking the sideline with her backhands, creating space to exploit on the other side. She started going for too much, aware of how well ≈öwiƒÖtek was retrieving, which contributed to the 14 unforced errors she hit in the first set alone, compared to just three winners. Attacking her backhand also sent out a message that ≈öwiƒÖtek didn't fear her opponent's biggest strength. She's been criticized for not being as tactically astute as before over the past year, but this was a brutally clear-headed performance. For ≈öwiƒÖtek, winning Wimbledon may be the most stunning yet predictable moment of what was already a Hall of Fame career. A month ago, she seemed rattled. The losses had been piling up and she had failed to defend three clay-court titles, including her favorite, the French Open. But ≈öwiƒÖtek had also made the semifinals in both previous majors in 2025, and had been showing signs of embedding the controlled aggression that she and her coach Wim Fissette wanted to be the bread and butter of her game. In a matter of weeks, she has flipped the script and solved the puzzle ‚Äî and on the grass of Wimbledon, the surface on which she was wrongly and too quickly written off. In part, the loss of those three titles may have been a help. But most of all, ≈öwiƒÖtek has done what all the great players have done at this tournament. And in less than an hour today, she became Wimbledon champion, giving her six Grand Slam titles, including one on every tennis surface, just as Ash Barty achieved before she dropped the mic with her retirement at the top of the sport in 2022. That decision made ≈öwiƒÖtek the world No. This title makes her the greatest since Serena Williams. When people advocate for making the latter stages of women's Grand Slams best of five sets like the men's events, it's matches like this one that they have in mind. The best-of-three format means that even after half an hour or less, it can be blindingly obvious which way a final is heading. This only adds to the pressure for the losing player, who feels like there's no time to settle and that their childhood dream is turning into a nightmare. Alcaraz lost the first five games of the 2023 men's final to Novak Djokovic, but at least he knew there was plenty of time to turn things around. The format is not why Anisimova got hammered in this final, but it adds to the sympathy everyone felt watching knowing that the match was likely to be over within an hour, as well as to the angst and awkwardness on Centre Court, where everyone was shellshocked at how awfully it was going for the first-time Grand Slam finalist. If this had been boxing, Anisimova would have been knocked out in the first couple of rounds. That's humiliating, but at least it's over. Here, it was clear where the match was headed after a nervy, error-strewn first couple of games, but Anisimova could do nothing but keep plugging away. There's no option in tennis to run the clock down and go for damage limitation, and it's hard to say where this leaves Anisimova. Hopefully, with a bit of distance, she can focus on how much of a breakthrough this tournament was. She made her first major final, and earned a win against the world No. Maybe she can write this off as just a dreadful day where everything went wrong, but there's also the psychological element of essentially having an anxiety dream play out in front of the watching world. ‚ÄúI didn't even dream of this because it seemed so far away,‚Äù she said on court. So I want to thank my team for believing in me more than I did. ‚ÄúI wish I could have put on a better performance for you today, but you guys have still been there for me and lifted me up, so thank you so much,‚Äù she said in her on-court interview. ‚ÄúWithout some of my family flying in, I definitely would not be standing here ‚Ä¶ My mom's put in more work than I have, honestly,‚Äù Anisimova added, through tears. ‚ÄúThank you for being here and breaking the superstition of flying in. It's definitely not why I lost today. (Top photo: Clive Brunskill / Getty Images)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British tennis star Dan Evans has urged people to 'leave Emma Raducanu alone' following her encouraging Wimbledon campaign. Raducanu encountered a stern challenge at the All England Club earlier this month when she went head-to-head with world No. Raducanu fought courageously, falling in straight sets 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, and Evans has now made an appeal following this promising display with Flushing Meadows approaching. "It was great to see her out there fighting the way she did and I thought she was the better player for long periods of that match against Sabalenka, who is the world No. I'm interested to see what comes next for Emma. She is already back on the court working hard, and I think the summer in America is going to be good for her. "We always need to manage expectations a little around Emma, but let's leave her alone, let her enjoy playing tennis and she has a decent chance to do well heading into the U.S. New York served as the backdrop for Raducanu's triumph four years ago, where she overcame players like Belinda Bencic, Maria Sakkari and Leylah Fernandez to claim the US Open title, remaining undefeated in sets until the semifinals. Following that victory, Raducanu has frequently switched coaches, terminating her partnership with Andrew Richardson merely two weeks after capturing the U.S. Open, a tournament she'll revisit in August despite failing to advance beyond the opening round since her championship. She has collaborated with Mark Petchey intermittently since the Miami Open, and although he guided her to her remarkable SW19 showing, their future partnership remains undetermined. Evans shared additional thoughts on handling Raducanu while revealing his potential coaching aspirations, though he hasn't retired from playing yet. "Coaching is something I would look at," Evans acknowledged. "It depends on what opportunity came up and the idea of working with players and see that improvement might be interesting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner says his and Iga Swiatek's singles title wins at Wimbledon were made "very special" following the doping cases involving them over the past year. For the first time in Wimbledon history, both the men's and women's champions have served suspensions for banned substances, ensuring that their celebrations have been accompanied by controversy. "I don't think it's a good look for the sport," said Australian Nick Kyrgios, when previewing both Wimbledon finals. Indeed, minutes after Sinner's victory on Sunday, the 2022 finalist posted a cryptic asterisk on social media, widely seen as a reflection of the mixed feelings some have about the men's world number one winning just over two months after completing a doping ban. Speaking after her victory on Saturday, Swiatek also hinted at the scrutiny she had been under. "The past months, how the media sometimes described me, how they treated me and my team, it wasn't really pleasant", she said. Swiatek's previous best performance at Wimbledon was reaching the quarter-final in 2023 Commonly used to treat problems such as angina, TMZ increases blood flow to the heart and stimulates the metabolism of glucose, which can improve endurance, which is why it is a banned substance in elite sport. Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was given a four-year ban last year after testing positive for TMZ in a sample before she competed at the 2022 Winter Olympics. Swiatek's level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range, as the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted it was caused by contamination of a regulated non-prescription medicine, manufactured and sold in Poland, which she said she took for jet lag and sleep issues. Sinner twice tested positive for low levels of the banned anabolic steroid clostebol - which can be used to build muscle mass - in March 2024. As with Swiatek, authorities accepted it was caused by the use of an over-the-counter medication and he was cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent tribunal, which decided not to suspend him. It accepted he had been inadvertently contaminated by his physiotherapist, who was treating a cut on his hand with an over-the-counter spray, which was later found to contain the banned substance. Significantly, however, the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) appealed against the panel's ruling that Sinner "bore no fault or negligence", and said it was seeking a ban of between one and two years. A hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) was set for April - but in February, shortly after retaining his Australian Open title, it was announced that Sinner and Wada had reached a controversial settlement, with the Italian then serving just a three-month ban. It meant he did not miss any Grand Slam tournaments, and was back in time for the French Open, prompting accusations of favouritism, with some players openly questioning their faith in clean sport. There have also been questions over why Sinner's former physio and trainer - who were both deemed responsible for the clostebol entering his system - could have made such a mistake, and why they have not faced any action from the authorities. Wada had felt the independent tribunal should have punished Sinner for strict liability - that he was ultimately responsible for failing the two drugs tests. In Swiatek's case, Wada did not appeal against her one-month suspension, claiming that its scientific experts "confirmed the specific contaminated melatonin scenario‚Ä¶ is plausible and that there would be no scientific grounds to challenge it at Cas". In the wake of Swiatek's punishment, Simona Halep was one of several players who questioned the differences in how doping cases were treated. In 2023, the Romanian had received a four-year ban for two anti-doping violations, later reduced to nine months after an appeal. Reflecting on both cases in December, Kyrgios said: "I think people are trying to sweep it under the rug. I just think that it's been handled horrifically in our sport. In the wake of Sinner's suspension, Spanish legend Rafael Nadal said he was "100%" sure that the Italian was innocent, but former British number one Tim Henman claimed the ban was "too convenient" and left tennis fans with a "pretty sour taste". Serena Williams said she would have been banned for 20 years and had some of her Grand Slam titles taken away if she had committed the same anti-doping offence as men's world number one Sinner. British player Tara Moore, who was provisionally banned for two years while challenging a doping charge of which she was eventually cleared after 19 months, also suggested top players were "treated differently", with their image prioritised. The ITIA has also highlighted a 26% increase in anti-doping tests in 2024 compared to the previous year, and says educating players about anti-doping rules is a priority. "A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair," said 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) - an organisation co-founded by Djokovic which aims to increase player power - said there is a lack of "transparency", "process" and "consistency" in the system. Three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka, writing on social media, said he did not "believe in a clean sport any more". Former British number one Greg Rusedski seemed to speak for many in the sport when he told BBC Sport: "I think you have to give them the benefit of the doubt, look at the tennis they have played in this last year, and I think this will all go away in time." Perhaps this should come as no surprise, given that doping controversies are far from unusual in tennis. Indeed, fellow Wimbledon winners Halep, Maria Sharapova, Martina Hingis and Andre Agassi also all had positive drugs tests, albeit after winning the championship, rather than before. "It's a little embarrassing for the sport and, by extension, for Wimbledon, it's a unique and unwelcome double" says public relations expert Tim Jotischky, of the PHA Group. "That might be because many don't follow the sport closely enough to be aware of the details, but the main reason is probably because tennis still looks like a clean sport, where performance-enhancing drugs have a minimum impact, in a way that athletics and cycling often do not. "Iga Swiatek's Wimbledon triumph followed a slump in form‚Ä¶ that may have helped divert attention away from her ban. "But tennis cannot be complacent or ignore the concerns of leading professionals. The rules around drugs offences need to be transparent and implemented consistently, regardless of a player's box office appeal." The All England Lawn Tennis Club has been approached for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the post-Wimbledon edition of the PIF WTA Rankings, champion Iga Swiatek is back in the Top 3, quarterfinalist Mirra Andreeva enters the Top 5, runner-up Amanda Anisimova makes her Top 10 debut and semifinalist Belinda Bencic returns to the Top 20. This year's Wimbledon began with a record-setting slew of upsets, as four Top 10 seeds exited in the first round, and ended with Iga Swiatek claiming her sixth Grand Slam trophy in style. Swiatek entered Wimbledon ranked No. 8, her lowest at a Grand Slam in over four years. She had not reached a final in 13 months, and her 3-year, 2-month stint inside the Top 2 had ended in May. The Pole responded in style, dropping just one set in seven matches to win her first Wimbledon crown -- indeed, her first grass-court title. Swiatek concluded her run by winning 20 straight games, wrapping up the first 6-0, 6-0 Grand Slam final since Stefanie Graf's whitewash of Natasha Zvereva at Roland Garros 1988 and improving her record in major finals to 6-0. Swiatek returns to the Top 3 in the PIF WTA Rankings after an eight-week absence, climbing one to No. That's just one of the many significant moves this week, from players hitting brand new career milestones to those on the way back to former highs. Here's how they break down. 5: Andreeva breaks into the Top 5 for the first time after reaching her first Wimbledon quarterfinal. The 18-year-old is the youngest player to make her Top 5 debut since a 17-year-old Maria Sharapova in November 2004. 7: Wimbledon runner-up Anisimova makes her Top 10 debut after notching her first win over a reigning World No. 1 (Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals) to reach her first major final. This time last year, the American was ranked No. 175 after falling in the last round of Wimbledon qualifying to Eva Lys. 19: Tauson enters the Top 20 for the first time after defeating former champion Elena Rybakina to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon -- her second time in the last 16 of a Grand Slam. She is the third player to make her Top 20 debut in 2025, following Yulia Putintseva in January and Anisimova in February. Baptiste also made the fourth round of Roland Garros this year. Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, +12 to No. 50: One year ago, Bouzas Maneiro caused a splash at Wimbledon by ousting defending champion Marketa Vondrousova in the first round and reaching the third round. Twelve months on, the 22-year-old Spaniard went one better to make the last 16 of a major for the first time, and makes her Top 50 debut as a result. The 20-year-old had also qualified for last year's US Open and this year's Roland Garros, but this result was the first time she had posted wins at tour level. Having cracked the Top 100 for the first time two weeks before Wimbledon, Sierra soars to a new career high in the Top 75. 95: At Roland Garros, Jacquemot lost a third-round heartbreaker to compatriot Lois Boisson -- who went on to reach the semifinals. The 22-year-old Frenchwoman has used that result as a springboard, though. Jacquemot qualified for Wimbledon and notched her first career Top 30 win over Magda Linette to make the second round; then, last week, she made her second career WTA 125 final in Contrex√©ville. She becomes the 17th player to make her Top 100 debut in 2025. Last week, the Swiss former No. 4 reached her second career Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon -- nearly six years after her first at the 2019 US Open. 30: Pavlyuchenkova bounced back from a bout of Lyme disease this spring to reach her second Wimbledon quarterfinal, and is back in the Top 30 for the first time since February. Pavlyuchenkova's Wimbledon result was her 10th career major quarterfinal, also including the Australian Open in January -- but this is just the second time (following 2011) that she has made more than one in a single season. 54: The largest numerical jump in this week's Top 100 belongs to former No. 27 Laura Siegemund, who reached her second Grand Slam quarterfinal at Wimbledon (following Roland Garros 2020). The 37-year-old German defeated Madison Keys in the third round for her second Top 10 win at a major this year, and soars back to her highest ranking since August 2021. Siegemund had won just two main-draw matches at Wimbledon in five appearances before this year. 76: The Italian had been forced to pull out of Wimbledon 2024 due to pneumonia -- the start of a battle with her health that contributed to her falling out of the Top 100 in May. Cocciaretto bounced back in style, reaching the Wimbledon third round after claiming her first career Top 5 win over Jessica Pegula in the first round. The 24-year-old, who reached her career high of No. 29 in August 2023, followed her Wimbledon run by claiming the Bastad WTA 125 title last week. 92: Since last August, former No. 29 Sasnovich had been ranked outside the Top 100 for all but two weeks. She qualified for Wimbledon and won the longest match of The Championships -- a 3-hour, 24-minute triumph from match point down to defeat Varvara Gracheva 6-4, 6-7(5), 7-6[8] -- to reach the second round. 98: Parry qualified for Wimbledon and upset Diana Shnaider in the second round for her second Top 20 win. Her fourth career third-round finish at a major means that the 22-year-old Frenchwoman returns to the Top 100. 135: McNally reached the Wimbledon second round, where she was the only player to win a set from Swiatek all fortnight. The American built on that result in style, claiming her second career WTA 125 title last week in Newport. Having been sidelined for eight months in 2024 due to elbow surgery, former No. 54 McNally's comeback has gained momentum -- she's back in the Top 200 for the first time since February 2024. 23: Noskova reached the fourth round of Wimbledon -- her second time in the second week of a Grand Slam. Her previous career high was No. 44: Kartal was the last British player standing at Wimbledon after making the fourth round of a major for the first time, and returns to the Top 50 as a result. 74: At Wimbledon, Sonmez made history by becoming the first Turkish player, male or female, to reach the third round of a major in the Open Era. 82: After kicking off the grass swing by making the second round of Queen's as a qualifier, Zakharova repeated the feat at Wimbledon, upsetting former World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in the first round. 86: The 18-year-old Canadian made the second round of Wimbledon as a lucky loser, notching her first career Top 30 win over Magdalena Frech to do so. 104: Jones, 24, claimed the first WTA 125 trophy of her career last week in Contrex√©ville. The Briton has also won clay-court titles at the Vacaria and Prague ITF W75s this year. 137: The 25-year-old Slovenian qualified for her second Grand Slam of the year at Wimbledon, then upset Marta Kostyuk in the first round for her maiden Top 30 win and first tour-level victory. 170: Oliynykova claimed her first ITF W75 title in The Hague last week. The 24-year-old Ukrainian has compiled a 24-4 record since April. 178: Branstine defeated compatriot and former junior doubles partner Bianca Andreescu en route to qualifying for her first Grand Slam main draw at Wimbledon. 181: Reigning NCAA singles champion Vidmanova compiled a 15-match winning streak in June and July, culminating in her first ITF W100 title in Cary two weeks ago. 1 Jones makes her Top 200 debut -- becoming the first 2008-born player to do so -- after the 17-year-old Australian reached the third round of Wimbledon qualifying. 199: Tjen extended her winning streak to 25 matches with her fifth title in a row, and sixth of 2025, at the Taipei ITF W35 three weeks ago. The 23-year-old Pepperdine University alumna becomes the first Indonesian player to be ranked in the Top 200 since Angelique Widjaja in June 2005. 353:The 18-year-old American reached her first ITF W100 final in Cary two weeks ago. Ekstrand has compiled a 30-12 record in 2024, also including two ITF W35 titles. 503: The 19-year-old Italian, a former Top 20 junior who made her WTA debut in Rome last year, claimed the first ITF W35 title of her career in Tarvisio three weeks ago. 591: The 15-year-old German is now the second-highest ranked 2009-born player (following Julieta Pareja) after winning her first pro title at the Kamen ITF W15 three weeks ago. 878: Thamm defeated an even younger compatriot, 14-year-old Wobker, in the Kamen final. Wobker followed that by reaching the Stuttgart Vaihingen ITF W35 quarterfinals and has started her career with an 11-4 pro record. She's the third 2010-born player to reach the Top 1,000 following Jana Kovackova and Kristina Liutova. 69: Rakhimova upset 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini in the Wimbledon second round for her first career Top 10 win. 93: Bucsa reached the third round of a major for the second time after defeating 2024 semifinalist Donna Vekic at Wimbledon, her sixth career Top 30 win. 115: Bogota finalist Kawa was also runner-up at the Bastad WTA 125 last week. 112 that she set in November 2020. 188: Former Roland Garros semifinalist Zidansek claimed the Bucharest ITF W75 trophy two weeks ago -- her first title at any level since the 2023 Bari WTA 125. 97 Mandlik reached the Cary ITF W100 quarterfinals and Newport WTA 125 semifinals over the past two weeks. 207: After being sidelined for 12 months in 2024-25 due to a shoulder nerve issue and returning to action unranked in January, Juvan qualified for the first Grand Slam of her comeback at Wimbledon. 339: Bartunkova, 19, won 11 straight matches over the past two weeks, claiming the Stuttgart Vaihingen ITF W35 title as a qualifier then making the Aschaffenburg ITF W50 final. 71 Diatchenko returned to action in April after a six-month hiatus. The 34-year-old won the first title of her comeback at last week's Corroios ITF W50. 1 Havlickova returned to action in June unranked after a 13-month hiatus. Havlickova previously set her career high of No. In the post-Wimbledon edition of the PIF WTA Rankings, champion Iga Swiatek is back in the Top 3, quarterfinalist Mirra Andreeva enters the Top 5, runner-up Amanda Anisimova makes her Top 10 debut and semifinalist Belinda Bencic returns to the Top 20.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner traded their tennis whites for some very sharp cocktail wear on Sunday night as the two new Wimbledon singles champions starred at the Champions Dinner. Swiatek won the women's tournament in just 57 minutes, double-bageling American Amanda Anisimova in emphatic fashion on Saturday, to become the first Polish singles champion. Then on Sunday, Sinner took on double defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the second installment of a growing rivalry at the top of men's tennis, avenging his defeat from the French Open just over a month ago. Both stars were dressed for the occasion - Swiatek wore a glamourous lilac gown by Stella McCartney worth more than $2,000, and Sinner, who is an ambassador for Italian fashion house Gucci, sported a custom dark suit and tie with a pair of the brand's signature loafers. The Italian revealed to BBC Sport how emotional he was after securing a memorable four-set victory over Alcaraz for his fourth major crown, describing it as 'the most amazing thing' that could have happened to him. '[It is] very emotional, even if I don't cry. Sinner's victory comes just 10 weeks after he returned from a three-month ban following two positive tests for banned substance clostebol. Meanwhile, Swiatek, whose final was far more routine in its brutality, admitted her triumph was beyond even her own dreams. 'It seems super surreal,' the now-six-time Grand Slam champion admitted. 'Honestly, I didn't even dream of winning Wimbledon because it was way too far.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With one hand already on the trophy, nearly three hours into one of the biggest matches of his career, Jannik Sinner's worst humiliation may well have played on his mind. It had only been five weeks since the Italian had squandered three championship points for the French Open title, before losing in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz. During Sunday's Wimbledon final, Sinner had once again used his measured, yet destructive, game to find the decisive breakthrough for a 2-1 sets lead and was up a break in the fourth. This is what made the French Open final such an oddity. And on Sunday, it would be confirmed that what happened in Paris was no more than that. Sinner would find his best serving form when needed, quell Alcaraz's late charge this time around, and round out a deserved 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory to win his first Wimbledon title and fourth Major trophy: his first away from hard courts. He handed Alcaraz his first defeat in a Major final. ‚ÄúIt's mostly emotional, because I had a very tough loss in Paris,‚Äù Sinner said on court after victory. ‚ÄúBut at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how you win or how you lose at important tournaments, you just have to understand what you did wrong and try to work on that, and that's exactly what we did. We tried to accept the loss and just kept working. The match did not have the same epic feel of their clash in Paris last month. Instead, it was a slow-burner ‚Äì perhaps even a tad boring compared to some of the other resounding encounters this duo has already produced ‚Äì in which Sinner was decidedly better in the baseline exchanges, constantly keeping Alcaraz uncomfortable when they went toe-to-toe, groundstroke for groundstroke. Key to that success is his charismatic spark; he is able to produce scintillating tennis at important moments, his very best tennis is better than anyone around at the moment. Cold-blooded and merciless, the latter took advantage of an off-colour Alcaraz, relentlessly pulverising the ball from the baseline, returning his sloppy serves with vindictiveness, and himself keeping a level head through it all. Alcaraz would fall prey to the same metronomic consistency that proved to be too much for seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in their semifinal a couple of days prior. His first-serve success rate fell to 44 percent in the third and fourth sets. His deftness at the net and usually fine touch betrayed him. Instead, it was Sinner who took all the initiative. He approached the net double the number of times that Alcaraz did throughout this match and had a higher success rate. He found sting behind his backhand, especially when he took it down the line while returning second serves. And even as the familiar fears began creeping in at the back end of the fourth set, Sinner's best came out, and vindication was achieved. Not many players would have backed up their worst humiliation with their career's biggest triumph in such emphatic fashion against the same opponent in just over a month. For such a no-frills player, no wonder the Italian was so emotional at the end.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Broadcaster's coverage was solid but unspectacular, with lead commentator Andrew Castle becoming the figure who viewers love to hate Since Sue Barker was, incorrectly, moved on, Clare Balding has been the lead presenter, supported by Isa Guha, and the pundit roster of John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Pat Cash, Tracy Austin, Tim Henman and Annabel Croft is a line-up that is firmly settled indeed, and bordering on stuck in the mud. Andrew Castle didn't have a great tournament and has taken on the unfortunate status of the commentator that many watchers say they love to hate, and that can be a difficult position from which to escape, particularly if there's an A+ alternative like Andrew Cotter warming the bench. This column bows to nobody in its admiration of Dame Elaine Paige, whose dominance of elite musical theatre in the early eighties saw her put together a sustained run of excellence with Evita-Cats-Chess-Sunset Boulevard, the likes of which we may never see again. But she was, unsurprisingly, not a figure of interest for Agassi. On and on Castle went, past the woman who had a top-10 hit with the haunting Memory from Cats, past Benedict Cumberbatch and Sachin Tendulkar, eventually offering up for Andre's consideration the wretched personage of Sir Nick Clegg, at whose mention the Las Vegas native had finally had enough. Castle: ‚ÄúThat was Nick Clegg, our former deputy prime minister.‚Äù For the final itself, McEnroe had his US commentary duties, so it was Henman and Castle with Todd Woodbridge. Henman and Woodbridge are perfectly acceptable co-commentators but not going to race the pulse. One wonders if Castle has been instructed to give a ‚Äúthis is a national occasion not just a sports match‚Äù general interest feel to the commentary because there was again a lot of stuff about the celebs on show, the vibe around Wimbledon and all that. With such an exciting match-up, you'd have hoped the sport could speak for itself. Another tennis star who has given the BBC coverage something different in recent years is Nick Kyrgios, but he had not been hired by the Beeb this time and instead had been snapped up by TNT Sports, which showed both finals live. A nice idea, and fortunately not a clone of the Jeff Stelling Soccer Saturday format where you don't get to see the action but instead have it erratically relayed to you by Paul Merson. In fact, the pictures of the Centre Court action were as on the BBC, with commentary from Alastair Eykyn but, innovatively, a studio panel of Dan Evans, Kyrgios and CoCo Vandeweghe chipping in with observations. Some were very illuminating, such as Evans explaining about how Alcaraz was varying where he stood to receive the second serve. Some were enjoyably revealing, such as Kyrgios saying: ‚ÄúWhen I used the underarm serve it is disrespectful to the game but when anyone else does it they are a genius‚Äù. The BBC's coverage, by contrast, is due a refresh.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrey Rublev is the top seed alongside many other fantastic players. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate. He will be looking to do that against Juan Pablo Ficovich, who is higher ranked but has never won a tour-level match on hard courts. Ficovich plays most of his tennis on clay and will find it hard to adapt quickly against a good striker like Kachmazov. It has been a forgettable season for the former World No. 58 Taro Daniel as he has failed to win a single tour-level match and is currently ranked outside the Top 150. He is a good player on hard courts and can go on a run here if he can find his best tennis. He will face the local wild card, Alex Hernandez, who has just one tour-level win to his name. This should be a close encounter between Aleksandar Vukic and Emilio Nava. Nava, on the other hand, has one Tour-level win this season but has won a lot of matches at the Challenger level and will like his chances in this one. Nava's aggressive style may test Vukic's consistency on the fast Los Cabos hard courts. If Vukic doesn't serve at a high rate, he will most likely lose this one. Aleksandar Kovacevic has reached the Los Cabos Open quarterfinals in both his appearances and will look to advance further this time. He is the highest seed playing on Day 1 and has played some good tennis on this surface this season. Hady Habib's aggressive style could pose a threat, but he hasn't been winning a lot of matches recently. He laid eyes on tennis when he was 10, and it all began with watching the legendary Rafael Nadal dominate the courts. Since then he has been hooked and spends countless hours watching tennis. Ateet loves to write about things he like and tennis is right at the top on that list.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) ‚Äî Jannik Sinner's Wimbledon title might mean he'll be able to keep Darren Cahill around as one of his coaches beyond this season ‚Äî by winning the friendly wager they made before Sunday's final at the All England Club. Back in January, while Sinner was on his way to winning the Australian Open, it came out that Cahill would be leaving his role as one of the No. ‚ÄúI don't want to answer this,‚Äù Cahill responded. You just need to ask Jannik that.‚Äù So an Italian reporter followed those instructions and did put the topic to Sinner, who smiled and paused. ‚ÄúIt depends,‚Äù Sinner began, ‚ÄúWhether I want to tell the truth or not.‚Äù And then he proceeded to explain the whole situation in Italian, revealing that maybe Cahill's exit is not set in stone, after all. That's because the two of them had a conversation on Saturday night. I've always looked for a person who is honest, a person who gives me a lot, not necessarily only on the tennis court, but (about) how to live.‚Äù Sinner also did acknowledge that if Cahill did continue to work alongside co-coach Simone Vagnozzi, Cahill probably would not travel on tour as much as he does currently. ‚ÄúBut let's just say I won the bet, and so we'll see what happens.‚Äù Howard Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.</p>

This time, starting with that seemingly innocuous missed forehand by Alcaraz, he was the one who lifted his game to a higher level, and kept it there.In the second set, Sinner was the one who closed with a flurry of brilliance that might best be described as Alcarazian. All three times, Alcaraz hit a shot that normally would have won him the point, only to see Sinner take it away from him.In the third set, Sinner was the one who came up with a clutch response at a pressure-packed moment. Serving at 3-4, he watched as Alcaraz hit a perfect drop shot and followed it with a winning lob to reach 30-30. But he quieted those noises right away, with a hooking second serve that landed on the sideline and curled away from Alcaraz for an ace.In the fourth set, Sinner was the one who broke early and‚Äîunlike at Roland Garros last month‚Äînever gave the lead back. He saved two break points at 4-3, and didn't show a hint of nerves serving it out at 5-4.

I think you saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments and a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, that he kept on closing the door against Carlos.‚ÄùAs for Sinner himself, he couldn't have dreamed of a better way to put the ghosts of Roland Garros behind him.‚ÄúI'm very happy with how I handled every situation on the court today,‚Äù Sinner said. It takes so much to win against him. He attacked whenever possible and hit more winners‚Äî40 to 38. By the fourth, Alcaraz, for one of the few times in his career, looked resigned to his fate‚ÄúAt some points I didn't know what I had to do in the match because from the baseline I was feeling he was better than me, and I couldn't do anything about it,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúI think the big key was the second serve.

We knew that Sinner was an all-time great hitter of a tennis ball. We knew, after he came back from two sets down to win his first Grand Slam final in Australia last year, that he was a clutch performer. But this win, coming so soon after his crushing defeat in Paris, and against the same opponent, was proof of a deeper emotional resilience. A champion's resilience.‚ÄúI think is the part where I'm the proudest, because it really has not been easy,‚Äù Sinner said. That's why I said after Roland Garros that it's not the time to put me down, no, because another Grand Slam is coming up, and I did great here.‚ÄùSinner-Alcaraz at Wimbledon was not a classic follow-up to their Roland Garros final. But it was an important step in their story. Paris made them famous as a duo; Wimbledon made them true rivals again.Even today's loser could appreciate that.‚ÄúI'm just really, really happy about having this rivalry with him,‚Äù Alcaraz said.
