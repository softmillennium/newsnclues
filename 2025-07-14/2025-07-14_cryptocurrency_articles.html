Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) surged to a fresh all-time high of $123,231 on Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) on Monday morning, capping off a historic week that saw digital asset investment products record $3.7 billion in inflows. This was the second-largest weekly total ever, according to CoinShares data, with the rally pushing total assets under management (AuM) for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) to a record $211 billion. It also marked the 13th consecutive week of inflows, bringing year-to-date figures to $22.7 billion and underscoring growing investor appetite despite volatile macroeconomic conditions.

BTC slipped below $120,000 late in the U.S. day, shedding most of its overnight advance, but holding on to a modest 0.6% gain over the past 24 hours.

Looking at the big picture, bitcoin is being propelled higher by excessive sovereign debt and investors seeking refuge from monetary inflation, said Eric Demuth, CEO of Europe-based crypto exchange Bitpanda.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US House of Representatives is scheduled to consider amendments to three crypto-related bills this week addressing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), digital asset market structure and payment stablecoins. Discussions of the three bills included several amendments submitted by Democratic lawmakers to address what they called crypto “corruption” in the US government. “This week, the House will consider several crypto bills, including the so-called CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act, which proponents claim will establish a pro-innovation regulatory framework for crypto that also safeguards consumers and investors,” Waters said in a Monday MSNBC op-ed. Related: ‘Crypto Week' approaches: Will these three pro-crypto bills pass? Among Waters' submitted amendments to the GENIUS Act was a provision to block any US president, vice president, members of Congress and their immediate families from promoting or holding crypto. She also proposed that the US Treasury Secretary “cannot deem a foreign country to have a stablecoin regime comparable to that of the US if the current leader of that country has described themselves as a dictator” — possibly a reference to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who called himself the “world's coolest dictator.” According to the congressional calendar, the House will have only eight days in session in July before going on recess. “I believe the bills we will have on the floor this week will protect investors, consumers, and make America as President Trump wants, a leader in financial technology and crypto and digital assets innovation,” said Arkansas Representative French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee. Stand With Crypto, an advocacy organization tied to Coinbase, called for action on the CLARITY Act.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto ETF Investors Want 'Ethereum Over Bitcoin' Amid Surging Demand: CoinShares Funds offering exposure to Ethereum have been growing at a faster rate than Bitcoin counterparts, underscoring newfound demand for the asset, according to CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill. Over the past 12 weeks, Ethereum-linked funds' assets under management have grown 19.5% to $19.6 billion, he wrote in a report on Monday. “Although the number is lower [for Ethereum] than Bitcoin, proportionally, it's much more significant.” Bitcoin had a blockbuster debut on Wall Street last year through exchanged-traded funds that now manage more than $148 billion in assets, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. As chair of Ethereum treasury firm BitMine, however, Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee is among the new faces pitching Ethereum as an investment. Butterfill described it as “record-breaking momentum,” representing the second best week for crypto funds, overall, on record. Its price has risen 10% to 168% over the past week. Although XRP's price has jumped over 31% to $3 in the past week, representing a fresh, seven-year high, investors pulled $104 million from funds for the Ripple-linked asset. Butterfill highlighted the WisdomTree Physical XRP exchange-traded note, which had  $115 million in outflows last week. Because the activity was limited to one fund, he suggested that it's not a trend or “something particularly ominous.” Still, crypto asset manager 3iQ Digital touted the adoption of its XRP-linked ETF in Canada on Monday. The firm's XRP ETF, which debuted less than a month ago, has so far taken in $50 million worth of assets, a "significant milestone,” President and CEO Pascal St-Jean said on X.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On July 7, 2025, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (the “ICO”) announced it had launched two new consultations: (1) a consultation on its approach to enforcement of the regulation 6 consent requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (“PECR”); and (2) a consultation on a new chapter within its draft guidance on storage and access technologies (the “Cookie Guidance”). The ICO believes that a new approach may “create opportunities to unlock business growth through innovation” and “enable commercially viable ways to deliver online advertising.”  The ICO notes that any such methods must still be performed in accordance with data protection and privacy principles, and be methods that individuals would likely consider “acceptable” without consent. The ICO confirmed that the review will not impact the enforcement of compliance requirements and practices under the UK General Data Protection Regulation, clarifying that there will be certain circumstances where online advertising will always require consent, such as where extensive profiling across different services is involved. The chapter reflect changes to PECR introduced by the DUAA, such as the ability to use certain non-essential cookies without consent for specific low-risk functions, such as statistical analysis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(LILAMAX)- Congress is on the verge of reshaping American finance as lawmakers prepare to tackle three major cryptocurrency bills during what's being called “Crypto Week.” The legislation will address stablecoins, the development of a government-backed digital currency, and new rules for crypto trading—marking a pivotal moment in the country's approach to digital assets. Meanwhile, the tech world is racing ahead with innovations that feel both retro and futuristic. “Call of Duty's” latest crossover brings back '90s icons Beavis and Butt-Head, but the real breakthrough is holographic gameplay. Deep tech company VividQ has unveiled display technology that projects real 3D visuals, allowing gamers to stay immersed in holographic environments for extended periods. Artificial intelligence is also rapidly changing the business landscape. A new report from data firm Tredence predicts that by 2028, one-third of AI agents will make 15% of business decisions without any human input. The rise of “agentic AI” could flatten corporate hierarchies, empowering small teams with big responsibilities, while leadership shifts from giving orders to orchestrating intelligent, self-correcting systems.

The Company closed on its initial private placement of $250 million on July 9th in furtherance of its asset light treasury strategy. "Since closing on the $250 million private placement, we have surpassed $500 million in Ethereum holdings, which validates our mission to increase our stake in the Ethereum network," said Thomas "Tom" Lee of Fundstrat, the newly appointed Chairman of BitMine's Board of Directors. "Since closing on the $250 million private placement, we have surpassed $500 million in Ethereum holdings, which validates our mission to increase our stake in the Ethereum network," said Thomas "Tom" Lee of Fundstrat, the newly appointed Chairman of BitMine's Board of Directors. "We are pleased that we added significantly to our ETH treasury just 3 days after closing our private placement," said Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine. Thomas Lee further states: "Among Bitcoin treasury companies, we have witnessed the reflexive benefit of acquiring large holdings. Microstrategy (NASDAQ-MSTR), the leader, has accumulated more than 597,000 Bitcoin (per Microstrategy.com website). Such sizable holdings has created a 'sovereign put' for the company, meaning a nation-state views MSTR holdings as attractive if a nation ever wanted to acquire 5% of the Bitcoin network. And even Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, recently said 'tokenization is the greatest capital markets innovation since the central limit order book' showing how Wall Street is converging onto crypto.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three high-profile pieces of digital assets legislation are in line to be discussed by the House of Representatives during what US lawmakers have dubbed ‘Crypto Week' in Washington DC – kicking off today (14 July) – with developments set to be closely watched globally. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (Clarity Act) aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets and cryptocurrencies; the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) aims to create the first federal comprehensive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act aims to block the issuance of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) – a digital dollar. President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled ‘Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology' three days into his second term as president. As part of an ambition to make the US the ‘crypto capital of the world' – an unlikely scenario to have foreseen during his first presidency, when he was anti-crypto – he has since undertaken numerous ‘pro-crypto' actions, including hosting a ‘Digital Assets Summit' (also referred to as ‘Crypto Summit') at the White House. STABLECOINS: EXPLAINED Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by having their market value pegged to an external reference, typically fiat currency. The world's two biggest stablecoins (by market capitalisation) are Tether and USD Coin – both are, like most stablecoins, pegged to the US dollar. “After years of dedicated work in Congress on digital assets, we are advancing landmark legislation to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets that safeguards consumers and investors, provides rules for the issuance and operation of dollar-backed payment stablecoins, and permanently blocks the creation of a CBDC to safeguard Americans' financial privacy.” “I thank my colleagues in Congress and the Trump Administration for their partnership and leadership and stand ready to work alongside the Senate [upper house] as they work to advance standalone market structure legislation by the end of September,” he added. “Digital asset market structure legislation is long overdue,” said Thompson. I thank House leadership for recognising the urgent need for Clarity to cement American leadership in the digital asset space.” “For the first time in US history, we have a president who sees the value in embracing digital assets, and already we are working to capitalise on that,” Lummis said.“In Wyoming, we have worked for nearly a decade to embrace digital assets, and it is exciting to see the federal government beginning to follow in the Cowboy State's footsteps. As we celebrate Crypto Week, I am thrilled to partner with chairman Hill and chairman Thompson to pass comprehensive stablecoin legislation, establish clear market structure rules, and ensure that any central bank digital currency respects Americans' privacy and financial freedom. No way…': US government's digital finance focus hailed at London event – a news story (2 May 2025) based on views of different jurisdictions digital assets-related policymaking – see below The trajectory and momentum of US policymaking in favour of cryptocurrencies and tokenised finance under Trump's presidency is being closely followed across the world. “On this particular topic [digital assets], there is nothing chaotic about what the US administration is doing, right from the White House through to all the different agencies and through the chairs of the relevant committees in Congress – there's a real determination to move forward and to do something really cutting edge with regard to cryptoassets and tokenisation.” Lord Ed Vaizey, speaking on a later panel, was asked whether the US administration's pro-crypto actions would have a knock-on effect in other nations, particularly the UK. “We can all speculate as to why there has been a volte-face [reference to Trump's previous stance] but I think the administration has got itself into the right place, in theory – we'll see what happens in practice – which is that crypto needs to be regulated.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin traded above $120,000 to set a new record high on Monday as U.S. lawmakers gear up to potentially pass regulatory changes that could bolster institutional demand. ET, according to data from Coin Metrics. On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs had logged their biggest day of inflows in 2025 at $1.18 billion. "We believe that Bitcoin's surge is driven by longer-term institutional buyers and this will propel it to $125k in the next month or two," Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency exchange BTSE, said in a statement sent to CNBC. "Trump's trade disputes with the likes of the EU, Mexico, and other trading partners could cause dips in the week ahead, but it's likely that Bitcoin's institutional buyers are discounting this risk and maintaining their positions that Bitcoin will still appreciate in the long run," he added. Investors have been anticipating bitcoin to hit fresh records this year as corporate treasuries accelerate their bitcoin buying sprees and the U.S. Congress nears the passing of new crypto legislation. The U.S. House of Representatives will begin deliberations on a series of crypto bills on Monday in what has been dubbed "Crypto Week." The potential laws are aimed at providing a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. The policy had been long sought by the industry, and is supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has branded himself as a pro-crypto president and is involved in several crypto ventures. One of the most significant bills under consideration is the Genius Act, which could establish federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and create a pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. "Long-term holders are locking up supply, while global policy clarity — especially around stablecoins and crypto legislation — has boosted investor confidence and capital inflows," Xu Han, director of the Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital, said in a statement to CNBC. Speaking on CNBC's "Access Middle East," Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, noted that corporate and institutional investors have purchased $15 billion in bitcoin ETFs over the last six to eight weeks. In contrast, retail investors appear to have been on the sidelines during the latest rally, he added. 10x Research has a year-end bitcoin target range of $140,000 to $160,000, Thielen revealed, but the most significant risk facing this remains the U.S. Federal Reserve continuing its hawkish policy and further interest rate hikes due to tariffs.
