      Date and time are approximate as this was captured on an old phone with unsynced time/date. Date is more accurate +/- 1 day at most.
    


      If you aren't indoors in a dark room and/or interested in technical videos, I recommend not investing the 44 seconds into watching this video.
    


      Basically all of the action occurs from 00:35 - 00:40 in this video. If you slowly scrub through that portion, I propose you will see two UFOs. One UFO remains stationary, providing a point of reference, while the other UFO accelerates upward.
    


      After 00:40 the point of reference is lost, but my memory is that it continued accelerating up (as depicted in the video).
    


      Also, regarding psi phenomena, I had the subjective experience of having my arm telekinetically assisted and directed to better capture these UFOs, while recording. It was highly consensual telekinetic assistance, as that was my objective, to record them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jared Padalecki is opening up about the mental health struggles he's faced during his decades as an actor — and how fans have accepted his willingness to share. Earlier this year, Padalecki, 42, was joined by several of his Supernatural castmates at MegaCon Orlando, when the conversation turned to the show's 20th anniversary (it debuted in September 2005). "There's been a lot that like, this sucks, and I don't wanna wake up and I don't wanna leave the house, I don't wanna get out of bed and I don't wanna go be with that person." He continued, "But in hindsight, I just feel so grateful [for the fans] because I was very public about some of the s--- I was going through that I've been kind of not secret about but haven't shared yet and I was met with such love and acceptance that it meant a lot to me." Padalecki went on to say how "grateful" he was to Supernatural's fan base, adding that he's enjoyed watching people get interested in the show in the years since it ended in 2020. In 2024, the actor revealed that he checked into a clinic in 2015 — during the run of Supernatural —while struggling with suicidal ideation. “It was 2015, I had a really low moment,” he said on an episode of Tommy DiDario's I've Never Said This Before podcast, alongside wife Genevieve Padalecki. “I was letting my thoughts take over and going to places of dramatic suicidal ideation. I called my wife and she said, ‘Get home. You go to an audition or on a red carpet and they don't want, ‘Jared, how are you doing today?' ‘Oh today was rough, I didn't sleep.' So I had done that for so long, trying to focus on what's best for the person who's talking to me as opposed to just being honest," he continued.

The infamous haunted doll, Annabelle, made a tour stop in Gettysburg over the weekend.

Known for her creepy presence and eerie backstory, Annabelle has captivated horror fans and paranormal enthusiasts across the country and around the world. 

The doll was put on display as part of the "Devils on the Run Tour" on July 11 at the Soldier's Orphanage Homestead, a historic building that served as a field hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg.

WGAL was able to get an up-close look at the doll. You can see that video above. 

A sign posted beneath the doll said:



"Annabelle

"This Raggedy Ann doll was believed to be possessed by a young girl named Annabelle. After the owner experienced more sinister and dangerous activity, Ed Warren determined that the doll was possessed by the demonic. The doll was soon turned over to the Warrens for safekeeping and placed in the Warren's Occult Museum. Annabelle is responsible for scratching one of its victims with seven psychic scratches, and several motor vehicle accidents including the death of a motorcyclist who taunted Annabelle shortly before the crash."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A firsthand journey into Columbia's haunted history—where ghost stories, unsolved mysteries, and Southern gothic legacies come to life after dark. Welcome to Rumor Has It, a series investigating some of the most compelling lore and legend across the U.S. These articles invite readers to dig deeper, ask questions, and be curious. There's something about this Southern capital after dark that chilled me. It doesn't try to be spooky. I love a good walking tour, especially after the sun sets and the real stories come to light. I stumbled upon a company called US Ghost Adventures and decided to sign myself up. While I had an idea of what to expect on this nighttime adventure (hello, local folklore and legends! ), I was unprepared for just how much I would learn about Soda City's past, including one of the most infamous murders the South has ever seen in broad daylight. There's something about this Southern capital after dark that chilled me. It doesn't try to be spooky. Quiet, very humid, and a little too still, this was the perfect stage for US Ghost Adventures' walking tour, which promises a walk through Columbia's haunted heart without veering into the campy. We began at the Trinity Episcopal Cathedral graveyard, where quite a few notable families and politicians are buried. Our tour guide, Hayden, was dressed in old timey clothes, complete with a vest, dress shoes, a wide brimmed hat, and of course, a lantern. As we wandered through the cemetery, Hayden pointed out, the cemetery walls were different than most. Columbia has been burned to the ground, rebuilt, divided, and reimagined, but some things still cling to its streets. Hayden got up on a cement planter and asked, "Can any of you find the only cemetery plot still remaining within this courtyard?" While nobody could accurately pinpoint, he pointed to a stone grave just outside of a campus building door. "Seems pretty strange to still have someone buried right in a courtyard of college campus, no?" At one point in the evening, as Hayden's shoes clacked along the sidewalk, he turned to us and said, "now let's go find the spot where the most gruesome murder in Columbia took place." In 1903, journalist Narciso Gonzales, co-founder of The State newspaper, was shot in broad daylight on Main Street in Columbia, South Carolina, by Lieutenant Governor James H. Tillman. Gonzales had publicly criticized Tillman in scathing editorials, calling him unfit for office. Despite Gonzales being unarmed, Tillman claimed self-defense and was shockingly acquitted. The killing, just steps from the State House, exposed deep political corruption and remains one of South Carolina's most infamous injustices. Gonzales is remembered as a fearless voice for truth—murdered for holding the powerful accountable in a city still haunted by its past. History wasn't just something you read in plaques, it pulsed, quietly, around us, in the spots on the capitol building's walls where canon shots were marked with stars, or in the hidden gravestone our tour guide brought us too right on a main thoroughfare. There's no jump scares or hokey theatrics here. Just a slow, steady immersion into the parts of Columbia that don't make it into travel brochures. By the time we circled back to our starting point, I didn't need to be convinced that Columbia was haunted. You don't need to believe in spirits to feel them brushing against your shoulder here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The discovery of interstellar objects over the past decade raises an important question that could shape the future of humanity: how to distinguish extraterrestrial spacecraft from interstellar asteroids? However, no telescope on Earth can resolve a hundred-meter object — the scale of our largest rocket — Starship, from a distance of about a billion kilometers — the distance where 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Unfortunately, we cannot rely on sky watchers to alert us to the possibility that a spacecraft just entered the solar system. Even after the first reported interstellar object, 1I/`Oumuamua, showed the anomalies of a flat shape and a non-gravitational acceleration without a cometary tail that distinguished it from any known asteroid or comet, it was nevertheless labeled as a “dark comet”, namely a comet without the unique signature that would flag it as a comet: a visible plume of gas and dust. Given this definition, any object launched by humans to space — which is pushed by rocket fuel or solar radiation pressure, is a dark comet. The best we can hope for is courageous astronomers that would admit anomalies exhibited by outliers, namely features that may fit better the description of a technologically manufactured object than a natural rock. This object is anomalously bright, implying a diameter of ~20 kilometers for the typical reflectance of asteroids. The implied diameter and detection rate are untenable by the mass budget in interstellar asteroids, as I showed in a new paper — just published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society. If 3I/ATLAS ends up being a comet, its nucleus must be an order of magnitude smaller. But if it happens not to possess a large cometary plume of dust or gas, what is the nature of this object? Without asking this question, humanity will remain in the “stone age,” regarding interstellar objects. Even if 3I/ATLAS will show up as a genuine comet, like 2I/Borisov, as it gets closer to the Sun and heats up, we should always ask this question about future interstellar objects. An interstellar comet is easy to identify by its tail. But what are the markers that would distinguish a technological interstellar object — a spacecraft, from an asteroid? Propulsion: a central engine or solar radiation pressure (as I suggested in a paper with Shmuel Bialy for 1I/'Oumuamua) would cause a technological object to deviate from a Keplerian hyperbolic orbit, dictated solely by gravity. The likelihood for these orbital angular momenta to be aligned so well is ~0.001, as I had mentioned in my recent anomalies essay. Artificial lights: Reflection of sunlight can be distinguished from artificial light by its spectrum and through its faster decline with increasing distance from the Sun, as I discussed in a paper with Ed Turner. Shape: An artificially-designed shape can be inferred from the light curve of reflected sunlight as the object rotates. This is how 1I/'Oumuamua was inferred in a paper by Sergei Mashchenko to have a disk-like shape. Such an image can be taken by a camera on a dedicated intercept mission or in case the object happens to be passing very close to Earth. Landing on a technological object through a rendezvous mission like OSIRIS-REx would offer the benefit of a direct inspection, including the privilege of pressing buttons on it. Surface composition: remote spectroscopy of the surface might show signatures of bombardment by cosmic-rays, interstellar dust particles and interstellar protons. The energy deposition rate scales as velocity cubed and travel duration. Faster or older objects should be more scarred by interstellar damage. Signals: A functioning technological device might transmit electromagnetic signs that terrestrial telescopes could search for over a broad range of frequencies from the radio to gamma-rays. Launch of mini-probes from a mothership: An efficient way to seed habitable planets with probes is to pass near them and release small devices at the right time and place with the appropriate velocity kick, so that they will intercept the planets while the mothership continues on its journey to the next star. Over the next decade, the Rubin observatory is expected to find tens of new interstellar objects. We should study the Rubin data with an open mind to the possibility that it may discover technological objects from extraterrestrial civilizations. If we insist that all interstellar objects are asteroids and comets with the outliers catalogued as dark comets, then the answer to the question “Are we alone?” would be “Yes, by choice.” Some of the loneliest people in the world are those who stopped searching for a partner. In order to find our cosmic partners, we must allow them to exist in our mind as we inspect the Rubin data. Surely, interstellar objects were passing overhead in the sky in 1950 when Enrico Fermi asked: “where is everybody?” As an experimental physicist, his oversight was not to build a large telescope to search for them. The paperback edition of his new book, titled “Interstellar”, was published in August 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The conspiracy-soaked culture that propelled President Donald Trump to political power is now coming for him. Some of the most influential voices in right-wing media are rejecting Trump's call to stop wasting “time and energy on Jeffrey Epstein.” Trump said “nobody cares about” the late convicted sex offender, but the incensed replies to his Truth Social post showed otherwise. The online outrage highlights a vulnerability for Trump and an unfortunate reality about the incentive structure of this social media era. In short, it's that conspiracy theories keep people watching, sharing and playing along, even about a topic as lurid as sex trafficking. So it makes sense that many people are insisting on further disclosures about Epstein and his connections to powerful people. Algorithms don't necessarily want answers; they want engagement, and asking questions about an alleged government coverup definitely stokes engagement. “It's very clear the algorithm wants some Epstein answers every bit as much as many of us do,” he wrote on X. Epstein's last name has become shorthand for a much bigger conspiracy theory. His crimes, and his 2019 suicide while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges, are just a piece of an imagined plot to abuse children at an industrial scale. “The Epstein story mattered so much in MAGA circles because it was a key element in their indictment of America's so-called ruling class,” New York Times opinion columnist David French wrote Monday. That is why last week's joint memo from the FBI and Justice Department denying the existence of an Epstein “list” and discouraging “unfounded” speculation was so disturbing to pro-Trump influencers. Attorney General Pam Bondi handed out binders to social media influencers in February misleadingly labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1.” Most of the records were already public, and evidently there will be no “Phase 2.” It's a stunning turn of events since conspiracy-theorizing has historically helped Trump enormously. The movement, which has been likened to a virtual cult, imagined that Trump was secretly fighting a cabal of Democrat child abusers. Epstein-related theories are an extension of that conspiratorial worldview, just as QAnon picked up where “Pizzagate” left off. He discovered that the restaurant didn't even have a basement.) Epstein is a complicated matter for Trump since the two men were described as friends decades ago. Trump is now increasingly the target of his base's conspiratorial thinking — the same position he put Barack Obama in by baselessly questioning Obama's birthplace more than a decade ago. Mike Davis, a former legal adviser to Trump with close ties to the administration, wrote on X that the sex-ring evidence many right-wing media stars have demanded to see simply does not exist. There are not tapes with powerful men raping kids. Related article Epstein fallout poses a loyalty test: Trump — or MAGA? Researchers like to point out that conspiracy theories are self-sealing, meaning they're impervious to scrutiny because evidence that contradicts the theory can be turned around and viewed as part of the conspiracy itself. The irate reactions to FBI director Kash Patel's tweet on Saturday — “the conspiracy theories just aren't true, never have been” — reaffirmed this. In 2023, when Patel was a frequent guest on pro-Trump podcasts, he told Glenn Beck that the FBI had possession of Epstein's “black book.” Such conjecture about a supposed Epstein “client list” lit up MAGA chat rooms and forums for years. Online guessing games about “the list” were an endless source of MAGA media content. Some Fox News hosts and Trump family members played along. “I keep hearing about some of the Jeffrey Epstein clients names being released today,” Donald Trump Jr. wrote on X in January 2024, “but I'd be willing to bet that something happens between now and then that prevents those names from ever coming out.” Some commentators have portrayed it as a profound betrayal. Writing on X, podcast host Matt Walsh cast Epstein as a symbol of how “the corrupt and the powerful are never held accountable.” We want the innocent to be vindicated and defended. Related video MAGA faithful weigh in on Epstein files debate Mike Cernovich, one of the social media personalities who received an “Epstein Files” binder back in February, wrote that “Trump's persuasive power over his base, especially during his first term, was almost magical… The reaction on Epstein should thus be startling to him. Perhaps some people have been so hooked on the speculation that they don't want answers at all. Salacious QAnon-style theories about powerful people preying on kids are an “addictive alternative reality” for participants, disinformation researcher Molly McKew told CNN in 2020. “It exploits the sense that something is broken in our society,” McKew said. “But rather than focus on understanding these social fractures and healing them, QAnon instead fixates on the pursuit of enemies and villains described in such extreme terms that any action — either by adherents or by identified champions like President Trump — becomes justifiable.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Your memo and release yesterday on Jeffrey Epstein, it left some lingering mysteries,” the reporter noted. Before Bondi could respond, Donald Trump interjected — and tried his best to shut down the entire line of inquiry. He went on to suggest that the reporter was wasting time with his question, given that there were more important things to talk about. In a statement published to his social media platform, spanning nearly 400 words, Trump praised his attorney general, and unironically described his administration as “PERFECT,” before complaining that he didn't “like what's happening” in MAGA World with regard to Epstein. In fact, he seemed to criticize some of his own followers, admonishing them as “selfish people” for their focus on Epstein, adding that “nobody cares about” Epstein, despite all evidence to the contrary. Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration. While referencing a variety of other conspiracy theories, the president went on to complain about “the same old, Radical Left inspired Documents on Jeffrey Epstein.” Or put another way, Trump, an ardent conspiracy theorist, has come up with a new conspiracy theory about the underlying conspiracy theory, which is a bit like watching a snake eat its own tail. It was during Trump's first term when Epstein, facing sex trafficking and conspiracy charges, died in 2019 while in custody, and a medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. But according to Trump, the so-called Epstein files were written by Barack Obama (who left office in early 2017), Hillary Clinton (who left office in early 2013), former FBI Director James Comey (who left office in 2017) and former CIA Director John Brennan (who left office in early 2017). How could they have “created the Epstein Files” given that they were nowhere near public office when Trump's own team tried to prosecute him? I haven't the foggiest idea, and Trump's weird tantrum never explained how this could even be possible. Complicating matters, the president appeared to reinvigorate the story he wants to go away, but changing his administration's official line. What started with (1) the “Epstein Files” are real and important, transformed into (2) the “Epstein Files” don't actually exist so everyone should just move on, has now evolved into (3) the “Epstein Files” do exist, but they're fake. If the White House was counting on this new line shutting down the chatter and speculation, it should probably lower its expectations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Right now, radar systems utilized by civilian airports and military operations are unintentionally broadcasting our existence to potential advanced alien civilizations, according to new research. According to the Royal Astronomical Society, theoretically, it also suggests this is the distance we could detect if aliens have evolved to use comparable technology. The findings, presented at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting 2025 in Durham, reveal how global aviation hubs like Heathrow, Gatwick, and New York's JFK International Airport emit signals indicative of our existence. By meticulously simulating how these radar signals radiate from Earth over time and space, researchers were able to assess their visibility from nearby stars such as Barnard's Star and AU Microscopii. The study showed that airport radar systems could be giving us away to faraway civilisations. These systems, which scan the skies for airplanes, emit a combined radio signal of 2 × 10^15 watts, which is strong enough to be detected as far as 200 light-years away by telescopes equivalent to the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. To provide some perspective, the closest potentially habitable world beyond our solar system is Proxima Centauri b, located 4 light-years away. Even so, reaching it with current spacecraft technology would take thousands of years. Lead researcher Ramiro Caisse Saide from the University of Manchester pointed out that these would appear "clearly artificial to anyone watching from interstellar distances with powerful radio telescopes". "These military signals can appear up to a hundred times stronger from certain points in space, depending on where an observer is located," he said. "Our findings suggest that radar signals – produced unintentionally by any planet with advanced technology and a complex aviation system – could act as a universal sign of intelligent life." "By learning how our signals travel through space, we gain valuable insights into how to protect the radio spectrum for communications and design future radar systems," Professor Michael Garrett of the University of Manchester elaborated, highlighting the dual benefits of their work.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joao Felix was absent from Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph after being axed by Enzo Maresca, but at least the Portuguese star had something else to watch. The 25-year-old has been ostracised at Stamford Bridge since returning to West London for a second spell, this time permanently, in 2024 in a deal worth around £46million. But it's been a disaster for him since making his comeback to the Premier League. After playing 20 times for the Blues in the first half of the season, with just three of them Premier League starts, he was loaned out to AC Milan, again to limited success as he managed just four goal involvements in 21 appearances. Felix looks set to be on his way out of Stamford Bridge again after he was left out of the Blues' victorious Club World Cup squad. However, Felix was probably watching a viral video with his rumoured stunning Colombian model other half Valentina Rueda Velez. Valentina earned fame and fortune in her homeland when she appeared on Netflix 's dating show Too Hot to Handle last year. And one of the reasons for her social media fame, alongside her bikini-clad pictures, is a crystal-clear video she took in 2023 of an apparent UFO sighting. In the clip she shared on her Instagram Story, she is flying at an altitude of 20,000 feet under a bright, blue sky. Well then sign up for the brilliant Daily Star Football email newsletter!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Supernatural debuted in 2005, the plan was never for it to run 15 seasons. It was a tightly plotted arc that gave viewers a satisfying resolution, but also one that almost cut the show off just as it was finding new, unexpected ways to evolve. Had the original Supernatural ending gone ahead and the show concluded with season 5's “Swan Song”, we wouldn't have gotten 10 more years of monster hunts, meta mayhem, and character arcs that pushed Sam and Dean to their limits. If Eric Kripke's five-season plan had gone ahead, it never would've seen the light of day. In “The French Mistake,” Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) are thrown into an alternate reality where they're not monster-hunting brothers - they're actors named Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles filming a show called Supernatural. It proved that Supernatural could take major creative swings and still land them. The show didn't just continue past season 5 - it reinvented itself. “The French Mistake” wouldn't have fit within the original Supernatural ending because its tone and structure were too playful for Kripke's biblical finale. Yet its success helped justify the show's extended run, giving fans a clear reason to keep tuning in. For many fans, it represents everything that made the show special: its ability to be self-aware, hilarious, genre-bending, and emotionally grounded all at once. Even after so many monster-of-the-week stories and apocalyptic arcs, nothing hit quite like this. Misha Collins, in particular, steals the show - especially when he tweets “Ola, Mishamigos!” while chaos erupts around him. It's a surreal, wink-to-the-audience experience that rewards longtime fans without alienating newcomers. “The French Mistake” also functions as a love letter to the production crew, poking fun at real-life showrunners, VFX teams, and network quirks. However, underneath all the in-jokes is a story that still centers Sam and Dean's brotherhood and purpose, grounding the madness in emotional stakes. That balance is hard to pull off, but Supernatural nailed it here. “The French Mistake” proved that Supernatural could take huge risks and still deliver something deeply memorable - a reminder that sometimes the best moments happen after a planned goodbye. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. I watched supernatural from the start and loved it. Many TV characters take time to like, but some grab us instantly with their wit, courage or generosity. Prepare for a game-changing narrative shift in One-Punch Man's latest installment, according to a shocking tease from one of the anime's stars. Supernatural has an awesome soundtrack of classic rock songs, but one, in particular, serves as the perfect theme song for the Winchester brothers. As High Potential season 2 heats up, the series is adding new members to the cast, and it just landed a big name in a recurring guest role. James Gunn's Superman introduces a key DCU location and sets up the debut of multiple superhero teams besides Maxwell Lord's Justice Gang.</p>
